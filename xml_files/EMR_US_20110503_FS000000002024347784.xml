          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 3, 2011.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Lynne Maxeiner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christina. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2011 results; a conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.</p>
          <p>I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. We saw strong second quarter sales that were up 18% to $5.9 billion with increases in all segments. Underlying sales were strong at 14%. Gross profit margin of 39.4%, down 20 basis points in an increasingly challenging material inflation environment.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 16.9%. Earnings per share was $0.73, up 38% compared to $0.53 in the prior year quarter, strong operating cash flow in the quarter of $753 million and free cash flow of $627 million. Our free cash flow to net earnings conversion was 113%. Our balance sheet remains strong and flexible. We have returned 51% of operating cash flow to shareholders in Q2 through dividends and share repurchase. And we have room to increase share repurchase in the second half of fiscal '11. We had a very strong first half of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 3, the P&amp;L, again, sales increased 18% with underlying sales up 14%, acquisitions added 3 points, and currency added a point, operating profit up 30% to $991 million or 16.9% of sales. The increase was driven by volume, leverage and cost reduction benefits, partially offset by higher material costs. Earnings from continuing ops up 36% to $556 million. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $132 million in the quarter, which gets you to an EPS of $0.73, again, very strong growth on all key measures in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 underlying sales by geography. In the second quarter, the U.S. was up 13% and total international was up 15%. Europe was up 17%, Asia up 10%, including growth in China of 9%, Latin America up 26%, Canada up 22% and the Middle East Africa up 13%. Again, total underlying sales up 14%, currency adding one point, and acquisitions adding three points, gets you to the consolidated sales up 18%.</p>
          <p>Slide 5, some income statement detail: Gross profit of $2.306 billion or 39.4% of sales. Higher material costs and unfavorable product mix partially offset by volume leverage, higher prices, and cost reductions. SG&amp;A of 22.5% gets you to operating profit again of $991 million or 16.9% of sales. Other deductions net of $101 million includes lower restructuring of $20 million and gains in Q2 of $19 million, which were offset by increased amortization of $19 million and unfavorable mark-to-market from currency transactions of $20 million. Interest expense of $57 million gets you to pre-tax earnings of $833 million or 14.2% of sales. Taxes of $266 million for a tax rate of 31.8%. We still expect the full-year FY '11 tax rate of approximately 31%</p>
          <p>Next slide, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow $753 million, up 19%, driven primarily from higher earnings. Capital spending of $126 million gets you to the free cash flow of $627 million, an increase of 15%. Trade working capital balances are at the bottom of the slide. We added some strategic inventory during the quarter due to Japanese supply concerns.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the business segment P&amp;L. Business segment EBIT of $934 million or 15.5% of sales, an increase of 20%. Margin expanded 30 basis points driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost reductions, partially offset by material inflation. Increased amortization from acquisitions was offset by lower restructuring. Difference of accounting methods, $56 million, corporate and other of $100 million. We had lower stock compensation expense in the quarter, $33 million, and positive impact from the gains of $19 million, primarily related to the Fisher Sanmar JV buy-out. Interest expense again, $57 million, down $10 million primarily due to lower debt balances gets you to the pre-tax earnings of $833 million.</p>
          <p>Next we'll review the business segments starting with process management. Sales in the quarter up 16% to $1.653 billion, underlying sales were up 14%, and currency added two points. By region, the U.S. was up 13%, Asia was up 13%, Europe up 16%, and Latin America up 20%. We saw broad strength across the measurement Valves and Systems businesses. EBIT of $296 million or 17.9% of sales, up 23%, driven by volume leverage, cost reduction benefits, and lower restructuring, partially offset by the unfavorable mark-to-market impact from foreign currency transactions, which was a negative $20 million impact. Orders remain strong, but are moderating from peak levels as the comparisons are getting tougher.</p>
          <p>Next slide, industrial automation. Sales in the quarter of $1.308 billion, up 30%. Underlying sales were also up 30%. By region the U.S. was up 30%, Europe was up 30% and Asia was up 22%. We continued to see broad growth across the portfolio and very strong growth in the Power Generating Alternators business and Electrical Drives. EBIT dollars of $210 million or 16% of sales, an increase of 61%, driven by volume leverage, cost reduction benefits and lower restructuring. Revenue growth will moderate from these very high levels in the second half of fiscal '11 as comparisons will be tougher.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Network Power. Sales in the quarter of $1.616 billion, up 20%. Underlying sales were up 8%. Acquisitions added 11 points, and currency added one point. By region, the U.S. was up 5%, Asia was up 6% and Europe was up 4%. Network Power Asia resumed slight growth in the quarter, and we expect double-digit growth in the second half of 2011. The China telecommunications business is struggling after two strong years in '09 and '10. EBIT of $150 million or 9.3% of sales, a decrease of 5%, we had increased Chloride amortization of $16 million and other Chloride acquisition related cost of $9 million.</p>
          <p>We also had negative product mix, unfavorable price, material inflation and technology investments, which were partially offset by volume leverage. The Avocent and Chloride acquisitions are on track, and the integration of these acquisitions will accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2011. EBIT margins for Network Power are expected to strengthen sequentially as we move through the second half of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies, sales in the quarter of $1.014 billion, an increase of 12%. Underlying sales were up 11%, and acquisitions added a point. By region, the U.S. was up 14%, Europe was up 5% and Asia was up 6%. Our North American residential sales were strong compared to a weak preseason last year. Global transport sales were also very strong. Our China business is slowing as the government is reducing investments in residential and light commercial sectors, and we also have a very tough comparison to 2010.</p>
          <p>EBIT of $187 million or 18.4% of sales, an increase of 15%, driven by cost reduction benefits, volume leverage and favorable mix from higher technology products. Our revenue growth is tracking nicely in fiscal '11, increasing from a strong fiscal '10, which was up 19%.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Tools and Storage. Sales in the quarter of $455 million, up 8%. Underlying sales were up 7%, and currency added a point. By region, the U.S. was up 6%, Europe was up 8% and Asia was up 15%. We saw strong growth in the non-res construction-related businesses, which continued to outpace the Consumer and Residential related businesses. EBIT of $91 million or 20.1% of sales, up 3%. We had benefits from cost containment actions and material inflation and freight costs, which were partially offset by higher selling prices. Residential housing remains challenged and the forecasted recovery continues to be pushed out.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the summary and outlook. Second quarter was a very strong quarter on most levels. We had underlying sales growth in the quarter of 14%, and our operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 16.9%. As we have discussed, material cost inflation remains a headwind. We have been working our price initiatives aggressively.</p>
          <p>Overall, capital goods on markets remain favorable, and order rates continue to support our expectations building for a good start for fiscal 2012. We are on track for a record 2011, and the foundation of Emerson is strong. For fiscal 2011, we expect earnings per share of $3.20 to $3.30, underlying sales up 10% to 13%, net sales up 15% to 18%, operating profit margin 17.4% to 17.6%, operating cash flow in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion, restructuring cost $80 million to $100 million and capital expenditures $0.6 billion.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne. Welcome, everybody, this afternoon. First, I would like to say that I personally believe this was an excellent quarter in total for the company. Sales of 18% growth, underlying sales of 14%, record operating profit margin of 16.9%, net income up 38%, EPS up 38%, operating cash flow up 19% to $753 million, free cash flow up 15% to $627 million. The balance sheet was greatly strengthened at all levels, and in our board meeting today, the finance meeting this morning, we made a decision to increase our share buyback given the strong balance sheet and cash flow, and given the fact that we're modulating back on acquisitions given all the acquisitions we have done over the last two years. However, we will continue to do bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I would like to recognize the 133,000 people around the world that, through their efforts in delivering an outstanding quarter in a very challenging and I would say uncertain global environment, I want to thank them.</p>
          <p>I also want to recognize the employees and families that have had their lives torn up and turned upside down in the recent tornados that went through the South, through Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama. We had three facilities very negatively impacted, one of them totally destroyed. Families have lost homes. Fortunately, we have not lost any employees there or family members. There's a lot of rebuilding, and our hearts and our prayers are going out to these people as they rebuild their lives in the Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas area.</p>
          <p>We had three facilities, one of them torn down completely. And two of them right now continue to have no power and clearly will have interruptions. We don't know exactly how long and how much, but the most important thing is that none of our people were lost or their families were lost, and we can rebuild over the coming months. But it was quite a devastating week last week relative to our own people here across the company. I want to thank them for everything they have done despite all the turmoil going on out there.</p>
          <p>Third, yes, it was a strong quarter, but as always, we have issues. I would say the company, as I told the board this morning, is hitting eight out of ten cylinders. Clearly, the Network Power business is an area that from an execution standpoint we haven't got the job done. We have major new challenges coming at us in this area, somewhat &#x2013; some different than what we thought just a few months ago. But we know how to deal with these, and we will deal with these. And I will try to give you some color around these areas and to make sure you have an understanding of where we're coming from. But most importantly is the fix is underway and we will deal with it. Given the history of Emerson, we know how to deal with operating issues.</p>
          <p>Relative to Network Power, Network Power China particularly had a very strong Telecom business in 2009, 2010. That business has come down quite rapidly, and with the slowing of demand, in fact negative demand, we're seeing significant price pressures, and we're seeing some hits at the top line because of those price pressures and obviously at the bottom line as it comes down. At the same time, we are seeing significant inflation in China driven by the commodities, also driven by employee inflation, and that will have to be dealt with as we go forward and restructure our whole China operation across the whole company, but in particular Network Power China, which we will deal with.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are continuing to invest aggressively in new products and new next generation products across Network Power, even with the pressures we're seeing relative to the price costs within Network Power China. We have continued to invest for the future of the company and not worrying about a quarter or two. This is very important to the long-term growth of this company, and we have continued to deliver value to our shareholders over time by investing.</p>
          <p>The Chloride integration is going well. We are now moving into second gear, higher gear. After March 31st when the final payment was made relative to the employees that stayed with the Chloride acquisition, we are now fully moving forward with a very strong integration and aggressive integration across the company. The Chloride integration of the Chloride business is doing very well, and we're pleased with the acquisition at this point in time, and we continue to believe it's going to be a tremendous value creator for our shareholders over time.</p>
          <p>The key issue that we deal with right now in Network Power is primarily relative to some of our pricing pressures in the China telecom marketplace, some of the price cost pressures coming out of the actions within China relative to inflation, relative to material and also relative to the fact that the Chinese government have been backing off relative to some of the incentives and some of the tax benefits that we have had for many, many years, and that has backed down and hurt us in the most recent quarter.</p>
          <p>Relative to the other part that we're concerned about is within the Tools and Storage business. Tools and Storage clearly is not coming back. The U.S. residential market has continued to struggle. It is at record low levels, and I do not see when it's going to recover. Our profitability is doing very well there; however, with the price cost issues that we're facing, in particular the material inflation, we're going to have to go out and raise prices in a challenging marketplace, which is never easily done. But we will also get that job done.</p>
          <p>The other area that we're obviously dealing with right now is material inflation. It's nothing different than what we have been talking about since November. The only issue is the Japanese disaster which was a terrible disaster for that country, and we're having to deal with the shifting of our supply base and lock up our supply base. We have been able to do that. We are in good shape relative to the third quarter, relative to the fourth quarter. I still say we're not out of the woods. I still believe there will be speed bumps. But with that we have been buying in material. We have been shifting material around, and we are paying premiums for this material. I firmly believe we need to support our customers here, and taking a hit short-term is more important and we can deal with that over time. But material inflation is not going away.</p>
          <p>As I look at it right now, our net material inflation is now over 3%. Our pricing actions are going to have to be stronger in the second half of the year, and I personally don't believe it's going to die as we go into 2012. And as I look at it now, I think our net material inflation will be in the 2% to 2.5% range in 2012, which again means we're going to have to have strong positive pricing actions going across the company.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, if you look at the first quarter, which as Lynne told me we had communicated that we had a negative price cost of about $40 million, it is less this quarter. It's around $30 million. We are going the right way. We are continuing to raise prices, and we will continue to raise prices. At one time I thought we would be in balance in our price cost situation by the fourth fiscal quarter. Now with the China &#x2013; not China, but the Japanese situation &#x2013; and the premiums we're having to pay there and the fact that we're having to go out, I now believe it will be more like the fourth calendar quarter. And the actions are going in. They're taking place, but clearly the Japanese disaster and the unfortunate situation there has caused us to have to go out and do things which cause our material costs to go up. And we will get that recovered as we go forward here in the coming year.</p>
          <p>But net-net, net material inflation is much larger. It's going to take longer because of the Japanese situation, and from my perspective, we have the process in place and we're making headway given the fact that the net cost between fourth &#x2013; I'm sorry, the first and second quarter &#x2013; was less, we will make that less as we go forth here in the second half of the year. But it's still a challenge and a big issue for us.</p>
          <p>The other issue that we cannot control was unfortunately currency. Within our Process business and a couple other businesses, we take long contracts relative to projects. We price them out in dollars, and unfortunately with the dollar euro movement, we have to mark-to-market these agreements, and this is a big movement this quarter relative to the dollar. It's an unfortunate situation. The new rules put forth by Congress a couple years back and put forth with the SEC, we had to mark-to-market on these currency transactions and basically pull this hit forward into the quarter, which is quite significant from the Process level. The Process business is operating at peak performance, and if you take out that currency impact, they continued to perform at extremely high levels and continue to invest in the future and new products and innovation, and I feel very good about it. Currency does happen. There's not much I can do about it. And from that perspective, we have to move on.</p>
          <p>As I look at the company today, we continue to invest aggressively around the world, international, and emerging markets. We have continued to invest significantly in our mid-tier project programs especially around China, India, and Russia. Ed Monser and I just finished an 11-day trip where we went into Romania, Russia, and China, reviewing our key strategic engineering centers and the key programs relative to where we stand. We are doing better than I thought we would at this point in time. We have a lot of investments going on. We have hundreds of people going into these, engineering and sales and marketing, and we're continuing to really accelerate this program. It will start paying dividends for us as we move it into 2012.</p>
          <p>I want to thank the employees for the work they're doing there and putting up with us and the intensity that we went through for 11 days, but it was very productive to get firsthand experience on what's going on and making sure everyone understands where we want to go.</p>
          <p>So as I look at it, we have operating issues. But you have to understand, I'm an operating executive. I've been around here for 30 years. We have a couple issues. We will deal with them. We will fix Network Power. We will continue to improve the profitability in Network Power. We've had a couple new wrinkles come at us, but we'll deal with it. One thing Emerson can do is fix operating issues, and we can do it. But don't lose sight of the fact that we just put up a tremendous quarter. I'll repeat it, underlying sales of 14%. Operating profit, record margins of 16.9%. We are telling you that we're going to hit a record 17.5%-type for the whole year. Net income for the quarter up 38%. Operating cash flow strong, and we're talking about operating cash flow, free cash flow at record levels for the whole fiscal year and our EPS at record levels for the whole fiscal year.</p>
          <p>It was a tremendous first half, a tremendous second quarter. We have a couple issues. We will deal with them. We have the processes in place, and we have strong underlying growth going into 2012. As I look at the global markets today, yes, there are issues going on out there, but I still believe that we will see strong underlying growth based on our order pattern and based on the new product investments and based on our emerging market investments that we're making across this company that we'll have another strong 2012.</p>
          <p>So as I look at it right now, and one of the things that I will do at the upcoming May EPG, is I will update the segment where I would say expectations of sales and profit margins. Clearly there are some of them moving around. Some will be better. Some could be slightly worse. But in total, if you look at what we presented in February, I still believe our underlying sales will be good. They will be at the high end of the range in my opinion of what we communicated. We will exceed $24.5 billion in sales. We will set a record margin, Op margin of around 17.5%, and we will have free cash flow very close to $2.9 billion, maybe a tad less, but a record level. And our balance sheet will be sitting at extremely strong levels after we did the acquisitions of the last couple years.</p>
          <p>So the company is strong. The company is dealing with the issues we need to deal with. And I feel very good about where we sit today and about getting the things fixed that need to be fixed across this company. But again I want to thank the employees around this company. I especially want to thank the employees that have gone through basically an extremely challenging tornado the last couple, 10 days, two weeks, and they're still working. I have one group of employees that went back into the factory and pulled out all the working inventory despite their homes being destroyed. Now, that's where you talk dedication.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will open the floor and take questions. And again I want to remind people, I do not give quarterly forecasts. I haven't since 2001. I have no intention to do it. I give you my forecast for the whole year, and those numbers are still in line with what we communicated to you back in February.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll open the table. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mr. Davis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, you kind of &#x2013; you're calling them operating issues in China. Is it specifically kind of &#x2013; is it truly operating issues? Do you have some competitors that have been irrational over the last quarter or so, and you're just responding to something that's going on there, just if you don't mind clarifying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective in the China telecom market space, it's a very aggressive space. And the market growth &#x2013; and this is the telecom space -the market growth really came down as the government backed off the incentives, clearly the market pricing got very competitive, and we have had to protect some of our base, and some base we had to walk away from. So I never call a competitor totally irrational. Obviously there's a reason why they do things, but some of our competitors, local competitors got extremely aggressive and caused some significant price erosion. At the same time we did lose some business because we walked away from it. From my perspective where we are right now is, we're retuning where we want to aim our guns here, and we're also retuning what type of cost structure we want to grow forward. So there's nothing unusual for us, but it did accelerate quite rapidly here the last three or four months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you spent a lot of time explaining that, so I'll move on to something more positive. And that's the Industrial Automation business, which is just showing some phenomenal numbers. I mean, I think we all know that the alternator business is great, but what is surprising me is the strength of the drives business. Can you talk about that? I mean, is there something out there? I mean, obviously there's an OpEx cycle here and there's demand because things are getting running again, but it seems like it has to be more than that to be driving these kind of growth numbers. Is there energy efficiency, replacement, I mean, what's...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You hit the nail on the head. There's three things going on, Scott, and you hit them, all three, perfectly. Number one, clearly there's an operating investment going on from the standpoint of people looking at their factories and the productivity element of that factory and given where you are, be it in China cost going up or the U.S. or Europe or whatever. As you upgrade that factory, you're looking at new automation, and drives clearly is one way to do it.</p>
          <p>Energy efficiency is clearly another thing that's going on right now, so people when they go in and look at their upgrades, you're going to see energy efficiency is clearly one of these key things, including China. This is one case where our China investment is truly paying off and it's been a good growth for us relative to our drives business.</p>
          <p>And the third thing would be just from the standpoint of the investments we have made over the last couple years in particular trying to leverage it across our whole Industrial Automation and our Process business. So we're getting into new segments that we have never gotten in before. I think fundamentally if you look at the drives market right now, it's a good business, and we have a very good cost structure with our new product platform underway there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Dave, another question on Network Power. But just looking at it strategically, a lot of acquisitions in the past, and you have highlighted that you'd like to do more over the next couple years. Just wondered if there are any specific technologies there that would benefit the portfolio particularly or if it's more in process R&amp;D type properties you'd look at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, from my standpoint right now, Network Power, I don't see anything that we need to do right now. We have what we need for the current market I see out there and currently what we want to do. I would say that I would be probably rationalizing more. I would look at some of the segments we want to go after. You know, Network Power, I would continue to rationalize that as we look at the pieces we have here. We've made a lot of acquisitions, and the business will recover here as we come through that. But I don't see anything big I want to do at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a little maybe conceptual preview of what you're going to talk about at EPG, but it looks like the guidance for underlying growth allows for similar second half growth as in the first half. So just wondering if you can address where some of the acceleration versus deceleration might be or at least the sequential ramp might be more pronounced. Some pieces are obvious, but not all of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me grab the pieces here by business here. I'm just grabbing something here. I know we have it in here. Yeah, from my perspective, I mean, as I look at it right now, I think Industrial Automation is going to stay pretty strong. Network Power is going to pick back up. The comps will also be easier from the standpoint of a lot of China growth last year. So Network Power will be a pretty good growth basis.</p>
          <p>I think the Process business will be a little bit stronger in the second half than they were in the first half. I don't know about Climate Technology. It could be slightly better. It's a tough call. A lot depends on North America and the inventory, what happens. Inventories are very low right now. If you have a little heat, I don't see the residential market coming back. But the Climate Technology could do a little better, and I don't see much moving in Tools and Storage.</p>
          <p>So I think the positives right now are going to be Process and Network Power and Industrial Automation, and the wild card will be Climate Technology, and I don't think much will happen with Tools and Storage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe coming back to China for a second, I guess the China nominal GDP was up around 15, 16% in the quarter, so, you know, it makes me wonder if you take out Network Power, what were you guys up? I know you said 9% including Network Power, but what if you took it out?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pieces &#x2013; the industrial pieces did very well there. I would say the Climate Technology which was more than doubling last year at this time in China had &#x2013; I bet you had to be flat or slightly down in the quarter. The industrial business &#x2013; we're grabbing it here by the varied businesses here. But the two businesses that did not do well would be Climate and then Network Power. So we're grabbing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason I'm asking is just &#x2013; you're in niche...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Climate was down too, because &#x2013; Climate was up 40% or 50% last year at this time, so we have some &#x2013; we have two things. The government was really stimulating in residential and non-residential and telecom in 2009, 2010, and now they backed that off. So we had that going the other way. Those two guys are down. The other businesses were up quite significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you look forward given the niche you're in more attractive niches than general GDP growth normally, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're viewing this as an aberration and a very significant one. You should be growing at a multiple of nominal GDP in the country, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at &#x2013; I would look at nominal. I would look at fixed. But we have been certainly growing around &#x2013; we've been growing close to that 20% mark, and so we have a $3 billion of sales in China now. So we've been growing close to that 20% mark. And we do have segments that will go in and out based on what's going on with the government, and right now with where the focus is at this point in time, we're trying to slow certain segments down. I still think we're going to have good growth this year, but it's going be a little bit different mix.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And maybe also coming back to your comment where you talked about the local competition, in answer to Scott's question and those, you walked away. You had pricing issues with those guys. Other than retuning your own strategy, what makes you believe that the industry structure and competitive dynamics are going to change &#x2013; turn positive. You're going to get guys going out of business? You're going to get &#x2013; why would this have been a one-time thing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think there's two things going on. What we'll do is re-aim where we want to play in the telecom space in what type of products, and we will retool our product offerings to be a little bit changed, which we can do within a 12-month time period. So I would say that we will be less and less focused on telecom in China in the coming 12 months, which will allow us &#x2013; we're not going to go back and start a war like a battle. We're going to re-aim where we want to play and put our resources, which we can do in this space.</p>

          <p>Question on Process, given strong order growth rate there, how would you characterize the MRO business right now? And then are we transitioning into the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>White hot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when do you think we transition more into the project type stuff, and you know when margins start to &#x2013; you know, the leverage starts to maybe not be as robust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margins will start &#x2013; I mean, I'm sorry; margins. The big project business will start shipping in the second half of this year based on the way the order pace is going right now. And the game for us right now is to clearly continue to do our normal cost reduction, our repositioning, and things like that so that we can try to offset that hit we're going to get there. But if you watch our margins in this business, we'll run them up there towards the 20%. The big projects will come in, and we'll bounce back and forth in this 19% to 20%, little bit 20 plus percent. That's what's going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then are you surprised how strong MRO has held, or were you kind of expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, Rich, I blew it probably 18 months ago. I thought the MRO would come in faster. It didn't. And given the fact that &#x2013; going back to the question I think it was Scott asked or brought up &#x2013; in the U.S. in particular, people have really curtailed investment for so long, they need to invest in their plant. And with the price of natural gas being so low and the whole logistics cost going so high up, people are reinvesting in let's say in the plants here in the U.S. But also if you look at our European business, they're doing the same thing there. So this is something that has been expected for quite some time, and I think it's going to hold up for &#x2013; because I think I pointed out in February, I think it could hold out for all this year and maybe a little bit going into next year. The pace will obviously change, but it will still be a pretty good MRO business out there for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a bigger picture question, Industrial Automation, in February you talked about maybe shifting the mix longer term in that business. Given companies with a lot of cash out there, is there anything that you're looking at in terms of from a divesting standpoint that you're getting close to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We only have one divestiture underway right now, and it's not in industrial automation. It's in our appliance component business. You know, it's heating products. People know that. It's on the marketplace. And we would expect that to be done before the end of this fiscal year. And I don't see at this point in time. I'm not &#x2013; I mean, the acquisition mode, the price has gotten much higher, so we're doing bolt-ons right now, and strategically we're backing off and getting our balance sheet strong again and we'll come back out at the right time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry if it's a bad connection. First just on Avocent and Chloride, the way it's worded in the press release, the additional restructuring or integration or however you characterized it, sounds like it's something different than the original plan. Is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, let me tell you what happened. When we did the deal, I struck a deal with the board and Tim Cobbold that we would keep Chloride separate so they could do their March 31 close and bonus payout. And that was the deal that we struck with the board. And so from my perspective, when March 31 came, we paid out the bonus for that whole fiscal year, and then we made the decision of how we're going &#x2013; which people are going to be doing what.</p>
          <p>So we have had a lot of organization changes here over the last couple weeks. And now what we're doing is we're accelerating the integration, which we had held off. And I didn't want to go public and talk about that, because I felt that would be unfair to the employees of that organization at that point in time. But we made &#x2013; I made the decision with the board of Chloride to keep them standalone until the end of March. And now that that's the case, now we're going about doing the integration of Chloride, Knurr, which we had done a couple years ago, and Avocent. That's what that was. It's not we're going to spend any more money. There's not going to be more restructuring. I just want to let people know that we are now picking up the pace. That's what it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I didn't want to talk about it previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then on China, your comment about kind of retooling manufacturing, it sounded like maybe you're talking about something even more broad than Network Power. Is that the case? Is there some re-evaluation about how much footprint you want in the country or where it's at in country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What we are doing right now and have been underway for the last 12 months, across all of Emerson is evaluating &#x2013; we have a significant presence in China. We probably employ well over 40,000 people in China these days, and what we're looking at, Jeff, is we're looking at our various manufacturing facilities, and we're repositioning them &#x2013; and I've explained this to the government &#x2013; within China where we are moving further west and we're actually going to be moving some out of China because of the cost structure. So this is underway and will go underway for the next 18 months. There won't be any big announcements. We'll just start working it very carefully here. And at that point in time, it's across the board. And so where we look at capacity and where it's going to be in China, given what I see the economy is going into a more costly mode, then we need to figure out where we're going to be. We're not walking away from this market, because I think this market is going to be a $6 billion market for us within five years, but we're just going to have to re-fix where we're manufacturing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on inflation, you know, the debate so far is really still just around price costs getting caught up in net balance. But are you seeing any demand destruction anywhere, any behavior change by people because of what's going on with inflation and if so, where?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking from a customer perspective, Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from a customer perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't seen any of that. I mean, there's clearly in certain market segments that where the consumer could be very sensitive and unwilling to pay the higher prices. But most of our customers are facing the same issues we're facing, and they're going to have to go out and raise prices. You know, we're all going through the process right now of do we want to be in this segment or not be in that segment, product line, or something like that. But I think that from the standpoint of the whole price cost situation, we are in a mode here for inflation for a couple years, and people are gearing up, and how do you adjust to that and how do you take the necessary actions. But I haven't seen any demand destruction yet.</p>
          <p>I see more demand destruction from the global economy, from the Japan situation, from the war in the Middle East, from all the other things going on around the world than anything else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally for me, can you give us some sense overall how quickly the kind of the power quality related businesses are growing? How Chloride did on a pro-forma basis and the like?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good afternoon, Ajay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on China, so obviously very important component of revenues and your long-term strategy, you talked about wage inflation and obviously that's more related to Network Power and Climate. But I would think that has broader implications so for other businesses. So maybe share your thoughts on what you're seeing. Is that isolated, or is this a little more broader?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's across all the board. I think what it will do is it will accelerate the investments by companies in China into productivity and equipment rather than using low cost labor. So as that labor pool gets more costly, you're going to start making those tradeoffs relative to using more automation versus labor, and I think that we will continue to see that.</p>
          <p>So this issue is going across &#x2013; it's not just Network Power and Climate. Network Power and Climate thing is based on the government trying to draw back the demand more than anything else, and then inflation is just happening across the country right now, and it's one of the things that the government is trying to get back under control. But it's very difficult when they have national wage increases of 20 plus percent. So I think this is across all business segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you'd expect to move manufacturing out to other countries that you'd have lower cost there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will do some. We're going to reposition some. We still will have a very, very significant presence in China. What I was saying is there are some segments that I'll look at, as I look at if I have 100% capacity of a product, I might look at taking 80% and leave it in China; I might take 20% and move it out to a different country within the region. I'm doing more of a strategy where our manufacturing now is going to be China for China and then sort of a North Asia and South Asia type of strategy for manufacturing. And we're going to start dividing up that way from the standpoint of just from a diversification but also from a cost structure standpoint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, and then in Europe, very nice pickup, 17% growth, easy comps obviously helping. But 17% is a very solid number. So what's driving that? Is there any specific businesses, countries that stood out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's pretty much across all the businesses. All businesses are coming back quite nicely. The Industrial businesses in particular are doing better given the fact that they under-invested for a while. And I expect Europe is going to continue &#x2013; I put a forecast out earlier this year that Europe would outgrow the U.S. The U.S. is doing extremely well right now, so it's giving Europe a run for it. But I still think that Europe is going to have a very good growth in the second half. It won't be the 17%, but I still believe it will be double digits in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And maybe one modeling question, if I could. On the corporate and other line, it moves around quite a bit. So maybe if you can help with how we should think about the second half, is $100 million kind of the run rate, or is it a different rough number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, yeah, that's right. I mean, what we have moving around within the quarters is the incentive comp where we had a pickup this year versus last, and we will have a pickup on a net basis for the balance of the year, but it will not be even through the two quarters. That's the major item that is moving around on us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing to keep in mind, Ajay, is that on the corporate and other line, as Frank was saying, with the stock comp expense, that can be a little bit lumpy even though it's going to be a tailwind for the year. So we had $33 million favorable in this quarter that we just reported. Next quarter &#x2013; I don't want to get too technical on this. Next quarter, which is our third quarter, you have to remember if I compare it to a year ago, the stock price went down $7 from the end of March to the end of June. And so our stock...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're losing quite a bit today so maybe we'll move up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hopefully we get some of that back. But so it's not likely to be a tailwind like we saw in the second quarter. So you're likely to see that higher, and you're also likely &#x2013; obviously gains don't repeat. So you've got $19 million favorable on gains, so just between those two, you're talking about $50 million give or take. I mean, that should give you some color.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Jessica Mullin for Dean. That was a nice sequential uptick in Climate Technologies. Can you give some more color on the pricing increases and the realization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the realization, it happened. And we're about to embark on our third price in this area sometime this summer. I mean, the issue relative to our price is not what's driving the margin up. You know, our price cost situation we deal with our big OEMs here in this area is we pretty much stay in balance in a quarter out of quarter. Within a quarter, we're pricing every six months back and forth. So, I mean, that didn't drive our margin. What drove our margin here was the investment in new innovation in the electronics businesses we're investing in and also several new products that we brought out. So, I mean, at this level here, our profitability should stay pretty good given the current mix. And we are getting the price necessary to cover the cost. So it's not a headwind nor is it a tailwind right now. We're neutral. And so that's where it's coming from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the overall &#x2013; yeah, the overall, we can give you that. I think it's in the Q. So do you know what &#x2013; about a point of growth from pricing? I'll tell you in a second. One second.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, we're having to go after price increases across the board because of material issues and then a couple cases in from all the businesses are going to have to raise prices. And in the Q, it's going to show two points of the growth was from price.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Climate lead times are very short. We have the capacity, we deal with it. Unless there's &#x2013; we do have &#x2013; one of the facilities that got hit was a climate facility in Alabama. That's a wild card for us right now. I don't know what that is going to do.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the key issue for us &#x2013; there's two things going on: The orders are pretty good in Climate. China is definitely &#x2013; I mean, right now it continues to drop because of the demand and the comparisons are tougher and the Chinese government has been raising interest rates. So I expect China to be pulling down on us. And then in North America, if we get any heat at all, the inventories are very, very low out there that we'll obviously have to raise production. But you'll see that pretty quickly. If our orders tick up within 60 days, we're going to be shipping. In fact it's typically 45 days.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, on the challenges/kind of wrinkles that you didn't expect in the quarter, Dave, we spent a lot of time talking about this China telecom situation. Were there other things? You had the Japan disruption. Any other things that you were talking about when you made that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there are a couple things that are coming at us right now. One, the fact that the government had pulled back on the tax incentives and sort of the rebates that they had been giving &#x2013; you know, we have been working with for quite some time. And those are significant numbers. That causes us both to lose some operating profit, and we also lose it in the tax rate too. That hurt us a little bit. And I would say that the pricing intensified as the quarter went on further than I thought, and there's not much we can do about that at this point in time. Those are the two big things there.</p>
          <p>The inflation thing I think is &#x2013; I thought would be more tapped down, but the government is trying, but I don't see it having any impact at this point in time. And so the China inflation is a situation that is a concern of mine, and clearly will have an impact on the whole economy there if they don't get that back under control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of sort of the fix being in on Network Power, as you think in terms of like exiting 2011 and out into next year, what's your view on how long this fix is going to take and when you feel like you're going to get Network Power margins back up to something you view as more normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be &#x2013; we'll start making headway as we move into that &#x2013; into our fourth calendar here. But from my perspective, I won't be happy with them until &#x2013; we're going to be &#x2013; we're not going to be getting up into where I'm comfortable with probably until we get into the first part of next year. They're going to get sequentially better as the year goes on. But they should be &#x2013; they should be closer to 15% EBIT margin, and we're not there, and we're obviously not going to be quite there as we finish this year. I thought we would, but we're not going to be quite be there. So at this cycle, that's where it should be. And it's going to be more into 2012 before we get there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

I was just wondering, can you give us some idea of where you expect order run rates maybe for IA and Process towards the end of the year just in terms of obviously you talked about &#x2013; you talked about a good foundation for 2012. I mean, where do you see that sort of trend moving in the remainder of the year and into '12?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got the order trend right here. I want to see where they're trending right now. What I'm looking for is a graph, but I don't think I have that graph. I just have that.</p>
          <p>I mean &#x2013; I mean, I have to look at this, Julian, and we'll talk further. I'll look at it and think about it when we get down to EPG. But right now as I look at where we're trending, it would be have to be trending in the solid &#x2013; I'm looking on a fixed rate basis here, not a GAAP, because the GAAP obviously is going to be inflated with the weaker dollar &#x2013; but I still think it's going to be in the 15 plus percent range or say that 14 to 16, 17% range as we leave this year for those two particular businesses.</p>

          <p>The comparisons are going to be tougher and tougher as we go forward here. But I'll take a look at that and see those comparisons. But I think they're still going to look at double digit growth for those two businesses when we start out the year next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit of color on what happened with the embedded business? And then as you think about the Network Power top line improving in the back half, what are the drivers there? Is it just the comps get easier? Or are there some businesses that really you expect to pick up sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the comps are going to get easier, and but I'm also expecting in the precision cooling area &#x2013; not precision, but the reliable power area, that those orders and the sales will get better as the year progresses here. Because the order pace is coming already, and we see the quote &#x2013; we see the quotes out there. So that business &#x2013; and that's the normal cycle. It should be stronger in the second half this year and then really strengthen as we move into the early part of 2012. So that's where that cycle is going right now. And it's pretty much where I thought it would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the embedded business, is that the one you're talking about improving sequentially? And then can you talk about what happened there from a cost perspective as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The embedded business will &#x2013; should improve sequentially. And the cost system in embedded, right now it's in pretty good shape. Our manufacturing is both split between China and the Philippines there. We're obviously dealing with some inflation in China, but it's not that bad right now. More my concern with embedded is from the standpoint of the component inflation, the component points, the premiums I have to pay for certain components right now. That's the biggest issue for me at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to clarify on Network Power margins getting better, are you saying it should get better 3Q versus 2Q and 4Q versus 3Q, or are you just saying exiting the year we feel it will be better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I feel at that point in time, based on the plan we should see sequential improvement in the Network Power margin. We're taking the necessary action. The level that I'm not sure, I mean, we're redoing our forecast right now based on the first half of the year. That's clearly one segment is a little bit weaker, and I have some other segments are going to be a little stronger. But I would expect that the best margin will be the fourth quarter as we leave that quarter, as we leave the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly, at a high level, Dave, obviously you've got a track record of having very conservative guidance. I'm narrowing in on the fact that a lot of issues, a lot of different issues, and some uncertainty on timing of resolutions, Japan's still a wild card. And the fact that maybe you're a little bit south of the cash flow number as you talked about earlier. I mean, how would you like us to think about this new range on guidance now? Do you still feel like it's got the normal level of Emerson conservativeness in it, or really as it sounds here more likely the high end of the range is sort of not best case but very good case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, from my perspective, as I look at where we are right now, the guidance I'm giving you I feel is pretty solid. I don't have an element of conservatism in here. The issues that if we didn't have issues going on out there relative to the material inflation issues, relative to the China sourcing issues, relative to the various things that we discussed on the conference call here, maybe it would be a lot easier. But right now there's a lot of things tugging at us at this point in time, and we're going to have a very, very good year with strong underlying growth and good earnings growth, but from my perspective, there's a lot of things pulling at us from the standpoint of the whole material and the pricing action and some of the pressures we're seeing in the telecom and some on the fixed. So I'd say the guidance that I've been giving you is tight, and you should not be looking at that as Dave is trying to sandbag us. That's not what's going on here.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I've probably gotten cut off a bunch of times. I'm not sure what happened with the phone. Just a couple of cleanup questions. One, we now have two points of currency benefit. Did we have any currency earnings built into the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we built in. We added &#x2013; as we raised the sales, the reported sales level, we put in currency. We flow in around a 15% rate. That's basically what we flow in at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, one of the questions that everybody seems to be driving at is you've got a consensus estimate at $3.29, $3.30, and I think that adds up that you don't really want to cut estimates today or something like that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question is, what kind of &#x2013; in order to get to the other part of the range, is it just strictly the volume levels that will come through? Will that get you there? Would all the problems that if you had the stronger volume levels put you at the upper end of the range? Is that all you have to worry about at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective as I look right now and I look at the volumes, I look at the orders, I look at the margins. I mean, I look at &#x2013; we'll be at the upper end of that range if everything comes through at the higher volumes, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you hear anything talk about &#x2013; we have a unique tax &#x2013; talking about tax situation in China. We do have the 100% depreciation write-off in this country at least for this calendar year. Are you seeing anything that is helping drive demand or people talking about it? Because one of the things we hear is that it's easier to justify, if I have to take the pricing, at least I can write it off this year, so I want to make sure I get it. Are you hearing anything being driven by that tax incentive or that's still just in the background?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Network Power, there's been a lot of discussion around China, but your U.S. growth rate slowed to up 5% versus up 9%. There's also the dynamic around the recent orders being flat to down. So I'm just curious, question number one is could you just talk about the different moving parts in the U.S. and what's going well and maybe not as well there? And then secondly, given you expect this kind of comeback in the next couple of quarters, how should we jive the kind of order rates over the next couple quarters? How would you expect to see a nice pop in those moving in the next quarter, or should it be much more of a gradual move from flat to kind of that double digit rate that you would probably be talking about for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my standpoint, it's going to be gradual. I don't see a pop. I don't see a pop. We had a strong pop a year ago on the embedded power and computing, that's what's dragging down the North America orders at this point in time. Because at this point in time last year, those things &#x2013; the orders in embedded power and computing were extremely strong; and now we're working through that comparisons, and those have been very weak, and those are starting to pick back up. So from my perspective I would expect a gradual improvement. I don't expect a pop here. And I would expect that improvement to go across the board as the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a comment on lots of moving parts here. You guys are actually one of the few companies that actually said you built inventories, you know, as kind of a safety stock here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much do you think either your customers or suppliers, how much of that is going on given that a lot of companies have been surprised by their revenue growth in March? Do you think that's having &#x2013; you know, whether it's pre-buy ahead of price increases, or you know just kind of a land grab to buffer from impacts from Japan, you know, is there enough going on here to have kind of a pronounced positive impact on kind of shorter cycle businesses across the globe? Do you see that going around a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that one of the things I think people were going to try to grab and bring in more inventory. We didn't get in as much as we wanted to, because obviously sales were stronger. I think that's a natural tendency. But I think that there probably is a little bit of pop going on right now. But it's not going to go away because the pipeline is going to have to be replenished. So I think that this is going to go on here for at least six to nine to ten months. So I mean, from my standpoint in this quarter, in the current quarter we're in right now, the third quarter, we'd like to build a little bit &#x2013; even more inventory relative to around these commodities as we try to bring them in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one more question. I'm not sure I read the comments on Process. You basically said that some of the bigger projects are coming through. Does that mean we're kind of at a peak level for Process margins over the next, you know, year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year or so? I mean, I would say that our margins probably will not peak in Process within 12 months. I mean, they could go up &#x2013; we could work our way up a little bit next year again. I mean, we have the projects are coming in, but they sort of work their way in over time. In my opinion, the MRO is going to stay pretty strong out there. So through the early part of 2012, so the margins will continue to look pretty good for Process. You're going to have quarters go up and down based on mix, but right now I think our Process margin will continue to trend upwards.</p>
