        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter results presentation. This morning our CEO, Ossie Gr&#xFC;bel, will present the highlights of our performance for the first half of this year. Then our CFO, Tom Naratil, will present the second quarter results in detail. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions and we'll take questions first from the telephone and then from the audience, in English first and then followed by questions in German.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Ossie, I'd like to draw your attention to this slide, which contains our cautionary statement. In addition, I'd also like to refer you to our cautionary statement in the second quarter report. I'd encourage you to take some time to read and understand these statements.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Ossie.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for attending our half year results conference. In the first six months of 2011, UBS achieved a pre-tax profit of CHF3.9 billion and CHF2.8 billion in net profit. Net new money was CHF31 billion, with contributions from all of our wealth and asset management businesses and which we think is a testament of our clients' renewed confidence in the bank. Our Basel Tier 1 capital ratio was slightly higher at 18.1% and it also demonstrates our solid capital position and financial stability.</p>
          <p>The first half of 2011 was marked by heightened client risk aversion, especially in the second quarter, due to various effects such as the continued sovereign debt problems in Europe, increased concerns about the recovery in the U.S. economy and the debt problems and regional political instability. This uncertainty caused by these events dampened trading volumes especially in FICC and weighted heavily on the results of our flow driven Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Indeed in the first half of this year, the Swiss franc strengthened against the U.S. dollar and euro. Of course, currency movements like this affect our non-Swiss franc business, negatively for revenues, invested assets and margins but also positively on costs as you can see.</p>
          <p>As for the second quarter, let me highlight a few points. Our Wealth Management business and Retail and Corporate delivered increased profits and stable gross margins. Our Wealth Management business continued to attract sufficient amounts of net new money. In our Investment Bank, all our businesses were impacted by lower volumes. Our trading business in FICC, in particular, were impacted negatively by the widening of credit spreads. And, of course, we have continued to be disciplined in how we deploy risk. In other words, even in a low-volume market, we haven't increased our risk.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear to us that the new capital and regulatory requirements will weigh on banking profits going forward. This is a constraint for the entire banking industry, and we cannot rely on markets to boost our profits when global economic growth looks as it may have stalled. We will have to continue to manage risks tightly to make sure that the risk/reward balance is positive for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>After reviewing our business mix, we remain fully convinced that our integrated client-centric business model is best suited to serve our clients and create the most value for our shareholders. More specifically we believe we must have a leading Wealth Management business in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe and Middle East regions, which represent the greatest opportunities for growing our Wealth Management franchise, which also means, as I have said before, that our Wealth Management business in America is not for sale. And I only say that because these rumors keep coming up lately. We need a globally competitive Investment Bank and a successful, Asset Management business, to complement our lineup and we want to maintain our leading position in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Now, confirming our integrated model is one thing, delivering on it is another thing. And this is where we must adapt and improve so that we can succeed in this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>First, we have to eliminate costs in the range of CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion over the next two to three years, but we will continue to invest in growth areas. We will provide an update on this new cost initiative later this year.</p>
          <p>And second, we will continue to examine our corporate structure and booking model with a view toward optimizing our corporations under the new regulatory regimes.</p>
          <p>We also looked at our medium-term targets as part of our strategy. Considering the big changes in the market environment and regulation over the last four quarters, we believe that the medium-term targets we set out at our Investor Day in 2009 are no longer achievable in this three- to five-year time period.</p>
          <p>I believe the market conditions experienced in the last quarters are likely to persist in the immediate future, but you can be assured that we will continue to focus on our client needs, and we'll seek to capture revenues and growth opportunities. And as I said before, we will step up our efforts to reduce the company cost base and become more efficient.</p>
          <p>Now, before I hand over to Tom for the detailed results, let me tell you that my management and I are very pleased that Axel Weber has agreed to be nominated for election to the UBS Board. We know each other since years and we both look forward to working together. Tom?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ossie, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through the details of our results for the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>These are the highlights of our performance on the quarter. Our net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF1 billion represents diluted earnings per share of CHF0.26. At the pre-tax level, we made CHF1.7 billion. Both of our Wealth Management businesses performed well, delivering improved results despite a drop in client activity. We're pleased that we saw another quarter of positive net new money in all of our Wealth and Asset Management businesses. This performance is a sign of our client's continued and growing confidence in UBS.</p>
          <p>The Investment Banks' profits were lower as a result of weak trading performance and low client activity. Our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel 2 improved to 18.1% at the end of June, and our core Tier 1 ratio also improved to 16.1%, even though our risk-weighted assets increased slightly over the quarter. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased by 5% during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Before we get into the details of the results, I'd like to say a few words on the market environment last quarter. The Swiss franc continued to strengthen against other major currencies as ongoing economic concerns in the Eurozone and the United States reinforced the franc's safe haven status. For example, on an average basis, the franc appreciated 8% against the dollar over the quarter and 23% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our businesses are affected by currency movements, and you should consider them when evaluating our performance. Three-month LIBOR remained flat in dollars, pounds and francs, and current low levels of interest rates continue to put pressure on our net interest margins. Equity markets experienced considerable volatility and most major indices ended the quarter roughly flat. Investors often choose to remain on the sidelines under such circumstances as evidenced by the lower equity trading volumes on the exchanges most relevant to our businesses.</p>
          <p>Here's a summary of our performance by division. As you can see, all of our business divisions were profitable. I'll cover the divisional results in more detail later. First, I'd like to cover taxes and the attribution of profits to non-controlling interests.</p>
          <p>The net tax charge for the quarter was CHF377 million, an effective tax rate of 23%. Most of the charges stem from the amortization of our deferred tax assets. As part of our annual planning process, a re-measurement of the deferred tax assets in the second half of the year may reduce our full-year effective tax rate to below 20%.</p>
          <p>Net profit attributable to holders of our trust preferred securities was CHF263 million. Most of our annual coupon payments fall in the second quarter of the year. The amount this quarter is slightly higher than usual as it includes additional accruals for coupons in future periods. At this point, we don't foresee any events that would require us to attribute profits to non-controlling interests in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Net profit declined CHF792 million quarter-on-quarter including the non-controlling interests I just mentioned. This decline was primarily the result of lower revenues mainly driven by the investment bank, partly offset by reductions in expenses, both personnel and non-personnel. Own credit charges of CHF25 million this quarter were CHF108 million lower than the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>While the strengthening Swiss franc has caused revenues to decline on a reported basis, it has also benefited our cost base. In fact, currency movements are the biggest driver for the cost decline of 10% over the prior quarter. In addition, personnel expenses declined due to lower revenues. Non-personnel expenses declined 7%, most notably on lower administration and occupancy costs. If we look at the cost development year-over-year, reported expenses are down 11%.</p>
          <p>We'll remain vigilant on costs and continually seek efficiencies. Given current market conditions, this is even more pressing and we'll implement further measures to reduce our costs base. We expect to eliminate CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion from our expense base over the next two to three years. We're currently working out the details of these measures and we'll update you when we have further information. As Ossie has already highlighted, we're fully committed to our client-focused business model and the business divisions we run today and we'll continue to invest for their long-term growth.</p>
          <p>We've made considerable progress in our Wealth Management businesses over the last year and I'd like to highlight some of their strengths. We operate and are well-established in the largest and fastest growing markets in the world. Together, Wealth Management and Wealth Management Americas manage CHF1.4 trillion of invested assets, with over 11,000 advisors. We've delivered increasing profits year-to-date as management has executed well in challenging market conditions. There's been a considerable turnaround in net new money, highlighting our clients' confidence in us.</p>
          <p>A key feature of success in any wealth management business is its ability to attract and retain top advisors. Our retention rates have improved and our attrition rates are close to historical lows. In addition, we continue to recruit many of the industry's top advisors to our firm. We're confident that these businesses have fully recovered and we're well-positioned for further growth.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the divisions, our Wealth Management division delivered an improved pre-tax profit of CHF672 million. Revenues declined by 3% mainly due to lower fees on a lower invested asset base caused by the strengthening Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>Trading income benefited from a CHF21 million gain from an additional distribution of treasury revenues in line with our plans to fully allocate these revenues back to the businesses by year-end. Expenses decreased 7% due in part to currency effects.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses declined despite the full impact of salary increases effective in March. Client advisor head count continued to increase as we selectively hired in our strategic growth regions. Net new money inflows were a solid CHF5.6 billion, and we're pleased to see that they're coming from our key growth areas.</p>
          <p>The chart on the left illustrates the composition of our Wealth Management invested assets by currency. Two-thirds of our assets are denominated in dollars, euros, and pounds combined. The charts on the right show the drivers of the changes to the invested asset base, and as you can see, the largest contributor was currency.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter, invested assets stood at CHF748 billion, CHF43 billion lower than at the beginning of the quarter. Revenues declined quarter-on-quarter in all reported categories except trading income which included the treasury revenues I mentioned earlier. Transaction-based fees declined the most, 16% from the prior quarter reflecting lower levels of client activity. Recurring fees declined 2% on a lower invested asset base and net interest income also declined marginally.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on building our recurring revenue streams including interest income. As a result of the revenue decline and a 1% drop in average invested assets, the gross margin declined 1 basis point to 97 basis points per annum. We are determined to grow our gross margins responsibly and our objective remains to achieve 100 basis points or better.</p>
          <p>This slide shows a regional breakdown of invested assets with the respective net new money flows. Net inflows remained strong in our strategic growth areas of Asia Pacific and the emerging markets as well as globally from Ultra-High Net Worth clients.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we saw continued inflows in our onshore business, which were more than offset by net outflows in our cross-border business. We are disciplined in our efforts to attract net new money and we'll continue to add value to our client relationships which will help us achieve our gross margin objectives.</p>
          <p>Retail and Corporate profits increased 4% as a result of higher operating income and lower cost. This improved performance was supported by lower credit loss expenses and income from a small divestment as well as higher dividends from participations.</p>
          <p>Net interest income declined as increased deposit volumes did not fully compensate for the continued pressure on interest margins. This is better illustrated on the next slide I'll show you. Loan balances were unchanged at CHF136 billion and deposits declined marginally to CHF116 billion in the quarter. We've seen a steady erosion in the net interest margin over time driven by a relatively stable margin on loans and declining rates on our replication portfolio. While we've increased deposit volumes over time, this has not been enough to offset declining replication portfolio income. However, I'd like to point out that we're comfortable with the disciplined way in which we've priced deposits.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, we saw continued improvement in our performance as the management team is executing successfully on its plan. Pre-tax profit improved to CHF140 million from CHF111 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The strengthening of the Swiss franc masked some of the underlying improvement. In dollar terms, profits increased nearly 40% to $165 million. Also in dollars, revenues increased 4%, driven by higher fees and interest income, as well as incremental realized gains of $22 million from WMA's available-for-sale portfolio. Costs increased 1% in dollar terms and include $13 million in severance costs related to announced staff reductions and offshoring initiatives.</p>
          <p>The cost-income ratio improved to 89% in the quarter. The number of financial advisors rose again due to our targeted recruiting efforts combined with historically low attrition levels, especially among our most productive advisors.</p>
          <p>Net new money flows were positive at CHF2.6 billion despite approximately CHF1.6 billion of outflows due to the April tax season. Net new money including dividends and interest was CHF6.7 billion.</p>
          <p>This is a breakdown of the divisional operating income shown for the past six quarters in Swiss francs and in U.S. dollars. As you can see, revenues have risen fairly steadily over the past year in dollar terms. We've made progress across all major income categories, in particular, recurring fees and commission income. Net interest income has also improved partly as a result of client balances &#x2013; higher client balances and securities-based lending and mortgages. We expect to show further improvement in both of these key initiatives in future quarters.</p>
          <p>Financial advisor productivity when measured as revenue and invested assets per advisor continue to improve in dollar terms. We remain the industry leader in invested assets per advisor reflecting our focus on the high and ultra-high net worth segments. In terms of revenues per advisor, we further narrowed the gap to the industry leader.</p>
          <p>Improvements in Wealth Management Americas are quite visible and in line with our plans. And as Ossie mentioned, contrary to market rumors, this division is part of our Global Wealth Management business and is not for sale.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management delivered a profit of CHF108 million, CHF16 million lower than in the first quarter. Revenues fell 10% from the first quarter due to a significant decline in A&amp;Q performance fees as well as lower net management fees on reduced invested assets. Operating expenses fell in line with revenues.</p>
          <p>Overall gross margin declined to 32 basis points from 35 as a result of lower performance fees. The margin has been under pressure for some time due to a change in our asset mix, partly as we attract proportionately more assets into our passive strategies. Net new money inflows were CHF1.1 billion with continued strong third-party inflows.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire ING Investment Management Australia. The acquisition is expected to close in October and will further increase Global AM's presence, scale and distribution in Australia.</p>
          <p>In Global AM, only 25% of invested assets are in Swiss francs. Notwithstanding net new money inflows, the invested asset base deceased mostly due to currency effects.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, weak trading performance and low client activity led to a decline in revenues of CFH876 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. Approximately CFH400 million is attributable to debit valuation adjustments and a reduction in the contribution from residual risk positions, which are reported in other FICC revenues.</p>
          <p>As you evaluate our performance in the Investment Bank, you should not ignore currency movements as the vast majority of our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, pounds and euros. On the other hand, while our reported revenues suffer due to currency moves, our costs benefited. This mostly mitigated the overall effect on our reported pre-tax performance.</p>
          <p>We recorded a pre-tax profit excluding own credit of CHF401 million, compared with CHF719 million in the second quarter of 2010. The cost income ratio was high and the IB's cost reduction efforts are focused on reducing it.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Equities declined 23% year-on-year on a reported basis, but they were broadly flat in dollar terms. Cash Equities was impacted by currency moves and we reported 17% lower revenues. However, results improved in dollar terms as better trading revenues more than offset a decline in commissions caused by lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Derivatives and equity-linked performance was down year-on-year. While high volatility often presents opportunities for this business, markets were less volatile this quarter than a year ago. Consequently, we were not able to repeat the strong performance of the second quarter of 2010. Asia Pacific, however, posted solid performance in this business.</p>
          <p>In Prime Services, reported revenues decline slightly as the weakness of the dollar and spread compression offset increased client balances.</p>
          <p>Moving on to fixed income, approximately three-quarters of FICC revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, so all these businesses were impacted by currency movements. Our reported revenues declined close to CHF550 million with approximately CHF400 million of the decline explained by other FICC revenues, as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Our Macro business declined on a reported basis yet was broadly flat in dollar terms. Rates benefited from higher revenues in non-linear rates offset by declines in linear rates, largely driven reduced client activity.</p>
          <p>We saw fewer opportunities to capture spreads in foreign exchange this quarter compared to those presented during the exceptional market volatility of the second quarter of 2010. Reported revenues in credit decreased 14% year-over-year. We saw strong results in structured credit, which were more than offset by a declining credit flow trading in Europe.</p>
          <p>Corporate Lending revenues declined on lower loan balances and spread compression. Emerging markets revenues &#x2013; reported revenues nearly doubled. Increases were seen across all regions driven by stronger performance in foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>IBD delivered revenues before risk management charges of CHF607 million compared with CHF554 million last year, an increase of 10%. This business is predominantly dollar based and currency moves had a significant effect on reported revenues. Our reported advisory revenues increased 54% year-on-year and nearly doubled in dollar terms as we notched strong market share gains in a much improved M&amp;A environment. Financial sponsor activity increased and corporates utilized large amounts of cash on their balance sheets.</p>
          <p>We're pleased that we participated in three of the top 10 transactions that closed in the quarter in both the U.S. and Europe. Reported capital markets revenues were down 7% but grew in underlying currencies. Fixed income capital markets had a solid quarter with reported revenues up 10%, which was broadly in line with the market in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Reported ECM revenues were down 24% but almost flat in dollar terms. The Americas remains a key focus region for our Investment Banking department, and we continue to recruit and to hire talent to renew the business.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax result in the Corporate Center was a loss of CHF63 million compared to a profit of CHF116 million in the previous quarter as the first quarter benefited from higher valuation gains on our call option on the SNB StabFund. The revaluation of the options contributed CHF13 million this quarter, and the replacement value on the balance sheet totals CHF1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel II basis improved to 18.1% at the end of June. We increased our core Tier 1 capital in the second quarter by CHF1.3 billion to CHF33.1 billion mainly on net profits, and it represented 16.1% of our Basel II risk-weighted assets at quarter-end.</p>
          <p>In June, we redeemed a $500 million hybrid Tier 1 instrument. In the first quarter, we reserved for the full amount in our regulatory capital account. That's why the redemption did not negatively impact our overall capital base this quarter.</p>
          <p>We've been reporting to FINMA on a Basel 2.5 basis since the beginning of this year. On this basis, Tier 1 capital was CHF36.7 billion or 13.2% of risk-weighted assets. A strong capital position has always been very important for the success of our business. Today, our capital ratios are among the highest in the industry.</p>
          <p>As we prepare for future regulatory capital requirements and the new banking environment, we will remain prudent and we will continue to strengthen our capital position by retaining our earnings.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation on the second quarter results, and we're now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Tom. Now, we will switch over to the telephone questions first, and we will start with Jon Peace of Nomura.</p>
          <p>I would like to ask everybody on the telephone to ask one question after another and not quadruple questions where we have to then come back and ask, what do you mean exactly? Just one question after another, and if you have more than one, you will ask one question after another. Thank you, can we start with the telephone questions, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question from the telephone conference is from Mr. Jon Peace from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I've got two questions, I will ask them one after the other. The first one is with regard to your targets, you've obviously flagged you won't get to the 2009 pre-tax profit targets in the original timeframe, and I know you're probably planning a November update for the market. But is there any more color you could give us at this stage in terms of the length of the delay or the size of the miss that you anticipate net of the cost cuts? And how do you feel about some of the other targets you've got today, including the ROE and the mix of the revenues, particularly fixed income versus equities within the Investment Bank? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the overall pre-tax target, no &#x2013; the short answer is no, we can't give you any more details there than to say that we will not be able to achieve it in the given timeframe, which we gave in 2009.</p>
          <p>If you think back, when we talked about that in 2009 mainly on demand by investors who wanted to know how we see the future, and how the future has changed since then, and how the market has changed, and how the regulatory environment has changed. And therefore, I think that we see much clearer where we are going from here, not only we, where the industry is going from here, and what kind of regulatory rules are getting implemented eventually, how the world is coming together and what it means for global banks. I think it doesn't make any sense to give you more detail on that.</p>
          <p>And on the other targets, we are &#x2013; as usual talk about them, and we focus them if it has to be done on Investor Day, and there won't be any change about that. So, in November this year when we have our Investor Day, we will talk about that. Your next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And the second question was on the Wealth Management business, where despite the volatility, it's clear the recoveries are coming through. You've given us a target for gross margin but I wondered if there's any color you could give us around your thinking around net new money, the inflow rates and in particular how long it might take to converge upwards with the level of inflows seen by some of your peers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I knew that. But as you have seen from the net new assets, how they are moving from quarter to quarter still, and I think it's much too early for us to claim that we have &#x2013; that we can predict the quarterly net new assets and, let's say, are steady. We only turned the whole thing around last year, the net new asset flow and so, I think at the moment, there's no way that we can forecast that.</p>
          <p>There have been huge influences if you think on the Swiss franc, 25% in 12-months' time is quite a number, and on assets and on revenues. And I think one thing which has become obvious and is pleasing that I think the clients are trusting the bank again and that we will be able also going forward now to have net new assets on a quarterly basis. And...</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Two questions. Firstly on risk-weighted assets, I noticed that the RWAs have gone up CHF6 billion in the Investment Bank despite currency would have normally gotten down. And I'm trying to square that with the comments on the quarterly call last quarter that your intention was to remain RWAs flat. I mean, it strikes me that you're still growing the Investment Bank despite what you're telling us today about restructuring, so I'm just wondering was this a surprise? Are there some funnies in there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that question, Huw. I think what we said around the previous quarter was that we would have our RWAs roughly around the level at which we ended the quarter. At the beginning of the quarter we did take our risk up slightly in our credit positions; and as a result, we saw some higher RWAs flow through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then secondly, just going back to the cost-cutting plans CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion, if I just do back of the envelope on the first half results in the Investment Bank, to get that to a 12% pre-tax return on equity, probably 90% of the cost cuts need to come from the Investment Bank division, is there any light you can shed on how you might apportion those expenses, savings between the divisions, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Huw, we're actually &#x2013; as Ossie mentioned, we're actually just beginning that exercise and so we don't have the details on that at the moment but we will update you when we get them.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just one question. I just wanted to get a sense from you on the kind of risk-weighted asset mitigation as we go into Basel 3. So, the inflation that you have, I think, of CHF200 billion mitigation that you've outlined, I did see that you started to sell off a bit of student loan exposure. But I wanted to get your thoughts on this kind of two or three year or multi-year process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kinner. So, we're &#x2013; as you did note, we did indicate that we have reduced our student loan position by $1.3 billion. We closed the sale on the 30th of June and it settled at the middle of July. We are highly focused and in particular the way our Investment Bank's asset and liability committee meetings are run, they are focused on looking at mitigation opportunities with a particular focus on, first, Basel 2.5 and then second, Basel 3.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we had a downgrade of the U.S. from AAA to AA, would that have any material impact in terms of the valuation of those securities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would like to know as well. And we doubt it, actually, and if that would actually happen, I would certainly think, then AA is the new AAA.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Next question from Mr. Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. The first question is regarding your cost-cutting exercise. How should we think about capital release by reducing costs? Will there be also some capital release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not that we're planning on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question relates to fixed income. If I look over the last four quarters, you're either the worst pro forma in the industry globally of the top players, or you're the second worst. Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel when do you say enough is enough of underperformance and when do you take more drastic actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we are constantly, obviously, looking at our businesses and how they are performing. As you know, we have been building up fixed income in &#x2013; over the last two-and-a-half years. And clearly, we are now coming at a point where we have to say what are the chances in going forward, what kind of fixed income departments do we need actually for the rest of our operation? And because, as we said before, we do need for our Integrated Bank a fully-functioning investment banking operation, and that is all and will be in discussion, and will be announced then, hopefully to your satisfaction, at the Investor Day in November.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Considering that at the previous Investor Day, there was an indication that roughly two-thirds of the risk-weighted assets relate to fixed income, isn't it fair that the, I think, CHF30-plus billion of active equity in the IB could also reduce &#x2013; be reduced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is clearly depending on how we structure our business going forward, and if indeed, we should reduce certain areas, then we will free up capital. But the whole capital situation is under consideration because of the regulatory changes and what we have to do in the future depending on what kind of business and what kind of locations we have to subsidiarize and what kind of capital requirements that means actually at the parent company.</p>
          <p>And I think that as I said before, probably only will be absolutely clear in the middle of last year when all the different governments of the countries where we are active have made up their mind on what kind of capital requirements they will charge going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The question was on the Wealth Management pre-tax which was especially resilient. I'm trying to understand what would it have been if the Swiss franc hadn't strengthened so much? And could you say whether you hedged currency more than normal in this quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I wouldn't say that and we don't hedge the currency more than normal in that quarter. And I would think probably would be in non-Swiss franc terms probably would be something like 8% higher...</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have three questions. I'll take them one by one per your request. The first question is just to come back to the cost-cutting targets you had mentioned, and just so I'm clear in my mind, you're talking about CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion over the next one to two years. And just so I'm clear, that's versus 2010 reported costs and that's a net number, so it's any investments minus cost savings, it's a net figure? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's &#x2013; Derek, thanks for the question. It's actually CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion over the next two to three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's based on our run rate as of the end of the second quarter. And those are reductions, but we're not placing a cap on expenses. So we're taking out the expenses, but as we mentioned, we'll continue to invest away from that in the areas that we think drive our long-term strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's not a net number is what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And the second question was just coming to the equity and the tangible equity in your balance sheet. You had a nice improvement in Q2, obviously, part of that is retained earnings, but it looks like there's also about a CHF500 million positive move in the AFS, as well as a CHF400 million positive move in the cash flow hedges. And, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in these things, but is there anything in particular we should be aware of in those two? Or, I guess, I was surprised that they're both positive given currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There also, during the quarter, was a significant downward move in long-term rates or mid- to long-term rates in the U.S. which affected the AFS portfolio gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then the last question, just to come back to your tax charge. I guess the previous guidance, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but the previous guidance was that if you earned more in 2011 than you did in 2010, you'd revisit some of the assumptions behind DTA recognition. Now, you seem to be saying you could recognize additional DTAs in the second half, so I guess you don't need the 2011 net income to be above 2010. I guess I'm hoping you can give us some more color on what would drive the decision to recognize additional DTAs in the second half and probably more importantly what order of magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Derek, what we'll do is, as we go through our annual process in reassessing the DTAs, it also falls in line with our annual planning process which includes a look at our five-year plans. We'll take a look at those numbers and assess what we should do with the DTAs. The best guidance that we can give you right now is that we believe that if we were to revalue those DTAs in the second half of the year that our full-year tax rate could be below 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, from Mr. Christopher Wheeler from Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning everybody. The question is on slide 23, on the Investment Banking revenues, where you're quite upbeat. I suppose the question I really have is trying to get my head around the true impact of the dollar weakness. Because if we look at the overall numbers, you're obviously down about 12% Q-on-Q and about 14% on the second half of last year, and that looks pretty weak compared to your U.S. competitors, although, perhaps less so certainly in terms of this quarter on Deutsche Bank. But particularly advisory, that seems to be more than just dollar weakness, so could you comment again on what impact do you think the issues you've had in the last few years are now having on some of your investment banking activities and whether you are having to sort of fight back to regain, if you want, your reputation in those areas?</p>
          <p>And secondly, perhaps share with us how much of the revenues from investment banking are actually in dollars so we can get a feel for that because you obviously do talk about how important the U.S. is to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Christopher. What I would do in terms of the overall impact, as I mentioned earlier, the dollar versus the Swiss franc was down 23% year-on-year and 8% on the quarter. I think you're referring specifically to FICC revenues &#x2013; to IBD, sorry, it was the IBD slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On IBD basis, it's actually quite a substantial effect. It's probably in the range of 65-ish percent in terms of revenues on a dollar basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, are you concerned about still on particularly on advisory, was this just the fact that deals that closed in the period, there weren't as many perhaps as some of your competitors, because that does seem to have gone beyond just the dollar weakness?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that our performance actually looked &#x2013; as I mentioned before, we were in the three of the top ten deals in the U.S., three of the top ten deals in Europe, and we were slightly weaker in the quarter based on the closings in APAC than we would normally be, but we don't consider that to be an indication of a trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jernej here from Goldman Sachs. Can I ask &#x2013; the first question is to what proportion of the net new money was attributable to Lombard loans this quarter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, roughly around CHF300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, essentially of the CHF 5.5 billion, virtually nothing, CHF300 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. And then I wanted to ask just one more question, which is on your comments on the Investment Bank and how a business like UBS requires a fully-functioning investment bank, etcetera. Can I just ask the following: what do you estimate is the proportion of your Investment Bank that is directly related to supporting your Private Banking business and your Wealth Management business, i.e., what is that &#x2013; I'll just leave it there, I guess it's the best. So, what's the proportion of the Investment Bank that is directly supporting the private bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the question is in what portion of what? How do you measure that if you measure it in what they are doing actually, and there are very few business we are doing in investment banking which are not related to the rest of the bank. But certainly, you can be bigger or smaller in certain businesses. And I would think probably from the size, I would purely guess it's something like 50%-plus is very much related to the rest of the bank and mainly to our Wealth Management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's all the flow business, it's very clearly execution. It's all the capital market business, being debt capital market or equity capital market, it is the advisory business very clearly, because, otherwise, when the capital markets and my big question is what kind of trading operation, what kind of size would you need to support our Wealth Management and Asset Management around the world. And so, I think in the end, it comes down to 50% to 75% probably would be needed to keep our Wealth Management going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Matthew Clark, KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions, as well. To start off with &#x2013; on the cost cuts, I understand that you haven't worked out the details yet. I'm just wondering what the kind of ethos behind them will be? Are you scaling back some of your growth and expansion initiatives or the areas that you had hoped would be viable and you hired into, et cetera, post-crisis that you are now getting rid of, or is this more just an efficiency drive, tightening-the-belt across the board? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is firstly an efficiency drive. We have to recognize that, as I mentioned several times before and in the last few quarters, that the markets have changed considerably since the middle of last year which is witnessed by the returns on capital in the industry as a whole. And we are not immune against that. Now, within my management and I, we came to the conclusion that this trend will not very quickly change. And therefore, we have to adjust to that kind of market environment which we are facing now.</p>
          <p>On top of it, clearly you have constantly technical improvements throughout the company and that has to be taken care of. So, it is not the CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion which we said is not on top of what we would have done anyway. It is included in that part are certain efficiency gains which we would have done anyway in the next two to three years. But we believe to get the returns to our shareholders in a reasonable percentage range that that is necessary and that we have to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then next question just on dividends, I think Mr. Naratil commented on the tape not to expect dividends for the foreseeable future. Just wondering how you see that &#x2013; what trigger has to be met before you would restart the dividend? Do you have to get to the 13% on a Basel III basis or would you restart the dividend if you were heading in the right direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. When we achieve our capital requirements, then we certainly would be the first and also to say that we start paying dividends again. But after what that bank went through in the last few years, you can appreciate that we clearly want to make sure and we also have to make sure to regain our reputation that we are at the forefront of capital requirements; that we are not lagging behind any other bank. And as you have seen on the chart today, very clearly, how we improved our capital quarter by quarter, and we will do that until we reach the requirements of &#x2013; the regulatory requirements. And then, believe me, we'll be the first to pay a dividend again to our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then final question is just on how you think risk management performed during the quarter because your risk-weighted assets were up, your VaR was &#x2013; average VaR was up at the first quarter both segmentarily and dollar terms and yet you saw quite a steep fall in credit trading in particular. I'm just wondering whether you felt that you were well positioned for the disruption or whether there are some regrettable losses buried in that FICC result?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, afterwards, one always can say we could have done something better. But as you see, in credit trading, revenues declined substantially due to the spread widening. And, yes, we could have argued we probably should have had a smaller position there. Overall, I think our risk management performed very well. And we have no undue risk in our positions in credit trading, probably it was a timing mistake, so to speak, by trading, but otherwise, I'm pretty convinced that we have one of the best risk management in the industry.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. I have just one simple question. I was wondering if you could help me join the dots on page 11 of the report on the FX impact to the results. My question is excluding short-term hedges and based on the second quarter P&amp;L, can you give any color on what the mix of group costs and revenues are by Swiss franc, dollars and euros if possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'd suggest, Cormac, is that &#x2013; I don't have the exact details rolled up since I've done them business division by business division, but we'll follow up with you on that question.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, and let's finish the telephone questioning. Now, we go over here to the room, and you can ask questions in English, in German and we try to translate to any other language. Please go ahead. Are there any questions here? Yes.</p>

          <p>Kilian Maier, Mainfirst. Short question on net new assets; if I calculate the net new assets of the Retail and Corporate division, which I didn't see in the paper, that would be a small negative number, is that correct? And what was the reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. There was a small negative number, I think, negative CHF600 million. We don't consider that to be particularly noteworthy. There were some adjustments during the quarter, but we believe that in all of our Wealth and Asset Management businesses that our long-term positive net new money trends are still intact.</p>
