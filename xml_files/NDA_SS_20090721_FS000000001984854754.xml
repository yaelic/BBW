        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and welcome to this press meeting. My main headline today is that the strong performance continues. And this is the snapshot of the results: Income is up 4%; expense is up 2%. And that gap between income and cost has gone on for a long time. And as you can see that compared from the first half year it's up 13% and the quarter, on the quarter last year it's up 14%.</p>
          <p>Loan losses are expected according to our expectations with 57 basis points. Risk adjusted profit is up significantly, and the capital base is well above targets.</p>
          <p>We also have the numbers, if you want to see them, they are here. You already read the report. You can see the blue boxes, which indicates that total income, profit before loan losses and risk adjusted profit are all at record levels, and it's very pleasing to see this performance. Even net profit is very close, after loan losses, to be at that same level. On the red boxes, you can also see the gap between income and costs, both, this quarter compared to Q2 last year and on the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The total operating income is, as I said, up 4%. It's up 18% on the same quarter last year. It's new record level. The performance is according to our strategic plans and it reflects that we have a continued momentum in customer areas.</p>
          <p>Looking at a bit longer horizon, we can see since Q1 '06 that we had 10% average growth rate in income. It's very pleasing to see, you may remember that we launched our long-term target in '06. It shows that we have executed on our strategies presented then. It shows that we have robust business model this period. It reflects an upturn in the economy and certainly a downturn at the same time. And it also shows that we have captured the potential in our customer base, very pleasing to see that.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on our cost management, expenses are developing inline with our outlook. Total expenses is up 2%, there are some Fx effects, so the underlying cost growth is approximately 6% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Cost to income ratio is down to 47% and the number of employees is down 1.5%. You may remember that we said that during the year we'd manage the number of people down through our efficiency projects, during the year of approximately 2% and we are closing in on that target.</p>
          <p>Profit before loan losses is up 5% and it's up 35% quarter-on-quarter. Again the strong income is, of course, an important driver. This amount is important. It's a huge amount and it can absorb all the loan losses we see. All the stress test which have been performed on the day, both our own, those by the authorities &#x2013; various authorities, both, on country level and EU level shows that we clearly have the earnings capability to absorb the loan losses, which could come even in the worst of the stress tests.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses is inline with the outlook statement. It's 425 million, and excluding a legal claim which relates to the old Swiss Air estate back from 2001 which has nothing to do with the present situation and the present downturn, it's actually 57 basis points, and it's broadly inline with Q1 and what we have expected for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Danish currency scheme, it's 50 basis points and of these 50 basis points, 17 basis points are collective provisions, which is up from 11 basis points in Q1.</p>
          <p>The loan losses are still coming from a large number of smaller and medium-sized exposures and not from a few large. It's also well diversified through sectors and it is also worth noting that approximately 10% of these loan losses are actually write-offs. 90% are provisions for expected losses going forward. I come back to loan losses.</p>
          <p>Net interest income, to go a bit more in detail, is holding up well despite the pressure on deposit margins. It's minus 4% in the quarter. The pressure on deposit margins has a significant impact on Nordea. As we reported in Q1 it was a level of minus 180, but it seems that that impact is leveling off and it's minus 60 in Q2.</p>
          <p>Obviously it's leveling off, and we will not see further impact of that because interest rates have now gone down to a level where this adjustment has been made. We maintain or improve the market shares on both household and corporate deposits in this period.</p>
          <p>On corporate customers, you can see lending growth is very limited in this half year. The main reason is actually that a number of our large corporate customers have actually funded themselves on the capital markets. This slide shows that we have a significant increase in the amount of capital provided through the debt capital markets in this quarter.</p>
          <p>So you can say that the companies &#x2013; the corporates' need for working capital is actually coming down, so the credit utilization is low. They are working their way through the downturn in a classical way, where they reduce working capital. But they require &#x2013; their long-term funding requirement is to a last degree coming from the debt capital markets, and we have had a lead position in a large number of these issues, and we are very happy about that.</p>
          <p>So you can say in general, the activity on the corporate area has been extremely big and we have had a very strong development in our relationship with these corporate customers which I will come back to.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission income is up 8% and it's breaking the negative trend. It's very much related to the assets under management area, which is up 9%. We have a strong inflow also of new assets of another 9% and in general we think the trend has broken. Our customers are now investing more money into funds and other vehicles rather than putting their money on time deposits.</p>
          <p>Payment and commission income is also up. And we have to note that the reason why the level is lower than last year is in particular that we have the commission expenses for state programs particularly in Denmark but also in Sweden.</p>
          <p>Net gains/losses is up 15% from the record level posted in Q1. It's very much explained by our corporate strategy, as I said we had moved closer to our corporate customers. We have a huge need for the balance sheet management advice we give, risk management advice which have created a large activity both within fixed income, FX and equities and it is very much customer driven. As you can see we also had a strong result in Group Treasury in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Economies are contracting and it's affecting our loan portfolio obviously. Our impaired loans are up 19%. Please note that 55% of the impaired loans are still performing. And the largest increases are in the consumer area and shipping, offshore, but as I said there is no single area which is sticking out.</p>
          <p>Allowances increased 20%. It corresponds as I said to the 57 basis points of total lending. Collective provisions account for &#x2013; is up 37% and account for the 34%. Provisioning ratio is now 49% and is slightly up from Q1.</p>
          <p>Loan losses has to be seen in the larger context, so when we say loan losses develop as expected it has to be seen in the context of the credit policy and the credit risk levels, which we set out since 2002. That level is expressed as an expected loss over a cycle. So, you can say our credit models express that credit policy which we have adhered to since 2002, as a 25 basis points expected loss are calculated right now over the cycle.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on the slide behind me that we have during this period had large swings in this area. Actually in the beginning, we had loan losses coming up to the 25 basis points, then we had many half years, you can say with positive loan losses, very few loans losses and reversals and now since second half last year, where we actually just passed the 25 basis points, and now at the 57 basis points.</p>
          <p>Nothing indicates that this does not hold. This credit policy is working well and is developing according to expectations. So, in the longer run over the cycle, we still expect that this level will hold through. Of course, it's very difficult to forecast what it will be in each individual quarter. Actually it is impossible. But as I said, the quality and the levels we experience right now is very much in accordance to our expectation.</p>
          <p>And this is very important because this is a part of the foundation of Nordea. We have built in Nordea with a very strict credit policy, with a very clear guidelines, very clear ways from how to grand credits in all the areas we are in and this has resulted in a development which we &#x2013; when I say according to expectations is exactly according to the credit model we are running.</p>
          <p>Another way to express the credit portfolio is the way I also did &#x2013; last quarter, we have an area of the portfolio which is low risk, the green one, which is nearly half of the whole portfolio. Here we are experiencing very low loan losses expecting according to our plans.</p>
          <p>The medium risk, the typical corporate exposure in the Nordic area is also developing as expected also with low loan losses, but of course with the number of impairments. And then we have the special attention areas, the areas which we focus on, which you also focus on by the way, which are the areas where we can expect somewhat higher loan losses.</p>
          <p>On average this is going to deliver the 25 basis points of loan losses over the cycle. I would like to give a few comments on some of the particular areas of the special attention pie and one area which is often discussed it's a private equity area. It's 3% of our lending. It's a well-diversified portfolio.</p>
          <p>We have very &#x2013; most of the exposure is towards senior debt and we can say that we are posting modest loan loss provisions in Q2 in this area. We have made several restructurings in the quarter and they have been performing successfully, and this is developing according to our expectations.</p>
          <p>Shipping and offshore is 4% of our lending. It's well collateralized. They are well diversified. We have seen some developments in this half year, where the bulk market has stabilized, but the tank market has come down somewhat.</p>
          <p>We have very few problem cases. Again, we are restructuring a number of commitments. The impaired loan &#x2013; impaired loan levels have gone up to 184 basis points that is still according to our expectations we have given out previously.</p>
          <p>Commercial real estate is 7% of lending. It's very highly collateralized and it's actually performing quite well. It's not an area that is producing loan losses right now. It may come in later in the cycle depending on the development.</p>
          <p>And then the famous Baltic exposure 3% of lending. We have increased loan losses. We have increased impairments, but again, it is inline with our expectations and I'd like to comment a bit more on our Baltic portfolio.</p>
          <p>It is a portfolio of relatively good quality. We have developed it through organic growth. We have established branches. We have taken in customer-by-customer focused on their top segments and that is clearly something we can see in the present environment.</p>
          <p>We have had the same straight credit policy as I mentioned before in the Nordic area and the Baltic's with the same ways we have entered credits and as the same terms and conditions. The loan losses annualized in to two is 214 basis points. Impairments have gone up to 550 basis points and our coverage ratio is now 48% with a strong collateral exposure.</p>
          <p>One important part when we analyze this is not to take the whole portfolio. If we look at the slide behind me you can see that the corporate portfolio is split up in what we call a low risk areas and higher risk. And in general our Nordic exposure, our Nordic companies in the Baltic's is a blue one which is around 20%.</p>
          <p>The red one is large companies, which are listed and where we track very well where risk is low. It's not a main issue. The yellow one is the medium and small, and the green one is the medium and small companies, and that's typically where we see the large loan losses in a downturn. This represents only &#x20AC;1.7 billion of our loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>So when we look at loan losses we have to take care that we actually also analyze which part of the portfolio will produce the loan losses. And as you can see from this number that even very high provisions on the 1.7 billion is easily covered by the provision level we have today of more than &#x20AC;200 million. Actually the 1.7 is only 0.6% of total lending, and therefore, these loss ratios and provision ratios should be clearly viewed in light of that.</p>
          <p>So the general comment on the Baltics is that the area is developing according to our expectation. They are in a very severe recession. We are following it very closely. We're working with it very hard. And I'm sure, we're going to see some more loan losses going forward, but we also believe, it's going to develop according to these expectations.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong capital position. We are one of the strongest capitalized banks in Europe. We had it as a very important part of our middle-of-the-road strategy to strengthen our capital base. We did that in March by the rights issue, and now we have a core Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, which is high; total capital ratio of 11.2.</p>
          <p>We also have a very competitive funding position. We are one of the highest rated banks in Europe with the lowest CDS spreads. We have created a liquidity buffer of &#x20AC;48 billion that covers our liquidity need for more than one year, if that was needed. And we have a very good demand for our issuance.</p>
          <p>So, as you can see in the first half year, where funding markets have been difficult, we have actually increased our long-term funding compared to previous years, both, on covered bonds and senior unsecured issues. Of course, we have higher prices on our funding, so the average funding costs have gone up, but availability has been very good. And we also think, on relative terms, we have funded ourselves on very attractive terms.</p>
          <p>A few comments on the long-term targets, which you remember we issued in late 2006. The most important was this one on risk adjusted profit. And you may remember we said we wanted to double risk adjusted profit in seven years. The reason for the seven years was that we wanted to reflect the performance long-term over a full business cycle.</p>
          <p>Now, we didn't know in 2006/'07 that we actually would hit a business cycle like the one we have done. And therefore, I think, it's very satisfying to see that we are clearly above the line. The red line is the 10% growth line, which reflects the doubling in seven years. And as you can see we have moved, in the beginning, ahead of the line, then we were for a few quarters somewhat below, and now we are clearly above. So we are delivering according to our long-term target and we are even somewhat ahead of the targets now when we are 2.5 years into this period.</p>
          <p>The other long-term target we set out was to be in top quartile of total shareholder return compared to our European peers. And this is the period, since 1st of January 2007, when we started this target 2.5 years ago. And as you can see we are number one among European banks in total shareholder return. Even in this first half year after this long-term performance, we are also among the top performers in the first half year on total shareholder return.</p>
          <p>So despite the turbulent times, the journey towards a great Nordea continues. Our long-term strategy, which you may remember, was built on four pillars: the strong foundation we have built since 2002, the focus on risk management, capital management and cost. We set up the ambitious targets, which I mentioned, and the clear growth strategy, which I have also mentioned. And then, our strong customer-centric culture and values; which are actually more important now than ever. We are moving closer to customers, I'm going to demonstrate that in a few moments.</p>
          <p>But we have the challenging market conditions, which you all know about. The weak economic activity. We see some signs of recovery but the economic development is uncertain. And it's for sure that we're going to see a difficult second half year with increasing unemployment and a large number of smaller corporates still struggling to get their hands on the situation.</p>
          <p>We see rating migration, we see increased risk of loan losses and increased funding cost and the higher capital requirements I mentioned. Therefore we have already, since the end of last year, adjusted the short-term strategy to what we call the middle-of-the-road. I spent quite a few remarks on that on my last presentation. But still I want to remind you that we want to keep this positive momentum, the line we have created, the income momentum and the momentum with new customers, and we want to be loyal to this strategy. We don't want to change the strategy. We want to get back to the strategy when the economic environment change again.</p>
          <p>And we also want to reduce customer uncertainty, so we are moving closer to the customers. And the message is that the yesses and noes we are seeing these days are going to remembered by customers for decades. So we are very careful to help the customer through their problems right now. And to be early out to discuss with the customers what they should do to adjust to the situation and try to help them through.</p>
          <p>We're staying very focused on risk management. It is the key focus, of course, for a bank these days, and we want to continue to be prudent on this; and to be able to accelerate out of the crisis. We have the capital base for it. We have our growth strategies in place and to accelerate when we see that the economic visibility gets better is the target.</p>
          <p>So the long-term strategy is unchanged and this is just reflecting the same message, the middle-of-the-road in our strategy matrix which I have presented on every single meeting since the end of 2006 year, where we want to focus on core and healthy new household customers. We want to support our corporate customers and financial customers. And we will step up the risk management together with them, and we will also secure that we make sure that our margins reflect the risk on each and every segment.</p>
          <p>We have managed exposures in shipping and New European markets and we continue our efficiency improvements, as already mentioned, and our risk management processes.</p>
          <p>This strategy is based on the robustness of our business model; I will not go through this in detail. But this customer-centric business model we have is showing its value these days. We have the large customer base. It's well diversified, and we are focusing on our key segments. We have a very low earnings volatility. You saw the line. It's more or less a straight line. And we have a solid asset quality. We are well diversified among markets.</p>
          <p>So we could say that the Nordea business model is viable long-term. It has been reconfirmed these days. Many banks in Europe I talk to are looking at how to change their business model, how to maneuver in the future. We can just say that it's clear that it has been reconfirmed that this type of business model is the one that's going to succeed going forward. So we will focus even more on executing on this model.</p>
          <p>And a very important part of it all is, of course, as I already said, the close relationship with our customers. And we are building these relationships these days. Our stability and our performance, of course, is positive in view of the customers. So we're attracting new customers. We have a record level of customer meetings. We have new advisers. All-in-all we are moving very close to the customers, and it's a very strong and committed job being done by our staff right now.</p>
          <p>In private banking, we see a strong inflow. The inflow of new assets is up 9% in Q2, and we see a number of new customers. On the corporate side, we are clearly moving closer to a large number of corporates. They are also moving closer to us you can say, and in new European markets we also gained a number of customers.</p>
          <p>All-in-all we are actually gaining around 10,000 new gold customers every month. And in the first half of this year, we actually got 40,000 new customers from the market, which have never been part of Nordea &#x2013; never been a Nordea customer before. So this is actually very positive that we see customers react to the strong position of Nordea.</p>
          <p>On the corporate side, we have attracted 1,500 new customers on the largest segments. Now it may not sound like a very big number, but in the Nordic area to attract 1,500 customers in the large and the merchant banking segment is in our view a very good performance. In addition to that we have moved a lot closer to a number of customers we already have, both, on risk management and balance sheet management, and these things, which are reflected in our net gains losses.</p>
          <p>So with this foundation we can hold a steady cost, continue to support our customers. We'll grow the share wallet with our key segments. We will selectively capture the new business opportunities, which we have done, and continue to do that. And we'll make sure that the corporate margins reflect the risk and the liquidity premiums in the market. We've already done that, but we are continuing also to re-price some of the old credits. And the prudent risk in capital management is, of course, key in this environment.</p>
          <p>On the outlook, we have changed slightly. We're now saying risk-adjusted profit will be higher this year than last year. It's quite obvious it was up close to 40% in the first half of the year. Cost growth is expected to be slightly lower that's unchanged. And then we are saying that there is a risk that we will see somewhat higher loan losses in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And the reason for that is that even though we now see signs that the drop in economic activities sort of leveling out, some positive signs it is also clear the historic drop we saw in GDP in the first quarter of this year, have never been seen before. And that is now rolling through the economy. And we don't know exactly what impact that will; we just know we haven't seen the full impact yet.</p>
          <p>We will see unemployment going up. We will see a number of corporates being struggling with adjusting to the new environment. So exactly how that filter through the economy into our loan book and exactly what happens quarter-by-quarter is extremely difficult to forecast.</p>
          <p>So, even though we see the positive signs we like to say that the risk is still out there. And it is difficult to forecast this quarter-by-quarter. And the tax rate is expected to be unchanged at 25%.</p>
          <p>So, the concluding remarks and the summing up; record performance in second quarter on total income, profit before loan losses and on risk-adjusted profit. The key financial target is even above our long-term targets in the middle of this downturn. We are strengthening our customer relationships and getting new customer both on household and corporate.</p>
          <p>We hold a high operational efficiency, expressed by the gap between income and cost. And the current credit situation is solid. Loan losses are developing according to our expectations and whilst in the first quarter are broadly in line with the outlook we gave in the beginning of the year. And as I said risk-adjusted profit is up 40% in Q2 over Q2 which we think is quite amazing.</p>
          <p>So, this was my presentation. And we will now be able to &#x2013; hopefully be able to answer some of your questions. And Fredrik and Carl-Johan will join me here on the podium.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Magnus Andersson at ABG Sundal Collier. I was just wondering, when I look at your corporate lending margins in the Nordic banking division they are between 30 and 60 basis points year-on-year, although, there are some differences between the countries, do you think that you can get the corporate lending margins in Sweden and Finland up to the levels of the Denmark or Norway even in this cycle? And regarding the latitude countries Denmark and Norway have we seen most of the re-pricing in the margins we have here in Q2 or is some more to be done also there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can say what has happened is we established a new margin level reflecting the capital we need and the funding cost and that has been done already towards the end of last year. And all new lending is done at those margins and old lending is when it's renewed re-priced at those margins and that is happening in good order. Depending on the documentation in each country, the tradition how you document loans and how its working it takes more or less time. And a lot of things have already happened in Denmark and Norway and whereas it's still ongoing in Sweden and Finland and we expect that development to continue, do you have anything more, Fredrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, it's difficult of course to compare the different levels in the countries, Finland of course and Sweden to some extent has been slower than Denmark and particularly Norway. But we still believe there is an upside yet in both Finland and Sweden.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you are on 110 basis points do you think that you could reach something like 160 having done in a quarter or even more than that in this cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not giving any specific forecast for any &#x2013; for the countries. As I said, we still believe there is potential, both in Finland and Sweden. Although that is a slower process than it has been re-pricing wise in Denmark and particularly in Norway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, could you say something on the sustainability on your client related trading income that you did not think would reach the same in level in Q2 as in Q1 although it did?</p>

          <p>Yeah. It's part of our corporate strategy. I've explained it since two years that that what's exactly what we wanted to achieve. Now, the markets have been very favorable in this period and activity has been extremely high. We actually think the activity level will stay rather high on this area, because it is not only because of this downturn its also a large number of corporates and not in the absolute top segment but in the next segment that start actively to manage the balance sheet and their risks.</p>
          <p>So that is ongoing. And we are growing that business and we are growing the number of people in it. So we can handle a lot much larger number of corporates. So in that sense, it will continue, but the very favorable market conditions, it's difficult to say whether they will continue or not, of course, so we had two exceptionally good quarters there.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Peter Grabe at Handelsbanken. This is a question regarding the Baltic reserve ratio. How should we look at this? How much attention do you put to the reserve ratio in the Baltic internally? And also, I mean it's down to 48 basis points from 62 basis points, what should we expect going forward in terms of the reserve ratio in the Baltics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have a target for the reserve ratio because individual cases are dealt with as they come through. We started off by making a fairly large general provision as you remember, 18 months ago. And we have increased that over time, while we are now seeing concrete cases coming forward, which we then provide according to the cash flow forecast that we see, and the collaterals that we have. So I think that this level is still comfortable. It is very much depending on what kind of clientele you have. If you have security on that security, a bigger part of the trouble part is related to real estate and even if the prices have gone down, say you have 48% coverage, means that you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Half the price is then expected to come forward. So, I think we feel fairly comfortable there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you split this way between the countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, these are underlying statistics about where it comes from. Overall as you have seen the Latvian economy is the one where we have the biggest problems as most banks do, while Estonia is actually doing pretty well, and also their collateral values have upheld better than for instance in Latvia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that did you want to &#x2013; I think we have a gentleman up front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two separate questions. First of all, you have now normalized loan-loss levels, 25 basis points you have communicated, earlier you communicated 17% &#x2013; basis points and that's a 50% increase. What has changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While the expected loss as we used in the economic capital model is based on the rating of the portfolio which has changed over this period. So there will be a slight movement in that expected loss ratio over the cycle not as much as in the credit losses, because as we've seen they have been going from minus to &#x2013; minus 25 to plus 50. But there will be always, according to the model, a slight change in the expected loss based on the rating migration. And that's what you see in the increase from 17 to 25 basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can add, there is one more thing I guess it is the inclusion of the retail portfolio, if you recall we also included the retail portfolio in IRB in December of last year. And that also had a part of that change. So it's a part of the change to it from 17 to 23 is actually that inclusion. So it's a calculation you can say. So, migration is only a part of that shift from 17 to 25. So &#x2013; yeah, those are the two explanations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a completely separate, you talked about ten restructuring cases completed in private equity in the past quarter, I guess. Could you say a little bit in general themes on how this restructuring have gone about. I mean debt to equity swaps, write-down of mezzanine funding, what's been the general theme here? And how &#x2013; what have you booked your shares that you received at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the classical way which I will say the majority of the cases have been handled there according to &#x2013; is that there is some new equity from the original investor, there is some conversion of debt to equity or to subordinated loan. Usually there is a wipe out of the mezzanine totally. And how we evaluate then the part of equity that we would have in that case, is then depending on the case, of course, not held at original value. But not necessarily held at zero because if we believe in the case, if the equity investor believe in the future of company, of course there's a value to that. But the write-down is basically taken in relation to the conversion that we make from debt to equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much leeway do you on the value of those shares? Because there's another bank not too far away that said they were participating in two restructurings and booked the shares at zero value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also had cases where we had booked them at zero. It depends on the case, as I say, how, let's say, strongly the company is capitalized and thereby what is the actual equity value for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you actually think the value is zero, why participate in the restructuring at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because only part of the loan is converted. The major part is still there performing fully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One on the personnel reduction, you've already achieved 1.5% of the two. How do you view the potential of actually cutting more than the 2% that you had as a target, let's say, in 12 months time? And also, if we look to the loan-loss outlook, obviously the Baltic has performed worse than expected three months ago, but are there any other areas which you would like to point out, which has performed worse and where the risk has clearly increased compared to what you thought three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the reduction of people, as part of the middle-of-the-road strategy we are performing now, we said we will accelerate efficiency programs, which would reduce by 2%. So, that's the decision we have taken. Of course, we can do more if we want to. But right now, the important thing is that our momentum is extremely high. We have more activity than ever. We have more customers in the bank, and we are very busy, because a lot of the customers are having some problems. So, it's not the time to make across the board cost cutting, that's not our decision.</p>
          <p>Our decision is we will continue to make the bank more efficient and we are stepping on with that, and we will develop more efficiency programs running. So, I think this will be in continuation of what we have been doing, actually over several years, this is a number we have actually done year-by-year and I think we will continue that. So, it's an important difference between across the board cost cutting, because you are panicking or accelerating some cost efficiency programs where you simply improve the efficiency of the bank, and that's what we have decided to do. So depending on the economic development, this is our plan, and this will, of course, be adjusted going forward during the autumn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take the second part. I think what Christian said is very much the way that we think that it is the general economic recession that is the unknown factor and it will hurt the business life in all our markets, Baltics as well as the domestic markets. Maybe so far in addition to the Baltic development has been very much in line with the way we have anticipated, maybe the severeness in Denmark up to-date has been a little bit higher than we thought.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I think there are signs that maybe that is leveling out now, and maybe with some room for some deterioration in the other Nordic markets. But it's very difficult to say and what is the country, what is the industry, and what is the timing. So, that's why we have to be pretty vague in this, but I think we wanted just to flag for the fact that that the economic downturn has been more severe than we thought when we gave the previous outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can see no new areas of concern have developed, so we have no warning flags out there. Everything is more or less according to plans. Obviously, Latvia is a more severe recession than we anticipated and so on. But in general terms, we are very close to what the anticipation was previously and there are no warning flags popping out as we see it. So that's a general observation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions first on costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I remind you to state your name and where you come from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Jan Wolter at Deutsche Bank. So on costs, you just say that the cost growth in 2009 will be slightly lower than '08. What in your world was the cost growth then in 2008 just so we have the reference point there? So, that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Approximately 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And the second question is when we look at lending growth in corporate and retail, what is your own thoughts on the demand for new credit, first in corporate and then in retail, if you look at in the Nordics, since it seems like it's slowing down, at least on a corporate side, and your expectation there? And the third question is most banks, we hear, talk about Estonia as a bit better than the other two Baltic countries. What in your world is the objective reason or evidence for that? What do you see in Estonia, which would make it better? Because when we look at it, the GDP contractions are just as severe, unemployment is pretty much exactly the same in all three countries. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you will start Fredrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe on the lending growth, as you've seen from our numbers, of course, household lending continues to expand and that goes also, of course, for mortgage lending, perhaps on the back of, of course, the low interest rates that we see. Corporate lending, Christian mentioned it very well. In this part of the cycle you see corporate customers, of course, being very mindful of their working capital, the investment levels are typically lower as visibility is low going forward, of course. So, we see a general reduction in demand in this part of the cycle.</p>
          <p>So again, a slight &#x2013; although I think it's hard to draw any specific conclusions just from an individual quarter, we have a slight decline in the corporate lending in the quarter. It's difficult maybe to draw a conclusion. But, of course, as a consequence of the general economic climate, corporate lending is slightly lower and, of course, that may continue for some time going forward. So, I think that's the short version.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Estonia, of course, the Baltics are in some way related in that, there is a common problem, and that is the extreme growth that happens in too short a time. But that growth was actually spread over a much longer period in Estonia. Estonia was the first country to start developing. I can remember when we opened the bank there already in 1995 that there was a sort of &#x2013; they were more far ahead of Latvia and Lithuania. So, I think as well that the bubble that particularly Latvia built up was never sort of peak like that. It was more a constant, more sustained development, and I think we can see that.</p>
          <p>Also, the state deficit in Estonia is non-existent. I mean the state is debt-free. Of course they have a lot of foreign debt, but that is all in the economy as such. And also thirdly, it's a smaller country with more homogenous political sort of consensus, which mean it is more &#x2013; it's easier to manage the crisis in that country than in Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I think we'll have the last question before we spilt up the meeting up. And where is the power in the microphone? There it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering if you could give us some flavor on how you reason around the Group coverage ratio going forward. And a couple of the other banks have allowed themselves to elaborate a bit on this now in this report season. And just another one, a short question if you have the possibility, also the somewhat higher loan-loss ratio for the second half, I suspect that you don't want to get any clearer than that. But if you do, I would be very interested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can take the first one, and then maybe Carl-Johan can elaborate, because, of course, we don't want to say more about it. I said it quite accurately in my presentation is, it's not possible to forecast the loan-loss levels and the provisions quarter-by-quarter, because the unknowns are too big. So, we just say that the risk has gone up that it could be somewhat higher. That's the flagging we're doing.</p>
          <p>And it's also because a lot of the comments I see focus very much on the positive signs we see in the economy right now. Those positive signs are suggesting that the freefall has stopped and the economy is leveling out, so it's not falling anymore, which is, of course, very positive. But we have to remember that the drop in activity is historic &#x2013; of historic proportions and that is not just done in one quarter; that will continue to filter through the economy. Smaller companies will have problems, people will be laid off, and so on, and we will see employment peaking, maybe not even at the end of the year, maybe into next year.</p>
          <p>That effect we will see in the coming half year, and exactly how that will filter through in our reporting each quarter is very difficult to say. So, we are saying there is a risk that there will be a quarter where it is somewhat higher and that's it, and no magnitudes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the coverage ratio, again, we don't have a target for that. It is very much dependent on the portfolio we have. I think one indication of how we look at this and why we feel confident as well is that 30% of that is in collective reserves, which means that they have &#x2013; we have a reserve for not yet identified individual cases. And that is sort of a buffer as well for the individual cases that may come through. So, we feel that this is in a level that we are happy with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. And then I suggest that the journalists come with us over to that part of the room and this meeting can continue here. Thank you.</p>
