      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. In February of this year I set out our targets for 2013. At our Investor Day in June, we gave you more detail about how we intend to reach them. We are now six months in and the results we are reporting today represent the first stage on that journey. They show that we are making clear progress. Chris will take you through the numbers in detail, but before he does, I would like to discuss the results in the context of the four execution priorities I laid out in February, capital, returns, income growth and citizenship.</p>
          <p>Let me start with capital. We increased our core Tier 1 ratio from 10.8% to 11% during the first half. This is a result of our ability to generate and retain earnings despite making a billion pound provision for payment protection insurance. As you know, we have agreed to settle all PPI claims as quickly as possible. This was the right thing to do for our customers. We are giving numbers today that exclude that one-off provision, as well as owned credit gains. By doing this, we aim to give you a better understanding of the business performance on an underlying and ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>Of course, we recognize that there are concerns about Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. So we have also given you a detailed and transparent breakdown of our assets in these markets. Chris will take you through these later, but it is important to understand these exposures in terms of the businesses they relate to, the nature of the risk, and how we manage that risk. The majority of the assets relate to our retail and corporate banking businesses in Spain, Italy and Portugal. About half of them are mortgages, mainly on first homes with low loans-to-value. These are not speculative positions and we are managing the risks carefully.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to talk about returns. Despite the fact that we are just six months into our journey and we still have a long way to go, there are signs of good progress when you look at the underlying numbers. You will be aware that we are operating in a challenging environment and that we continue to run with high levels of capital, notwithstanding that our return on equity rose from 6.9% to 9.1%. Our return on tangible equity increased to 10.9%.</p>
          <p>I told you at the Investor Day about our three world class businesses, businesses that operate in the very top tier of their industry, businesses that have scale, technology, brand, customer depth and customer breadth. Our Retail and Business bank in the U.K., our Global Cards business and our Investment Banking business all delivered a high return on equity.</p>
          <p>As you know, we apply a core Tier 1 ratio of 10% to all of our businesses. U.K. Retail Banking reported a return on equity of 15%, at Barclaycard it was 16% and Barclays Capital generated a return of 15%, despite a soft trading environment for fixed income currencies and commodities. Taken together, these businesses account for two-thirds of our risk-weighted assets, two-thirds of our capital. Our two businesses that have the potential to become top tier are Wealth and Africa. I'll talk later about these under income growth. Both show continued progress.</p>
          <p>Then there are two businesses where we have some serious work to do, Corporate Banking, particularly outside the U.K. and Ireland and Retail and Business Banking in Europe. Barclays Corporate turned to profitability in the first half. This is a very significant improvement on the negative return last year. Clearly, we still have much further to go. Europe, Retail and Business Banking was loss making due to the cost of restructuring that business. We are reducing head count and the size of our branch network in Spain. The business now has strong leadership and is in a much better shape for this environment. We expect it to return to profitability in the second half and to generate positive returns going forward.</p>
          <p>Disciplined cost management is also critical to delivering returns. So if we held costs flat year on year, excluding restructuring costs. We expect to deliver a cost reduction of &#xA3;250 million this year, net of restructuring. We are running Barclays in a more integrated way so we can deliver both revenue and cost synergies. We have identified up to &#xA3;2 billion in savings opportunities by 2013. So we believe we can exceed our billion pound target, a target which underpins delivery of our targeted return on equity.</p>
          <p>The third execution priority is income growth. Income growth is an important part of delivering returns and though the environment has been challenging, those areas where we are investing are beginning to deliver. At Barclays Wealth, we're in the second year of a five-year investment program. In 2010, the first year, revenues grew 18%. This year first half income has grown 12%, and we're operating ahead of plan. We launched One Africa at the beginning of July and Maria Ramos is now CEO of the Africa Region in addition to Absa. Total income was up 7.5% when we combine revenues from all of our activities across the region. As you know, we have top tier positions in many African markets and our One Africa strategy will deliver the entire capabilities of Barclays in an integrated way across the continent.</p>
          <p>Within Barclays Capital, though overall income was down, there was good growth in the businesses we have targeted to build out globally. Equities and prime services grew 5%, investment banking was up 11%, market share is growing. Our equities franchises continued to strengthen. We were number two in the U.S. IPO market and number eight globally.</p>
          <p>Our Advisory business is also gaining momentum. We ranked number five in the U.S., number seven in Europe, and we advised on two of the five largest M&amp;A deals during the first half. For the first time ever, Barclays has been named Best Global Investment Bank by Euromoney. We are also pleased with a very strong performance in U.K. Retail and Business Banking. Income grew 4% as we continued to upgrade the customer experience by investing in our branches, in our technology and in our people. This represents good progress after six months.</p>
          <p>The fourth pillar of execution is citizenship. Despite the challenging environment, we have done a lot to support job creation and business growth in all of the markets in which we operate. In the U.K., for example, we take our commitments under Project Merlin seriously. We met them in the first half with new lending to U.K. businesses totaling &#xA3;20 billion. &#xA3;7 billion of this was to small and medium businesses.</p>
          <p>We held over 75,000 meetings with our business clients in the first six months of the year. On average, we processed over 14,000 loan applications a month to small and medium businesses. And our approval rate was above 80%. In other words, we approve a new loan to a U.K. SME every four minutes.</p>
          <p>We supported over 50,000 U.K. business start-ups in the first six months of this year. Take One Small Step is an award scheme we run to help entrepreneurs launch new businesses. Fiona Wood is one of the winners with Naturally Cool Kids, which makes chemical-free skin care products for children. She used her &#xA3;50,000 prize to launch six products at the same time instead of just one. And as a result, her business landed a contract with John Lewis which increased turnover by 45%.</p>
          <p>This is just one example. I could give you many others where we advised start-ups on a whole range of essential skills from developing a business plan, managing cash flow, through the launching a Web site, complying with legislation or starting to trade internationally.</p>
          <p>Operating with integrity lies at the very heart of our focus on citizenship. We know that trust in the industry has been damaged in recent years. We know we do not always get things right for our customers. When we get them wrong, we apologize and we put them right. That is our commitment to our customers. We care about being good citizens, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because trust underpins our relationship with customers and clients. Trust underpins our reputation in our brand. Trust underpins our aim of delivering sustainable returns for shareholders.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on four execution priorities in order to achieve just that. We remain committed to our targets of a 13% return on equity and a 15% return on tangible equity in 2013. And though we are never satisfied, we have made good progress. We are on track to deliver those targets.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll hand over to Chris now to take you through the numbers in more detail.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning. Barclays has delivered an encouraging performance for the half year in challenging economic conditions. Underlying or adjusted profit before tax grew 24% to &#xA3;3.7 billion and on a statutory basis profits were &#xA3;2.6 billion. Adjusted or underlying numbers exclude any credit, gains or losses from acquisitions and disposals and the provision for payment protection insurance taken in the second quarter this year. I'll use adjusted numbers this morning when it gives you a better understanding of the operating trends.</p>
          <p>Turning to the other headline numbers, total income decreased 8% to &#xA3;15.3 billion. There was a good performance in Retail and Business Banking where income grew 3%. Impairment improved by 41% to &#xA3;1.8 billion, resulting in net operating income of &#xA3;13.5 billion, which is 6% up excluding owned credit. Operating expenses grew 1% to &#xA3;9.8 billion, excluding PPI. Taken together, this resulted in adjusted profits of &#xA3;9.7 billion &#x2013; sorry, of &#xA3;3.7 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, return on equity improved to 9.1%. Return on tangible equity increased to 10.9%. Our cost-to-net-operating income ratio improved from 77% to 73% and our dividend policy remains unchanged. We announced a dividend of one pence for the second quarter, bringing the dividend for the first half to two pence.</p>
          <p>I'd like to move now to the performance of the individual businesses. In Retail and Business Banking we had good momentum. Net operating income grew 14% to &#xA3;6.4 billion, and profits before PPI were up 33% to &#xA3;1.4 billion. In U.K. Retail and Business Banking, profit before PPI increased 74% to &#xA3;704 million. Income grew 4% to &#xA3;2.3 billion with volume growth in mortgages and personal savings.</p>
          <p>Improved margins on both the assets and liabilities side resulted in a seven basis point increase in net interest margin to 146 basis points. Excluding a &#xA3;400 million provision for PPI and one-off pension credit for &#xA3;118 million in 2010, operating expenses were down 11%.</p>
          <p>In Europe Retail and Business banking, we reported a loss of &#xA3;161 million. Income was stable at &#xA3;604 million, and we saw some positive trends. There was a small increase in net interest margins to 116 basis points due to better pricing of new business. Impairment improved 13% despite the economic environment and excluding restructuring the business made a profit in June. Expenses increased to &#xA3;657 million. This included a restructuring charge of &#xA3;129 million, which was mainly in Spain where we're closing 20% of our branches and reducing our head count by 16%. Africa now comprises Absa Retail and Business Banking and Barclays Africa. Profits were broadly flat at &#xA3;379 million.</p>
          <p>Income increased by 5% to 1.9 billion and impairment decreased 19% to &#xA3;268 million. As a result, net operating income increased 10% to &#xA3;1.6 billion. Costs grew from &#xA3;1.1 billion to &#xA3;1.2 billion reflecting a one-off pension credit of &#xA3;54 million last year as well as currency movements.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard, profits grew 65% to &#xA3;524 million, excluding a &#xA3;600 million provision for PPI. There was a strong improvement in the performance in the international businesses. Profits in the U.S. and Absa each grew to over &#xA3;100 million largely as a result of reduced impairment.</p>
          <p>Income grew slightly to &#xA3;2 billion including Egg and MBNA. Impairment charges improved 27% to &#xA3;648 million, and costs were held flat at &#xA3;771 million excluding PPI and a goodwill write-off of &#xA3;47 million relating to Firstplus.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Corporate and Investment banking where profit excluding owned credit increased 7% to &#xA3;2.3 billion. At Barclays Capital, excluding owned credit, total income for the half year was down 11% to &#xA3;6.3 billion. There was an impairment write-back of &#xA3;111 million, and strong cost management led to a reduction in operating expenses of 3%. Excluding owned credit, profit before tax was down 9% to &#xA3;2.3 billion. The cost-to-net-operating income ratio for Barclays Capital, excluding owned credit, was 64%, within our target range of 60% to 65%. Return on equity was 15% as we've reduced legacy assets at prices at or above their marks. In total, these assets decreased &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;17.9 billion.</p>
          <p>I know you're interested in the quarterly income progression. Total income for the second quarter, excluding owned credit, was &#xA3;2.9 billion, which is down 14% on the first quarter. The breakdown by asset class is on this slide. This is a good performance relative to the industry, and we're making good progress in the businesses in which we're investing.</p>
          <p>Barclays Corporate delivered operating profit of &#xA3;17 million compared to a loss of &#xA3;377 million last year as performance improved across all regions. Profits in the U.K. increased 11% to &#xA3;413 million. In Europe, losses reduced to &#xA3;359 million, driven by improved impairment in Spain, which was 46% lower at &#xA3;299 million. Losses in the rest of the world more than halved to just over &#xA3;100 million.</p>
          <p>We're making good progress on the sale of Barclays Bank Russia, and we've made a provision of &#xA3;64 million in relation to this. The current return on equity is obviously well short of our 2013 target, but this is a significant improvement on the first half last year. We expect Barclays Corporate to break even for the full year.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Wealth, there was strong income growth of 12% to &#xA3;848 million. Profits decreased 7% to &#xA3;88 million as we've invested &#xA3;44 million in the Gamma program. Return on equity was stable at 10%; and we're on track to reach our target of 17% to 18% in 2013.</p>
          <p>I'd like to give you now more detail on impairment, Eurozone exposures and costs, before I turn to capital. Impairment reduced 41% to &#xA3;1.8 billion, and the loan loss rate decreased to 74 basis points on an annualized basis from 118 basis points for 2010. We're pleased at the speed with which impairment has improved, and we expect a steady loan loss rate in the second half, excluding write-backs.</p>
          <p>We significantly increased disclosure on our assets in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As you know, our exposure to Greece is minimal. About half of our total assets relate to retail mortgages in Spain, Italy and Portugal. Our lending criteria are conservative, and the average loan-to-current market value in these markets is just over 50%. Let me remind you that our impairment charges in Europe return on business banking, decreased to &#xA3;116 million in the first half. The loan loss rate was down to 50 basis points, and credit risk loans were 43% covered.</p>
          <p>Our corporate assets totaled &#xA3;13.7 billion. Over half our lending was to companies that we rate as strong or satisfactory on our credit grading scale. We've taken substantial provisions already in the lower rated corporate portfolio, especially in Barclays Corporate Spain where we acted early.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges here are now declining, and we expect this trend to continue. Our exposure to sovereigns totaled &#xA3;11.6 billion. We think of this in two parts. Firstly, &#xA3;8.4 billion of exposures are held as available for sale in order to hedge interest rate risk related to our local businesses, mainly in Spain. Over half of this has a remaining life of under two years and is being replaced by interest rate swaps.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our trading and derivative portfolio totaled &#xA3;3.2 billion at the end of June and is actively managed. This reflects our role as a leading primary dealer, market-maker and liquidity provider to our clients. Finally, our financial institutions exposure of &#xA3;6.7 billion reflects normal inter-bank activity. A significant part of this relates to non-Irish banks with administrative centers in Dublin but with little Irish exposure. So all in all, we're comfortable with our assets that we own and the values at which they are held. We continue to manage our risks here carefully.</p>
          <p>Turning now to costs, which grew 1% to &#xA3;9.8 billion excluding PPI. This roughly matches the increase in restructuring charges, which were &#xA3;216 million in the first half compared to &#xA3;93 million for the same period last year. The restructuring will, of course, deliver future cost improvements, and at the same time as controlling costs, we're continuing to invest for growth. In Retail and Business Banking expenses grew 9% to &#xA3;4 billion as a result of restructuring charges of &#xA3;129 million in Europe, goodwill impairment of &#xA3;47 million relating to Barclaycard, and the one-off pension credits in 2010 of &#xA3;200 million. Without these items, RBB costs were slightly down.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Capital costs decreased 3% to &#xA3;4.1 billion and our investment spend reduced, and cost reduction initiatives started to have an impact. Costs at Barclays Corporate were broadly in line with last year giving an overall reduction for Corporate and Investment Banking of 4% to &#xA3;4.9 billion. Excluding the U.K. bank levy and PPI provision, we're on track to keep 2011 non-performance costs in line with last year and to deliver at least &#xA3;1 billion of run rate cost reductions for 2013. Our first half numbers do not include an accrual for the U.K. bank levy, which we expect to be in the range of &#xA3;350 million to &#xA3;400 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to look at the balance sheet, we maintain a strong capital position with adjusted gross leverage stable at 20 times and risk-weighted assets flat at just under &#xA3;400 billion. Our core Tier 1 ratio increased to 11%, and net asset value per share was up 6 pence from the year-end of 423 pence. The increase from our retained profits was partially offset by reserve movements, notably currency.</p>
          <p>We've continued to generate capital and retained earnings. Excluding PPI contributed 44 basis points to our core Tier 1 ratio. The PPI provision accounted for an 18 basis point swing in the other direction. The new regulatory requirements for market risk contained in CRD3 will come into the Fed from the end of the year. We've calculated that our core Tier 1 ratio would have been 10% had this been in force at the 30th of June, reflecting additional market risk RWAs of &#xA3;40 billion.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity and funding position remains a key strength in volatile market conditions. Our liquidity pool was down slightly from the year-end at &#xA3;145 billion, as we've intentionally reduced short-term wholesale deposits. Our BarCap liquidity coverage ratio increased from 80% to 86%, and our net stable funding ratio grew from 94% to 96% as we continued to issue longer term liabilities. We raised &#xA3;19 billion of wholesale debt across a variety of products and geographies during the first half, and the term funding we've raised over the last 18 months has already refinanced our 2011 maturities.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, adjusted profit before tax was up 24% to &#xA3;3.7 billion, impairment improved by 41%, and net operating income was &#xA3;13.5 billion. Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.1%, and our core Tier 1 ratio strengthened to 11%. This represents an encouraging performance in challenging market conditions.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much indeed. I'll now hand back to Bob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Before we open it up for questions, I want to end by talking about the market and regulatory environment. There continues to be uncertainty surrounding sovereign debt in Europe and the U.S. and about the prospects for economic growth, all of which are contributing to a lack of market confidence. We see that most clearly from our customers and our clients. In the U.K., our small business customers have grown their current account credit balances by 41% since the start of the year. These are successful businesses, generating profits in cash, but they lack the confidence to invest. Lack of confidence has also impacted the financial markets where volumes are down and investors and issuers are hesitant.</p>
          <p>The two most important factors moving forward are confidence and certainty. As we continue to work through issues over the debt ceiling in the U.S. and fears of contagion in Europe, we also need to work through the final stages of bank regulation. I have said many times that we are strong supporters of creating a safer and a sounder financial system, a system that fosters job creation and economic growth. Strong banks want strong regulation.</p>
          <p>It is critical now that we all work together to achieving certainty as quickly as possible so that U.K. banks become investable, so that we can support economic growth, and so that we can act as a source of stability amidst market volatility. We submitted and published our full written response to the U.K. Independent Commission on Banking in July and will continue to engage closely with them.</p>
          <p>As I have said before, we believe that if banks could be allowed to fail without creating systemic risk then many of the more emotive issues about those that are seen as too big to fail would be addressed. What is important is that customers can still access their deposits and essential services, even if a bank does fail. Credible resolution and recovery plans are critical. At Barclays we have invested a lot of time and a lot of energy in developing these, and we expect to have them in place early next year.</p>
          <p>There continues to be a lot of discussion about ring fencing and the final outcome remains unclear. Ring fencing would not be our choice, but we could make it work if we have to, and we would work constructively with regulators to implement it in such a way that U.K. banks and their customers are not unduly disadvantaged. But what is most important right now is that we achieve certainty. It is time for governments, for banks and for the private sector to work together to achieve that because only then can banks play the key role that they must in helping the private sector pick up the growth mantle from the public sector in supporting customers and clients to create jobs and to generate economic growth.</p>
          <p>This is important around the world, but we have a special responsibility here in the U.K., a responsibility because of the economic challenges we face. A responsibility because of the important role London plays as one of the world's leading financial centers. We have to continue to attract companies to come here, to invest here, and to stay here. This is a great place to do business, and if we can work together with a common aim to regain confidence and certainty the business environment will recover.</p>
          <p>In the meantime we remain focused on executing against our priorities at Barclays, capital strength, returns, income growth, and citizenship. And our results today demonstrate good progress. Our three world-class businesses, which account for two-thirds of our capital, delivered a return on equity of 15% or more. We 'e investing in the two businesses with potential to become top tier and they are delivering strong income growth already. And we have made good progress with those businesses that need work. In short, we are on track to deliver our targeted return on equity of 13% by 2013.</p>
          <p>Chris and I are here with a team that you know well to take questions. We have with us Rich Ricci, who's the Co-Chief Executive of our Corporate and Investment Bank, Robert Le Blanc, our Chief Risk Officer, Antony Jenkins, Chief Executive of Retail and Business Banking, Jerry del Missier, Co-Chief Executive of Corporate and Investment Banking, Tom Kalaris, Chief Executive of Barclays Wealth, Maria Ramos, Chief Executive of our Africa businesses, giving the results presentation in Johannesburg for Absa today. Going forward, we'll have her here to answer questions as well.</p>
          <p>So with that, we open up for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes for you from the line of John-Paul Crutchley from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning all. I wanted to ask a question on the income cost dynamic. I guess when I look at the broad picture here it looks like income was a bit light to my expectations. But you've done well on the group in terms of costs. If I look at it in terms of first-second quarter dynamics it looks like revenue is down, obviously Q2 on Q1, but cost up slightly on those, a little bit of restructuring there. And when I've delved down to the businesses, clearly you've performed very well on the retail business in terms of the cost revenues that I mean, but obviously, the Investment Bank has got more of a headwind there.</p>
          <p>What I guess I'm interested in is how that plays out over the rest of the year if it does remain a difficult revenue environment in the Investment Bank? And to what degree are you actually able to bring costs down in line with revenues of Investment Bank which clearly has not been the case in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J.P. I think there might have been a question in there. I'm going to assume that was two parts. One is what is the cost picture and the income cost picture as a group level? And I think at the end you're asking more specifically about Barclays Capital. So Chris, if you want to start, maybe Rich and Jerry can talk more specifically about Barclays Capital.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, J.P. and good morning. You actually summarized the situation pretty well. If we look at the income performance it was down 8%, but if you include impairment it brings it down to a number that's broadly flat. Against that expenses went up 1%, which is pretty much the impact of the restructuring costs. I've excluded PPI because I think that we'd all agree that's one-off and non-recurring. I feel that in terms of rather than looking at income and costs separately, we should look at them together, and in particular look at the returns that we're generating from this. An adjusted return on equity of 9.1% or return on tangible equity of 10.9%, I think, is an indication of both reasonable income performance and good cost management.</p>

          <p>Hi, J.P. It's Rich. I think in terms of Barclays Capital we, as we said at the Investor Day, we're managing on a returns basis, and we do expect the second half of the year to be somewhat challenging, probably in line with the first half. And we remain confident on the cost line, on the capital line, that we can manage the returns to come out to 15%. And we demonstrated, I think, very good cost management in the first half- quarter-on-quarter from Q2 20101 to Q2 2011. Costs were actually down 7%. So I think we've demonstrated that we can manage all those dynamics and deliver the returns that we've committed to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up on the Investment Bank costs, I mean to what degree &#x2013; I guess where I was coming from is have you got actually accrual obviously based on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:35:09) is this a further conversation which actually gives you a headwind in terms of managing a cost outcome, where you want it to be this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look at the comp-to-income ratio in the first half, the accrual is around 45%. About 3% or 4% of that relates to the additional deferral rates, so it's kind of in line with last year. And the accruals overall are down in line with the revenue base in the business.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J.P., here's how I look at it, and I think it's important to have this perspective. It was a tough environment for the revenue line in investment banking industry-wide. Our revenues in the half are down around 9%, and yet there's a 15% return on equity and a 64% cost-to-income ratio. And what we have talked about, and Rich and Jerry have talked about, is a commitment to manage returns and the cost-to-income ratio. And I think it's good that we show those kind of results in this kind of an environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I've got a few questions, actually, but I will just pick a couple out. The restructuring charge that you talked about, Chris, the 216, does that include the &#xA3;47 million of goodwill and how much was the restructuring charge in U.K. Corporate? So that's question one.</p>
          <p>I was looking at Page 63 of the press release, and I was just looking at the movements in the credit market risk assets, and there's a couple of items which I was wondering if you could explain? Firstly, there's a reduction in the value from &#x2013; and what I'm trying to get at here is the P&amp;L impact, so there's the reduction is down &#xA3;5.9 billion and there's FX movements of 393, and that's partially offset by a fair value gain of 322. Should I look at the P&amp;L impact as being a net of the 393 and the 322? That's question two.</p>

          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [06T4F2-E Christopher Lucas] : If I could move to Page 63, the best way of looking at what's the P&amp;L impact is the 209 that goes through top line income and the 113 that goes through impairment.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Can I ask just two questions? I don't know if I misheard, but I think that when you were discussing costs you said that you'd identified &#xA3;2 billion of potential cost efficiencies relative to your &#xA3;1 billion. I wonder if you could talk about that in more detail and whether you would be revising that &#xA3;1 billion at some point?</p>
          <p>And then the second issue is on risk-weighted assets and where we are in terms of mitigation? Because I think you say you've sold &#xA3;6 billion of credit market assets, and I just wondered if you could give us an update on where we are relative to the new targets given at the Investor Day?</p>
          <p>I'm sorry, could I just add a third one on the U.K. Retail bank, because the top line's very good, particularly net interest income and margins, and I just wondered if you could talk a bit what's going on in deposit margins, because I'm quite surprised that it has widened. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fiona, thank you. Let me answer the first, ask Chris to talk about RWAs, and then Antony about the U.K. Retail Bank. I think you heard us accurately. We set in February a commitment to take &#xA3;1 billion in costs out by 2013. That underpins as one of the many things that underpins our confidence in getting returns to 13%. We have identified, which doesn't mean we have acted on, but we have identified more than we had anticipated at &#xA3;2 billion. So we have confidence that we'll exceed &#xA3;1 billion, but having given a target of how much we'll exceed it by. But it gives us great confidence in the billion pounds and that we can exceed that. Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of RWAs here, and the best way of looking at it is the driving parts are the movement between &#xA3;398 billion, which was at the 31st of December and &#xA3;395 billion, and there's really two items in there. There's the reduction for those credit market exposures and other business activity which nets about &#xA3;4 billion of RWA reduction. There are however methodology changes that increases the four to six &#x2013; increases the number by &#xA3;6 billion and that relates to different regulatory interpretations. It relates to moving from standardized to advanced, and I think is what we would expect to see as the sort of day-to-day changes in interpretation predominately by the regulators. There's FX and other movements, but that's how you get to 395.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance we gave at the Investor Day, that remains the same and since we did that as of about the middle of June there's no real update to give at this point.</p>

          <p>Fiona, thank you, for the compliments on the top line at U.K. RB. We were pleased also with the performance of the business. Of course, competition for liabilities is intense out there, but really it's a day-to-day battle around the quality of the products we have in the market, our marketing and the rates that we offer consumers. And we're constantly managing those variables to deliver a good deal for the customer as well as a good margin for us. Specifically in this half we had a product out there which was a savings bond where customers could actually withdraw an element of it early, and that proved very popular. So this is about competing very actively in the market day-to-day, and we're able to get a good return on the liabilities that we're raising.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Good morning, everyone. I had a question for you on the net interest margins, which is sort of given on Page 69 and 70 of the release. It looked like sort of at a sequential basis they've actually declined by around 11 basis points on the sort of Retail and Business banking, Corporate and Wealth, so it's with more banking divisions. Clearly, it was impacted by a lower contribution from your equity structural hedge. I'm just trying to think about how we should think about the net interest income line going forward, given obviously funding costs are rising? And you do seem to have had sort of margin decline across a number of the different units there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I'd ask you to answer, and Antony, if you want to add anything, please feel free.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, thank you. I think it's very much wrapped up in Antony's answer. Both the asset and the liability margin have improved, and I think there is a degree of seasonality in those numbers. We tend to see the second half be slightly higher than the first, and I think that's as re-pricing takes place throughout the year, and that's indeed what you see. So if you look at the first half 2011 versus first half 2010, you will see there's a slight improvement, although again, if you look at the asset margin against the second half it's down slightly. But I would regard the underlying margin is strengthening, even though the second half is slightly better than the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should actually anticipate a pick-up in the margin similar to what we had last year, so that 10 basis points of improvement?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I've just got three quick ones this time. Firstly, on Africa, Bob, you referenced 7.5% revenue growth for Africa in its totality, whereas I think Chris noted the 5% top-line growth specifically within ARRB. Would I be right in assuming that the difference in those businesses you report elsewhere, i.e. at the Capital and the Cards business, et cetera? And if so, could you just provide a few comments on those businesses where the rate of growth is clearly higher and is making a useful contribution in the other units?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on sovereign exposures, and specifically Greece, one of your peers with rather greater exposures in that market was making a virtue of the haircut they had taken within their numbers yesterday. Just for clarity, and I accept that your exposure to Greece sovereign debt is de minimis, about 120 million gross I think, just for clarity, have you actually taken a haircut or not? I believe no.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just looking at the roadmap to the 13% ROE by business in 2013, which you give within the Appendix slides, would I be right in understanding that you candidly acknowledge you will have an ongoing drag from Europe and from Barclays Corporate in 2013? Is your expectation that there will be a future point in time that both these businesses, and more particularly Europe, will reach your group targets? Or do you candidly acknowledge that a business like Europe RBB will remain below the group threshold, even if we build in your cost initiatives, some normalization of interest rates over time and normalization of impairments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with Africa. I'd like to say a few words about Europe and then have Antony pick up on those. And then Chris can address your issue on sovereign exposures. I think you were specifically asking about Greece, but we've given a lot of detail and transparency around our exposures.</p>
          <p>In Africa you're absolutely right, Ian, and I am very, very focused on the opportunity that we have in Africa, and it's both about integrating our Retail and Business Banking operations where we've in essence run 11 different businesses in 11 different countries over the years. And that's an integration on the continent. And you'll see those numbers of Retail and Business Banking rolling up into the Africa portion of Antony's business. So he'll have U.K. Retail and Business Banking. He'll have the Global Cards business. He'll have Western Europe Retail and Business Banking and Africa.</p>
          <p>You'll also hear me speaking about Africa in a different context, which is all of the businesses combined. And Absa Capital and other activities in Africa that are a part of Barclays Capital, Tommy Kalaris has got the beginnings of a very successful effort in the Wealth business and as you mentioned, Cards. So we will be showing it on a geographic basis as well as on a functional basis within U.K. Retail and Business Banking.</p>
          <p>In terms of Western Europe, we feel more optimistic today than we did six months ago. You've all asked us the direct question did we consider exit? Of course we did when we looked at that over the course of our planning cycle, and we're very, very committed to the fact that this can be a good part of our business. We have had historically a very strong presence in Spain and increasingly Iberia with Portugal alongside. We had serious under-performance, and so we've made change. We have very strong leadership in place. It's very much one Barclays operating together with all of our other operations now. We are reducing head count in the branch system circa 20% type of levels, as we've said, and that's ongoing. We will be returned to profitability in the second half of the year. And while that business will not be at 13% by 2013 while the group is, it will get to 13%. It's just going to take it a little bit longer. We would not be as committed as we are if we didn't believe that we could get the returns in that business to 13% or above. If you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Bob. Just to build on that, we did say at the Investor Day we expected for Retail Business Banking Europe to be in low single digits by 2013 but that we would expect to get within the target return by 2015. And we still feel confident, as Bob has said, in achieving that. And just one thing I'd like to mention about the Retail Business Banking in Africa. It was impacted by the disruption in Egypt in the first quarter on the margin. That slightly dampened down the revenue growth. So that would be my comments on those topics.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Greece, and you &#x2013; Ian, I'm sure you got to Page 62. It shows you that we've got &#xA3;14 million of sovereign exposure. That's fair value-to-equity. There is a small haircut against that, but I think it got immaterial for the purposes of the disclosure. You'll see that it is held as amortized cost. We've really got some corporate lending of &#xA3;139 million which we're very comfortable with the collectability of and other retail lending of &#xA3;33 million against which we have an &#xA3;11 million impairment provision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry, so I wasn't introduced. Tom Rayner. Thanks. Just three, if I may, one just on the cost flexibility question in Barclays capital. I mean I'm assuming the adjusted cost in the net operating income ratio is the targeted measure, the 60% to 65%. You got off to a better start, if you like, in Q1 last year. Q2 this year, a little bit better than Q2 last so I'm just trying to get a sense of is there a revenue outcome in the second half that might mean you exceed the 60% to 65% ratio on a temporary basis? Or will you meet that by reducing costs regardless of the revenue outcome. And I've got another couple of quick questions, please, after that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. One was just you've given this disclosure less than 1% of the residential mortgage book is subject of forbearance. And I was wondering if you could give us the figures on the sort of commercial real estate exposure? And also I just wanted to follow up on your comments on the ICB ring fence proposals. You think you can implement them without unduly disadvantaging, I think you said customers? Could you clarify also for shareholders? I mean I'm interested in how the ring fence can be put in place without doing too much damage really?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Tom. I'll ask Jerry and Rich to talk about the cost flexibility in BarCap. Chris will pick up on I think you're saying how does forbearance trends laid across into commercial real estate as opposed to residential? And then I'm happy to make a few comments on the Independent Commission.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom. It's Jerry. So you heard Rich earlier talk about the environment. Clearly the first half was a challenging environment, and we recognize that we're very likely to be operating in a challenging environment in the second half as well. Year-over-year costs down 7%, reflecting the fact that I think we were early in recognizing that the environment had changed in late 2010, notwithstanding the fact that we were still executing build of our equities and banking franchises in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>At the Investor Day we declared that by the end of this year we would be more or less complete with those bills, and we'd move into really a BAU investment plan. So nothing particularly special about those businesses, and rather it would be done very much on a BAU basis. Against that backdrop, and given what we've already done and the commitment to remain vigilant on costs, we remain confident that we will stick with the 60% to 65% backdrop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess the point of my question was that there's going to be a danger I suppose that you could damage the franchise by cutting costs too aggressively just to meet a target in what might turn out to be a temporary period of weak revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and look, we don't take decisions to manage costs lightly. We're very committed to returns. We also have a very strong franchise that we are very committed to protecting as well. So obviously we take that kind of balancing into account.</p>

          <p>Chris, the question on forbearance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't have, Tom, as you know a set forbearance program for wholesale exposures. They are done on a case-by-case basis, and I think probably the best way of looking at it is the wholesale credit risk disclosures we give on about Page 45 that sets out the credit risk loans, which was not in forbearance are those that we have identified as suffering stress. And if you look at it, you will see that it's about &#xA3;11.4 billion on a total loan book of &#xA3;271.</p>

          <p>Tom, you asked about the Independent Commission and how will this impact shareholders? Well, I was very clear and have been very clear. We would have not recommended and did not recommend a ring fence, but we have engaged, we think very thoughtfully and very constructively, with the Independent Commission and other members of the regulatory community. We think within the range of outcomes we can work constructively to support both our customers and our shareholders. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty and we're not going to know a lot of these decisions until September, but I think it's narrowing in on an acceptable range of outcomes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes through from the line of Jason Napier of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had three questions, please. The first was around the level of costs in the group and the identified &#xA3;2 billion is, of course, welcome. I wonder whether you wouldn't mind talking about the distribution of those additional savings ideas and particularly looking at a very strong outcome in expenses in U.K. RBB in the half, whether the expense run rate there is sustainable or can be further improved upon and what restructuring charges might go along with the additional saves?</p>
          <p>Secondly, some of your peers have spoken about concerns around late cycle loan losses. Your CRLs and PPLs are down pretty much everywhere and actually on the Retail side look better than I would have expected given the economic conditions. They're all kind of much better sequentially, and I wondered whether you could talk a little bit about your &#x2013; what concerns you might have around a sort of double dip, if you like, in arrears rates?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just as I thank you for the equity allocation disclosures, those are very helpful and it makes it very clear what kind of profit level the execs are going to have to deliver to hit the numbers, I just had a question on Africa and perhaps the treatment of minorities perhaps? The equity to RWA's number looks low or perhaps there's something going on in tax equity to RWAs of 8% or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:57:23) RWAs of about 3%. I just wonder whether there's an allocation wrinkle there that perhaps you could explain, just as far as how much capital is in that division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we work through &#x2013; and thank you, Jason. Let me talk about costs, and ask Chris and Antony if they want to add to that since you had a lot of questions about Retail Banking within that. I think on the loan loss and the late cycle, I'll turn to Robert and lastly, Chris, if you can answer the question maybe when you do the other about Africa that would be great.</p>
          <p>Listen, the metric that we're following most closely, and there's never one metric, is we start with rock solid capital funding and liquidity. And I think we're really, really pleased with how solid, how rock solid all three of those are. The next priority is around returns, and we're committed to getting returns on equity to 13% and on tangible equity to 15% by 2013. The cost program, head count, everything else is a part of getting those returns up, so one of the things that you're seeing is a much more integrated Barclays. We talk about it internally as One Barclays.</p>
          <p>So the executive committee is very focused on the opportunity we have with higher levels of capital post-Basel III to get both revenue and cost synergies out of the business. And we're excited that we've seen more opportunities than just the &#xA3;1 billion. We haven't said anything in terms of how much of those we're going to be able to get, but we are being open with the fact that we're seeing more opportunities than we expected so you should expect us to exceed the &#xA3;1 billion target.</p>
          <p>But this is being done in a very positive way in terms of really looking at the opportunities where we're integrating Corporate and Investment Banking that have been run for years as very, very different businesses. I'm going to ask Rich just to say a few words about some of the revenue synergies we're seeing from that business and some of the cost synergies, but that's the context I would put it in. Rich, you want to talk a little bit about what's going on with the Corporate and Investment Bank coming together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Bob. Where we've really started to see some traction as the two businesses have been run in conjunction with each other, as Bob mentioned, it's very, very exciting because as an example, capital market transactions that are being done for Barclay Corporate clients by Barclays Capital have increased fivefold since we started managing the businesses together. And revenues in those type of transactions have trebled. Likewise, in terms of Barclays Corporate products that are being sold to Barclays Capital clients, primarily cash management and other operating products, have increased by 20%. And we think that's just the tip of the iceberg. As we work further to combine the infrastructures, as we work further to look at the way we cover clients, we think there's really, really a lot of opportunity to better serve our clients but also to generate more revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, the issues around lead cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The question mentioned the possibility, I think the phrase was of a possible double dip in the arrears rates and potentially concerns around late cycle loan performance. From our point of view, I don't see that as a major threat for us. Just looking across the statistics of most of the book, the early cycle delinquency and late cycle delinquency in our books have been improving steadily. And those trends I don't think are going to reverse.</p>
          <p>Our CRLs levels are steady, as you mentioned, and you'll see in the papers that our CRL coverage ratio is also steady. So while the economic environment is still a little bit fragile and the recovery is uneven, I think that in the second half of this year the impairment performance will look similar to what we've seen in the first half, taking into account of course some of the releases that have occurred and that are not recurring. But no, I think it's still a tough time in the credit world. But I don't think we're going to give up ground on the improvements we've seen in the impairment of the credit books.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And Jason, I think the answer is on Page 68, little note two, which is to do with the treatment of the non-controlling or minority interests. But rather than use more time now, why don't we give you a ring and just go through it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. I have two areas I'd like to explore, please? First of all, simply what level of cost savings from the &#xA3;250 million, if any, has been achieved so far in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About &#xA3;120 million, something in that sort of order.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The second area I wanted to explore was a bit more detail on BarCap, if I may? Firstly, what was the nature of the credit impairment release in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't you tell us the questions you want on BarCap and then Rich and Jerry can answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then more broadly I was going to explore the area that we touched on earlier, I think in answer to Tom's question. I was looking at the levels of revenue in BarCap, and even with a credit impairment release, it looks like about an 18% pre-tax return on the risk-weighted assets that you have post-mitigation that you gave on the analyst day. And I wondered what your thoughts were about how long you continue with the current level of expenses given your objective to get the return on equity up toward the 15% tangible that you've set?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I actually think we've been pretty clear and pretty clinical about how we set the priorities. I'm happy to ask Rich and Jerry if they have anything to add, but I think it's been pretty clear, Robert, how we set those priorities. Chris, there was a question I actually didn't understand on what's the nature of the release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. They would be because we have a reversal of the impairment charge for the loan because we now consolidated the assets, and they flow through the collateral fair values, if you see what I mean? So they go through the fair value line. The reversals will be because the value of the collateral has increased, either because as we've sold it, but more likely as we've revalued it in line with current market values.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's simply that things we have provided for have turned out to have a better outcome than we anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And is that Protium related again? Because I thought Protium was in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In total, Protium was about &#xA3;220 million across the half, and the first quarter was about &#xA3;100 million I think, and the second was about &#xA3;130 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought it was &#xA3;180 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#xA3;230 million for the half, Robert. I can't remember the first quarter, but it's &#xA3;230 million for the half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich and Jerry, was there anything else you wanted to add on that? I feel &#x2013; I think we feel like we've answered that question, Robert. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, it's just a case as to whether the revenues you've set have been something like &#xA3;3.7 billion for a quarter, and the only time you've achieved that is the first quarter of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, as we said at the Investor Day, we don't expect this environment to continue forever, but we also stated very clearly that while we're committed to those numbers in a normal environment, we're managing to returns. And we've got the levers of cost. We've got the levers of capital, as Bob described and as Jerry described. Certainly it was a very challenging quarter, and I think we've demonstrated that we can honor that commitment of 15% even in a challenging environment. So it's our intention and expectation to deliver that 15% even if we have an environment that's as difficult as the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, please. The first one is with reference to the &#xA3;3.5 billion net transfers into level three assets, could you give us a bit more color what's happening there please and what the benefit to the P&amp;L has been from not keeping them in level 2?</p>
          <p>And secondly with reference to your comment of the July trading conditions being impacted by the current market conditions, could you give us a bit more color whether you're making that comment being down with reference to the first half clean revenues in BarCap or whether it's just reference to the second quarter clean revenues in BarCap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think simply stated, Robert &#x2013; I'll talk about market conditions and expectations first and then I think it's either Chris or Robert will take the first question. We're expecting the environment broadly speaking to be similar in the second half to the first half. It was a sluggish environment, both because of the issues in Europe and in the U.S. clearly impacting volumes in the marketplace, so a lack of confidence and certainly still some regulatory uncertainty.</p>
          <p>It's possible there's a positive scenario that potentially we resolve some of the issues around regulation in September and that maybe the markets pick up before the end of the year. But our expectation is clearly that we'll have a market environment, or what we're planning on, is a market environment in the second half which is pretty sluggish and very similar to the market environment in the first half. Rich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me just add, most of the people on the call work for investment banks. We shouldn't overplay the notion of what we said. It's certainly a challenging environment, as we all know. And I think you would have heard something very similar from all the other investment banks. You know please don't misinterpret as a disaster or anything. We're trying to provide color in line with our obligations to the market. But I think, as Bob said, we expect it to continue to be challenging and we shouldn't read any more into than that.</p>

          <p>Level three assets. It feels like you've got an accounting question, but if I get it wrong, Robert will help. The net increase is about &#xA3;3 billion as you quite rightly point out. Of that &#xA3;3 billion about &#xA3;2.4 net is the Protium assets coming back onto the balance sheet and going into the level three assets. The P&amp;L impact is the 230-ish that I described earlier for Protium. The balance is net transfers of different bond positions and in particular index-linked bond positions as set out on Page 82. I don't think there's a huge significant P&amp;L impact as a result of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks. Just a couple of questions on your Eurozone exposures, firstly, on Italian sovereign exposure, it looks to me like the net exposure there, just to the sovereign this is, the net exposure has doubled pretty much since the end of last year. So taking the EBA numbers and then comparing with the numbers you've put out today, looks like it's doubled. Can you explain what's happening there? And also does that mean we should expect some sort of charge to come through in the third quarter effectively, because clearly, actually pretty much since the end of the first half Italian sovereign bonds have devalued quite sharply. So any color on that would be very useful.</p>
          <p>And then secondly just on, again sticking with Eurozone, on Spanish mortgages, the total provision you've got there, impairment allowance rather, is 54 basis points. Can you give us some comfort as to why that would be enough, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding residential property valuations in Spain? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jon. Robert, do you want to take those? And Chris, if you want to add anything, please do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would only start, but Chris please jump in as well. On the first part of the question there's a difference in the way the EBA presented its data, which was on what we call an exposure at default basis. So those numbers were exposure at default. What we presented in the financial results are accounting and balance sheet positions. So it's simply a different measurement. Our positions to Italy didn't really jump, and overall our structural hedge positions and capital market positions to Spain, Italy, et cetera have been reducing on a slightly &#x2013; they are represented in the accounts on a fair value basis.</p>
          <p>I won't go any further into the accounting because I would defer that area to Chris. But you can't do a like-for-like comparison of EBA numbers and financial statement numbers. What we have disclosed here is more complete, and I think also very transparent to try to break it out to an even greater level of detail.</p>
          <p>On the Spain mortgages, we're very comfortable with the position we have there. Let me just take a moment and tell you a bit about our business there. Mortgages in Spain are mostly primary residences. They are mainly in urban areas. We have very little lending on the coasts to holiday properties. We have very few expat mortgages, for example. The LTVs are conservative. There's a current 58% current market, current market 58% loan-to-value. And even over the last couple of years, our early and late cycle delinquencies in Spanish mortgages have not increased very much.</p>
          <p>We have a tiny amount of stock in charge-off. It's only about &#xA3;300 million, less than 2% of the book, and we value each of those houses on an individual-by-individual basis. We don't look at HPI indexes for that. And so we're very comfortable that our CRL coverage ratio of 37% is adequate, and the book continues to perform well. I think we would wish to have better margins in that book, but the impairment performance is fine. And by the way, new business vintages over the last two years have been performing even better. So we're happy with the credit performance of the Spanish mortgage book.</p>

Thanks, and then just a follow-up on Italy, if I may, because I know your point about the different methods for disclosure that you make, but I think if you look at the Spanish sovereign or the Greek or Portuguese or Irish, the moves there were very small. I think they were slightly down in most of those countries, sovereign. Italy is marked a little different from everything else, so just because somewhat <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:28) there is that actually if <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:30) sovereign exposure has fallen a bit, it's just something peculiar really that makes it look like it's risen a lot?</p>

          <p>Sorry. I didn't mean to jump in. My apologies there. One thing that's not in here is the maturity of the book. In Italy, the portfolio is heavily short term so the price move from the spread widening or yield curve widening is less pronounced. There certainly have been some moves in July, but there aren't any large hidden problems in these numbers at all either.</p>

          <p>Listen, I want to say thank you for taking the time. This is the first time that we've done our results this way. We'd love to get your feedback. We're sorry if we didn't look at the camera a few times, because this is all new to us, but hopefully it went well for you. If you have feedback, please feed it through Stephen. If there's further questions, let Stephen know, and we'll try and get back to you promptly. Thank you very much.</p>
