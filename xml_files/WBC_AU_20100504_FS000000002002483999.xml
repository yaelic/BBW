          <p>Well good morning everyone and welcome to Westpac's 2010 Interim Result. My name is Andrew Bowden. I'm Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning of course is Gail Kelly, our CEO, and Phil Coffey, our CFO; and as per normal, we'll go through a presentation before we open up for Q&amp;A. Thanks very much.</p>
          <p>Gail, if you'd like to come up in the front, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much Andrew and good morning all. Thanks for joining us, be it here in Westpac Place or via the telephone or the webcast. I'm pleased to be here today presenting the Westpac Group's first half 2010 results. All of the team are here with me today, with the exception of George Frazis, who's on the phone from New Zealand.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do is start by reflecting on the key messages of the result. Firstly, with cash earnings up a strong 30% we see this as a good result. As the cycle has played its way through, we benefited from having a strong diversified portfolio. Those businesses most affected early on by the downturn have bounced back strongly.</p>
          <p>WIB is the best example of this. First half last year, it was severely impacted by an impairment charge of over 900 million. And this half, it has an impairment charge of less than 10% of that, coming in at 73 million.</p>
          <p>Each of our businesses have a story to tell, and I'll touch on that shortly.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the result reflects key strategic choices that we've made during the global financial crisis and the economic downturn. In essence, these strategic choices reflect a determination to invest in our business for the long term. We made a clear choice to strengthen our capital position and to materially improve the quality of our funding.</p>
          <p>The changes to our funding profile are particularly noteworthy. We've lengthened the tenor of our short and our long term funding books, and we've materially strengthened our liquidity profile. Of course this has come at a cost, but we see it as an investment in our future.</p>
          <p>A further explicit choice we've made is to be there for our customers, to support them in their borrowing needs, support them with advice and practical assistance. There are many examples I could point to across all of our segments and geographies. But to give just two evident in this first half's results, first would be the substantial and comprehensive reductions we've made to bank fees, benefiting retail and business customers; and the second element is the support we provided to customers needing a home loan.</p>
          <p>Our preparedness to be open for business for customers looking for a home loan where many other financial services companies, for whatever reason, were not there, has meant that we added two percentage points of market share in the Australian mortgage market from 25% to 27%. And it's only in very unusual circumstances that this sort of organic growth is possible. The last time such organic shifts in market share occurred was in the early 1990s after the last crisis.</p>
          <p>The third key strategic choice we've made was to significantly invest in our distribution, in our people and in our technology. This investment continued throughout the crisis and included opening 19 new branches last year while others were winding back. It also included the appointment of over 600 bank managers, the cornerstone of our Westpac local approach. This investment has strengthened our strategic position and is already delivering in terms of business momentum.</p>
          <p>Another key message I want to pass on today is that the merger with St. George, which has now passed its first year anniversary, is going very well. Indeed St. George is stronger than ever and is assisting the group in its broader strategic transformation, which is also progressing well, and I'll talk to this later.</p>
          <p>Finally, although both the Australian and New Zealand economies have materially improved, we are advocates for caution. I'm always concerned when people talk of the GFC as being over implying that we're back to normal. Because to the contrary, there is no doubt we'll be living with the effects and the consequences of this crisis for many years to come.</p>
          <p>So turning to the financial scorecard &#x2013; as already mentioned, cash earnings are up 30% on the first half '09, and cash earnings per share are up 22%. Core earnings are up 5%, a solid performance in this environment. The big positive effect on this half's results is the material reduction in impairments. Impairment charges to average loans now stand at 37 basis points, down from 73 at both March and September last year.</p>
          <p>It's also good to see the improvement in ROE up to 16.6%, notwithstanding our significant merger completing less than 18 months ago. Our cost-to-income ratio has improved again and remains sector leading. Productivity will certainly remain a key focus for us.</p>
          <p>This slide, while somewhat busy, helps display how our portfolio of businesses has collectively delivered through the cycle. You can see in the first half '09 results column that WIB and our Wealth business were the two divisions initially impacted by the global financial crisis. While those divisions saw their earnings fall sharply in that period, it was partly offset by improved results from our Australian retail and business bank franchise, which were initially less impacted by the crisis. The downturn in WIB and in Wealth were relatively short term, but they were severe.</p>
          <p>And both businesses have now produced two halves of positive growth. They've also emerged from the crisis with stronger franchises. The team at BT has done an excellent job in managing the integration work with the St. George Wealth businesses, leaving us a stronger product, platform and distribution capability. WIB has strengthened its customer relationships over the period of the crisis.</p>
          <p>These positive performances from WIB and Wealth have in part offset softer recent performances from Westpac Retail and Business Bank and from St. George. Impairment charges in these businesses did not pick up until the second half of '09 when greater numbers of SME and commercial customers started to show signs of stress. Westpac, RBB and St. George have also been impacted by higher funding costs and by the material reduction in bank fees charged to our customers. Both businesses, however, had excellent underlying momentum and have grown market share.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, which had a particularly disappointing second half last year, is an improving story. Earnings bounced back this half after absorbing the impact of two large impaired assets in the second half of '09. New Zealand still has some way to go to restore its performance, although it has been encouraging to see good gains in market share across both consumer and business in the half. This is the result of strong management focus and investment that George Frazis has been putting in place.</p>
          <p>In my key messages slide, I spoke to the clear, strategic choice we've made to support customers through the cycle and remain open for business. And this slide gives further detail on home lending and our 2% gain in market share. We're particularly pleased to have assisted 60,000 new homebuyers into their first homes.</p>
          <p>This is a segment we understand well and it's a segment that, despite popular belief, performs very well through economic cycles. What we have found is that over the long run, first home loan borrowers perform better than the average of our residential lending portfolio; and the most recent cohort of first home borrowers is performing in line with this experience. Indeed, with property prices having improved across the country, those first homebuyers we assisted last year now have a healthier level of equity in their homes.</p>
          <p>If I can turn your attention to the box on the bottom right hand side of this slide, you can see that our relationship with our home loan customers averages more than 11 years. Our portfolio run-off is at historic very low levels, lower than a year ago, and we are focused on deepening relationships with our mortgage customers, both existing and new. So all in all, our 355,000 new mortgages and two percentage points uplift in market share has resulted in substantially more customer relationships we'll be supporting for the long term.</p>
          <p>This slide speaks to our strength in institutional and business relationships. In WIB, Rob Whitfield and his team have done an excellent job in getting closer to customers through the crisis, and these stronger relationships position us well as the cycle turns. This proactive constructive approach has seen WIB extend its lead on key customer metrics, including relationship strength and lead bank. WIB also has outstanding transactional banking capabilities and it's good to see how well this part of the division has performed. Lastly, capital markets are beginning to expand, as you can see on the slide, and pleasingly in each category, WIB is number one in market share.</p>
          <p>In business banking, we've added around 470 new business and specialist bankers to our networks, the majority in Westpac Australia, but also additions in St. George and in New Zealand. Significant focus is going to training and development for both relationship managers and our risk teams. In St. George, we've strengthened our capability in segments other than property, and St. George continues to perform very well in terms of customer advocacy, particularly in its key account managed relationship segments. This past year, credit demand has been soft. We've recently seen an improvement in our pipelines and we are ready for the expected pickup later this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the St. George merger, which has been a key focus over the last 18 months, I'm pleased to say we remain ahead or on target in all key areas. In lots of ways, for an in-market merger, this is quite a remarkable story. Conventional wisdom is that in the first 18 months of a merger, one experiences customer attrition, lower levels of customer satisfaction and issues with employee morale.</p>
          <p>The opposite has been true here. We've grown customer numbers, we've grown market share, we've increased the depth of relationship with customers. Our customer net promoter score, which is a measure of advocacy or preparedness to recommend, has improved, and St. George's lead over the average of the major banks has actually widened. Employee engagement has also increased. St. George's brand position of being small enough to care, but big enough to deliver is stronger than ever.</p>
          <p>BankSA, which is a gem of a business, continues to power along with excellent growth, outstanding credit quality through the cycle and high levels of customer advocacy. Indeed, BankSA, which is being run as a standalone sales service and distribution business within the context of St. George for many years, has provided us with the best practice model for implementing our multi-brand approach across the group.</p>
          <p>On the operational sides of the merger, we've hit every milestone from employee appointments early in the process, to the integration of key systems, and more recently the transition to a single ADI. These have been very major projects and the team has managed them effectively and efficiently, leaving us very confident of our merger synergies. Looking ahead, further upside remains as we continue to leverage the advantages of operating multi-brands and realize the significant benefits of operational scale.</p>
          <p>Earlier, I spoke of key strategic choices we've made. These choices are reflected in the transformation agenda we began in mid-2008. Two years ago, we set out to shift our company from being product and head office oriented, to being customer and distribution focused. We're underway with shifting the culture and mode of operation from being lending oriented to being more relationship focused, driving customer advocacy, which is a significantly more powerful measure than the simple concept of customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>With our merger with St. George, we now have a multi-brand business offering more choice to more customers. At the same time, we're working hard to drive and embed a one team culture to deliver the best outcomes for customers, and this contrasts with our previous more siloed approach. Our strategy is clearly about being an integrated financial services company, and hence our focus on wealth capability and wealth cross-sell to our customers.</p>
          <p>I recognized two years ago that our technology platform was unreliable, fragmented and underinvested. It was a key concern. Since then, we've made tremendous progress, materially improving the stability of our technology environment for both customers and our people. We've also begun the process of enhancing our infrastructure for the long term, in line with our technology strategy and roadmap.</p>
          <p>The financial crisis has also transformed the way we think about our balance sheet. Before the crisis, capital efficiency and funding cost efficiency were what we aimed for. This is no longer the case. We've transformed our position with more higher quality capital and with a materially higher quality funding profile.</p>
          <p>In summary, the past two years have seen a very significant reshaping of our business. We've made good progress this half, but we have lots more to do.</p>
          <p>So in the lots more to do category, and looking to the balance of this year, our priorities are to consolidate our customer gains and to work hard to further deepen relationships to earn all our customers' business.</p>
          <p>For Westpac Local, we have the building blocks in place. Rob Coombe and his team are now setting about bedding down the model, learning and sharing best practice and executing well. Our bank managers are a great example. The more than 600 leaders we have on the ground are doing a great job. And with most having worked in their roles for less than 12 months, there's more upside to come.</p>
          <p>Investment in our people and in technology will be ongoing. Productivity gains are a strategic imperative for us and this is a key element of Peter Hanlon's new transformational role. Over the next period, we will be increasing our focus here.</p>
          <p>On running a multi-brand company, we've learned a lot, and will be working to extend our capabilities further and take advantages of the opportunities the multi-brand model provides. And of course with regard to our balance sheet, we will continue to position ourselves well for the pending regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>After Phil's presentation, I'll say a few words about the outlook. So let me now hand over to Phil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks Gail and good morning everyone. Let me start with a quick summary of the numbers, and I'm going to focus on cash earnings in my presentation. Adjustments to the statutory figures are detailed in the ASX report and they are relatively straightforward and consistent with prior periods.</p>
          <p>I look to comment on changes from the immediate prior period and from the prior corresponding period where relevant.</p>
          <p>You can see that most of the 30% uplift in cash earnings in the first half of 2010 was due to the material reduction in impairment charges that were down almost 50% when compared to each of the last two halves. That said, we have had a good increase in core earnings &#x2013; and core earnings is our measure of revenue less expenses &#x2013; and that's up 5% over the prior corresponding period with revenues 4% higher and a moderate cost growth of 2%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share growth has lowered cash earnings a little because of the capital that we raised in early 2009. However, that impact will moderate, and you can see that at 26% EPS growth over the prior period, our EPS and cash earnings growth rates are quite similar.</p>
          <p>When looking at the components of growth, you can see that the drivers of earnings over the past two periods are quite different. In the second half of '09, the slightly higher result was driven by stronger net interest income, which to a large extent was driven by treasury. Despite an improvement in Wealth revenue in that half, non-interest income actually declined with trading in particular lower. Impairment charges were also softer, but remained elevated. In the first half of 2010, the picture's quite different. Net interest income was unchanged, with growth across the portfolio largely offset by lower treasury result.</p>
          <p>There was a lot of activity within the non-interest income sector &#x2013; and I'll break that out later, but overall, it had a good contribution to the bottom line. And so it was lower impairment charges which were the obvious driver of the improved performance, and that's particularly the case in the institutional bank.</p>
          <p>Now the context for this result is also relevant, and before looking in detail at some of the components of the P&amp;L, I did want to step back and look at a slightly longer period of earnings.</p>
          <p>Over the past two years, we've achieved a material uplift in core earnings, up some 30% on the first half of 2008, and that excludes any merger impact. This was broadly based across all the Australian divisions and it drove a 22% growth in cash earnings over that period.</p>
          <p>Core earnings growth has eased back over the past two halves, but given the extraordinary growth achieved in the prior periods, that's not surprising, particularly given the more severe impacts of higher funding costs and our decision to significantly reduce customer exception fees. However, what we are now seeing is that as impairment charges are reducing, the underlying improvement in the franchise is flowing through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We have been dealing with some headwinds to revenue growth over the half, so I'll spend some time giving more detail on that.</p>
          <p>Turning to net interest income, growth was just over 6% over the prior corresponding period, but unchanged over the prior period. The flat picture over the prior period needs some explanation, because it suggests the good volume growth that we've achieved has been fully offset by margin decline. However, what you can see in this slide is that while margins have declined, the customer related net interest income is a more consistent story. It's up around 3.5% over each of the last two halves.</p>
          <p>The swing factor in this measure has of course been market related, particularly treasury, as much of its earnings are included in our net interest income. WIB markets income recorded as interest has also been a factor in the flat net interest income recorded this half.</p>
          <p>The margin story is an important one, and so the next couple of slides will go through the key drivers of our income. If we look at the components of margins, you can see that the consumer and business margins are down some eight basis points over the half. The decline in margins in that segment essentially comes down to two factors, higher funding costs and mix impacts, both asset and liability mix. The higher funding costs reduced margins by 12 basis points. The mix effect reduced margins by four basis points, two basis points each in assets and liabilities. Offsetting that, asset repricing added eight basis points to margins so the net impact of those three elements is a net down eight basis points in margins. Institutional spreads, however, were higher over the prior half as much of the repricing of that portfolio to reflect the market has now been completed. Establishment fees and line fees recorded as interest income also contributed to the WIB spreads.</p>
          <p>As I touched on earlier, treasury's contribution eased over the half and the margin was 10 basis points lower, both from lower treasury interest income and from holding higher levels of liquid assets. Our margin decline reflects both the growth in the balance sheet and the components of that growth, and in these areas, the Westpac Group position is quite different to some of our peers. This slide highlights the major elements of growth in our balance sheet over the past six months and so let me step through it.</p>
          <p>We have had strong above-system growth in mortgages, which has more than offset some decline in business lending, which was mostly at the institutional end. Our mortgage growth, as Gail said, was a very conscious decision. Opportunities to materially increase market share in a sustainable manner come around infrequently, and we were more than happy to meet the customer demand for new mortgages. This strong growth had two margin impacts. It stimulated an acceleration in term wholesale funding at the higher market spreads and as mortgages became a bigger part of our overall balance sheet, we had a negative mix impact on margins.</p>
          <p>In funding this growth, we've also looked to ensure we didn't compromise our risk and so we've lengthened the wholesale book and raised more term deposits. Both actions had a negative impact on margins. The lengthening of the wholesale book has been going on for some time and in fact over the past 18 months, the total wholesale book has lengthened in duration by over one year. Lastly, we've also increased our holdings of liquid assets and improved the quality of those assets. So the bottom line of that is that our decision to stay open for business and strengthen our balance sheet has meant that we've had a more rapid decline in margins.</p>
          <p>Switching to non-interest income, and there are a few moving parts over the past three halves. On the components and looking at the left hand side of this slide, trading has been quite volatile through the latter periods of the GFC while Wealth has steadily improved and Other has switched from negative to more positive. On the Other component, much of that was due to the asset and the investment write-downs that we processed in both halves of 2009, whereas in 2010, there were no further write-downs and indeed we had a couple of asset sales including some airport holdings in the Hastings business.</p>
          <p>The largest component of non-interest is fees and commissions, and the numbers reported have declined over both of the last two halves, but for quite different reasons. So looking at the right hand side of the slide, and if we start in the first half of '09, revenue in that period benefited from the Qantas loyalty point redemptions that we talked about last year. That wasn't repeated in the second half of '09. The move to direct ATM charging also saw a reduction in our income. In the latest half, our decision to reduce the fees paid by customers for account exceptions had a material $158 million impact.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rest of the fee portfolio, there have been some positive trends, particularly in the corporate and institutional book, where we are now charging more appropriately for undrawn credit lines. And we're also seeing some fee growth consistent with the increased activity in our book.</p>
          <p>I talked about the impact of lower treasury interest income in the half, but the contribution does remain very healthy. In WIB markets we saw some pick up in the half and most of that activity continues to be from good customer flows. FX revenue recovered modestly but is still well down on the prior corresponding period, and we had seen a number of foreign banks re-enter that market and they've done so principally using a price-led strategy. And so market spreads have contracted quite rapidly over the period.</p>
          <p>Debt markets, on the other hand, had a good performance, with good sales and tighter credit spreads assisting returns. If we look at treasury and markets together as businesses impacted by market conditions, we reported a slightly lower overall performance against prior periods, as we expected and flagged last year. That said the returns have remained relatively high.</p>
          <p>As Gail mentioned, our two standout divisions this half were WIB and BT and WIB has been relatively well covered, so let me just say a few words regarding BT. We reported a very healthy increase in cash earnings, up 40% over the PCP, supported by strong growth in average fund balances. Improving markets did have a significant impact on earnings for the year, although this would understate the excellent work that BT has done in managing that business. On the cost line, for example, BT has materially improved its productivity, holding expenses largely flat for the last two years.</p>
          <p>The funds management business has been the key driver. It's up 28% over the prior corresponding half and funds under administration has been the particular strength. We continue to capture around 1 in every $4 into the platform segment. In insurance, the business is relatively small, but with our large distribution base we are consistently winning share and there's further upside as we bring the St. George cross sell rates up to the level we have achieved with Westpac. There's been a bit of noise in insurance over recent halves, mainly from claims from storm activity. And in the latest half, the severe storms in Melbourne and Perth impacted. That said, we managed this business conservatively; and with strong reinsurance contracts, the impact on our bottom line from these events has been relatively modest. We also in the half took the decision to outsource a higher portion of our mortgage insurance, and this has reduced some of the higher margin premium income received in this business.</p>
          <p>Now turning to expenses, and as we indicated in our first quarter update, expense growth is now tracking below the 5% run rate of last year with expenses up just 2% over the prior corresponding half. The lower growth in the last six months can be attributed to the additional merger synergies we have achieved along with the fixed salary freeze for executives.</p>
          <p>We've also completed a range of other productivity initiatives across the group. As Gail has touched on, 2010 also marked the commencement of a number of major strategic projects to substantially improve our frontline capability and our infrastructure. This is a large program of work and more detail is provided in our discussion pack.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that this program is centralizing actually a range of project activity from around the group to better support multiple brands. And as a result, while the program is large, its incremental impact on cost is manageable. While the direct project costs on P&amp;L will rise with increasing amortization, many of these projects are related to combining Westpac and St. George, product and operational platforms. And in addition to enhancing capability they bring with them significant efficiency benefits.</p>
          <p>The mortgage processing is probably one of the better examples, but we currently have separate systems for Westpac, for RAMS and for St. George. And while we're beginning to benefit from the application of best practice across those three areas, we're only scratching the surface in terms of the gains that we can make by bringing processing together on a single system. The key message here is that we are effectively managing the expense profile of this program of work but it will be a feature of our future cost trajectory and we will continue to call this out for you.</p>
          <p>Switching to asset quality, we've now had three consecutive quarters with little change in the percent of stressed exposures and that's a good sign that asset quality has stabilized. I say stabilized because we are still seeing downgrades within the stress facilities. So while the environment has improved and we have seen a handful of upgrades we are still seeing more downgrades.</p>
          <p>What is encouraging, though, is that we're now spending the bulk of our time working through existing stress rather than worrying about new emerging issues. I should also note that the modest increase in impaired assets in the half is an accurate representation of the trend in new impaireds as write offs were quite small at 125 million in the half.</p>
          <p>As we pointed out last year, commercial property has been the sector for us that has been most under stress, and the majority of the downgrades over the half have been in this sector. We have, however, materially reduced our exposures in total to property over the last 12 months. As the de-gearing of this sector has unfolded and projects completed we've used the opportunity to take three percentage points of our total commercial property exposure, which now represents 9.6% of total loans. However, we are still lending to this sector and in fact we have approved over $1 billion of new commercial property lending over the past six months.</p>
          <p>Last year we called out that the two segments under most stress were development property and New Zealand. Over the half we've seen an improvement in New Zealand. However, there's been some further deterioration in development properties greater than $10 million. The increase in stress in this sector has been principally due to changes in valuations and that's led us to downgrade within stress or in some cases to impaired. However, given security levels generally remain good for these exposures the impact on provisioning has been quite modest.</p>
          <p>This slide looks at the composition of impairment changes on a quarter by quarter basis and it speaks to how the cycle is playing out through the various sectors. Over the last two quarters the key movements have been in institutional with no new large provisions raised and a contraction in the book, we've seen a material reduction in impairment charges. And it's also been pleasing to see a reduction in bad debts in New Zealand, particularly in the most recent quarter. Last year we also saw a significant pick up in impairment charges related to Australian business customers. This was to a large extent due to the commercial property sector but also from smaller companies impacted by the slowdown in growth.</p>
          <p>We have seen a small rise in smaller company impaired assets but in aggregate impairment charges related to business customers has eased. Consumers continue to perform well but as we alluded to last year, this sector is typically the last to be impacted through a slowdown and that trend continues to play out. As a result, the proportion of consumer losses in our impairment charges has increased, particularly in the last quarter. And this is also reflected in our delinquencies, particularly in unsecured personal. Losses on mortgages remained very low and the overall portfolio is performing very well.</p>
          <p>Our capital generation picked up over the half with a tier one ratio up 53 basis points. The driver of the improvement has been cash earnings with a return on equity of nearly 17%. Net dividends took just under a half of that increase once the DRP is factored in. A feature of this stage of the cycle is that risk weighted asset growth has been relatively modest. In the current half, credit risk weighted assets are little changed, with growth in mortgages offset by lower business lending and a reduction in undrawn commitments. Other factors affecting our capital ratio were broadly offsetting in the half. Pleasingly as the chart shows the increase in tier one was totally in the highest quality fundamental capital ratio. Given our strong capital levels and healthy capital generation, we are very comfortable with our position.</p>
          <p>On dividends, we increased the dividend to $0.65 a share, a 16% rise over the prior corresponding period. Market expectations for the dividend were a couple of cents higher than this level, so I thought it would be helpful to outline our position. In thinking about the dividend we have previously indicated that we aim for an average payout ratio of around 70% and with a gradually improving dividend trajectory. This is more difficult to maintain with greater degrees of half to half earnings volatility, and you can see that in the second half of '09 we had a higher than average payout ratio at 76% and in this half the payout is a little lower than the average at 65%. But that payout will tend to average out over time. We are, of course, also very mindful that considerable uncertainties still exist in the outlook, including regulatory change and given we are seeking to maintain a sustainable dividend growth path we prefer to err slightly on the conservative side.</p>
          <p>Looking forward and the factors expected to impact performance are likely to be similar to those we've been dealing with over the past six months. In particular, we have achieved good growth in the balance sheet and from what we can see in the pipeline that growth will continue. We will have more moderate growth in mortgages more like one time system, while business lending will likely increase as borrowing intentions are beginning to build. Our wealth average balances also look likely to further improve. On the flip side, funding costs will be a headwind for a bit longer yet and our strategic decision to continue lending and fund in a sustainable way will continue. As we look at it today, the rate of increase in our cost of funds though should moderate in the next half.</p>
          <p>We've also sought to highlight over recent halves that treasury and markets income may moderate as stability returns to the market, and so we may also see more of this. We expect expenses to be well managed, although we are investing in an infrastructure which will deliver material longer term benefits. Lastly, our impairment provisioning remains sector leadings, whilst many of our other measures of our book highlight a relatively lower risk. We've already had a steep decline in impairment charges, but we do look strongly positioned.</p>
          <p>So when I take all of these factors into account and given the slightly better than expected first half outcome, additional earnings growth in the second half will be challenging. Now let me hand back to Gail for the outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Phil. Okay, so turning to the outlook &#x2013; and I'm recalling that at our last full year results presentation I spoke of being cautiously optimistic. So reflecting on what is it that I am now, fair to say I'm still both optimistic and I'm cautious. So my reasons for optimism are many. They include the improved and improving Australian economy. Indeed the Australian economy has rebounded more quickly than expected. Unemployment remains low. At this time a year ago we were talking of a potential 8.5% unemployment rate, potentially even higher, and as we now all know it never reached 6%.</p>
          <p>The household sector's remained particularly resilient, as we thought it would, and housing prices have rebounded strongly over the past 12 months. While the demand for business credit has been very soft over the past year, it's good to see a buildup in activity with our pipeline increasing. And in the commercial property market which was hard hit during the economic crisis, there are clear signs of stabilization. Credit growth, as a result, is on an upward trajectory. We're forecasting system credit growth to strengthen to around 4% through this calendar year and then further strengthen in 2011. Housing credit is likely to remain constant at around 8%, with business credit increasing from its negative position this year &#x2013; negative potentially around 3 to positive 6% next year.</p>
          <p>The strength in the commodity sector and our connection to the Chinese economy has been a major underpinning for overall growth and this is likely to be a feature for some years to come. New Zealand is now recovering from a prolonged recessionary period. So these are clear positives for us. The reason for caution goes to the uncertainties in the broader environment. The global financial crisis was an extraordinary international economic and financial upheaval, and recovery from such stress is seldom in a straight line, nor are the impacts felt evenly. One of the impacts we've felt and continue to feel in Australia is the increase in our overall cost of funding. The higher Australian dollar is also having its impact, and these will be factors for some time to come.</p>
          <p>A further key effect of the crisis is the significant fit of capital and liquidity regulatory changes we know are coming our way. Of course there's lots of work to be done here, conversations to be had at the G20 political level and <mark type="inaudible" /> committees and locally, to agree upon the final shape and the transition approach. The last time I spoke about this, I indicated that I believe that I thought all the right people are across the issues and the significance of the potential implications, and again I believe this to be the case. And ultimately I think we will get to outcomes that are workable here, but it will take time.</p>
          <p>On interest rates, it's good to see that the Reserve Bank considers that as a result of yesterday's decision, rates for most borrowers will be at around average levels. This suggests that there will now be a pause before the next increase sometime later this year. When that next increase occurs, it will likely be in response to growing inflationary pressures.</p>
          <p>So I'll finish by saying that the Westpac Group has come through the past two years significantly stronger than it went in. Our business is stronger in every respect &#x2013; a multi-brand group with many more customers, a material uplift in distribution, growth and market share, and a much strengthened higher quality balance sheet.</p>
          <p>What we're about is running a sustainable business for the long run, and so right up front in this presentation I called out key strategic choices we've made to significantly improve our capital and strengthen our liquidity profile and funding profile, to remain open for business actively supporting our customers through the crisis while many others weren't, and to materially invest in the business, distribution, people and technology. To add to that, our strategic decision to merge with St. George, and what you have is a business that is materially reshaped; and I think this result of this half year shows that we are making good progress.</p>
          <p>Well thank you all for being here today and listening, and Phil and I will now take questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks Andrew. Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just to get some further clarity on some of the margin trends that we saw in that last half. At the first quarter trading update you flagged margins, you said margins were flat. They've declined 11 basis points half on half, which suggests that the second quarter margin must have been down 20 basis points or something of that magnitude to average out 11 basis point decline. Can you just give some further clarity &#x2013; I think you've mentioned that you're having high liquids on the balance sheet? Clearly the treasury contribution to the net interest income is also weaker, but it doesn't seem to explain such a dramatic shift over just the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The averaging here hasn't helped us. But anyway, the major factors that have taken place in the quarter really are to start with treasury, and that's both lower interest income in the quarter versus the first quarter. And also as you pointed out liquid assets, higher holdings of liquid assets, which actually on average are up quite a lot in the quarter. And the type of assets that we held were a better quality asset than the bank paper that we had been holding and that we continue to hold in the portfolio, so that was the major impact.</p>
          <p>We had in the institutional bank some mix impacts in the quarter as well, and so that was the second major impact and together they account for about 75% of that drop. And then lastly in terms of across all of the other customer influences, when you look at the quarter effectively whilst we had some asset repricing we also had the flow through of that higher wholesale cost of funds, which we talked about both in terms of having more of it but also having longer term funding and a period of very extensive deposit pricing in the market, and so the confluence of all those factors also led to some margin decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that second quarter margin is probably a right base then, a more normalized base for us going forward, or do you still expect further pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to call out because some of those influences have got some volatility in them. Treasury earnings is clear one of those, but the higher level of liquid assets we've moved to we feel very comfortable with and we think we should be maintaining that kind of level. The average will continue to roll through but we've already had a big step up in that average and so that won't be as big an impact. And in terms of other sources of pressure, the wholesale cost of funds we can see and we can see that that's going to continue to scroll through. Though as I said, I think that that's going to increase at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last half. Deposit pricing is also a big variable and so in the last month deposit pricings looked a lot better. Whether that continues for the half is a judgment call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd certainly be hopeful to see customer margins &#x2013; the rate of declines slow. So we had eight basis points between our business and consumer margin over this half. We'd expect to see some further reduction in margin for consumers &#x2013; that's including retail and business &#x2013; but not of the same order.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Phil, if I can grab onto a comment you made finally. You said additional earnings growth will be difficult in the second half. Can I just sort of whether that's referenced around sort of your &#x2013; the cash earnings or the core earnings sort of figure you're talking about and if you see some small improvement in the fact debt charge is still going forward, does that mean that actually core earnings may actually go backwards in the short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm extremely careful about not giving guidance Jarrod, as you will all know and actually I used the term challenging rather than difficult, because a number of those factors will play out. When we look at all of those variables, each variable has a range of outcomes and so I think it's actually inappropriate to try to be as explicit as perhaps you'd like. But I do think it's appropriate to say we've had a very material uplift in our cash earnings this half and we know &#x2013; and we've been talking about the benefit of the impairment charge that we got, as a consequence of that. And so with such a big step up, it is going to be challenging to maintain that sort of level of cash earnings, challenging.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jon Mott from UBS. Just got a question about the net stable funding ratio. It's something that you've probably just put your submission in to the QIS to <mark type="inaudible" /> recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to get a feel for or if you could give us an indication of where you are on that. You've given us your own internal stable funding, both the net stable funding ratio. And also, if you do need to get to that 100% in 30 months or so by the end of 2012, what that will require for amount of additional term funding. And also, well, you've got a lot of political pressure on putting through rate rises which we saw about in December. What's that going to mean to your margin if you roll that forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So look, the net stable funding ratio we have shared with you our own measure using our definition of customer deposits. I think we're still working through with the regulator how to look at and how to model various levels of deposit and various levels of outflow and the liquid assets that qualify, whether it be a 30 day stress event or a three month stress event. So I think that there's still way too much water to go under the bridge to be talking about that. When we have greater clarity and when we think that it's clearer as to what's going to be required and how those measures will be calculated, I'll be happy to share it then but I think it's too early Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it would be fair to say that there's very extensive conversation across the industry and a really good awareness and understanding of the impacts of the quantitative impact studies on Australia and indeed more broadly. So I think the next few months are quite crucial, and I think we will see negotiations, discussion more clarity. It won't come out as draconian, as tough as it looks when you look at it on face value now, because that would put us in a very difficult position. So it will &#x2013; it's got a lot of work to go.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Craig Williams from Citi here. I suppose on a somewhat related note, Australian banks I think are top 10 banks when you look at wholesale funding as a percentage of assets and I think on that stable funding ratio we're probably going to have around 70% at an average suggestion this obligation to term out will continue. So what do you think of the prospects of the government providing tax reform to help drive stronger bank deposit growth and are there considerations being given within Westpac to sourcing perhaps more deposit funding at stronger liquidity pools in Asia or the Middle East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly The Henry Report, if you look at the full elements of The Henry Report, have put that on the agenda as one of the elements that they are tabling for consideration. The government have tackled the first set of reform in what they've announced so far, but they have flagged that there's a further step that they're going to be addressing and looking at over the next month. And in that, they've flagged that they're going to look at the Henry elements that go to creating incentives to save and improving the funding pool for us here domestically within Australia. So certainly that's encouraging and certainly we in the industry will be working with the government in order to try and facilitate that that occurs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the Asia deposit pools, look I think that's a fascinating question for Australian banks as to clearly there are big pools of savings in Asia that it would be very effective for us to have as sources of funding. There's lot of questions though that go into, quite frankly do those deposit pools, when they come onto an Australian bank balance sheet actually qualify as net stable funding? If you've raised the funds from a financial corp or from a large industrial corporation and it's for a month or to something shorter, does that qualify as stable funding? It may, it may not. Then what's the flexibility with which those funds can be used somewhere outside of their own jurisdiction? So there's quite a lot of issues to both solve with the regulator and obviously with the investors to find ways to make those sources of funds as valuable as you can.</p>
          <p>It's actually those kind of issues that we have to work through into great detail, to work through how we will as an industry, ensure that we've got the right kind of funding model in Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a strategy point of view, and you've heard me talk about this repeatedly, we are very focused on improving our own deposit raising capabilities through our own network. We have a very sizable customer base through our multi brands and we're moving from being quite lending oriented, I mean that's certainly the history and the traditions of our banking group, to be much more relationship focused. So at the core of every relationship lies a retail deposit or a transaction account or in a business sense, transactional banking. So that's a very fundamental piece of our overarching strategy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tom Quarmby from Macquarie. Phil, at the first quarter trading update, you cautioned us not to annualize the first quarter impairment cost of around 400 million. We probably should have done that for this half, but I note your comment in the pack that impairment charges will reflect more stable asset quality going forward. Can you give us an idea, is that the same kind of charge we have seen in the first half?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Once again, averages have undone me here, but because you wouldn't have done &#x2013; if you multiply it by two, you wouldn't have got to 870 million odd. But anyway, the challenge of having quarterlies are, I reckon.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. Look I think we've got another quarter of experience behind us in terms of what's happening to our stressed exposures. That gives us another quarter of confidence that we have seen the stabilization and the fact that the economy appears to be on a good footing, notwithstanding the fact that these rising interest rates will also take some of the heat out of growth.</p>
          <p>Overall I think what we would &#x2013; without getting into guidance again &#x2013; we would say that given that stabilization, the kind of trend you're seeing in impairment charges still is about right. We should be able to see, given the quality of our book and given the provisioning we've got, we should be able to see impairment charges over time reduced.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Just wanting to ask a bit around the margin, you've raised as you mentioned the significant amount of funding at high cost to actually fund the growth that you've had over the last six to 12 months. That obviously leaves you in a difficult position in terms of the actual asset pricing side of the equation, in order to earn pretty similar margins to your peers, you've obviously got it priced a little more expensively. I'm just wondering, so when you trade off volume and margin, how does that situation look if we suddenly get to a situation with Westpac growing subsystem, do we get larger margins of clients for a longer period of time out of Westpac than what we'll get out of peers.</p>
          <p>Just a second one if I can, just quickly, you mentioned trading income will be hard to replicate the first half 2010 levels, just wanting to know how far we are away from normal levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first one. I was very keen to try and explain the overarching strategy that we've taken. What we're about is running the organization for the long run, so building a sustainable business for the long run. So the choices that we've made were very clear, very deliberate, very specific choices, choices to strengthen our funding profile, that was a clear deliberate choice that we wanted to make and improve the quality of our overall funding. So we've done the heavy lifting in that regard. So a lot of that work is behind us, so that's a good position for us to be in from a going forward point of view.</p>
          <p>The other element was to be there for our customers and actually stand up and be counted when it got to the opportunities around mortgage growth. And, you know, it's a one in a decade opportunity to organically grow your mortgage position two percentage points in a year when you start from a starting base of 25%, so that's very material for us. Mortgages is an asset we know, an asset we understand, it's a high quality asset, with deep customer relationships that actually stay with us. So we're really pleased to have written that business.</p>
          <p>Having said that, with regard to the margin side of things, I think we've outlined that clearly already. Clearly we've been in the vanguard of the funding pressures. Some of that will begin to moderate for us because we've done the hard work on the funding side and we're seeing some moderation with regard to the regional deposit pricing side, so that's working in our favor.</p>
          <p>From an overall point of view of mortgages, we're aiming to now grow at or around system growth, so we've claimed the additional market share, we intend to look after those customers, deepen the relationships with those customers, but not lose market share. So others are coming back into the market, we're pleased about that. We want to retain that market share. We also want to retain capacity to support business dealing as that begins to recover. So we've made sure that we have that capacity to do that too.</p>
          <p>So I think we've been in the vanguard of the funding pressures. We're building the business for the long run, we have a stronger franchise with a stronger funding profile, stronger market shares, more customer relationships and an opportunity to support the business customers as that sector grows.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Gail, I probably wasn't that clear. What I was actually asking was if market share does slip below systems you've outlined you're targeting &#x2013; are you willing to drop the margin back to where the peer levels are or are we protecting the margin and we'll let the system growth go given that you're 2% up on where you were two years ago?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no indication that we're under pressure to drop below system James. If you look at our applications data, the early pipeline data, it's not suggesting, in fact that's been very constant in terms of numbers and dollar volume of applications throughout the last three months. So unless the system has suddenly jumped up and I don't think there's much evidence of that, our full indicators suggest that that's not a pressure point we're dealing with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've never competed on price, nor have we competed on having lower credit standards. It's never been, throughout the crisis, it's never been a price play; it's always been a relationship orientation or service delivery orientation, a proposition to the customers that's different brand by brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually really &#x2013; I mean one of the other encouraging things is the share that's coming through first party versus third party. So we've looked to really concentrate in terms of which third party sources we want to support and have a deep relationship with and that's meant that overall the volumes, certainly most recently and all of the forward indicators, the volumes coming through first party are a much healthier proportion of the total.</p>
          <p>On trading, what's normal, look I think what we've indicated is that as we did last year, that 2009 was, certainly in the first half, was exceptional. The second half we saw &#x2013; actually I think quite a material reduction in the WIB markets, whereas treasury had a very strong period. This period has been a mixed shift again. But in total we've declined. The questions are whether we will have the same kind of market volatility that stimulates the customer interest to drive the revenue in the second half and ongoing.</p>
          <p>Now from time to time I get thinking, oh well things are going to stabilize and then events like last night happen and you think, oh maybe they won't. But we want to call out that it is still a function of what the kind of environment is that's driving the customer activity. Richard?</p>

          <p>Gail, it's Richard Wiles, Morgan Stanley. The Commonwealth Bank's got core banking and NAB's got Next Gen. I'm wondering, once the St. George integration finishes, what's the likelihood that Westpac pursues some sort of major systems overhaul and associated with that, is there the potential for Westpac to have a quantum improvement in its efficiency in a banking cost to income ratio under 35% like CBA is targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. We haven't called our program anything in particular, but we have a very strong strategy with regard to improving our overall infrastructure and service delivery to customers. So you'll see some detail in this results pack and this discussion pack that actually goes to that. I have flagged over prior periods that we have been working on an IT strategy to support the business strategy and an IT roadmap. So we're now underway with implementation. There's a set of 13 or 14 key projects that we're working on. It's in a coordinated, integrated group-wise way. It's a staged approach. Some of those actually involve integrations of our back office systems, such as our card systems or our mortgage systems across St. George, Westpac, RAMS, in the mortgage space.</p>
          <p>So there's a set of key discreet programs that we're working on. All of those will drive an efficiency output for us, but also a service delivery output for customers. So we haven't called it any one particular thing, but it certainly goes to all of the elements of core banking. It replaces our online systems, it's a new front end sales and service desktop for our Westpac brand. It goes to our core banking or Hogan system which we will be implementing across the Westpac Group. So there's a set of things staged and managed in a coordinated way over the course of the next five to seven years.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gail, without committing to any cost to income targets do you think there's potential for big improvement within Westpac?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we haven't put out a target around that. I think the major one is to get to sub 40. But because we've got the operational scale now we do have some quite significant opportunities to improve our productivity which is to get more uplift, particularly as we put platforms together. I mean right now in mortgages we have a Westpac one, a St. George one and a RAMS one for example. We do have two card systems. We have two deposit systems. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> processes that support many of those systems. So we do have an opportunity through scales to put those together, get efficiency and improved service delivery at the same time.</p>
          <p>So we haven't put a target on it, but clearly there's quite a significant productivity uplift to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson from CLSA. Gail congratulations on a great result. I see Curt let you down a little bit, but that's to be expected. Well done, Curt. If you have a look at your tier one ratio, I think everyone looks at the tier one ratio where yours is a little bit lower but that's because you haven't got as much hybrid capital. If you strip that out it looks about &#x2013; it certainly looks right compared to the other guys. But I go back to the messaging I think that came out of the last result, Gail from memory what you were saying was that we're really, really well capitalized and at the end of the day there are discussions being had and we're confident of a great outcome. The very next day John Laker came out and he cautioned about capital amnesia and that everyone's already forgotten the cycle. Overnight we've seen the Basel committee come out and talk about they expect banks to retain profits to the buffers.</p>
          <p>During the period we've had negligible growth in risk weighted assets, the tier one ratio was up, which is all well and good, but we're talking about an environment with growth returns. And then I look on slide number 70 in the discussion pack and we see all the current Basel II outcomes and we see all the Basel III outcomes as they stand at the moment, and none of them look particularly flash.</p>
          <p>Gail, the question at the end of all that is the messaging six months ago was that Westpac had surplus capital. What's the message now in the new regulatory world? Do you have enough, do you have an excess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view hasn't changed Brian, we remain as we said last time very happy with our capital position. We remain &#x2013; we're happy with it now. We knew at the end of last year that there were positive trends in our capital. Firstly, clearly, we're organically growing our capital pretty well and certainly as you said also very low level of risk weighted asset growth over this period. So the trend is good and if you look ahead into the next six months the trend is good again. We should see some further increases in our tier one capital. So relative to an equivalent is to say we remain strong. We also are not a bank that's actually got an acquisition agenda and therefore we don't need to hold extra capital for an acquisition agenda.</p>
          <p>So all of the indications we've had with regard to discussions with local regulators is the major impact for us here in Australia is actually going to be more on the liquidity front and less on the capital front. The rest of the world will be coming more towards APRA's view of what constitutes tier one and how it gets determined.</p>
          <p>So to be honest our major priority and focus is going to be on the liquidity side here in this economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Gail we should be thinking this reduced level of gearing we see in the balance sheet now it's about right and that's where it's going to stay going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look as you heard me say I think there's going to be some increase in credit growth and we're going to see more of it coming through the business segment which clearly will carry some higher level of risk weighting. However, it's still going to be relatively modest and we're going to continue to grow our organic capital and we've got the advice accreditation from St. George coming through as well which will have some modest impact.</p>
          <p>So there's positive headwinds in our capital, but we're very comfortable with how we've placed right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, Axiome Equities. Phil, a question on the reserving. You've increased the collective provision again relative to credit risk weighted assets, that you talked about asset quality stabilizing. What are you waiting for to stop the collective provision increasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really reflects the downgrades that I talked about and as some of those downgrades have played through we've needed to top up the collective provision against those accounts. When that ratio actually starts to reverse it will be actually when we overall get an overall upgrading in aggregate across the portfolio. So we haven't reached that stage of the cycle yet. And so we haven't yet seen the collective provision against those kind of measures improve.</p>
          <p>The other factor of course in our collective is our economic overlay and we look at that as we approach the end of each half and make a deliberation based upon the factors that that is providing additional cover for. At the end of this half we looked at it and effectively decided that the pros and cons actually didn't justify any release of that provision and that part of the collective provision. We'll do that again as we approach the end of September and we'll look at the conditions that largely apply to that and make a call then. Obviously, and as we've called out, a big chunk of that is to do with property exposures in New Zealand and in Australia and, obviously, therefore the health of the property market will be a key consideration in that regard.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. You've talked about the over-emergence of business credit growth towards the end of the year and also flagging a pull back in your participation in the mortgage growth, which indicates you're reallocating a given level of funding between the two. Are you seeing the availability of funding of as an issue in terms of your $45 billion wholesale funding requirement, and the other's how you think about that going into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think in terms of where we think the customer demand's going to come from and where we're best placed in participating, yes, we don't want to miss out on the opportunity to participate as the business credit cycle picks up. As Gail mentioned, having gained quite rapidly market share in the mortgage space in the last year or so we're very determined to ensure that we retain that share as opposed to believe that we necessarily need to go out and achieve more share, particularly as we're starting to see competitors re-emerge in that space.</p>
          <p>I think the key word that Gail called out was sustainability. We want to ensure that we've set ourselves up for sustainable growth and that obviously goes to how we manage the balance sheet. We want to be in a position where sustainably we can meet customer demand and we can fund it in a long term and sustainable way, and that's what we did in the last half and we positioned ourselves for the next half as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's nothing sort of magic about the 45 billion. You know that's in order of magnitude what we think we may need for this year and order of magnitude last year, we're well ahead of in terms of our funding for that over this year. That's put us in a good position, so we've done a fair bit of the heavy lifting earlier in this year, but we'll adjust that depending on what the demand is, depending on the quality of the opportunity that's out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that going from the wholesale funding requirement of 25 billion to 45 billion in a pretty short period of time means it's highly unlikely to grow off that 45 going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, there's nothing magic about it. I mean, it could well be 50 billion in any one year. We look at the maturity profile of our funding over time as well to make sure that we are aware of when larger chunks of funding are coming &#x2013; are rolling over and need to be replaced. But there's nothing magic about one particular number, so I wouldn't sort of <mark type="inaudible" /> in that. We manage a balance sheet so we're thinking about the lending growth that we do, we're thinking about the deposits that we raise, the retail deposits that we raised as well as the wholesale.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone. Phil, you made a reference to private competition from offshore banks in <mark type="inaudible" />. What's the level of competition from those players in other parts of the <mark type="inaudible" /> market and what nationality are those banks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stewart, it's a bit hard to hear but I think it was around competition in markets other than FX, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the reason the FX market is the easiest one for foreign banks to re-enter is because a lot of the instruments actually don't have much in the way of a credit risks associated with them and so it allows new participants to actually come in quite quickly. Where you're looking at longer term instruments, whether they be other forms of derivative or other forms of capital markets activity, there's a much greater consideration by the customer as to who the counterparty is, how well they know them, what kind of level of relationship they have and what kind of credit limits they have for that counterpart.</p>
          <p>So that's meant that the return of foreign banks, who exit our market pretty rapidly at the start of the GST, has been much greater in FX than it has been in the other markets.</p>
          <p>I think if the world continues to improve, then we'll probably see other foreign banks coming back into that space, and they are the names that you would expect and that were here back in 2007 as well, in terms of the global majors and the global investment banks. There's a few less of them but they're still the same pretty names, and we know that we have them as competitors in the institutional bank space.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, its' Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Just a question going back to the mortgage product spread, which has moved from 87 basis points to 76. Now recognizing what you said about the terming out of funding, the numbers still seem somewhat disappointing given where the SPR was. So two questions, firstly, has the transfer pricing method changed at all in the last six months and, secondly, are you being forced to do larger point of sale discounts on mortgages to hold that share at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer the second one, Phil, and you can deal with the first one. The answer to the second one is absolutely not. As Phil said, there's no indication at all of us losing market share in mortgages. In fact, quite to the contrary, we've been focusing primarily on our existing customers first and we've been focusing on our own proprietary channels that we've been to a large extent sort of managing to get to the sorts of outcomes that we're looking for with regards to mortgage growth. So there's been no change to that at all and all of the application volumes coming in have supported that we remain strong within the mortgage space.</p>
          <p>We also, as you would have heard me say in the presentation itself, have a particularly low level of runoff and that, if anything, is better than it was this time last year. So no to that second question. Phil, do you want to answer the first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On transfer pricing, Matt, in the ASX we actually outlined the three elements that go into our transfer pricing and we thought it was important to do that because I guess different banks actually apply different approaches and therefore it's important for you to understand what we do and therefore how it flows through into product spreads. With regard to the last half, probably the biggest impact has been the third element of the transfer pricing that we call out there, which is the premium that we actually pay to our deposit gatherers that is charged, that premium is charged, to the asset writers of the Company.</p>
          <p>That's a signal that we're providing through our transfer pricing to our frontline salespeople that say we actually want to raise deposits from customers. We're not going to penalize you that you're paying above the market benchmark to raise that deposit. We'll compensate you for that, and that cost will get charged to the asset writers. And that has obviously changed and changed quite a lot in the last half as deposit pricing escalated through the half. So that's probably the biggest change. It's not a change in approach but the impact of that higher deposit pricing actually had quite an impact on all of our asset spreads.</p>
