          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the News Corp. 2009 earnings release conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like turn the conference over to Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Affairs Gary Ginsburg. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2009 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Peter Chernin, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. Dave will give a detailed presentation of the quarterly results at the beginning, followed by Rupert, who will offer a more qualitative analysis of the company today and our future prospects. Rupert, Peter, and Dave will then take your questions, which given the press of time I implore you to limit to just one.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to the News Corp.'s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp.'s Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2008, lists risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the 10-Q filing.</p>
          <p>Finally, please note that certain financial measures we will use in this call, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted net income, are expressed in a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude impairment charges and other net in the second quarter of fiscal '09. The GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation of operating income is included in our press release, and the EPS and net income reconciliation is posted on our website on our Investor Relations Earnings Release page.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you, and good afternoon. As you can see in today's News Corporation's earnings release, we're operating in a very challenging economic environment, and our current operating results reflect this. As a result of market conditions and the decline in our stock price, we performed a review of our intangible assets during the quarter, which resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $8.4 billion related to goodwill and intangible assets.</p>
          <p>Because of this charge, reported GAAP operating income for the second quarter was a loss of $7.6 billion as compared to operating income of $1.4 billion for last year. Excluding this impairment charge, adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $818 million, down 42%, as compared to last year's result, reflecting declines in all segments except magazines and inserts and cable. Bottom line, the Company reported a net loss for the quarter of 6.4 billion as compared to $832 million of net income last year's second quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition to the impairment charge this quarter, there were a few other comparative items to mention. This quarter's associated entities' results include a small ITV write-down at BSkyB as compared to the $270 million charge recognized a year ago. Our other expense of $98 million principally reflects a pre-tax loss on the sale of our TV business in Poland. And our tax rate was favorably affected by tax credits from the impairment charge. Our normal tax run rate would approximate 39%.</p>
          <p>Including the net income effects of these items and the impairment, adjusted net income was $385 million in the quarter, down 57% from a similarly adjusted second quarter result a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share this quarter was $0.15, down 46%, from an adjusted $0.28 in the second quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide some comments on the performance at a number of our businesses. And please note that for comparative purposes, this discussion is based on adjusted operating income in that it excludes the effects of the impairment charge.</p>
          <p>So let's begin with the filmed entertainment segment. This segment reported second quarter operating profit of $112 million compared to last year's very strong result of $403 million in profits. Last year's second quarter performance was led by several very strong DVD results, which included "The Simpsons Movie," as well as the pay-TV results of "Night at the Museum."</p>
          <p>This year's quarter was led, although at much lower levels, by the Worldwide Home Entertainment performance of "Horton Hears a Who" and "The Happening," and by the domestic pay-TV performance of "Juno." As a result of higher launch cost, the results from the current quarter's theatrical releases, including "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "Australia," and "Marley and Me," were approximately $60 million lower than films released last year. And additionally, the current-year result also reflects a $22 million charge for the bankruptcy of a customer in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>At our television segment, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $18 million, as compared $245 million in the second quarter a year ago. This result reflects the impact of weaker ad markets, higher programming costs at the network, and the absence of earnings from the sale of eight stations in July. The eight stations accounted for revenues and earnings declines of $78 million and $23 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Revenue at our remaining stations declined 20%; this is right in line with market declines. And adjusted operating income decreased 38% in the quarter. The station had good political advertising growth. However, this was more than offset by weaker auto, telecom, movies, and fast food categories. At the Fox Broadcast Network, higher operating losses resulted from higher entertainment and sports programming costs and reduced ratings. On the entertainment side we had increased license fees this year from returning series, while at sports we were particularly affected by this year's postseason baseball results. And at STAR, we experienced a decline in advertising in India, in part due to the ratings impact of the three-week broadcast strike and the Mumbai attacks and due to a general softness in the advertising market there.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the cable networks, where we continue to show a very strong growth with operating income up 27% over a year ago on increased affiliate and advertising revenues. The largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the first-time operating profit at the Big Ten Network, and this reflects: the recent distribution agreements in the Midwest. We now have full coverage there. The International Channels, from advertising and affiliate increases. And this is led by our Latin American and European channels. And finally from the Fox News Channel. And this is the result of higher affiliate rates and increased subscribers and ad revenues, which raises their operating profits and margins to record levels. New affiliate deals for the Fox News are in effect with all major cable and satellite operators, including our most recent deals with Comcast and EchoStar.</p>
          <p>And just as a reminder, comparative results at this segment are impacted by the sale of the three RSNs last year, which contributed 51 million in revenues and $23 million in operating profit in the year-ago results.</p>
          <p>Turning to the direct broadcast satellite segment, or SKY Italia. SKY Italia reported operating income of $10 million, a $52 million decrease from the second quarter a year ago. Nearly half of this decline results from the shift in the timing of our soccer package revenue recognition, which we described to you all last quarter, with another 10% coming from currency translations. The balance of the decline comes principally from revenue increases being more than offset by higher cost. While reported U.S. dollar revenue growth show a decline due to changes in currency rates, SKY Italia's local currency revenue grew 6% in the quarter, and this growth would have been even higher, or 3% higher, without the shift in our soccer revenues.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, our cost increased in excess of this revenue growth, and this was led by programming cost increases reflecting the expansion of the average subscriber base, increased soccer costs from our new contracts, and the addition of new channels. It also includes the relocation of our Milan facilities, and from increased investments in expanding premium services to subscribers.</p>
          <p>The additional investments we made in marketing, installation, and technology costs associated with these new initiatives is driving higher penetration of premium services to our existing subscriber base. At quarter end, over 1 million subscribers were taking at least one premium service, such as HD, DVR, and multiple boxes, as compared to 650,000 premium service subscribers a year ago. SKY Italia is the only provider of HD and PVR services in Italy. The rapid penetration of these products is designed to achieve a longer life and more profitable subscriber base.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, gross additions were approximately 300,000, while net additions were approximately 150,000. And this brings SKY Italia's closing subscribers at the end of December to 4.7 million. Our monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged 45 euros. This is about even with last year. If you exclude the impact of the soccer revenue recognition change, our monthly ARPU would have been 46 euros. And finally, we're still on plan for an annual churn rate of slightly more than 10%.</p>
          <p>In the newspaper and information service segment, adjusted operating income in this year's quarter was $179 million, and this is down 9% versus last year. This result reflects the inclusion of $59 million in Dow Jones adjusted operating income. Now, this is net of about $17 million in purchase accounting amortization. Additionally, while we had $51 million of lower depreciation expense this year from our UK press project, this amount was offset by a similar amount from the effect of the strength in U.S. dollars on a reported basis. So if you look at the segment absent these items, adjusted operating income declined $82 million, and this is primarily due to reduced advertising revenues.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, advertising revenues were down 10% overall from declines in classified and non-color display advertising, principally at our quality titles. However, color display advertising increased, and this was led by our tabloids, principally The Sun. In addition, our circulation revenues in the UK were up 2%, primarily due to higher pricing.</p>
          <p>In Australia, overall advertising revenues were down 6% compared to a year ago. Classified advertising revenues declined 13%, primarily from reduced employment ads, while display ad revenues were down 3%. Again, circulation revenues here, similar to the UK, were at similar levels in the year-ago, as cover price increases offset fewer copies sold.</p>
          <p>Turning to our book publishing segment, second quarter operating income contributions were down $44 million compared to last year. This decline reflects the weaker retail book market, the lack of comparable strong releases versus a year ago, and a charge of $6 million for the bankruptcy of a customer.</p>
          <p>And finally at our other segment, we reported a second quarter operating loss of $38 million, $61 million less than a year ago. This decline is principally due to higher costs at Fox Interactive Media and lower contributions from NDS. At Fox Interactive Media, revenues in the quarter of $226 million were down 3% compared to a year ago. This is primarily due to reduced subscription levels at IGN.</p>
          <p>Search and advertising revenues were similar to year-ago levels. However, cost increases &#x2013; particularly from the development and launch of MySpace Music, expanded international operations, and the addition of new MySpace features &#x2013; reduced FIM's earnings contributions to around $7 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to guidance for fiscal 2009, I'd also like to make a few comments related to our financial health and our balance sheet strength. At December month end, we had $13.3 billion in gross debt and $3.6 billion in cash, with net debt of $9.7 billion. This represents an improvement of over $900 million in 12 months from the net debt position at the end of December 2007. Additionally, earlier today we closed the NDS transaction, which increases our cash position by over $800 million.</p>
          <p>The company has approximately $450 million of debt maturities in early 2010, including the $250 million puttable bond. Additionally, 1.6 million in debt convertible into shares of BSkyB owned by News Corporation could be put to us in March of 2010. News Corporation can elect to settle this put in cash, shares of BSkyB, or shares of News Corporation. Our current cash balance alone is sufficient to repay all of these maturities, as well as all other maturities coming due through 2015. And despite the current financial crisis and the related difficult trading conditions, we continue to generate significant annual free cash flow. So while we recognize we are operating in a challenging environment, the competitive position of our franchises and the strength of our balance sheet will be a significant asset as we manage through this period.</p>
          <p>And finally &#x2013; excuse me just a second.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2009. And as a reminder, you will recall that we mentioned this guidance, excluding from 2008 results the $253 million in operating profit contributions from businesses or assets sold in fiscal 2008, which are no longer included in our ongoing results, namely the eight TV stations, the three RSNs sold to Liberty, and the UK land sale. So as you look at measuring comparisons in fiscal 2009, we are comparing it to a base of 5.13 billion in operating profit for fiscal 2008, and our fiscal 2009 outlook excludes the effect of the impairment charges we took this quarter.</p>
          <p>In early November, we indicated that we were anticipating our change in operating income for fiscal 2009 to be a decline in the low to mid-teens from the 5.13 billion fiscal 2008 result. At that time, we indicated that in developing our outlook, we had limited visibility into trading additions for the remainder of our fiscal year. In addition, our outlook assumed that advertising trends and market conditions would remain where they were at that time. Since that time, we have seen a more significant deterioration in the economic conditions and consumer confidence. The direct impact of this to us has been a further weakening of all our advertising-driven businesses, including our local television station, our newspapers, Fox Interactive, and to a lesser extent Fox Broadcast Network and cable networks. Additionally the weakness in consumer discretionary retail sales is also negatively impacting our DVD and book sales, as well as the performance of some of our releases.</p>
          <p>As a result, taking all these factors into account, and considering that we still have less-than-perfect visibility into our fiscal '09 advertising and currency trends, we're reducing our fiscal 2009 operating income outlook to now to be down approximately 30%, from the 5.13 billion fiscal 2008 result. This guidance assumes there will be no further weakening in the advertising markets and economic conditions, and I want to stress again that we still have less-than-perfect visibility into the markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at this change in our outlook from November to today, roughly 60% of the change is from the further deteriorating ad markets, which reduces our expectations at our advertising-sensitive businesses. A further 25% of the change is related to weakened retail sales of home entertainment and book titles. The remainder of the change reflects updated views on other aspects of our operations. While we are continuing to run our businesses on a lead &#x2013; cost base, we're also intensely focused on cost reductions to respond to these revenue challenges.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rupert.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. The results Dave just outlined are a direct reflection of a recession that is deeper than anyone predicted. Indeed, it's the worst global economic crisis we've witnessed since News Corp. was established more than 50 years ago. While it's impossible to be completely prepared for a downturn of this magnitude, we began priming ourselves for a weakening economy early last year. We've implemented strict cost-cutting measures across all our operations. We've reduced head count in individual businesses where appropriate. And we have scaled back on capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Even in flush times, we've never been a company that tolerates fat. So in times like these, we are better positioned to weather this cycle than our competitors. We've also consistently maintained a strong balance sheet, which today, following our completion of the partial sale of NDS, boasts approximately $4.5 billion in cash. Given our strong financial position, we have the reserves on hand to cover over seven years of upcoming debt repayments. And we intend to operate our businesses and balance sheet as conservative as usual.</p>
          <p>It's important to point out that while our earnings are challenged and there are variables we cannot control, chief among them the weakening advertising market, we can control how we manage our businesses. And I can tell you we're doing everything we possibly can strategically, operationally, and financially, to position ourselves to emerge stronger when the economy returns to some semblance of normalcy.</p>
          <p>One of the things about our company of which I'm most proud is this: We're never content to accept the status quo, to not challenge conventional assumptions, or challenge ourselves in coming up with new business models or new approaches. It's the reason why we revolutionized network television with Fox or cable news with Fox News. It's the reason the UK and Italy enjoy choice in TV as they do, why The Wall Street Journal today is the only newspaper in the country to be growing, or why social networking is now a part of the cultural landscape. We're also leaders in most every segment in which we operate &#x2013; in cable television and pay TV, in newspapers and digital media &#x2013; for the simple reason that we've not been afraid to take risks where others have flinched.</p>
          <p>I mention all this today not to chest-beat or to obfuscate, but to offer perspective on how we are approaching our business within this difficult environment. We're not sitting still, waiting for things to change or to get better, but acting now, when things are perhaps their bleakest, to strengthen our businesses, challenge our assumptions, and come up with new approaches that will solidify our leadership positions into the future.</p>
          <p>We're putting all of our established businesses through the usual rigorous strategic reviews to see if old models can be revitalized or new models created. We're making judicious, highly targeted investments to ensure that our developing businesses continue to grow. We have some of the world's most recognized, vibrant media franchises in the world today, and now is the time to strengthen these franchises. We're also working to improve operating margins at all of our divisions by streamlining costs. As always, we're intensely focused on market share &#x2013; on capturing an even larger share of the markets in which we operate. How are we, for example, making targeting investments to better improve our competitive position?</p>
          <p>Consider SKY Italia. The numbers for the quarter, as Dave explained, were down year-over-year. Some of this is timing, some is currency. But what may not be evident from the numbers is how much stronger our competitive position is becoming from the steps we're taking today. Most significantly, we're making investments that will both strengthen our relationship with our customers while ensuring we remain market leaders long into the future. For instance, we launched nine new channels in Italy during this quarter, 13 in the past six months. Invested in high-quality original entertainment programming, moved people up to higher programming tiers, and increased our penetration of premium services, the single-best hedges against churn. So this quarter's results actually reflect many growth and retention initiatives. But what's most encouraging is despite these investments, we're still on track to reach 90% of our original subscriber target for the year and a higher level of profitability over last year's record numbers.</p>
          <p>We're adopting the same strategy at Dow Jones and our other news brands. Over the past year at The Wall Street Journal, we've added new pages and launched a luxury magazine that has attracted 30 new advertisers to the franchise. We've also revamped our website, developed mobile applications, and upwardly revised our pricing policy &#x2013; I should say strongly revising our pricing policy. At the same time, we realized more than $100 million in cost savings since acquiring Dow Jones last December, and continue this process throughout the coming months. Today, The Wall Street Journal is the only major newspaper to grow its individually paid circulation year-over-year, up 2.4% when nearly every other newspaper in the country is experiencing declines. In the most recent ABC reporting period, the Weekend Journal became the biggest-selling weekend newspaper in individually paid sales, surpassing the Sunday New York Times for the first time. And The Wall Street Journal digital network &#x2013; which includes WSJ.com, MarketWatch.com., Barrons.com., AllThingsD.com &#x2013; has increased visitor traffic by 76% over the past year.</p>
          <p>The same is true at Fox Interactive Media, where we have been investing and expanding MySpace into a global social portal, a destination that is as much about entertainment and lifestyle as it is about social networking. We've launched MySpace Music, which is off to a great start with partnerships with a number of major and independent labels and high-profile artists. With MySpace Video we're making deals with film and television producers for original content that will not only drive increased viewer engagement, but also deliver enhanced sponsorship opportunities and revenue. And MySpace Mobile is a great success story, with new device applications now running on the iPhone and BlackBerry in a popular WAP site. Despite a slight downturn in revenue this quarter, let's not lose sight that after five years, MySpace still leads the social networking category in the U.S. and has become a substantial business that we believe will continue to grow.</p>
          <p>Our cable division is another leading example of judicious investment. We went from naught subscribers to more than 400 million monthly subscribers in under 10 years. Because we launched properties wisely, gave them room to grow, and capitalized on their success with new carriage deals. This is all in the U.S., I might say. One illustration, the Big 10 Network, which we launched just over a year ago, today is profitable and is broadly distributed in Big 10 markets. And the Fox International Channels, which no one had heard of a few years ago, continues to expand globally and is becoming one of our fastest and most durable growth drivers. Of course, the biggest success story is the Fox News Channel, which has been the number one cable news channel for 28 consecutive quarters &#x2013; and by a big margin.</p>
          <p>And we continue to invest in quality movies, because we know that in good times or in bad, people want to be entertained and will pay for the experience, either in the theaters or at home. So while our quarterly film number is off sharply from last year, there are many reasons to be extremely optimistic about this segment for the rest of the year and beyond. First, we're emboldened by the success of our Christmas slate, particularly the strong performance of "Marley and Me" and the Oscar-nominated "Slumdog Millionaire." We absorbed their costs in the second quarter and will now reap the benefits of their box office success. Going forward, we have three sequels to blockbuster films, which give us tremendous confidence: "Ice Age 3," "Night at the Museum 2," and "X-Men Origins: Wolverine."</p>
          <p>One of the reasons we're willing to make investments in our businesses and in quality content is that we have never bought in to the pervasive fear that all is lost when the business hits a recession, that advertising is gone never to return, that consumers won't pay for entertainment. Sure, there's reason to be concerned, and we are running our business to respond to that concern. But historically, every time we've seen a recession, mild or major, we've endured this panic and come out better. And every time the economy rebounds, advertising comes back, usually stronger than before.</p>
          <p>I'm not being flippant. I recognize that we may never return to record levels. But we do believe we can recapture a large percentage of the advertising that does return. It's why we continue to believe in newspapers and their brand extensions and television and film as mass media. Quite simply, as long as advertisers need to move a product and build brands, these entities will remain strong and the market leaders will be the strongest. And when this recession ends, we'll be better positioned than anyone else because we've been aggressively building market share in these businesses. And we will make no compromise in that sector.</p>
          <p>So just don't take my word. Consider these facts: The Fox Network, it will win the seasons the fifth consecutive year on the strength of "American Idol," which in its eighth season continues to dominate prime-time and serve as an effective launch pad for new programs. In fact "American Idol's" ratings exceeds its closest competitor by 69% in adults 18 to 49.</p>
          <p>Or our station group, which is the number one U.S. station group in terms of market share. Sure, margins in this business have contracted drastically, but we continue to best our competition because we're aggressively cutting costs and expanding into what makes these stations franchises and be local news. Today, everything is on the table at the station group. We're looking at new revenue streams. We're making inroads on the web. And we're doing strategic news-gathering partnerships. We continue to gain market share in the newspaper business. Beyond the gains at The Wall Street Journal, market share in the UK is up year-over-year. With gains at The Sun, The Times, The Sunday Times, and the News of the World. And we're also very lucky that the vast majority of our titles are not at all dependent on classified advertisements.</p>
          <p>To put it in perspective, times may be tough right now. But if our forecast is correct, we'll make in excess of $3.5 billion of adjusted operating income this fiscal year. We also have a very strong balance sheet. We're working hard to grow our franchises, and we have the best-run businesses in the media sector. This downturn will eventually end. And News Corporation will emerge better positioned, better capitalized, a better business than our peers.</p>
          <p>Thank you, everybody. And now Peter, Dave, and I are happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I want to go to Rupert for a sec. It sounds like, as you say, there's been a little fat at News Corp. over the years. So when you describe the opportunity to take out costs, which businesses do you think you have the best opportunities to take out costs, and how big could that savings be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we're taking them out everywhere. I mean, I'm out in Australia at the moment, and the local management is in the process of combining all their back offices, between the <mark type="inaudible" />. There are many different processes we're doing. That goes right across the company, which is going to save a lot of people and a lot of money.</p>
          <p>And then there are little things. At The Wall Street Journal, there are so many numerous small things. We're combining the back office at The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, which will eventually save about 7 million, certainly 4.5 million in the immediate future. We've also renegotiated nearly all our delivery contractors across the whole United States with a savings just starting now of $5 million a year. And it goes on and on. It seems like we're chiseling away at small things, but they do add up to a lot of money.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've cut out I think just under $400 million in costs out of all of Fox so far this year. It's a combination of head count and looking at all of our marketing things, looking at all of our vendor deals. And I think we've been extremely aggressive in looking at head count. We've been trying to do it without layoffs, but we have eliminated I think just under 800 positions from the company, by &#x2013; we put a head count freeze in at the beginning of the fiscal year and then recently we just eliminated two-thirds of the open jobs. So we're down about 800 heads across all the Fox companies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Banc of America-Merrill Lynch. I guess this question's for Peter. Could you comment on what you're seeing for calendar second quarter cancellations to the broadcasting cable networks and what you're seeing in the scatter market in calendar Q1 and I guess your views of how much of this DVD slowdown is cyclical versus secular? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, what we're seeing with scatter is that we are writing scatter. In the current quarter, I think we've written about $50 million of scatter at upfront pricing or better. I think a lot of that is due to ratings shortfall in the marketplace. But we feel we're probably doing better than our competitors.</p>
          <p>In terms of cancellations, we've extended a couple of things. Right now, we're probably at about 8% of total dollars canceled for the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to end up at about 11%. And just to put that in context, for the past several years, we've run them at 7 to 8%. So we're a little bit higher than we've been running the past several years, but I think honestly we're probably feeling that it's a little better than we expected on the cancellation side.</p>
          <p>And I would say the national cable networks are &#x2013; they're a mixed bag depending upon whether you're exposed to auto advertising and the mix of advertisers. But in general I think that the national cable networks are running fairly similarly to the broadcast network.</p>
          <p>In terms of the DVD marketplace, what we saw was &#x2013; it was an interesting year. We were actually up slightly in the first half of the year. Clearly the marketplace was down in the second half of the year, I think down about 11%. But most importantly the market was &#x2013; the sell-through market was down close to 15%, primarily October to December. So we've seen some pretty rough numbers in that period. Interestingly, we've seen the sell-through market bounce back a little bit in January. I think the numbers we're looking at for January see sell-through down about 9%. So better than they were in the October quarter.</p>
          <p>I read with interest Bob's comments, and I clearly think it's important to keep a close eye on the business. But I think given the depths of the consumer recession that we're in the middle of, I think it's too soon to &#x2013; there's so much consumer pressure. And number of retail trips are down, the size of baskets, what people are doing. I think it is too soon to &#x2013; while I think it's important to be mindful and to look at our cost structure and to look at that business closely, I think it's &#x2013; in my opinion, given the depths of the consumer recession, that certainly is a pretty good way to account for most of what's going on out there right now.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Rupert, I guess the question, as you look out a couple of years, coming &#x2013; assuming the market stabilizes and the economy stabilizes &#x2013; how do you think about the asset base of the company and your exposure to the local TV station business and newspaper business? And then just one quick housekeeping item for Dave. Through the first half of the fiscal year, cash flow from operations and free cash flow were negative, it looks mostly like, because of working capital. Was that just timing, or is there something else? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm extremely happy with all our newspapers. I think that they're good newspapers. They're increasing their share of market. There's never been a greater appetite for news in the community. And we will be able to capitalize on that very well. I've got great faith, and if we continue the way we're going, we may even get lucky and be &#x2013; not have so much competition at the end of it all. But we're in good shape on the newspapers.</p>
          <p>On the television stations, we're doing everything we can. We're in the process of some major cost-cutting, which will take place over the next 12 months. And the big thing about the local &#x2013; there will always be room for good local stations, supplying good local news. That is what the demand is for, and that is what we're expanding, and which incidentally is cheaper programming to do than buying a lot of syndicated material. But will we return to the big profits of two years ago? I don't know. But we will certainly be seeing much better profits than we're seeing at this moment.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> We were down about &#x2013; Dave can correct me &#x2013; about 20%, I think, in revenue in the first half. Certainly in this quarter, what we're looking at. And we are expecting &#x2013; and I think it may prove pessimistic, it may not -to be down 30% in this second half of the fiscal year. And that's built into our forecast.</p>
          <p>But the big thing that really is killing us is the lack of automobile advertising. In local stations, automobile advertising was at least 30% of total revenue. And there's precious little of it around at the moment. Other categories are down, too, but nothing like that. So we are just &#x2013; it's a fight day by day there, and we've had a little bit of encouragement in the last couple of weeks, but I wouldn't want to build false hopes on it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, with respect to your question on the cash flow, you are correct. It's a timing issue, as you probably remember.

          <p>Yeah, thank you. Dave, could you tell us, have you taken any reserves for bankruptcies in either the TV end or the cable end as some of your competitors have? And if you think back to, I think it was the late '80s, you had a slew of TV station bankruptcies that hit all these companies. Are you concerned about that in the near future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have taken reserves, and I mentioned a couple of them in my remarks. We've taken &#x2013; I don't want to get into the details of all this, but we have taken a reserve on Tribune and on others. And I think we feel, for the moment, we're adequately reserved.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. At The Wall Street Journal, it looks like calendar '09 is starting off much like '01, when ad volume fell nearly 40% and EBITDA by a lot more. Now, I'm wondering, what are you hearing from the core financial and tech advertisers, and where are you on the expected $100 million in savings you talked about in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we've made the 100 million; they're in the bank. And the increase in circulation revenue is, as I explained to you, a fairly slow process, although a very strong one. I think no one is being moved up by less than about 40%. And &#x2013; well no, that's not true. No one less than by $40 a year. Some by $100 a year, depending on their status.</p>
          <p>The revenue, I've got to tell you, particularly in the last &#x2013; well, January was bad, or it is bad. But it is very short-term. And it's very hard to get a visibility into the future there. We have the New York Times cutting rates against us. And we will not cut our rates. So we're down at the moment about 20% in advertising.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just have a question for Mr. Murdoch. And please correct me if I mischaracterize your views. I think back in the late '90s you were sort of not a believer of Internet advertising, and when we came out of the last recession, which was mild, and you saw less of a rebound I think sort of the light bulb went off that a lot of ads were migrating to the Internet. You then bought some assets, obviously, that worked well for you for a while. And I was just wondering, at this juncture, how are you sort of thinking about the long-term viability of the Internet as a medium? Are you still bullish on it and this is all cyclical, or is it not sort of panning out and you sort of have questions about the viability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there are &#x2013; and Peter would have views on this, too. In the social networking area, where there's sort of two majors, we're getting 80 or 90% of the total revenue. But &#x2013; not that that is a particularly relevant number. Clearly, people in the search business are on to a very good thing. The general display advertising, if it can be very specific such as it is with The Wall Street Journal, where we have a very healthy increase, and I think our group there are going to do about $120 million this year in advertising, that's fine. But overall, you'd have a problem in that there is an almost infinite increase in inventory -</p>

But as Rupert mentioned, we can talk about the TV stations, where we were assuming in the first &#x2013; with our guidance, down about 20% when we gave guidance in November, and now we're assuming guidance down 32%. So it's that type of change. And I don't want to go through every single one of our businesses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would say that &#x2013; just if I may say that the downturn in Australia hit very late. It is beginning to hit now. And I don't know what the exact figure is, but we're not yet feeling it the way we've felt it in Britain. In Britain, it's interesting. We have in The Sunday Times a totally dominant newspaper in the quality of market, with the circulation a lot greater than its combined circulation of its competitors. Yet what was &#x2013; could be broadly called classified, whether it was jobs or travel or whatever, we have lost out on, I would say we're getting all the business at full rate that is available. But the profit at The Sunday Times is down quite seriously.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, on The Sun, which is in a different markets, and the popular market is holding nicely over 3 million, has been &#x2013; a great job. There were some weeks, thanks to price wars over there between November and December, where we had all-time record advertising revenues. That's not true at the moment, but it's not down seriously.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Question for either Rupert or Peter or both, related to your station group. Looking at the ratings across your network and on the station side, what is your view on retransmission payments starting to kick in more significantly over the next few years? Is the model as it's set up today appropriate for the audience delivery you're generating? Maybe is there any scenario where you took that to be extreme and went to the FCC, gave spectrum back, and turned the network and station group over to effectively a cable network? I realize it's a little Draconian, but what's your view on sort of the scenario that we're looking at here?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>They're extremely important to them. They cannot drop us, particularly when we have people, things like the NFL franchise. And we've been using them in the past; we've been given people some retransmission rights into return for extended numbers of homes for our cable channels. So it's not that we're being unrewarded by that. We've been using this as a big asset to leverage cable distribution, the results of which you can see.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I would just &#x2013; just to both echo and add. Most of our retrans deal don't come up for two to three years, but when they do come up, we would expect to be clearly in partnership with the cable guys. Pretty aggressive, we are the number one network. We are generally the number one station. We've made heavy investments in the quality of our programming, in sports and entertainment, and in local programming on our stations. And we would expect to be &#x2013; I guess bluntly, we'd expect to outperform the market in what the value of retrans is, given we're the number one network and the number one station group. But they are &#x2013; most of our retrans deals are two to three years out.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple questions. First, could you remind us of the progression of cancellation options? If you could go through the kind of fourth quarter, first quarter, and second quarter. And in connection with that, can you kind of remind us of the spread on scatter versus up-front pricing and how that spread's been trending for the fourth quarter through recently. Has it changed recently? Has it narrowed materially recently? And second, the Eastern European and Russian assets, can you kind of give us an update on what's happening with those? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cancellations, as I said earlier, we expect to end up this fourth quarter at about 11%. I think the third quarter, we were somewhere in the 7 to 8% range, although I could be off on that. And so we're seeing an increase, but not increase all that dramatically. And as I said earlier, the last several years it's been running, at 7, 8%. So I don't have it exact quarter to quarter, but that's what it looks like.</p>
          <p>In terms of scatter, we see the scatter market was probably a little bit stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. But overall, as I said earlier, we have written $50 million of scatter at up-front pricing, and we think it's going along pretty well.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question for either Rupert or Peter on SKY Italia. The high VAT charge came in from the 1st of January. I'm wondering whether or not you've seen an increase in churn or an impact on net adds? And considering these quarter's result, do you still expect year-on-year growth in that business in U.S. dollar terms? And then, of course, connected with that, there are reports you're in discussions with Telecom Italia about a stake in that business. I'm just wondering how any relationship there would impact SKY Italia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't seen much effect from that except anger by our viewers against the government. We have actually, in our forecast, put in an extra 50,000 churn. Because of it so far &#x2013; and it's very early days &#x2013; we see no evidence of that happening. And we're still very confident the year will see an increase in subscribers of 350,000.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple questions. One, on My Network TV. Just given the potential that CW sounds it may not survive the next year in the current environment. Just wondering how you're thinking about My Network and if there is a change at My Network, what that would mean for the stations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I would say that we are &#x2013; on the one hand we're pleased with the ratings increases. I think our ratings are up about 50%. Clearly the market's gotten a lot tougher. And we are extremely focused on the cost basis of it and seeing if we can get the cost basis down. And we think that the most important piece of it for the stations is the wrestling franchise, which we have wrapped up. So we're looking at it pretty tightly. We feel good about the ratings performance, but it's into a very, very tough marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up. When you look at the performance, the advertising performance of what you're seeing at the core Fox stations, is it notably worse at My Network, or are you seeing something similar at the current time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would characterize it as being worse, not notably worse.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Peter, you stopped short of calling the declines in DVD sales a secular trend. But can you talk about how the company plans to respond to these declines? For instance, any plans to boost the pipeline of films into on-demand channels or the Internet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, I didn't &#x2013; I just said I think it's too early to say it's a secular decline and that we should look at it really closely. It very well may be; we don't know yet. As a result of that, we are not chaining our wheels being aggressive, I think about as aggressive as anybody about looking at every avenue of distribution. And I think it's sort of the cornerstone of the way the company looks at things.</p>
          <p>Our view is we should be in the business of making the best possible content and distributing it as widely as possible. So we have seen pretty significant increases in a number of &#x2013; I think on an industry basis, we've seen the pay-per-view, video on demand, grow by about 25%. We've seen electronic sell-through grow in excess of 50%. And we are participating aggressively in all those areas. And obviously are, as a company, extremely excited about and interested in Hulu, which we look at as being ultimately both a good asset for us as a company, but more importantly a way to maximize our revenues in distribution.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this an opportunity &#x2013; given current environments, is this an opportunity to tweak the windowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have seen windowing steadily &#x2013; the windows certainly between theatrical and in-home, steadily decrease over the past several years &#x2013; steadily decrease. So I think we'll probably see that continue. But I do think, particularly right now, we've seen pretty good theatrical marketplace, and we want to constantly be alert that we don't in any ways compromise that.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mr. Murdoch. I'm just wondering from your experience in previous downturns, when you start to get a return of confidence from the advertising sector, where do they first tend to put their money, into which segment? Do they go to TV or newspapers? And do you think, when there is a return to confidence, that a lot more of the advertising share may go to the Internet this time? And just secondly, can I have some comments from you, please, on how you think the film "Australia" has fared?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I don't think that there's any sign that advertising is suddenly going to rush to the Internet. Whether it goes to newspapers or television or outdoor, I think it'll depend on the advertiser. We'll see across the whole board.</p>
          <p>As far as the film "Australia," it has done extremely well on a worldwide basis, disappointingly in the United States. And it was a very expensive film. But we will not lose money on it. We will make a small profit &#x2013; well, Peter can answer that, but I think that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Mr. Murdoch, you were saying before that you didn't think there were any companies out there so far that you could see that made a good strategic potential fit for News Corp. Lots of people like to talk about why the New York Times would or wouldn't make a good fit for News Corp. And I'm curious about what you think about that fit in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's just fair to say I've got no interest. But if you want to comment further, I've got no desire to be an even bigger public enemy or target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then the one follow-up was why is cable up? And I'm wondering if that is a long-term trend. I'm making the question pretty much for anybody on the call right now. What's going on with the consumer that they keep signing up? Because it doesn't &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; it seems like it's really kind of going in the right direction at a time when other consumer trends are going in the wrong one.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they're spending more time at home. They're watching more television. And they're enjoying wonderful choice. And so you naturally get the audience fragmented somewhat, which is hurting over-the-air. But there is no question that good, interesting programs can be monetized very successfully.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I completely agree. I think that as people cut back on other options, they're spending more time at home, and they need the entertainment and information and sports that comes through cable.

          <p>Hello. This question is for Mr. Murdoch. I was wondering, similar to the New York Times, a lot of Japanese newspapers are currently struggling with respect to individual subscribers and the influence of advertising. And I was wondering what you foresaw for the media industry as kind of a global entity and where you saw it going particularly, once this recession -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fine. I think it's just a matter of the state of the economy. And dependence &#x2013; different newspapers have differing dependence on advertising. Those that are most dependent on it, particularly classified advertising, are getting hurt the most. But it's a cyclical matter.</p>
