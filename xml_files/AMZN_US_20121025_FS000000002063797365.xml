      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.</p>
          <p>Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares consistent with 469 million shares.</p>
          <p>Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.</p>
          <p>Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36% or 39% excluding foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&amp;A combined was $3.26 billion or 23.6% of sales up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%.</p>
          <p>Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll you will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.</p>
          <p>In the North America segment revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%.</p>
          <p>North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the international segment revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%.</p>
          <p>Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 54%.</p>
          <p>International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million.</p>
          <p>CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 10%.</p>
          <p>Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>The third quarter of 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity-method share of the losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill. As of the end of September the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 days from 72 days in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material affect on guidance.</p>
          <p>Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior year period. We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion.</p>
          <p>These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.</p>
          <p>We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington.</p>
          <p>We remain head-sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks. And with that Sean, let's move to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. At the time we will now open up the call for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. And our first question comes from Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Two, please, if I could. Tom, first on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency. And I was wondering, if you could speak to the effect of currency that it's having on margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment &#x2013; digital in Italy and Spain being contributors there? And then secondly on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year, I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more Prime versus the revenue allocation of FBA. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To take the first part of your question, Scott, as it relates to operating profit in international, you have the big pieces correct. First one is, we're investing certainly very heavily in capacity and so you're seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there.</p>
          <p>In addition to that we're investing in the number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there, but certainly those are investments right now. China as you also mentioned is great a long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.</p>
          <p>In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM for Europe. So, those are things that are the primary drivers of what you're seeing in operating income in international.</p>
          <p>In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot, I can help you, with there is a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time, as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some of the things. But again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seem to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you've made, Tom you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies, you're also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you've reached a bit of a cyclical &#x2013; investment cyclical tipping point or am I over reading into just one quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the paid unit growth question it was 39%. As you mentioned, it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one. Two, if you take a look at last year's unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that we've had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we're overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011 and 2012. From a fulfillment standpoint, we've just seen unprecedented growth and we've added a lot of capacity.</p>
          <p>In terms of where it will level off? We'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're still experiencing very strong growth, with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So, we're going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have, we're going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there and we've been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season. I'm just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, could you elaborate on what you're referring to? I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A pop-up store, meaning something that might only be open for between, say, Black Friday and January 1st. A short term store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the vast majority, the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using a physical world, retailers as well, which we're very happy to do so. But again, it's not really the driver of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take a question now from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Tom, it's been nearly a year since you launched the first Fire devices and I was hoping you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking in terms of their buyer activity and in particular how you're seeing them, if they are over-indexing in terms of media content consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing and how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie Prime into devices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe the best way to describe it would be &#x2013; certainly we're seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fire and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward.</p>
          <p>All of that being said even though we're rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we're going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices, and so we continue to work with &#x2013; to make sure that we can provide that on our customer's behalf. But we're seeing very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We're seeing customers not only purchase content &#x2013; we're seeing customers &#x2013; Prime customers certainly being active in watching free content as well, and that's working very well. So it's a great combination of things that are going on there and engagement with the device.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. I actually want to follow up on that question that was just asked. So, intuitively it makes a lot of sense what it is that you are doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of the selling the device or all of these devices, kind of, near break even maybe. Is there any metric that you can point to help us understand the lift you get either in terms of the frequency or &#x2013; of buying or a lift in average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of that strategy?</p>
          <p>And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content cost related to your streaming service going forward? Just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; there's not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from content standpoint, in terms of what the purchasing patterns have been. But as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in a device, they are purchasing content, they are also in the case of video &#x2013; they're purchasing content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they're purchasing books as well as &#x2013; if they're Prime members, they're participating in free content.</p>
          <p>So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there which is why we continue to invest in that business, which is why you see the offerings &#x2013; the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of.</p>
          <p>In terms of the video content spend &#x2013; if you're referring to the &#x2013; related to Prime Instant Video &#x2013; I think it's probably what you're referring to. We have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We'll continue to monitor very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.</p>
          <p>We launched Prime some number of years ago now and we had a little over a million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We're now offering digital items through Prime as well. Most notably and certainly in books and video and we're monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we're seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I know it's still early, but have you seen any noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lighting you guys up on collecting sales tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right, it is early. The only thing I could point to is, we collect in over &#x2013; either sales tax or its equivalent value-added tax. We collect and over 50% of our revenue today &#x2013; we have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in. So, that's all I can point to today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So good afternoon, guys. So, revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer? I mean, over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency level, as you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; actually, we feel very good about the investments we're making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we're making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more the running of the business type investments. We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently and to the point where, as you know we've extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers to fulfill by Amazon.</p>
          <p>So, those are things that we feel &#x2013; certainly those investments we feel good about, but what you are seeing is certainly just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's one of these investments, we only make those investments where we absolutely need too, but in terms of deploying that capital and those resources, we feel very good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Brian Nowak of Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter? And if so, any comments on any pockets or countries of weakness? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about social and your use of social networks like Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now? Or do you think over the long-term or time you'd like to have more end-to-end control over social e-commerce? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the Europe piece, we're not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international and local currency basis, which includes, obviously, our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan. So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we're reading the same thing that you're reading in terms of the softness. Hard to tell how much that's impacting us. Again, when you look at 27% growth rates, still think that's pretty solid in the environment. But again, hard to tell how much we're impacted by that.</p>
          <p>In terms of social, we're certainly very &#x2013; looking at a lot of different ways to reach customers, and certainly that's an opportunity for us and something that our &#x2013; certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of. And working on ways best to monetize those channels.</p>

          <p>Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships, for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you view that market in terms of the retail business? When do you think you could be in Brazil with a retail presence? And then the second question is fulfillment: as a growth &#x2013; as a percent of gross profit, showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in like three years. So do you feel like you've turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements? Or given the pace of new facilities that you're putting in, is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the first question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography, as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today. But beyond that, there's not a lot to talk to.</p>
          <p>In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we've seen in the past few years. Again, it's one quarter. I wouldn't read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we've added since 2010. Some of that capacity, going back, is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we're layering on a sizable number of FCs this year on top of that that you're seeing the costs for so, again, the 19 that we've announced today.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Could you share what you've learned with the add-on program and the purchase rate you're seeing? And do you think over time you're going to have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that effect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of add-ons, we're &#x2013; our goal is to try to make products available to customers that we aren't &#x2013; weren't able to make available to before, and so it's very early but that's the &#x2013; just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to our customers profitably. So again, there's not much more to it than that.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your holiday &#x2013; as you might go into the holiday season with your third party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games as well as some of the Thailand floods, I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for a holiday season &#x2013; this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is, wondering how we should think about the increasing cost, shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. We're &#x2013; as you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3, it's started. We're adding inventory, getting ready for the holiday season. That will happen throughout Q4. We're continuing trying to increase our in-stock levels so you're certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we're very excited about the getting ready for a great holiday season and that's with our own retail inventory. Certainly we haven't &#x2013; sellers who are selling on our platform will be doing the same thing. And we're getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.</p>
          <p>In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing what would happen from a short term leverage standpoint, it would be premature to do that at this stage. But we can check-in in future periods and talk more about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just one question. On the North America media segment, just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth rate down in that segment, whether it's physical media or otherwise? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not &#x2013; I &#x2013; you've characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast. And it's reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call outs with the exception of &#x2013; if you look back over the past five quarters, certainly the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011, which we're lapping. So that's the other factor, but again very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that that &#x2013; the growth of digital will also trail our device sales, and given the new launch that we've had recently, that will be good for digital content sales going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same-day delivery on a wide scale wasn't a goal. And since then I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery especially here in New York. And there was some news from Walmart that they were going to start shipping from their stores.</p>
          <p>So, could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people? And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to sort of 1% operating margins and just wondering, like is that a philosophical way that you're managing the business? Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to? And we should expect this sort of level going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of same-day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a tremendous amount of selection, and what I was referring to last time was I said I talked about &#x2013; with a large amount of selection broadly, that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere. It's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.</p>
          <p>That being said, we &#x2013; if you look back over the past several years, we have done &#x2013; added a lot of capacity. We're getting &#x2013; we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers. That has helped improve our delivery speed to customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.</p>
          <p>So what I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint and we feel good about that. And again, you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years, and New York is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in the same day in cases.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And our final question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just thinking about this investment cycle &#x2013; it's been like two years and a quarter and yet revenues decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends continue to be kind of down year-over-year. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on returns on the investments you've been making over the last two years? And as far as like, return on invested capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history?</p>
          <p>And then when can we start kind of seeing returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're starting to think about that?</p>
          <p>And then just a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15% for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of return on invested capital, beyond the total numbers there's not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is, in terms of our profile, if you think about the parts of our business, the retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for share owners. We feel it's something that we have, again a lot of experience in, as we've added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies, so we're able to learn from the experiences we've had to date. So we feel good about those.</p>
          <p>We have a great portion of our businesses and our media businesses converting to digital so we've talked a lot about that, and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices. So we feel good about that business and it's growing very fast.</p>
          <p>In terms of our Web Services business, that's a &#x2013; if you start with the core operation of that business. We've been in that part of the business serving Amazon the customer since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of those &#x2013; of that business as well.</p>
          <p>Our third party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically and we like the ROIC potential of those. We're investing in a lot of new geographies. A few in the last couple of years, and on top of that China. China is &#x2013; you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we've been investing in for several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns on invested capital in the short run, in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies. But, again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in, in terms of time line for returns and feel very good about those. So, hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs.</p>
