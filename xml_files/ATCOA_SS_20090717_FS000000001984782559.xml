        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q2 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hans Ola Meyer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome everybody to what we just heard. The conference call on Atlas Copco's second quarter interim report. We will carry this conference call out in the same way as usual, where I will soon handover to our CEO, who will make his comments first of all following the slides that is also posted on our website. So you can follow it from there. And then we will open up for a question-and-answer session as usual after perhaps 15, 20 minutes or something like that.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; I am very happy to hand over at this time to our new CEO, Mr. Ronnie Leten. Please, Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Ola. Thank you very much. And good morning and good afternoon to all of you. Like Hans Ola said, I will follow the handouts which you, I guess, have in front of you or on the Web. And, of course, I will also come time-to-time back to the numbers of the slides. So at least you know where I am.</p>
          <p>Let me start immediately with slide number three, which call the highlights. The demand remained soft in all regions and for all types of products, but I would also like to say that we are here and this has something which I would like to stress and maybe we'll do it also during couple of times in the presentation here. We really compare with the top quarter two 2008. So just as a matter of calibration, when you look to the figures, keep that in mind.</p>
          <p>Australia, China, just two are keeping up reasonable well, and there's also the mining and construction equipment, as well as the standard compressors, and this is a bit of a general remark I want to make when you talk about how it looks. So as we also said during our quarter one conference call, we are looking for some light and maybe to defer a bit what I said earlier, maybe we found some good point in China, but then in some specific market segments. So generally, I would say it's rather a soft development still.</p>
          <p>Cancellations, they are over and we do not see any indications that more is coming. We see a bit better sentiment in the mining segment. That's may be something what indicates why the cancellations are low or over now. Some bright spots, I think that this for me is a bit the aftermarket business. I think it keeps pretty up and I will come back a bit later on that one when we talk a bit on the different business areas.</p>
          <p>We continue to adapt our capacity in our organization and there is definitely good momentum in this adaptation. I think the organization takes it on and we also see that we have some results of these cost reductions we have done in the previous quarters. Of course, unfortunately, this also means that we have reduced further our workforce with 1,600 people in the quarter.</p>
          <p>A strong point we feel is the cash flow. We have managed very well and also that I will come back a bit later in the presentation. The reduction of inventory has improved. We have also done the same on the receivable side. So that gives the reason of the good cash flow. And of course, with this trend will go on, we'll also have a good cash flow for the next quarters. So yeah, this also results in a quite solid cash position we have today, and we will also have in the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide number four, more on the figures. Organic intake, order intake, decline of 37% and this also indicate a bit, if you look more deeper that the prices are holding up in general. We are keeping our prices at the desired level. Of course, we can always be better, but I'm pleased to see that we have a positive side there. So no doubt there is pressure, but we managed reasonable well.</p>
          <p>On the other point, which I feel, given the volume drop is solid outcome we have of the result. If you look here and that adjusted for the non-recurring items, 14.4%. And that is a good achievement for the organization. The other part, I think, when it comes to the other figures, I believe you can read from the slides.</p>
          <p>So let's now go to slide number six, the roadmap. And here you could see that, yeah, it's all so to say no much pluses, I think most have declined. You can see of all our declines, but again, we should not forget that we are also comparing with an extremely strong quarter two in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide number seven called the Americans. We have not seen any great highlight or great light in North America. But on the other hand, what I must admit, if we really dig deeper in the details, we don't see further deterioration either. So that is a good point, and I think also a good point is that we see that the service work in &#x2013; especially in U.S. keeps up and also that the prices are at good stable level.</p>
          <p>South America, construction activities are a bit better, Brazil, Peru and Chile so the larger mining companies are affected. But also on the other hand, I see that also there, the activity is flattening and maybe even we can see that the enquiry level has increased in some of these countries.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Europe, slide number eight. Europe, Africa, Middle East still a soft trend, Russia is really weak and I must say, in general, Europe but with some positive spots or surprising spots, you can say is Italy and the Nordic countries, which showed a very good outcome if we compare the quarters.</p>
          <p>Then, North Africa, keeping up reasonable. I should see maybe also on the figures here and you look to the map, you see a rather significant drop. But on the other hand, I would like to say that we are comparing here also with an extremely strong quarter where we had last year a couple of very large orders, especially in the Middle East. So what makes the comparison very difficult? But there is a lot of activity in that region which is, I must say, quarter that's solid, may be with an exception of the Emeritus, the Middle East, nor do Africa does well for construction and compressors when we compare the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Asia, Australia maybe some light in the tunnel. If we can talk about that. Business in China for some segments are improving. Activities are definitely not deteriorating in the other areas, so that's good. India shows a bit better trend, but definitely not positive when we compare with last year, and Japan is still very weak. One surprising area was Australia for us in the quarter. The mining business is doing very well. But also the compressor business was good in the quarter, when &#x2013; of course when you look again on the map, you would see that we still talk about the minus. But again also there we had an absolute record last year in the quarter, so that makes the comparisons very difficult in this quarter.</p>
          <p>So let's now go to slide number 10, organic growth. The quarter was minus 37, and as I said already before, we are of course comparing again with a very peak year, a peak quarter. And we turn to the bridge, the sales bridge, next slide. Currencies helped the numbers, but the organic growth is 28% on the revenue, 38% on orders received. And again I want to stress that we have a positive effect on price. Elaborate a bit &#x2013; elaborated a bit more on pricing that is focusing what we do is a bit &#x2013; not a bit, but a lot, we focus on top differentiated products that we want to make and that is also a good way to justify the right prices for our products. And that is maybe one key success factor why we are able to do this, and to report at good level the price effect.</p>
          <p>Now, let's go to slide number 13, return on capital employed. It's of course affected by the profit &#x2013; it's affected by the profit, and we are working hard to get our capital employed down, lowered and you saw already on our receivables and our inventory. But, yeah, I think there is still some work to do to get it back on the levels as they were before.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the business areas, the slide 14, Compressor Technique is declining 34% organically. Revenue volume has down 19%. So we're still invoicing equipment from the order book. Aftermarket is holding up very well, and we are not saving any effort neither in terms of personnel nor in terms of money to try to build up this aftermarket. Of course, there is always more aftermarket to take and if you compare the different quarters, you would see that we're coming pretty well out when it comes to the aftermarket for the Compressor Technique.</p>
          <p>If you look at the operating margin, we landed 17.5, if we added back the redundancy cost, which I believe is a solid level. And yeah, here also we are still working on adapting the organization where it needed. So there is still some work to do to bring it back on even higher levels.</p>
          <p>I want just to make a small remark on specialty rental. Also there we see that it keeps up pretty well. So also there we do a lot of effort to further develop that business and that works fine. And then I bring this remark as you remember, we acquired one part of Aggreko a couple of months ago, and we see that that is doing well.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I also would like to highlight that we keep investing strongly on design and development. And that's also here, as stated on the slide, we have received as one of the first company, a certification where we prove we can recuperate a lot of energy out of the compressor, even we can in giving certain references, recuperate as much as we put in that. So again, we keep investing in innovation, we keep investing in design and development in all business areas to really also &#x2013; to make sure we create productivity for our customers, and of course also generate business for us. And this, we do even when the times are tough.</p>
          <p>Now, let's go to slide number 16, now we come to Construction and Mining Technique. Like I said, cancellations are over, incoming orders had been pretty stable at the same level and that we can say, maybe since 2008. And what is also good to see that the aftermarket stays at a pretty healthy level. So that is good. So more enquiries are coming for equipment out of the community, but also, yeah, you can have a lot of requests, but we don't see it really translated in real, real orders. So let's see what it will bring.</p>
          <p>Profit was I think very good achievement after redundancy cost we got 14.3, which I'm very pleased to see and given the market as we are in today.</p>
          <p>If you then go to slide number 18, Industrial Technique, yeah, hit very hard. If you look to the decline, 45% of course that is enormous &#x2013; of course we also know that this business is partly related to the MVI business, which is in a very difficult situation. So yeah, and you've also seen that in the result, which has a big effect.</p>
          <p>We're focusing internally a lot on the business growth, especially in Asia. We are pushing hard at, when it comes to the result. I would also like to highlight that Industrial Technique has a higher vertical integration when we compare with our other businesses like CT and CMT and of course that also &#x2013; then also more affected by the under-absorption when the volume drops. And of course again also here the restructuring costs are very high.</p>
          <p>We're taking measures, of course we don't let it be like this and we are working hard internally to bend trend and to come up with a reasonable profitable level given the volume.</p>
          <p>So let's then move to slide number 21. The P&amp;L of the group, adjusted EBIT say, adding back the restructuring cost, we come out with 14.4% and even when we look to the profit line, we come up to 12%, which is compared with last quarter 10.8 this is mainly to a better financial result. If we then look to the bridge, we see that we have a positive effect of currency, but also that we have in the last quarter when we look to that line.</p>
          <p>So, let's now go to slide number 24, the balance sheet. We can see that comparing with June, last year we have an increase and the two major contributors are as also more or less the same remark as we had in quarter one is of course is the cash accumulation. We have that one. We can say that when we compare June, in June we have around 3 billion more in cash there and of course then another effect is the translation effect, which plays a positive effect on that plan.</p>
          <p>Then look to the slide 25, EBITDA, we are net debt-to-EBITDA, where we are around 1.5%. Of course also here currency place at one row on the left side and we paid also the dividend of 4 billion in the quarter and of course also with the lower earning, the lower EBITDA is of course also affecting this number. But I think still could be healthy number.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 26, I think yeah, the picture shows a very lower maturity profile. So we are proud to have that. I think it's good to be in this situation today.</p>
          <p>So let's go then to slide 27, the cash flow. I think they are as good as they are in quarter one, maybe they showed a bit lower, but okay there is a small explanation for that. But I would say, if you look to the cash flow from real operation, I'd say the inventory reduction is doing well. I think we got good return on our activities. So that is good to see and the same was happening on the receivable side. We have taken real measures to drastically improve in this. Of course we have to improve as the volume drops, but also we see some opportunities to really get efficiency more in the flow, so which will yield some improvements. Of course we can do this faster and we tried to do this faster, but of course there also some activity, some projects or some investments to do before we can all bring this in real result.</p>
          <p>So anyhow in summary, we can say, a strong cash position, a healthy balance sheet and I assume that most of you will agree with me.</p>
          <p>Yeah. And then maybe a last one I forgot to say, investments, they are definitely not high today, definitely not capacity investments. So we stay on that normal level. So that is nothing more to say. Then we come to the maybe most interesting point you want to hear, what is the outlook?</p>
          <p>From us, we feel that the demand will stay around say this present current peak levels with maybe some potential in Asia, where we can see maybe and then more specific India and China. But this is also with a good level of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>So Hans Ola, I would say it's now.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Time to hand over to the audience. Yeah. Thank you very much, Ronnie. We're then ready for the question-and-answer session. And I would turn the word over to the operator first for some instructions.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Guillermo Peigneux of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions from my side. On your aftermarket exposure, would you say that you're guiding towards growth in 2010, maybe? Second on margins. Obviously your orders are deteriorating, and that suggests that you're going to have part of the volume &#x2013; part of revenue pressure going into the next few quarters. Would you say that margins move down from here or actually from here onwards you'll see it stable at these levels or even going higher? Actually, that's from me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can maybe answer on the aftermarket. Of course, we keep pushing and developing, I would say, the aftermarket. And the aftermarket you can develop in two directions. One is, of course, to come with new service products, which we extend our offer to our customers. And on the other hand, we're also looking to services of compressors we are &#x2013; or units we are not servicing, so what we call internally climbing the service level. And this is what we keep doing.</p>
          <p>Of course, if you ask me, will the aftermarket start growing in 2010? Yeah. That is a long shot and that is where everybody is looking forward to that. But anyhow, internally I think we really push hard in really new business development on that side, to make it growing on that side.</p>
          <p>Then, the second one, when it comes to the margin on equipment, like I also said in the presentation is we push a lot on design and development to make our products better for our customers, but at the same time also more cost effective. And by clever design, by using less material, by having higher power densities, so to get these products doing the same at the lower cost, which then if the market stays solid, yeah, which yield then in a better margin on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thank you. Maybe a last one, are you in any position to discuss at the moment your dividend policy going forward or is it too early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dividend policy stays for the time being. I mean there is no -- stays the same as has been communicated. When it comes to the capitalization of the company, of course that is reviewed on a regular basis by the board and the management. And that is, as I said, continuously looked at and who knows what the situation will become nine months from now; that we will have to see. But from a policy point of view, it stays as it is, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Fredric Stahl of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen, it's Fredric here from UBS. I just noted something from your release that light construction equipment is doing well in Eastern Europe of all places. Could you maybe explain a bit on what's happening there?</p>
          <p>And then also second question, I would like to see if you can give us an idea on how it lay &#x2013; how long it will take before sales meet your orders given that your orders are undershooting sales now for the third quarter in a row, I think. But your orders are undershooting sales obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The orders are main situation. Okay. Yeah. I think when it comes to the East Europe, we were pleased to see in the figures that we got a good development there on the construction site and this was mainly also on the lighting and concrete development, which in markets like they were Czech and Poland. So I think that it's a good work we are doing there, we are present, I think we have a good name. And of course, it's picking up the opportunities there. Is it a trend? That really &#x2013; it boost on that. Okay. That I think is too far for me now to say.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the orders on hand, I would say that, I think when we look to the different business areas, we maybe could say that the IT business is more or less on the level where the orders on hand situation is more or less in par with the orders received. Over the orders invoices in par with the orders received, let's say it this way. I think on CMT and CT, I think, we still have a kind of backlog on that one, especially when it comes to CT, when it comes to the larger compressors, we still have some space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps one can simplify and make a little bit of numbers of your question, Fredric, that the fourth quarter had a gap between orders received and orders invoiced of about kr4 billion accentuated by the cancellations of course. It was 2 billion, this gap in the first quarter again with some port cancellations and now there is kr1.5 billion roughly in &#x2013; sorry -- in this gap.</p>
          <p>We don't know, we don't have a perfect crystal ball to say that in two or four or five months we'll be at par if anything &#x2013; if this &#x2013; the demand stays level from today. But it's likely that it will take this year to come to adjust. I think due to the divisions that Ronnie referred to that still have some order backlog to invoice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fantastic. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Peter Testa of One Investment. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Just a couple of questions please. I was wondering if you could give us some sort of your thoughts on how you perceive your material cost situation developing through the second half of the year, maybe some magnitude.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just a follow-up on the aftermarket question earlier, can you &#x2013; on one hand you're pushing very hard to develop your aftermarket business. So I was just wondering if the recession persists in terms of time, the degree to which the headwinds you'll be facing in the aftermarket business would change or increase going forward or whether you perceive that is not an issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. On the material cost development and I think then I would refer in more as the product cost development. Of course we are striving and I said already in the previous question and it was a question about the margins because we are really working hard on the part of engineering and together with purchasing suppliers to get our product cost lower and this is continued strife.</p>
          <p>We had a lot of headwind last year when the material prices were going up from iron ore, copper and others because this -- now we get a bit more tailwind so that helps to bring our product cost at the lower end. And this is coming also now, in real terms also in the different units. So I think we see a reasonable positive development on the lowering of the product cost development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps, Ronnie, if I can shoot in that for those perhaps for Peter who posed the question it's obvious but the reason we talk more about the product cost rather than the material cost is that we do have this &#x2013; a big portion of our production is outsourced, and so for us the direct material input is relatively small part of the product cost. So our focus is for that reason what Ronnie said, that perhaps just as an extra comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the aftermarket, of course it is &#x2013; you can have real aftermarket, also good development when your units, your drilling equipment, your compressors are used. So it's also a lot in function of what is the capacity, in which capacity are all these equipment used. So that is a bit, yeah, will we get a bit of tailwind from that when once the real production in mining, the real production in, say, in the industry pick up a bit.</p>
          <p>Of course we will see that immediately in the aftermarket revenue, which is maybe today also playing a bit against us. But on the other hand, what plays in front of us is what I said we're really going more in selling our aftermarket, getting deeper penetration because we still don't have all our equipment and/or service. So there is still some other areas where we can grow in the aftermarket than just held by the activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you for the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Ben Maslen of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon; it's Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Two questions, please. In terms of the aftermarket, you used to give a rough rule of thumb that accounted for around a third of sales and half of EBIT. Given that you've seen a very steep decline in equipment orders over the last six months, and the aftermarket's been relatively stable, I guess that split has changed quite a lot. And could you give us a bit of color as to the relative size of aftermarket in OE in terms of orders and EBIT at the moment, please? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the aftermarket and equipment ratio, of course the aftermarket is still giving the present situation as still a good development. Of course we all know that equipment has dropped and I don't know which ratio we're looking now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; if I might interpret your question, Ben, I think that the ratios that you refer to is something that we have commented when it comes to compressor technique sometime in the old days or some time ago with that the third of the revenues, etcetera, because as a group as you know we refer to it as being a higher proportion of non-equipment revenues than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; so the ratio of that you referred to and we don't argue that it had been historically around a third in Compressor Technique, was of course lower in years like 2007 and 08, because the equipment growth was so strong. And now we see it quickly coming back and now representing clearly more than a third, if I put it like that. And when it comes to the relative profitability, you all know what we have said before and that hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative profitability meaning between that of the market and the equipment business. That's at least the same type of comment as before, but no more details please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just a second one, in terms of your slide 23, your bridge analysis, the drop through rates or the incremental margins in Compressor Technique and CMT came down quite a lot, 32, 33%; I think that was 40-something in Q1. That's very impressive given that you're destocking at the same time. Can you give us a little bit of color as to why it was so much better than Q1 and whether you think that's sustainable going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perhaps I can start at least and say you're right, it came down from even high 40% numbers in the first quarter. And I think that it's very &#x2013; one has to be a little bit careful to interpret single percentages here, but the trend is clear that you have noticed. It's less of a loss flow through, if you like, in the second quarter than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are not surprised of that direction, so to speak, because as you know, we pride ourselves of having a relatively flexible structure in operationally, meaning that we can adjust fairly quickly to a new level of demand or new level of production without seeing too much of effect on profit margins. But that is a relative thing, of course. And in Q1, we were definitely in the midst of the adjustments as such.</p>
          <p>And now, I would definitely not say that the period of adjustment is over. It's also part in Q2. But as you note, we have a better situation that we lose perhaps a third of every revenue krona lost. And it's nothing of one-offs or specific issues at least. So it is a clean development if you like. If we &#x2013; what lies behind your question is perhaps also what can we expect going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we coming back to a normal level for the future? Well, again, it's very, very difficult to be precise but, yes, I think that something in the order of the second quarter situation is what we would still expect those for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Nico Dil of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. First of all, do you have a view on the destocking impacts that you saw in Industrial Technique? So if your volumes are down around 45% in sales and in orders, how much do you believe your customers have destocked? Second question is that the target on your inventory, how much inventory do you intend to take out by the end of the year?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I was hoping you could give us some aftermarket sales proportions in each of the divisions. And I was especially interested as well in how much the consumables have come down in Construction &amp; Mining Technique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will take maybe the first, okay? Yes, on the IT and the destocking, I think there are very few customers or distributors. I think we are still sitting with a lot of stock on tools side. I think that when it comes to Industrial Technique, I think the destocking in the channel is more or less finished. And as I referred a bit in one of the earlier questions, where we get on the orders on hand situation, I think I also said that you'll obviously see if there's more or less in June with the orders invoiced.</p>
          <p>So that I think we are more or less in balance there, and also I think with our channels. When it comes to inventory target, as such I do not have it here in front of me and really the target. But I can say and if you calculate a bit back &#x2013; of course it will take as a bit of time before coming on the levels where we were before when we talk to net invoice sales or we take it in days. So there is still some work to do and I think this will take us more than one quarter in the different business areas because in all the three business areas, we have far too much stock. And we are looking into that and you can expect significant reduction in the coming quarters. Maybe you can talk about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you talked about the proportion of aftermarket and we've touched up on it in the previous question. But there is a different of course, a difference between the three business areas as many of you know. Relative terms, you can say that in second quarter we estimate that the equipment part, and I'm talking about orders received, the equipment part is somewhere in the region of 55% of group sales and consequently then aftermarket and the rental revenue is about 45% and it's gradually moving every month, sorry, every week as long as the situation stays as we see it as Ronnie has talked about already.</p>
          <p>If we take Compressor Technique, the pure aftermarket is around 35% and then of course, they have specialty rental division as well, which adds more than 5% of the total to that to and then &#x2013; more than 5% &#x2013; represents more than 5% of the total business area. CMT and pure aftermarket is between 30 and 35%, something like that and they also have the consumables business, which take up something like 20 to 25% on top of that. And when it comes to IT, the aftermarket is around 25%, roughly. That should all in all give a &#x2013; an aftermarket proportion clean, so to speak, but including consumables of 40 to 43% or something and including rental 45 or slightly higher than 45% for the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Could you give any clarification on how much consumables came down as you specifically highlighted it in the press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Consumables came down and it was slightly less negative than in the first quarter actually, indicating perhaps the effect of destocking, because this is of course, the revenue part that is mostly affected by that. And the &#x2013; without the consumables, we're still talking about the aftermarket for the group being down as we commented in a couple of places in the report. But it's certainly single-digit down and including consumables, it becomes a little bit more than 10% down.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Michel (sic) [Johan] Trocm&#xE9; from Nordea. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Johan Trocm&#xE9; from Nordea. And if I can just ask you to remind us of the size of Atlas Copco's rental fleet right now. Is it the value for rental machinery that we see in the balance sheet. Is the total assets deployed there greater than that? And how much net debt is associated with the rental business within Atlas Copco Group right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all we don't have a specific financing scheme for the rental equipment. It's part of our corporate debt and corporate &#x2013; the totality. So you can do &#x2013; you can apply whatever you like if you want to say that a certain percent is equity finance and a certain percent is debt-finance. It's as same at the rest of the assets if I put it that way.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the balance sheet, yeah, you have the numbers there and its, yeah, that's the numbers. So it's a net number of course, of whatever depreciation et cetera that is applied is a net of that that you see there, 2.3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be fair Hans Ola to argue that something like 90% of the asset value in the rental business that much net debt could be seen as associated with that business and not really being Atlas Copco Group's liability from the point of view of the rating agencies or how you should...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see where you're going, Johan, I think, as I said, we haven't been forced to do that type of a detail in our discussions with the rating agencies. So it's an assumption that you make that is probably as good as any but it's not something that we identify, you see what I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If can just add a question, you mentioned in the second quarter report that you are carefully reviewing the intangible asset values in Dynapac. Should we read anything into that in terms of there being an imminent risk of an impairment there in the coming quarters, or is it just some things you mentioned as a routine observation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can start <mark type="inaudible" /> it's obvious to everybody that &#x2013; how the economic market situation is and that we have made no secret that the construction market has been weak even before the crisis of last autumn. And the road construction equipment part is no exception to that, so that's quite clear.</p>
          <p>We have also got of course specific questions, for example, in the last Annual General Meeting, we got questions and we answered whether there was any impairment of those assets related to the Dynapac acquisition and do &#x2013; we of course performed impairment tests both at the year-end, as well as now for this closing of the second quarter report.</p>
          <p>And that only confirmed the values that we carry. Ever since the acquisition of course, there has always been a careful study, but given the market situation, that is what merits that say the comment and a little bit more specifically that it has been raised by some shareholders and we wanted to give an answer to those people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course the market is like you said, Hans Ola, the market is the market that it is, but I think when we come to Dynapac, I think we have a lot of activities going on, which really gives the outlook a much brighter view. Because we have adapted if you look to the situation two years ago and now, of course it looks a bit different. But there is a lot of activities going on, new products, we have set up a new entity also in India, which allows us to penetrate in that market. We have some activities and plans when it comes to China. You heard us saying also in the document, which we sent out about East Europe light and concrete, where we see some good activities and prospects for Dynapac, which &#x2013; yeah, we believe that still is a good strategic fit for Atlas Copco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course on what Ronnie comment here, is exactly what is always build into the evaluation of an impairment test of course, it's the market outlook, it's the activities that we can compliment that way to improve the efficiencies et cetera.</p>

          <p>And we will now take our next question from Simon Smith of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi. Thank you. I had one question about your cash flow. You obviously had a &#x2013; did a very good job of taking down the inventories and generally with sort of falling showers you've sort of mismatched between receivables and trade payables as meant with that.</p>
          <p>But you get a positive contribution there as well. And I just sort of wondered what was the negative acting within working capital that meant that you didn't sort of generate more cash than you had used inventories on and obviously in terms of the granularity, I mean, using balance sheet to balance sheet and I do understand there is currency elements in there, which may account for some of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I think I can shed some light on it. In both Q1 and Q2, we have &#x2013; of course, had more reduction of both inventory and receivables than what comes out as the net change of working capital; and the reason for that is that, it is offset by the continuously lower amount of accounts payable we have to suppliers. Meaning that, we continued to pay the old invoices, but we don't order merely enough of material and goods from our suppliers. So that's what is happening right now. Your observation that otherwise looking purely at the inventory and receivables; yes, the figure of reduction would, instead of around 3 billion, as you find between Q1 and Q2 together, it would be rough &#x2013; close to 2 billion more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just a sort of follow-up on a question, which I think you've touched upon, but clearly that you've been under producing in the second quarter quite significantly, and your &#x2013; from what you say about inventory plans, you intend to carry that on. But if &#x2013; do you have a feel as to what the sort of P&amp;L cost has been of that under production and what would possibly reverse when you come &#x2013; when you start to normalize your production levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll go...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we cannot detail the impact as such. Obviously, every company in those, in this period has what is referred to as under absorption of their capacity and &#x2013; or under absorption of fixed cost and the overhead et cetera. But I cannot go into these exact details, but as we talked a little bit about the situation from Q1 and Q2 when we talked about the profit bridge. And of course gradually, we do expect that this under absorption, which is carried in the results of Q1 and Q2 will reside a little bit gradually going forward because we have reduced a lot of employees, we have consolidated assembly plans into one, we have stopped some and so on. So gradually, of course we will have less of a hit in our margins from that.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the total results, of course, you will &#x2013; both from CT and CMT numbers understand that you don't produce 18 and 14% profit margins, if we have an enormous cost of under absorption. It is material in relation to where we come from of course, but it's not an enormous amount when it comes to IT of course they suffer a lot from this as Ronnie indicated before. But to give an estimate that, 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7% would have sort of comeback as soon as we get into regime (50.18) that this is extremely difficult to give a projection and we cannot do that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think you might have touched upon, I wasn't quite clear if you were actually saying this. But in terms of progression of margin I mean, obviously you'll now get into environment where you're seeing a flatter environment, you've sort of more advanced with internal action that you're taking and you're starting to look for signs of life in various markets. I'll take you from that point, you must be growing in confidence that you've maybe seen the low point for margins for this cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a very difficult situation of course. We'd see of course, there is still a lot of activity to do and it is also depending on where it all happens, because, like you see if I go back to my outlook, you have some areas where we see some positive things. But you also have some areas where you have negative hits and then you have to see how you are really set up there, which maybe can create, yeah, a bit annoying underabsorption on that point.</p>
          <p>So to answer your question, have we really on that on the margin reach the bottom on that one, yeah, it's a bit &#x2013; we of course &#x2013; one thing I can say and that is of course, I accept this. We are confident that the organization is geared up in adapting and that's for sure, but we are not at the end of adapting that is also to say. That is, I think we should not forget that. Although I &#x2013; maybe I sound a bit more positive than maybe we sound a quarter backwards. But we still have a lot to do in adapting our organization overcapacity and also coming back to the good efficiency levels we had a couple quarters back.</p>
          <p>Perhaps it's understood by everybody. But of course when you look for in answering such a question, you also have to consider of course that each quarter, even if it's looking forward, is not exactly the same. We will have effects of the seasonality in the third quarter and these kind of things that we have, it's correct that that is happening every year.</p>
          <p>But the &#x2013; those impacts after such a heavy correction and mix effects on top of that is not so easy to predict. So that's why we sound very vague when it comes to confirming anything regarding the margins in the near future at least.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Colin Gibson of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Yeah, Colin Gibson from HSBC. Two questions, please. First of all on Industrial Technique. There's obviously quite a big difference between the performance of Industrial Technique and the other businesses at the moment. And yet, I realize all of these industries face a very, very difficult demand environment and that's obviously a big part of the explanation for the performance. Nonetheless, quite a big difference for Industrial Technique.</p>
          <p>To what extent are you worried that there are structural problems underlying that performance, or maybe simply that your franchise isn't as good in that business as in some of the other businesses? And so to what extent do you think some of these problems may be more persistent than they will be in the other businesses? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, for Ronnie, this is your first call, and you've newly taken over as CEO. If I look back over the last few years at Atlas Copco and the last few CEOs at Atlas Copco, most of them have ended up being remembered at least by people in the capital markets for something. Treschow and Mazzalupi bought a lot of businesses, sold a lot of businesses. What do you think the capital markets will end up remembering Ronnie Leten for? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow. Actually this is philosophical question. I was not prepared for that to answer, so now I have to think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you start with the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I can start thinking then about that. When it comes to IT, that's definitely and I refer back a bit to what we said in the beginning of the presentation here. Of course the performance is difficult and we should also not forget 45% drop which we have for an organization. It's for anyone, for any business, you can find on earth it will be very difficult to cope with that one.</p>
          <p>And of course, when it comes to the IT business area setup, we also have said that they are more vertical integrated than we have in CT and CMT on that one, which was good. And you've seen also we should not forget if we look back a year ago or two years ago, we had extremely good profitabilities. Of course, we have a very short memory on that one. So that is the positive side on that one.</p>
          <p>But to answer your question, are there definitely structural changes, demand that we're having difficulties? We're looking into that and we are adapting areas. There is one thing definitely that we have in this setup, we have overcapacity. Otherwise, we will not have this under-absorption. I think there is no secret on that one. We are working on that.</p>
          <p>We are also looking in the way we design our products, so that we also have the ability to be more agile on when the volume is changing so we can get more leaner structure, more outsourcing structure as we have in CT, CMT. These are activities which were already started before the downturn more or less, but we'll take a bit of time on that one. And we are working on that to bring it on the level, which is, yeah, which is a good level on that one.</p>
          <p>But no one of us, neither my predecessor, neither myself had of course in the book in the plans that there was a drop of 45%. So that we had to go through on that one. But there are definitely measures to be taken, which also are discussed with management, also discussed internally, which is no secret for anyone. The organization is alert on that and this is on levels on manufacturing side. This is on level on engineering, on purchasing. This is on different areas on that one. Maybe, Hans got -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, just an add-on comment as many or most of you will remember, we have started, or we did start in last year restructuring of the manufacturing set of a pneumatic tools in this business area.</p>
          <p>And perhaps with hindsight, you can say that the complexity of that process was not helped by a dramatic fall of the market in the midst of that process. And that is, of course, also weighing into the result levels that we see today and &#x2013; but it's definitely part of what Ronnie already commented.</p>
          <p>But perhaps as a final comment to you, Colin, it's also well known to you, I'm sure because we just commented it. There is clearly lower level of aftermarket revenues in this business area compared to the other two.</p>
          <p>So the hit of the &#x2013; fall of equipment and also with the business that works with very high operating gross margins from the start, I mean it is a painful hit that they have suffered. So now to the billion dollar...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Now I got some time. Hans Ola, really said to me, that I had some time to think about it. And I hope you have some paper in front of you so you can write it down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I am all here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are all there, okay. Good, good. I think what if I, maybe &#x2013; if I'm going on this position, within a couple of years then how would I like to remember those something at that time. I think I have four points, which I would like really to enforce or let in the organization and one is product development.</p>
          <p>I really believe that product development stimulate, our organization stimulate also the business and of course it is also good for our customers, because we will also generate value for our customers, so stimulation of innovation product development that's one thing.</p>
          <p>Second, I think I would put a lot of effort in development, further development, I should say of Asia. I'm a real believer that China and India is one of our key focus areas for Atlas Copco. We are doing well. I think we can be proud of what we've accomplished there. But there is more to take for us and we must make sure we are there and go further in that one.</p>
          <p>The third one is diversity. I believe we can do better there. We have already a lot of programs coming on and I think also Gunnar spend a lot of time on that one and was also pushing on that, but there is still more to do that. And I think it comes to diversity of general diversity.</p>
          <p>And the second one, if you then relate it to Asia, we also will hopefully see very soon, whenever the soon is, that we have Asian presidents and maybe have an Asia business area president or maybe we have an Asian CEO, who knows, whatever. So that is one other ambition I'm putting in the organization.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, is the customer focus. We should not forget that we are in the market for our customers. We are not in the market for compressors, not for drill rigs, not for tools. We are there because our customers need our products. And that is, say, a last stamp I would let on the organization on that one. So I hope it gives a good overview and I hope time-to-time that you do a follow-up on that. So I can report on that. Well, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With that I think that's &#x2013; it's almost difficult to continue after that type of a question, isn't it? But we make a try and we take a final question because time is running fast and as always I used -- normally say, we are here to answer whatever questions we were not able to take on this call, but we can take separately also. But one final question, operator, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question comes from Mats Liss of Swedbank Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, thanks. Swedbank Markets. Well, you made some comments regarding IT and maybe you have something in mind there regarding the structural issues. And I just wondered if you could, well, I guess you can make the same comments regarding the other two, CT and CMT. Or &#x2013; and that's the first one, yes.</p>
          <p>And the second question is more related to the mining segments. If you have seen any -- while you indicated you &#x2013; well, activity improves and I just wonder if you could be a bit more specific within which areas. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, on IT and when they talk about structural change, what I mean with structural is that also the way we design our products, the way we produce our products, there is always one flow. And if we want to be at the level where we are able to say purchase 70 to 80% as we are in on the CT and CMT level, I think we have to look into our design of our products. And this is what I mean with structural. I'm not going to say that we have created another business there; we go to have different divisions. This is not what I mean by the structural, you can think about. But, it is really the structured the way we do things in this one &#x2013; in this business, which is allows us also then to work different in our factories will also be easier to transplant in areas where the business is. So that is what we really working hard in IT to accomplish that.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this is not just, yeah, a quick one that you said, okay we, closed the plant, we moved the factory to China and closed gates, it's off. Now this will take a bit more time on that one. But in the meantime, of course we work on adapting the capacity, which allows them to reduce the under-absorption.</p>
          <p>Then, yeah, on the mining what I said, of course, I said a couple of times what we see is, okay, we get for certain areas and this is underground. We get the good quotation level, so there is demand for pricing, let's say this way, but of course not real orders and we see that in &#x2013; where I also mentioned, we see that a bit in Australia; we see that also in Peru and Chile coming from a bit on the copper side and a bit on the gold side. So that is as far as I think I can go in this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just about the capacity issue. I guess you have made this mounting reduction, and my question was more perhaps related to the structure or the capacity with factories, if you see the need to adjust to make any &#x2013; address more drastic steps or if you wait until the markets probably would improve going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, we will not wait. No, we will adapt the capacity and then we are also working on that side to reduce the overhead capacity on that plan. And then that will mean a couple of, yeah, structural changes when it comes to the factories and maybe other areas, yeah. But we have to look into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; one can of course call it, capacity, I can also call a lot of projects on efficiency and that's exactly what Ronnie has referred to before that that it's not all about producing 10 units means that you have a factory for 10 and then if it goes down to eight, you have a factory that you have to close. And it is of course an enormous amount of variety in these projects and you could just as well call them efficiency measures as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. I think...</p>
