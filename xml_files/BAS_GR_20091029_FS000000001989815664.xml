        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's my great pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2009 conference call. When we informed the markets two weeks ago about our third quarter 2009 preliminary results, which were substantially better than expected. It took many of you by surprise.</p>
          <p>Today, we would like to provide you with further details on our third quarter performance, discuss the status of the Ciba integration and give you an outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today are Dr. J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer and Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, member of the Board of Executive Directors and responsible for the integration of Ciba.</p>
          <p>For your reference, we have posted the presentation and the speech on our website at basf.com/share.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand over to Dr. Hambrecht.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maggie, and ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As already announced in mid-October, BASF has demonstrated its operational strength by showing the third consecutive quarterly improvement this year.</p>
          <p>Impulses for growth were coming from Asia, especially China, as well as from parts of South America. We noticed that inventory reduction is coming to an end. In addition, economic stimulus packages improved demand. Overall, markets have stabilized on a low level.</p>
          <p>The sequential earnings improvement in the third quarter reflects BASF's operational strength and the focus on our value before volume strategy. We are seeing the effects of the extensive measures to adjust capacity, to enhance efficiency, to reduce costs, and to maintain margins. The BASF team worldwide has performed extremely well. Flexibility, solidarity, and Verbund-thinking are values all our employees stand for.</p>
          <p>I assume all of you are already familiar with our Q3 numbers, so I will only highlight a few figures. Sales totaled &#x20AC;12.8 billion and thus were 19% below previous year, but 2% higher than second quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA declined by 8% to &#x20AC;2 billion compared to Q3 2008, but grew by 26% versus previous quarter. Compared with last year, depreciation grew by &#x20AC;360 million, mainly as a consequence of acquiring Ciba.</p>
          <p>Third quarter EBIT before special items amounted to &#x20AC;1.2 billion, down 20% versus last year, but up 9% versus last quarter. If you take into account the drop of non-deductible oil taxes by almost &#x20AC;300 million, EBIT before special items almost achieved level of last year's third quarter. BASF incurred &#x20AC;277 million of special items related to the Ciba integration, and the restructuring of BASF sites. Earnings per share dropped 68% to &#x20AC;0.26. Adjusted for special items and amortization on intangible assets, earnings per share amounted to &#x20AC;0.61, a drop of 36%.</p>
          <p>One of our core strengths of BASF is its cash flow generation. Despite lower net earnings, we realized an operating cash flow of &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the third quarter. In the first nine months, operating cash flow equaled &#x20AC;5.4 billion, an increase of 50% compared to last year. Despite improved volumes, we were able to further reduce net working capital by about &#x20AC;450 million in the third quarter. Total cash inflow from net working capital in the first nine months amounted to &#x20AC;2 billion, two times the target we had set ourselves at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>In the following slides we have summarized the regional sales dynamics of our chemical activities over the last four quarters. Let us start with Europe and North America. In the first quarter, sales in Europe and North America fell by around 40% compared to the average sales per quarter in 2008. In Q3 and Q2, Europe and North America recovered, but remained 20% and 30%, respectively, below previous year level.</p>
          <p>Sales in Asia Pacific fell even more dramatically in the first quarter. From this trough, sales recovered rapidly and are now only 8% below previous year. In South America, the crisis was not as deep as in the other regions, as you see.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the business development in the third quarter in more detail. We have seen the fourth consecutive quarter with volume below last year's levels, but the rate of decline softened. Prices declined by 19%. In a more meaningful comparison with Q2 2009, volumes increased by about 4% and we managed to keep prices stable. The sequential development of volumes was negatively impacted by the seasonal slowdown in our Crop Protection business. Specifically with respect to the chemical activities, we realized a 9% volume and a 4% price increase. In turn, volume in oil and gas climbed by 9%, but prices dropped by 15%.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand over to Kurt, who will give you an update on the performance of our segments and our financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, J&#xFC;rgen and good afternoon also from my side. Our third quarter interim report provides you with in-depth information on our segment results, including year-over-year comparisons. Today I will focus only on the highlights and sequential changes between the second and the third quarters of 2009, which is more meaningful given the disruptive changes over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying that all our chemical segments showed gratifying earnings improvements over Q2. Two of these segments even beat the strong performance of the third quarter of 2008. In chemicals, volumes increased by 4% with growth coming particularly from Asia. Prices were up 9%. Earnings increased in all divisions, reflecting our measures to reduce fixed costs and the successful execution of our value before volume strategy.</p>
          <p>In petrochemicals, we reported higher earnings mainly because of stronger demand and improved margins. Given temporary shortages for olefins and acrylic derivatives, we were able to pass on higher raw material costs. Inorganics and Intermediates benefited from higher orders from key customers in the electronics, textile, coatings and plastic industries.</p>
          <p>Volumes in plastics increased by 10% while prices rose by 5%. As a result of our ongoing cost cutting and margin management programs, earnings improved considerably and were above the level of Q3 2008.</p>
          <p>In performance polymers we experienced a slight recovery in demand from customers in the construction, automotive and textile industries. In polyurethanes there was stronger demand for MDI and TDI in all regions, especially in Asia. Margin improvements for TDI contributed positively to earnings.</p>
          <p>The Performance Products segment changed substantially as a result of the addition of around &#x20AC;800 million in sales from the former Ciba activities. Before integration costs, the former Ciba businesses contributed positively to earnings of the Performance Products segment. EBIT before special items was above the level of Q3 2008.</p>
          <p>The segment reported a sequential sales increase of 9% with volumes going up by 8% and better earnings, thanks to improved demand from some customer industries, price/margin containment and comprehensive cost reduction measures.</p>
          <p>In Dispersions &amp; Pigments we noted increasing orders from construction while demand for pigments from the automotive industry remained at a low level. In Care Chemicals we had record earnings driven by vitamins and surfactants. Paper Chemicals realized higher volumes and better margins as industry production levels stabilized. The business nevertheless continues to operate in a difficult market environment. Performance chemicals generated higher volumes and better margins through cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Sales and earnings in Functional Solutions improved considerably compared with Q2. Volumes increased by 9%. All divisions reported higher earnings but segment profitability still suffered from subdued market conditions in the automotive and construction industries. The earnings increase was mainly attributable to fixed cost reductions and restructuring measures.</p>
          <p>In catalysts sales and earnings improved due to slightly higher volumes of automotive catalysts on a unit basis supported by car scrapping programs. There was stable demand for refinery catalysts but as yet not the recovery in chemical catalysts.</p>
          <p>The seasonal upturn in construction activity was less pronounced than usual and the Construction Chemicals division reported slightly higher sales in all regions except the Middle East. Earnings were up due to higher prices and lower fixed costs. Higher volumes in automotive coatings and seasonally higher demand for decorative paints in South America drove sales growth in coatings. Earnings also benefited from lower fixed costs.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of this year, agricultural solutions showed an excellent performance. Sales of our crop protection products grew by 7%. Based on constant exchange rates the increase was 3%. EBIT before special items amounted to &#x20AC;732 million, a 12% increase year-on-year. The positive business development was triggered by strong demand for our innovative crop protection products, particularly F500 and Boscalid.</p>
          <p>Business in Q3, however, was impacted by adverse weather conditions as well as lower commodity prices, especially for corn and wheat. Sales decreased by 2% or 5% based on constant exchange rates. We made a good start to the growing season in South America, given favorable soy prices and high disease pressure. EBIT before special items amounted to &#x20AC;21 million. This is second time after 2008, that Crop Protection reported a positive EBIT in the seasonally weak third quarter. Earnings were impacted and will be impacted going forward by higher fixed costs related to R&amp;D, registration costs, as well as intensified marketing and sales activities in Eastern Europe and South America. We are, however, confident that our Crop Protection business will exceed the EBITDA margin target of 25% in 2009.</p>
          <p>The substantial sales and earnings decline in the third quarter versus the last year was mainly due, in oil and gas to the 38% oil price decline in euros per barrel and the drop in non-deductible oil taxes by &#x20AC;287 million to &#x20AC;244 million. As a result of lower taxes, net income after minority interest increased of &#x20AC;186 million was 10% higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Volumes in natural gas production increased by 24%, thanks to higher production from the Siberian gas field Yuzhno Russkoye. In this quarter, the field reached its plateau-production of 76 million cubic meters per day. Oil production dropped by 12% due to the lower OPEC production quota in Libya. Natural Gas Trading, sales volumes increased mainly due to supply shifts from customers from the first half-year into the third quarter. Despite 26% lower sales prices, improved margins led to higher earnings.</p>
          <p>Sales and earnings of oil and gas, both in exploration and production as well as in natural gas are strongly influenced by the increased volatility of crude oil prices we are experiencing. Our Q4 2009 earnings figures are thus expected to be at the level of Q2 and Q3 of this year. In E&amp;P, the price of natural gas, which currently accounts for two-thirds of our total hydrocarbon production is linked via price formulas to the price of oil products with a time lag of six to nine months. Prices for natural gas produced in the fourth quarter therefore will on average reflect the low oil price level of the first quarter 2009. In natural gas trading, we will see negative time lag effects caused by the steep increase in oil prices throughout 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn over to other. Styrenics sales increased by 15% compared with the second quarter of 2009 as a result of higher prices for styrene, polystyrene and ABS. Earnings were at a satisfying level, but slightly below the good results in the second quarter, mainly due to lower margins in China.</p>
          <p>The fertilizer business experienced a weak third quarter and impacted earnings negatively. EBIT of other was minus &#x20AC;391 million compared with minus &#x20AC;312 million in Q2 and minus &#x20AC;320 million in Q3 of last year. EBIT includes higher accruals for BASF's option program following the strong share price increase and a provision for restructuring costs, which will be allocated to the affected divisions as soon as the measures are published.</p>
          <p>In Q3 special items including restructuring costs totaled &#x20AC;277 million, &#x20AC;218 million more than in Q3 of 2008. Special items included &#x20AC;128 million of amortization of intangible assets, for example the Ciba ERP-system. Total special charges relating to the Ciba integration amounted to &#x20AC;157 million.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date special items stand at &#x20AC;702 million. For 2009, we expect special items including Ciba integration costs of more than &#x20AC;1 billion. J&#xFC;rgen will talk more about this in just a moment.</p>
          <p>When looking at our Q3 numbers it is important to highlight the following additional effects apart from the special items. First, the financial result, which amounted to minus &#x20AC;173 million. This was substantially lower than in the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher interest and pension obligation expenses also arising from the inclusion of Ciba.</p>
          <p>Second, at 60% our tax rate was 14 percentage points higher than in the third quarter of 2008. One-time effects related to the Ciba acquisition were responsible for this increase. Third, we have mostly concluded the purchase-price allocation for Ciba, which will result in an additional amortization and depreciation of mostly intangible assets of about &#x20AC;140 million in 2009. Year-to-date, the effect was &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by having a quick look at our balance sheet. As of September 30, the Ciba acquisition had an effect of about &#x20AC;4.5 billion on our balance sheet, including an additional goodwill of &#x20AC;623 million and financial debt of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. Since the end of last year, BASF's net debt grew only from &#x20AC;11.7 billion to &#x20AC;12.9 billion, despite acquiring Ciba and paying our dividends of about &#x20AC;2 billion. This is another indicator for our strong cash flow generating capability.</p>
          <p>Let me hand back to J&#xFC;rgen, who will give you an update on the Ciba integration and our efforts to further improve our operational excellence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, ladies and gentlemen, you all know operational excellence operational excellence is a core competence of BASF and we strive for further improvements day by day.</p>
          <p>In mid 2008, we implemented another worldwide efficiency program called NEXT, which stands for New Excellence Targets. Currently, NEXT is running at full speed. We estimate that the program will already lead to cost savings of about &#x20AC;300 million in 2009. By 2012, we target a sustainable annual earnings contribution of more than one billion.</p>
          <p>With NEXT we will enter a new level of operational excellence, setting benchmark in our industry. And as always, we are acting quickly and decisively. For example, this year we close or divest at least 20 plants and sites, excluding the Ciba integration and there is still more to come. This leads me to the update on our Ciba integration.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the discovery phase we announced target cost synergies of at least &#x20AC;400 million per year or 10% of Ciba's 2008 sales. From today's perspective, we expect even higher cost synergies. The additional identified synergies are mainly related to corporate functions and procurement. All in all, we are now confident to achieve at least, and I underline, at least &#x20AC;450 million of cost synergies by 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we expect to realize already &#x20AC;60 million in synergies, 50% more than indicated at the end of the second quarter. By the end of 2009, the 12-month cost synergy run rate will amount to &#x20AC;120 million. And the annual cost synergy run rate for the integration of Ciba will increase then to &#x20AC;350 million by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>To fully exploit the potential of the joint businesses, extensive restructuring measures are required. As you can see, we made significant progress over the last three months. Cost synergies are higher and they will come in earlier than originally planned. The restructuring plans now include a reduction of approximately 3,800 positions. The majority of these positions will be eliminated by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Until year-end, we will close already 33 of the planned 56 Ciba sales and administrative offices and research sites. Final decisions concerning the 23 production sites under strategic review will be made in the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>The accelerated integration results in a steeper ramp-up of cost synergies. This also means that integration costs become more front-end loaded. Total integration costs, however, will increase only slightly to approximately &#x20AC;1.1 billion. By the end of September, we incurred &#x20AC;470 million of integration costs, most booked as special items.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2009, we expect total integration costs to equal &#x20AC;800 million thereof &#x20AC;720 million in special items. Cash-out will amount to approximately &#x20AC;150 million, mainly in the fourth quarter. In 2010 cash-out will be higher due to severance payments. Now to the outlook.</p>
          <p>The economic environment in Asia is improving and business conditions in the U.S. and Europe are stabilizing at very low levels. However, economic developments in the coming months remain difficult to predict. Although the mood is slightly brighter and we are climbing out of the trough, the recovery remains slow and fragile.</p>
          <p>A persistent shortfall in demand will weigh on supply. Stimulus packages are running out, unemployment is increasing and banks remain cautious about lending, which all in all may slow down the recovery. A sustained upturn is not yet in sight. We updated our expectations for the entire year 2009. We now project global chemical production to decrease by 6% compared to our earlier forecast of minus 8%. This excludes pharma, of course.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2009, we raised our average oil price assumption from 55 to US$60 per barrel and the euro/dollar exchange rate from 1.35 to 1.40. How does this translate into BASF figures in 2009. In view of the ongoing challenging business environment, we expect fourth quarter sales on the level of the third quarter 2009. EBIT before special items is expected to come in above fourth quarter of 2008, but below third quarter results as we will see a slowdown in demand towards year-end and Chinese New Year.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009, we anticipate a significant decline in sales and earnings. The Ciba integration has been accelerated and therefore higher integration costs will negatively impact earnings. BASF is therefore unlikely to reach its goal of earning its cost of capital this year. Excluding the Ciba integration, however, BASF would earn its cost of capital also in the crisis year 2009. This demonstrates the underlying operational strength of our businesses and underlines that we are pursuing the right strategy.</p>
          <p>And with this I now &#x2013; we are now happy to take you questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a remark from my side. We would appreciate, if you please ask only one question at a time, so that we can take as many questions as possible. And of course, and this I promise, you're always welcome to comeback with a follow-up question. So the first question in my queue comes from Thomas Gilbert, UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. In London or from London, thanks for taking my question. Performance products specifically the Care Chemicals division had a very, very strong result. Could you breakdown probably the strengths between you mentioned surfactants. Exactly, which chemical products in &#x2013; is it the glycol derivatives that were very strong and the vitamins business, which one &#x2013; were they equally strong or was there one or other that had an absolute outstanding quarter. And if you could &#x2013; just if you could talk a little bit around, that will be great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas, a few remarks here. We look into the results in Q3 what we see is nutrition, detergents and formulators are really performing very well. The same applies to cosmetics and aroma chemicals. I have to say, if we look into individual product lines, this is going too deep, but I can give you indication vitamin A and E has performed better whereas Vitamin B2 is not performing very well because there is over capacity in the market.</p>
          <p>Overall, I have to say if you look into Care Chemicals, this business is less impacted by the economic downturn, nutrition, hygiene, pharma is performing generally better and this is reflected in this business as well as tremendous cost cutting efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Well, there is no special impact from monoethylene glycol or any commodity products in there. It is the genuine downstream businesses that performed very well, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Neil Tyler, JPMorgan, and then I have Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about costs really, in addition to the cost savings that you outlined in the introductory comments, I wonder if you could perhaps try and quantify firstly what has happened year-on-year to the input cost, raw material costs and secondly whether you're at all able to quantify the cost benefit of the short-term working measures that you implemented earlier in the year, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, let me address the second piece first. I think the cost benefit of short-time working are limited. This is not a big and huge figure. However, we have reduced services very much. So those people who have not been employed within BASF have been reduced rather substantially and this is reflected in the costs savings.</p>
          <p>To quantify the input cost, raw material cost, I have to say there are two things. The first one is, of course they are much lower volumes, but overall as a rule of thumb this year we have reduction in raw material cost of 25%. And this &#x2013; now translating into margins to be very straightforward with you, this is a mix bag yes, in chemical business we have benefited partly of from that. But in oil and gas, we have not benefited from that. All in all, it is not a substantial improvement from raw material cost in our margins and going forward this really reflects, so to speak, what we have achieved in our price before cost strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. A question on the Ciba synergy costs, the integration costs. You got into 800 million for this year. Now I assume part of that is only cash costs, I've been told a 150 million of cash costs for 2009. Presumably then you are writing forward quite a large provision for future cash costs. How come we don't see that in your nine-month cash flow statement or will it all come through in Q4? And are there any other kind of funny Ciba cash adjustments to come in Q4? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Hans Engel. I don't think that you will see any type of funny cash adjustments. Give you the full picture here we are expecting a total of 800 million in integration cost for the year 2009. This is 800 million out of the total of 1.1 billion. Now if you look at the 1.1 billion total integration cost that we'll see over the time span 2009 through 2012, in that you have 600 million in cash and 500 million in non-cash. Out of the 600 million in cash, we will see most probably roundabout 150 million cash expenses in the year 2009 and then a larger chunk coming in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So how can we &#x2013; in the nine-month cash flow statement that you've just published, we don't see an adjustment between the non-cash element of those restructuring charges?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Kurt, Rhian. It hasn't had any effect in Q3 actually. We will provision for additional restructuring cost and severance payments in Q4, but frankly given the size of our cash flow and our balance sheet these are really, I think minor influences.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon; thank you for taking my question. This summer you stick to your statement that BASF is unlikely to cover its cost of capital succussing that dividend could be reduced, but now you say also that excluding Ciba you would be able to earn premium. And given the one-time effect of the integration cost versus the long-term strategy of the group, in term of cash flow generation, could you still consider to maintain a stable dividend despite not covering the cost of capital this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthias, I have to disappoint you. If we have extraordinary income, you will have extraordinary payments. We have demonstrated this in the year 2000. But if we have and this is an ongoing business and what we do is really designing the future of BASF, if we have a certain burden we &#x2013; you also will have to join this. So all in all, if we are not earning our cost of capital yes, dividend will be reduced, but BASF always have been very much stakeholder oriented and part of the stakeholders are the shareholders and we always have paid rather high dividend, so you will see a decent dividend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Just on Ciba, looking at the other side of the coin obviously the benefit of all this restructuring, I seem to remember they used to throw out a target in the Plastic Additives franchise of and EBITDA margin of somewhere between 20 and 25 and obviously that's when they spend out, they got nowhere near that in the 2000s decade. But clearly you were reaping out hell of a lot of cost, and it doesn't on the phase there that that sort of franchise could see margins move back into the teens. I mean were their all targets completely out of sink or is your thinking that this franchise is one where it could certainly be above average in terms of the spec &#x2013; chem's spectrum on performance? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter, very clearly, at this very point, we are not yet able to comment on EBITDA margin. But what we can really tell you is, our strategy is right what we have seen so far is we will strengthen our Specialty Chemicals business and this really means at end of the day higher EBITDA margins. And we are certainly striving for the best we can achieve in the market conditions we are actually in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one question regarding the gas price. There is strong difference between the spots and the contract price, does that effect in any kind the WINGAS business in Q3 or in Q4, whether it's positive or negative. And linked to this, the gas fields in the North Sea, do they sell all the gas under the contract price, we can see or is there also that they have to sell it for spot price? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, yeah let me start with the second part of the question, gas fields in the North Sea. As far as I know, all of these sales are done based on oil price related formulas. Spot and contract prices, you're absolutely right. There is a larger disparity for well know reasons at this point in time. Does that have in Q3 an impact on the WINGAS business? The answer to that is no. Are we faced with situations where customers are entering into price revision discussions, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will that have an impact in Q4 then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest impact that we will see in Q4 on the natural gas trading business will simply have to do with the pricing formulas in our sales contracts because if you think about how that works, the formula there is one that we call 661, the oil prices from Q4 and Q1 of 2008 and 2009 will be relevant for the sales prices and that is actually when oil prices hit their lows.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hellos together, little bit on the Q4 outlook, you gave an outlook on the clean EBIT level saying it would be better than Q4 '08, but clearly not the level of Q3 '09. If I look on the figures they're still that is despite of over 700 million, can you be a little bit more concrete on that perhaps also to avoid that you have to once again, make a talk before the general press conference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nobert, do you know that we are not guiding quarterly, but let me try to help you a little bit because there is public knowledge available. Cracker margins will decline, in Q4, you see this already. Taken, if you look into Performance Products, we will not be able to repeat Q3 earnings and there are basically two factors. I think first of all, you have understated the turnaround in Ciba in Q3 compared to Q2 and Q1 because there was a positive contribution if you deduct indication costs. And secondly, efficiency improvement costs.</p>
          <p>Looking into the fourth quarter, there is a seasonal weakness in Performance Products always, but we will see somewhat weaker seasonal downturn or let me say, seasonal downturn and the indication cost as said already for Ciba are little bit higher. Now Functional Solution certainly also a seasonal downturn accrual. We have already said that this business start was positive, so sales will be higher. But earnings will be lower and this is what Kurt already mentioned because we deliberatively invest at this very moment in R&amp;D, but also in marketing and sales and now oil and gas we have already guided. So all in all, if you look into what's the consensus from your side tells. I think it's not far apart.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question to the other line. Looking point number one, obviously at the option &#x2013; management option program, can give us &#x2013; quantify the number of provisions you have made and obviously where is that booked meaning, you have explained here the four major items, but we still miss 111 million so to say unexplained is that &#x2013; this is the option or is that anything else which would impact the others. And additional to the others reallocation, so you said in Q4 you will reallocate to the segments, can you also give a kind of number what we should expect to get reallocate to the segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay now we're on. Mr. K&#xF6;hler, I beg your understanding if I don't go into too many details because the other position actually has more than 50 items. The big factors of this quarter really is the options program that was almost a three-digit number. As you all know this is purely driven by share price development. This is a market valuation at the end of quarter, though this can change until the end of 2009 again. And then we had a provision for restructuring cost, which have not yet been announced internally and externally and for that reason we could also not allocate this to the affected businesses. That's about the same order of magnitude and this will be then become more concrete in the fourth quarter. And certainly than late February we will talk about all the special items in much more detail when we talk about our balance sheet and the financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then we have to expect something like around 200 million to get allocated from today's perspective from others into the segment, that's right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessary, the options program won't get allocated and again the options program is purely market price that can change, it can change overnight as we all know. So we talk about 100 million, which will get allocated to the divisions over the course of the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>So the next question is from Fraser Hill, Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon thanks for taking the question. So if you could update us on your capacities globally, both in terms of your utilization, you had been talking, I think last time just slightly above 60% having been slightly below in the first quarter where maybe that was in Q3 and perhaps now at the beginning of Q4. And with that you obviously sort of restarted certain capacities over the last couple of months which mainly the second cracker in Ludwigshafen, are there any other facilities that are also being restarted or what proportion of idled plants are under plans to be restarted during the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fraser, this is one my most favorite questions. Capacity utilization, I really have to tell you average utilization rate is of nonsense. Why? Because this is most probably the most frequently misused figure you can find. So I refuse to give a comment on that, but I can tell you that we are 10 to 20% dependant on the respective product lines below the capacity utilization we had in the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look into the respective plants and you asked for how many plans are still idled? Yeah, we have restarted most of the plants. Cracker was not restarted because of the basic demand, but because lot of our competitors had failures in their plants and unexpected breakdowns.</p>
          <p>Now all in all if you look into this, you need to go into the respective product lines. And as we go forward, there is tremendous over capacity. I am saying this always each time we're sitting together and we need to address it. Not only we. We have to give the example for the entire industry and we're doing this by closing down, for example styrene plant and polystyrene plant and EPS plants, THF and PolyTHF, butanediol plants and so forth and so forth. And we will continue to do so and you just have heard recently about new announcement and we'll look more closely into this because this is the most important thing. If we want to maintain margins going forward and as you know we strive price before volume and this will be difficult as capacities come back on stream going forward into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any product categories, where you feel your competitors have also shut significant capacities permanently and maybe where structurally pricing might have improved? I know you're just generally cautious on the topic, but any areas that give you a bit more cause for optimism.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Fraser, where the pressure is the biggest there is action also from competitors. So there are styrene plants closed down in North America, for example by Dow. We have cracker closed down in North America but started up new crackers in the Middle East and we have also on the butanediol side, we have closures of competitors in North America.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; Yeah, I'm member of Deutsche Bank Group sometime soon maybe. During your Investor Day focusing on Asia, the speaker has mentioned lack in pricing discipline by the industry in general. Is that observations are true and how do you touch your own pricing power at present also maybe going into 2010 negotiations with customers and in that respect how far is your auto visibility at present? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian to take the last one first, I already said that order, ordering from our customers is getting very short timed and small, lots especially towards the year end. We get the feeling that all of our customers tend to keep the inventories as low as possible as we go into the New Year. We will not see a major release from raw material going forward. So this at the end of the day means the pricing discipline is of essence in order to keep margins and as more capacity come on stream in quite a few product lines, I think we will see some margin pressure going forward and this is realistic. We could talk different things, but I think this is realistic. And especially Asia where most of the capacity of the Middle East is heading to is in over capacity in quite a lot of product lines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. You talked about the dynamics of gas pricing, vis-&#xE0;-vis your position as a seller of gas out of bin gas, but of course you are the largest customer for gas out of bin. So, I assume that means also that you are currently enjoying prices based on the very low oil price at the turn of the year. So, one if you could confirm that? But secondly, if that is true, then I don't really understand the statement that your raw material costs haven't benefited. I mean they must be, the gas costs going into the quarter must be way below where it was a year ago or even where it was in Q2. And also I think there should be some analogy for your naphtha purchasing as well because I've always understood that that you cover your naphtha purchases forward by six to nine months. So again you should be enjoying exceptionally &#x2013; should have enjoyed exceptionally naphtha costs in Q3. Could you just cover those two points please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, I'm starting and Hans-Ulrich will compliment with regard to net purchasing. First of all, dynamics in gas pricing is fully understood, yes we are customer, yes we have lower gas prices, is exactly what I said before. We have some release from raw material price side in our chemical activities. At the &#x2013; on the other hand we have a burden on our gas and oil business at this very moment and all in all if you look into both, this is more or less balanced, but net pricing is now addressed by Hans-Ulrich again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net gas pricing Jenny, actually not much to add to what J&#xFC;rgen just said which is, you're well aware as a purchaser. You, in the current situation, you have the benefit of the relatively low oil prices over the last nine months and yes that gives you a benefit in this current situation to the tune overall and this is now the entire raw material portfolio as J&#xFC;rgen mentioned earlier of roughly 25% in the first nine months of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, to complement on this &#x2013; to be very clear, if we look into the entire year so far, we have lost more on the pricing side than we gained on the raw material side and this is substantial.</p>

          <p>Just as your gas purchases, or just looking at the chemicals operations, just as your gas purchases are a function of oil prices six to nine month previously I've always understood that your naphtha purchases are also a function of naphtha prices, six to nine months earlier, can you just confirm that please?</p>

          <p>No, this is wrong. Naphtha pricing is basically set rather in short termed and you see this also and either way on the Naphtha side, this is basically running along the line with oil and you will see this immediately, almost immediately in our petrochemical figures.</p>

          <p>Morning.

By the way, I think it is both on the variable cost side as well as on the fixed cost side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Just wonder whether I could come back to the Performance Products division and just a very sharp sequential improvement in EBIT, before special items you saw from Q2 to Q3. Could you just, sort of, help me dimentionalize that between synergies from the Ciba that have already come through and perhaps better volume, any sort of help with what drove that very sharp, sequential increase in EBIT? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try first and maybe Hans-Ulrich will complement here. As I said already, I think looking into second quarter and first half year there is an underestimation from your side on the turnaround capabilities. This is basically what we have to say in cost. But secondly, I really think that the turnaround in business has helped us also. So there is a substantial improvement in the third quarter. And all in all, if we look into what we are doing, I think we changed the overall behavior of the entire organization. So price before cost strategy is something, which is paying back, especially, in case of Performance Chemicals. Maybe Hans-Ulrich has something else to top.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just strictly with respect to the Ciba synergies as we would see them in the year 2009, there will be a P&amp;L impact, positive P&amp;L impact from the cost synergies of 60 million in the year 2009. You asked with respect to Q3; I don't have an exact figure here. But I'll guess that roughly a third of that 20 million we've already seen in Q3 and 40 million of that then coming in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. So in terms of the rest of the improvement, could you just &#x2013; through the four divisions, is there anything that stands out other than the Care Chemicals where you've already commented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, first of all, I just said price before cost. Of course, it has to be price before volume, this is very clear. Looking into the entire portfolio, I think, Care Chemicals we already talked about. And also, Paper Chemicals, I have to say this is as we've brought together now both businesses, we see the synergies and we have acted decisively. So we have improved quite a bit and Paper Chemicals generally have improved, driven mostly out of Asia.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good afternoon. I just had a question really on how you see demand panning out. Obviously the third quarter was buoyed to a degree by restocking, but also the stimulus packages that are out there. In the absence of a number of those stimulus packages, is visibility still tremendously poor? Is there a concern internally of this, that actually demand level sequentially in Q3 might not necessarily be sustainable moving into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, as I said, visibility, as you say it, I think is rather low. Uncertainties remain. It's very clear, for example, in Europe and especially in Germany, scrapping premium is running out of stimulus. This will cause a decrease in the number of cars &#x2013; passenger cars built in Germany by about one million; this has an impact. On the other hand, the impact of stimulus packages going into infrastructure. Construction is only to come; in North America as well as Europe it takes much more time.</p>
          <p>Now if you look in to Asia, this is running rather well and the stimulus packages in China, China is certainly important. And some people say okay, the stimulus package of the government is running out. I do not believe that the Chinese government, at this very moment, will really stop. They may stop with specific pieces of stimulus packages, but if they stop this, they will do something else in another area really to support it. There is a little bit of overheating in residential in China. We need to watch out for that. But all in all, if we go into 2010, I think we will see stabilized business, low, uneven, and fragile recovery, as I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back to the restocking issue, do you think there was much of that in the third quarter, or do you think it was just the re-establishment of normal demand patterns year-on-year, i.e. the absence of de-stocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, here and there might be a little bit of overstocking because people believe that raw material prices will go up. Especially in China, where there is a little bit more speculation. But overall, inventories are what we see very low and other income indicates that almost everyone in the added value chains in almost all industries are striving for very, very low inventories as we come close to the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a quick question on the taxes, can you give us an indication what you expect for 2009 and possibly you have also got view for 2010 already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's one of the more difficult predictions we have to make. We know that the average tax rate for 2009 will be above the average of 2008. It will be again 60%, as it was in Q3, very hard to say. I guess it might be a little bit lower, but frankly there are so many factors influencing this. Where do we generate our profits depends for instance how much, how big the share of profit is in low tax countries which we have in Asia. So I refrain from making here a precise prediction, but it's a fair guess to expect that on average the taxes will be higher than in 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Again, it's just back on this customer behavior, perhaps in this emerging &#x2013; through this downturn as we approach the year-end, are you saying that customers will obviously strive to keep their own inventories and working capital at very low levels for sort of balance sheet purposes ahead of their year end? That equally stock levels are so low such that we will not see the sort of de-stocking that we saw last year, and thus that sequentially we can in reality begin to expect to see continuous volume growth quarter-on-quarter? In other words, there won't be a, from your perspective, a noticeable debt in December, January, partly because stock levels are so low right now? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on net debt, as J&#xFC;rgen described that everyone tries to reduce inventory towards the end I guess, BASF tries to do the same, and despite the fact that profitability in Q4 might be lower than Q3, we will still try to higher earnings level. Are you able to reduce the net debt level in Q4 sequentially by some 100 million or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That certainly depends on our cash flow generation capability in Q4. I would expect that we will still be able to bring it on a little bit further here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. On the restructuring issue again, I apologize if I missed a point earlier, but would it be appropriate to consider additional special items in Q4 belonging to other segments than Performance Chemicals? And in connection to that, looking back you regularly had booked special items. Would it be, or what would be a run rate for looking ahead for an ordinary something like 150 million or 100 million per year, if you have no restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously 2009 is a special year with regard to restructuring costs because we had acquired Ciba. If you do not consider Ciba, we are approximately 2 to 300 million a year. That is a pretty much the average which we have seen over the last couple of years. It's also clear in a trough situation, which we are facing right now, there is more restructuring need than in a boom phase, which we don't have currently. And the Q4 effect, I think I talked about it in my little speech. When I mentioned that for the total year, we expect something like a billion plus in total restructuring or special item costs. We're currently at 700 million, so that means approximately 300 million plus in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I still struggle a little bit with your Natural Gas Trading effect, obviously we should have had already the time lag effect, I guess, in Q3 and we obviously have this yes, we had spot price development where competitors actually said they were negatively affected, but did you even potentially positively participate here on buying and selling because of your stocking possibilities, or how is this very high result explained in a low season, and with potentially negative time lag effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the explanations is if you compare quarter-over-quarter, in other words, Q3 over Q3, the relatively bad results that we had in Q3 of the year 2008, they were negative to the tune of 35 million and now we're positive at 85 million. Whether or not we took certain opportunities here in the Nat Gas Trading business that gave us a certain advantage, that's something that I cannot comment on in detail, but your assumption is correct. We suffered already from lag and lead effects in Q3, but we'll see more of that coming in Q4 as a result of the fact that for Q4 oil prices of Q1 and Q4 of last year are the ones that indicate our sales prices.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, just one very small follow-on question on the oil and gas business. Looking at the E&amp;P business, in particular Q2 to Q3, the numbers were more or less flat, but we had more contribution from Russia and less from Libya. Why then did your non-compensable oil taxes go up sequentially from Q2 to Q3? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; frankly, I need to check whether they really went up from Q2 to Q3; just a second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I believe they were 244 million in Q3 and 226 million in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah. And the answer to that is if you look at average oil price in Q2 and compare it to Q3, you're looking at, if I remember that correctly, roughly $68 per barrel in Q3. And something in the high 50s, exactly 59.13 in Q2, and there is your answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the production volumes that went down in Libya were compensated for by higher oil prices compared to the gas price?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you again. I can &#x2013; you made it very clear in the past on previous calls that your focus would be digesting Ciba, in terms of potential acquisitive activity. You got free cash flow that looks like you're going to pay for Ciba in one year. The digestions going ahead of plan. We might be in a gentle recovery phase. I accept obviously the net debt is still relatively high, but does that mean potentially that acquisitions or medium size bolt-ons become more of a possibility in 2010 than we might have thought a few months ago? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I think we are back on the same track as in the past, with one additional point. First priority is really to reduce our debt and to gain additional financial flexibility, ensure A rating, as I said. Second, invest into organic growth, so we will not reduce, we have not reduced our R&amp;D expenditures this year. And we will certainly look into CapEx primarily in growth areas and then comes portfolio optimization. Yes, we will look into bolt-on acquisitions, but at the same time still will do the utmost to digest and to optimize the Ciba acquisition. Speed it up, restructuring while that profitable growth comes in as early as possible, then we have the operational freedom to do even more in the future. And fourth priority is then dividends, and five is share buyback, which is not an issue at this very moment.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. Just a couple of details actually, please. Do you have at this stage a figure for the average segment operating assets at the nine-month stage, using the nine-month balance sheet? I just wanted to try and clarify that number, first of all.</p>
          <p>And the second point is on this deferred, the write-off of the deferred tax asset. Could you explain a little bit about the thought process that went into that, because presumably if it is linked to Ciba, and the businesses &#x2013; the outlook for the businesses is improving, then the chances of actually being able to utilize the deferred tax asset is also improving. So I'm just trying to understand why that's happened when it's happened, and also whether there is still deferred tax assets on the Ciba balance sheet that could potentially be &#x2013; lead to a sort of risk applied tax charge going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so I try and address you on deferred taxes. The effect in Q3 is a consequence of an inter-company transaction which took place in Q3 where we basically tax optimized and legally optimized the acquired companies and assets, so that's a one-time effect and it's pretty much done in Q3, there is no real deferred tax asset left on our balance sheet coming from Ciba in Q4.</p>

In the reports, you mentioned earnings improvement, thanks to price discipline, well on your side as you said, presumably also from your competitors so far or do you see this discipline in Performance Products markets going forward, do you see a risk of weak base of your competitors now that Dinan is resuming?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthias, looking into &#x2013; this is not rather complex and I have to say all in all, so far there is price discipline as everyone is striving to reduce cost and to keep margins. As we go forward, the one or the other is really most probably tended and we see this once in a while in Asia. The comment was made earlier that there is a tendency to sell more so volume before price. However, looking into our businesses where we are in what we see is weakness maybe more on the pigment side. And the Care Chemicals business what we believe, will remain rather stable because there is not that much overcapacity.</p>

          <p>Jenny, this is Hans. Question, that was on Libya or was the question...</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my question is on Libya because you made a nice statement on your service clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just wondered what the prospects for Libya are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Libya, we're probably looking at declining production over the next two, three years period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Typical maturing of the fields there at a rate of &#x2013; at a range of, I would think ,5 to 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and finally, Sophie Jourdier [Citigroup].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You gave earlier very helpful comments about all the divisions except the plastics division, I just wonder whether you could comment on that and particularly on the performance although it seems to do very well in the third quarter and just whether the anti-dumping measures that China has put threw on nylon has any influence on that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, this is a turnaround story, Performance Plastics. As we have really restructured severely. We have closed down major plants <mark type="inaudible" /> and more and this is a real story behind your specific question on anti-dumping looking into China, this is an issue, but if you look very carefully the anti-dumping is so to speak a response to the tire attack from North America so we have assets sitting everywhere in the world if it comes to intermediates for nylon, so we will be able to cope with that.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
