          <p>Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Bill Hawkins, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Ellis, Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2010 second quarter, which ended October 30, 2009. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>A few logistical comments: earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement.</p>
          <p>Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ are contained in our 10-K for fiscal year 2009, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor Relations portion of the Medtronic website.</p>
          <p>Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and all growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Hawkins.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $3.8 billion, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year after adjusting for a $16 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Non-GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $850 million and $0.77, respectively.</p>
          <p>Q2 was another solid quarter reflecting once again the underlying resilience of our businesses and the strength of our globally diversified portfolio. While we have felt an impact from the macroeconomic environment, our initiatives over the past couple of years to resolve outstanding IP litigation, reduce product costs and reallocate resources towards faster growing markets and geographies are clearly making a difference.</p>
          <p>As we continue to drive our One Medtronic strategy we remained committed to our stated financial objectives of delivering 5 to 8% constant currency revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. We will continue to extend our market leadership through a relentless focus on customer valued innovation, which is the foundation of our success.</p>
          <p>As I look across the company and our pipeline I'm excited about the opportunity we have before us to deliver innovative technologies. These technologies will help us capture customer mind share and continue to differentiate us from our competition.</p>
          <p>For example, our recent investments in AF ablation technology and transcatheter valve technology have created a lot of customer excitement. These therapies clearly position us well for long-term market leadership.</p>
          <p>Looking further out, we will deliver new technologies to close the loop to dramatically simplify the management of diabetes. We will expand the application of our deep brain stimulation therapy to treat an increasing number of movement and psychiatric disorders in Neuromodulation.</p>
          <p>We also will continue to invest in our ventures group in several new markets to expand our business. The future of our diversified portfolio of technology has never been brighter.</p>
          <p>Next, let me say a few things about quality. While we have had our issues there is nothing more important to us than quality. We were clearly disappointed to receive a warning letter in CRDM following the inspection of our Kappa, Sigma field action this summer. However, we are working diligently with the FDA to resolve this in an expeditious manner. At this time, we do not anticipate any impact to our customers or patients or to delivering on our pipeline commitments. While I was not happy to receive a warning letter, I was encouraged by language in the letter where the FDA clearly noted that our "promised corrective actions appear to be adequate."</p>
          <p>We are continuously improving our capabilities of failure analysis, post-market vigilance, supplier management, corrective and preventative action and design for reliability and manufacturability. We are very confident that we have best-in-class quality systems. We will continue to raise the bar for ourselves and the industry.</p>
          <p>Next, let me comment on some of our recent organizational changes which will help us accelerate our market leading performance and "One Medtronic" strategy. As was announced in August, we realigned the businesses under two group presidents. Their focus will be on driving our growth plans and capitalizing on significant synergies that exist across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Rick Kuntz assumed an important new role focused on our R&amp;D portfolio management as well as optimizing the clinical reimbursement and regulatory functions across the enterprise. James Dallas will continue to lead our Global Quality, IT and Operations. Collectively, these changes will enhance our operating performance and enable us to more effectively leverage knowledge, technologies, capabilities and talent across the organization.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to some key highlights within our businesses starting with our Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management. Growth was in line with our expectations. I was particularly pleased with our ICD results. It is clear that our pipeline, strong management and exceptional field talent are once again making the difference. Our results also reflect the continued stability of the global ICD market and our relative market share. The worldwide ICD market continues to grow in the mid single digits. We are pleased to be maintaining ICD share in the U.S. and seeing some modest share gains in international markets.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we did not experience a slowdown in customer buying patterns. ASP pressure remained in the low single digit range, consistent with what we have seen in previous quarters. Our strength continues to be driven by our market leading exclusive technology, including OptiVol fluid monitoring and our Attain family of left-heart leads and delivery systems.</p>
          <p>In AF Solutions, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. Earlier this month we reached the one year adversity of our CryoCath acquisition. Our comprehensive integration activities at both CryoCath and Ablation Frontiers continued to go very well. We are quickly making progress in becoming the undisputed leader in one of the fastest growing areas of Med Tech. We remain on track to gain FDA approval for our Arctic Front balloon catheter and Ablation Frontiers catheters in the first half and second half of FY '11 respectively. Together these innovative technologies position us well to become the first company to have labeled indications for all stages of AF.</p>
          <p>Turning to Cardiovascular, the business delivered another strong quarter. Growth was balanced across all segments of the business. We gained momentum in our coronary franchise, continued to successfully integrate our transcatheter valve acquisitions and posted another quarter of exceptional growth in our endovascular business. In coronary our stent share remains strong. We continue to establish a powerful body of clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of our drug-eluting stents. The successful launch of Endeavor in Japan continued this quarter and we remain on track to bring Resolute to market in the U.S. in FY '12.</p>
          <p>The integration of CoreValve is also progressing extremely well as the business delivered another quarter of strong results. We remain the leader in the transfemoral transcatheter valve market outside the U.S., which has emerged as a method of choice for aortic transcatheter valve replacement. We are optimizing our distribution channels in Europe and leveraging our U.S. and international manufacturing capabilities. We also continue to make progress on the pathway to a U.S. IDE.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I did want to pay tribute to Dr. Don Baim, who recently passed away. Don's contributions to the field of interventional cardiology are legendary. He will be missed, but not forgotten.</p>
          <p>Turning to spinal and biologics, the overall market remains robust with growth of approximately 10% in the U.S. and low teens growth in international markets. We continue to work toward returning this business to market growth by the end of FY '11. In core spine, our team continues to reestablish our innovation leadership by enhancing the most comprehensive line of products on the market. Over the next 12 months, we will launch two new posterior fixation systems.</p>
          <p>I'm also encouraged by the mid single-digit growth in core metal constructs in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Biologics performed well in the quarter, driven by growth in InFuse. We continue to invest in initiatives to drive the long term value of this franchise. As we discussed at our analyst meeting in June, we are working on eight clinical studies designed to expand indications for the use of InFuse. In the near term we anticipate the approval of Amplify, our BMP-2 product for use in posterolateral applications in FY '11.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I would like to make a couple of comments on Kyphon. If I had one disappointment this quarter it would be here. We did not execute and on top of this we were negatively impacted by the recent vertebroplasty articles in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
          <p>While our customers understand the value of BKP as demonstrated in the FREE study, the negative vertebroplasty news impacted the perception of referring physicians. We are focused on improving our marketing execution and differentiating Balloon Kyphoplasty from vertebroplasty with our customers and the referral channel.</p>
          <p>Moving to Neuromodulation, results this quarter were driven by continued strong performance of our Activa Deep Brain Stimulation therapy for movement disorders, and our InterStim Therapy for incontinence, both of which continued to grow greater than 20%.</p>
          <p>Adoption of Activa RC and PC, the most advanced DBS devices, continues to accelerate in markets around the world. Our focus on referral channel development and educational activities over the last several quarters is paying off.</p>
          <p>The pain stim market continues to grow at a healthy rate in an extremely competitive marketplace. As I acknowledged last quarter we continue to feel competitive pressure and are focused on a number of key initiatives aimed at improving our sales force effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Tom Tefft, the recently announced President of Neuromodulation has already made a number of sales leadership changes and is driving the organization toward more disciplined sales and marketing execution.</p>
          <p>Our diabetes business delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth driven by both insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring products. Continuous glucose monitoring experienced double-digit growth across all markets where it is available.</p>
          <p>And lastly, growth in our surgical technologies business was driven by our ENT and NT segments. While capital equipment sales in the low to mid priced range performed well, we experienced a slowdown in high end capital equipment products due to macro economic factors.</p>
          <p>Looking at our business from a geographical perspective, our international sector delivered yet another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Our cardiovascular business was a large contributor to international growth driven by the success of Endeavor DES in Japan as well as the continued growth of our CoreValve business in Europe. We also saw strong international growth in our ICD and core spine businesses. We expect international revenues to continue to pace our growth going forward.</p>
          <p>We are committed to focus &#x2013; to our focus on geographic expansion. In the quarter we announced our decision to establish a manufacturing facility in Singapore to support the rising demand for our products in the Asia Pacific market. We were also honored to receive The Presidential "E" Award earlier this month in recognition of our efforts to promote and increase U.S. exports.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Gary, who will take you through the financial results and after his comments I will conclude with some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bill. As mentioned earlier, second quarter revenue of $3.838 billion grew 8% after adjusting for a $16 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Breaking this out geographically, revenue in the U.S. was $2.297 billion, up 5%, while sales outside the U.S. were $1.541 billion increasing 13%. After adjusting for a litigation gain as well as the non-cash charge to interest expense due to the change in accounting rules governing convertible debt, second quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $850 million and $0.77 respectively. GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $868 million and $0.78 respectively.</p>
          <p>The second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was impacted by two items that we have reconciled for our non-GAAP results. First, we recorded a $70 million gain related to the resolution of outstanding patent litigation with W. L. Gore &amp; Associates related to selected patents in Medtronic's Jervis and Wiktor patent families.</p>
          <p>Excluding the $41 million non-cash charge to interest expense due to the change in accounting rules governing convertible debt, interest expense on a non-GAAP basis was $13 million. As of October 30, 2009 we had approximately 4.7 billion in cash and cash investments. Second, $41 million of non-cash interest expense was recorded in the second quarter in accordance with our adoption of the new convertible debt accounting rules.</p>
          <p>Moving on to a more detailed analysis of our results, CRDM revenue of $1.278 billion increased 3%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $754 million grew 6%. The U.S. ICD market continued to grow in the low to mid single digits and the global ICD market grew in the mid single digits. We continue to see strong demand for our high power devices with OptiVol, which is driven by positive U.S. reimbursement changes made in January and the recent FAST study which demonstrated OptiVol was three times better at predicting heart failure events than weight monitoring alone.</p>
          <p>Pacing revenue of $498 million declined 2%. We were able to maintain share despite a slowdown in Japan where we continue to feel pressure from the previously announced Kappa, Sigma field action. We are excited about the anticipated launches of EnRhythm MRI in the U.S. and Advisa MRI in international markets this coming summer. We believe this differentiated technology will allow us to stem the mid-single digit price erosion in pacing and allow us to maintain our market-leading share position.</p>
          <p>Cardiovascular revenue of $696 million grew 18%, coronary revenue of $369 million increased 18% and we estimate that our worldwide unit share for all coronary stents is above 20%. International coronary grew 21%, reflecting the continued momentum of our Endeavor launch in Japan, which again contributed over $30 million in revenue this quarter. In the U.S., Endeavor continued to perform well, and we estimate that it gained approximately 300 basis points of unit share sequentially.</p>
          <p>Structural Heart revenue of $206 million grew 11%, driven by 24% growth in international markets on the strength of our CoreValve transcatheter valve. CoreValve continues to maintain greater than 75% share in the transfemoral TCV market. We continue to achieve our key objectives related to the integration of CoreValve. The full integration of our distribution channel is nearly complete, and the expansion of U.S. and international manufacturing operations remains on track. In fact we have tripled our daily manufacturing production rate since the acquisition was closed.</p>
          <p>Endovascular revenue of $121 million grew 28%. The impressive 43% growth in international markets was driven by ongoing success of our next generation Endurant abdominal stent graft. U.S. growth of 16% was fueled by the continued success of our Talent abdominal and thoracic stent grafts.</p>
          <p>Spinal and biologics revenue of $862 million grew 4%. Core Spinal revenue of $642 million grew 2% driven by strength in our international business, which grew 10%. International results were aided in part by a full quarter of sales in our Weigao joint venture in China.</p>
          <p>Core metal constructs continued its midst single digits growth, while Kyphon results had a year-over-year decline, clearly feeling the effects of the New England Journal articles on the vertrebroplasty that Bill mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Biologics revenue of $220 million grew 12%, reflecting the continued resilience of the business following the number of challenges it has faced over the past year. We also are beginning to see success in our efforts to expand the business beyond BMP with strong growth in DBMs and ceramics.</p>
          <p>Neuromodulation revenue of $384 million increased 12% driven by continued strength in deep-brain stimulation and gastro-uro. Revenue in our DBS business grew in the mid 20% range. Gastro-uro revenue continued to grow above the 20% level driven by another strong quarter for InterStim.</p>
          <p>Our pain stim business grew in the low single digits and our infusion pump business grew in the high teens. However, infusion pump growth in the quarter was aided by easier comparisons because of the manufacturing issue that we experienced last year.</p>
          <p>Diabetes revenue of $300 million grew 11% driven by continued strength in our CGM franchise. Positive results from several studies, including the ONSET Trial and the REAL Trend Study, continued to build evidence of the benefit of Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. insulin pumps had double-digit growth in the quarter. In markets outside the U.S. pump growth was impacted by delayed purchases in anticipation of our Veo, Low Glucose Suspend pump launch in Q3.</p>
          <p>We reached favorable settlements in the second quarter with key suppliers involved in the recent Quick-Set recall and are confident that this is behind us without a material impact on our financial results for the year.</p>
          <p>Surgical Technologies revenue of $224 million grew 6% driven by growth in monitoring, ENT image guidance systems, power disposables, and service. Growth was impacted in the quarter by a slowdown in the high value capital equipment in our navigation business. This was due in part to a lengthening of the contract cycles as customers required higher levels of sign off prior to purchase.</p>
          <p>Finally, Physio-Control revenue of $94 million increased 24%. Growth was driven by strong international performance in the recently launched LIFEPAK 15 monitor and defibrillator with the price premium it demands. Growth this quarter was also aided in part by a product availability issue that negatively impacted revenue in the year ago period. Physio-Control continues to make good progress with the FDA, and we expect resolution in this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the rest of the income statement, the gross profit margin was 76% compared to 75.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Gross margins in Q2 versus the prior year was, due to the write-off of coronary vascular inventory in the prior year, somewhat offset by a negative foreign exchange impact in the current year. We continue to see the benefits of the initiatives we have underway to reduce our cost of goods sold by $1 billion by fiscal year 2012. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect gross margins to be between 75.5 and 76%.</p>
          <p>Second quarter R&amp;D spending of $369 million represents approximately 9.6% of revenue compared to $326 million or 9.1% of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We remain committed to investing in new technologies to drive growth and we anticipate R&amp;D spending in the range of 9.5 to 10% of revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Second quarter SG&amp;A expenditures of $1.323 billion represented 34.5% of sales, compared to 35.4% of sales in the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense benefited from our ongoing SG&amp;A initiatives to leverage our facilities and IT expenses. Additionally, our realignment and restructuring efforts from both fiscal year 2008 and 2009 provided some tailwind in reducing expenditures. This was partially offset by a 30% increase in legal expenses in the first half of fiscal year 2010, driven by an increasing amount of government scrutiny on the industry. We expect legal expenses to continue to grow at a similar rate for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Net other expense for the quarter was $130 million, compared to $143 million in Q2 of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily is a result of pure losses from our hedging programs, which were $3 million during the second quarter, compared to $42 million in losses in the comparable period last year, slightly offset by an increase in the amortization of intangibles related to our AF and TCV acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, based on current FX rates, we anticipate hedging losses of 60 to $90 million per quarter over the remainder of the fiscal year with more impact in Q4 than in Q3. Taking this into account, we anticipate net other expense will be in the range of 190 to $220 million per quarter during the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense for the quarter was $54 million, excluding the $41 million non-cash charge to interest expense due to the change in accounting rules governing convertible debt, interest expense on a non-GAAP basis was $13 million.</p>
          <p>As of October 30, 2009 we had approximately $4.7 billion in cash and cash investments. Looking ahead, we expect our cash to continue to increase; however, lower interest rates will negatively affect our return on the cash.</p>
          <p>After adjusting for the impact of certain litigation payments, we had yet another quarter of generating greater than $1 billion in free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Turning to our tax rate, our effective tax rate as reported was 21.8%. Excluding the tax impact of the litigation gain, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the second quarter was 20.8%. We expect our fiscal year 2010 tax rate exclusive of one-time adjustments to be in the range of 21% to 22%.</p>
          <p>Second quarter weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.109 million shares. During the second quarter we repurchased $265 million of our common stock bringing our year-to-date total to $609 million. As of October 30, 2009, we had remaining capacity to repurchase approximately 60 million shares under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we also paid out over $227 million in dividends as we continued to return a minimum of 40 to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As before, we have attached an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement to this quarter's press release, and I direct your attention to these statements for additional financing details.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by providing an update to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2010. As you know, we continue to see significant fluctuations in the currency exchange rates and they remain difficult to predict. Therefore we continue to provide our revenue growth outlook on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>We believe that constant currency revenue growth rate of 5 to 8% is reasonable for the second half of FY '10 as we continue to execute on our product pipeline and monitor the economy and healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>If exchange rates remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our revenue for the second half of FY '10 would have an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 350 million to $370 million, including an estimated favorable impact of 150 to $160 million in Q3.</p>
          <p>Turning to our guidance on the bottom line, we are pleased by our execution in the first half of the year, were we delivered 12% earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP basis even with the impact from acquisition dilution. Taking this into account, we feel comfortable in raising our fiscal year 2010 earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.17 to $3.22 per share.</p>
          <p>As communicated before, our earnings per share guidance excludes any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year and the impact of the non-cash charged interest expense due to the change in accounting rules governing convertible debt, and includes $0.06 to $0.07 of acquisition dilution for the full fiscal year.</p>
          <p>In particular, our earnings per share guidance does not into account any potential impact from a U.S. medical device industry tax being proposed as part of broader U.S. healthcare reform. This updated guidance represents FY '10 earnings per share growth of 11 to 13%, after adjusting for the acquisition dilution.</p>
          <p>I will now turn things back over to Bill, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Bill?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Gary. Before we begin our Q&amp;A session, just let me close by reiterating that Q2 was another step in building our track record of delivering consistent performance. I'm confident in our ability to execute across our globally diversified portfolio and we will continue to generate 5 to 8% constant currency revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>I would now like to open things up to Q&amp;A. In the interest of getting to as many questions as possible, we respectably request that each caller limit themselves to one question with one follow up. Operator, first question. Operator?</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Two questions here, first, I just wanted to get a timing update on two issues, could you just talk a little bit about the timing of the potential hiring of a new cardiovascular division head and when we might extract some news flow there? And then also, can you give us an update on the timing of your AF Cryo data? And then I have a question on CRDM. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just to follow up on your comments on CRDM, especially on the pricing front, given some of the previous commentary. Bill could I ask you just to kind of, walk through your comments on exactly where pricing was for both ICDs, and then separately pacemakers in the quarter? And how that might have differentiated from recent trends that you've seen? And just say your comments on where you think pricing is going in the marketplace as well? That would be very helpful, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with ICDs as I commented that for the quarter, we saw ICD prices off in the low single digits. And this reflects the value of innovation, as we're able to bring forth new products like the Attain family of heart &#x2013; left side of heart leads. That has helped us to offset pressures in other areas and net-net, we've been able to manage prices in that very low single digits on the ICD side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's consistent with where it has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And on the pacing side, you know we saw a little bit more price impact. I think in part this reflects, if you will maybe a lull in new products and with the &#x2013; we continue to be very excited about the opportunities with MRI pacemakers and as I mentioned, the Advisa will be in Europe, we hope by the end of this fiscal year and EnRhythm by &#x2013; for the U.S. in the beginning of next fiscal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then just to sum it up, your opinion on pricing is really that not much has changed in your CRDM business from what you have seen historically? Is that a fair characterization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's overall a fair characterization except for the pacing side. I would say we've seen a little bit more impact on pacing recently, but as I mentioned, I think that in part reflects the fact that we haven't seen the &#x2013; any new products come out of consequence in the last year or so and &#x2013; but again historically what's enabled us to be able to manage prices has been that the timing of new products.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning guys. Gary, could you start on the SG&amp;A side, we've all been focused here for the last several quarters and in this quarters you did a particularly good job of generating leverage, so I hoped you could give us some incremental insights into the progress there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as you said, Mike, we've been pleased with our progress on the operating leverage side both on the cost of sales and the SG&amp;A where we continue to focus a lot of attention. As I mentioned in some of my comments there is a lot of programs that are impacting SG&amp;A that we've been driving across the organization.</p>
          <p>We've been obviously focused on IT cost, consolidating facilities, improving processes across the organization as we look at that and as you know we have had kind of a restructuring of the organization over the last couple of years 2008 and 2009 where we have reduced the resources in some of those functions and some of those areas and as a result that has taken the cost down and we are starting to see the benefits of that more here in this quarter as we kind of expected and we would expect that we will continue to see those benefits as we move ahead.</p>
          <p>So there is a lot of things obviously affecting the SG&amp;A that we are trying to manage and so we are making a lot of progress in a lot of categories. The one that we're not, as I mentioned in my comments, is we have a little bit of a headwind that we are fighting right now on the legal expense side which has been higher for us over the last couple of quarters here, as I mentioned in my comments 30% uplift, really related to this government scrutiny across the industry which has really added to our costs. So even with that, we've been able to as you see the 80 to 90 basis point improvement in SG&amp;A, we're continuing to focus on as a company and we have the plans in place to deliver on that, even fighting some of the headwinds we are fighting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so &#x2013; sorry the target for the year is still the same? I think you talked about in the 1Q call 80 to 100 basis points as the target for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah, we still have the same target in mind as far as achieving the overall improvement in SG&amp;A as we've talked about and as you said 80 to 100 basis points. As we've indicated previously, we are trying to focus on delivering the operating margin improvement, so as much as we're still focused on SG&amp;A, it's going to come from both SG&amp;A and improvements I think that we can continue to get in the product cost. Because again, with where FX rates are going that actually benefits the gross margin a little bit, makes it a little bit more difficult on the SG&amp;A side, but overall we think we can get the operating margin improvements we've committed to and we are still driving towards that same kind of objective in the SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me follow up with a couple of pipeline questions just to clarify. Number one, Infuse Amplify, I think that has slipped a little bit -- you're now talking fiscal 2011, so I was hoping you could clarify. Second, the Intercept DBS system for epilepsy, do you have any visibility on a panel? And then third I guess I'll ask on Bob's question on the STOP-AF trial, when do you think we might see the data? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the epilepsy, to start there, it's a &#x2013; we were expecting a panel before the end of this calendar year. It probably has slipped into the early part of next calendar year. And so we still think that there is a possibility that we could have something in the beginning of FY '11 for epilepsy.</p>
          <p>Then on the &#x2013; what was the first one you asked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Amplify.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Amplify, sorry, Amplify, again we're looking at the beginning of FY '11, and on the AF we're still working on it. We &#x2013; the Boston AF symposium in January or possibly ACC would be when we present that data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, great. Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Gary.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Next question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Bill, just looking at what's on the table in the various Senate and House bills, do you expect the likely outcome with higher or similar reimbursement pressure across the Medicare and commercial side, at least over the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at in this whole healthcare reform in both the House and the Senate, I would tell you that I think that the one stakeholder who is I think &#x2013; everybody is participating here, but the hospitals to some degree have, I think, fared the best. The plan is to kind of bend the cost curve, so over the next 10 years, they will slow the rate, if you will, of increase. They're not going to cut, they just going to slow the rate of increase. And so, I mean, yes we will see pressure as we do every year as hospitals are looking to better manage their enterprise. But I don't think you're going to see anything sort of unusual or you'll see any inflection, because of the healthcare reform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my next question kind of follows up with Mike and Bob's question regarding a couple of spine segments. So the kind of subterranean talk that we've been hearing pertains to the CMS questioning reimbursement for Infuse and/or kyphoplasty on an in-patient basis. Do you feel that the &#x2013; on the Infuse side that the regulatory approvals that are in the queue will basically protect that franchise from any kind of change in reimbursement? And is there anything going on with regards to kyphoplasty reimbursement in the U.S.? Thank so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Infuse, as I've mentioned, we have eight clinical studies underway to expand indications, the most important being the AMPLIFY for the posterolateral indication, which, as I said will be out, we hope, in the first part of FY '11. So, I am pretty optimistic that the Biologics are in good shape going forward. We've got a lot in the hopper there to really protect that franchise going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on kyphoplasty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On kyphoplasty, there too, I mean, there is good evidence out there with the FREE study, and we've got the KAVIAR and the CAFE studies underway right now. And again kyphoplasty is very different from vertebroplasty. And if I look back this quarter and say where we could have maybe done a better job, it would have been in differentiating kyphoplasty from vertebroplasty. There is very good evidence that supports the importance of the benefit of kyphoplasty, and particularly relative to vertebroplasty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess, just over &#x2013; just to clarify, so over the next year you don't see a risk of a significant challenge to reimbursement for either of those product categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bruce, I mean there is always risk in this business, but I don't see anything unusual from where I sit today and looking forward. I mean, we are always dealing with issues that are coming up here or coming up there, but I don't see any macro trend that would say that there is, there is something on the horizon that could disrupt the kyphoplasty or Biologics and  Infuse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions, first on kyphoplasty, Gary, can you say, that business down like in the 5 to 10% range and if it was down in that kind of level is there any reason to think it's going to snap back anytime soon or should we assume, at least for the near term it's going to remain flat to down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is &#x2013; it has &#x2013; it was down this quarter in that sort of mid single-digits and we've got a lot underway to, if you will, revive that business and I'd also point you to Japan, I mean, we are still on track to getting kyphoplasty approved in Japan in early FY '11. So, there is a lot of things that we are doing to substantiate that business. I mean, we still have complete confidence that this is a very important therapy for people with vertebral compression fractures, particularly for those where height restoration is important. So we're going to work hard and I can tell you, with Chris onboard now in his role there's a lot of focus on the kyphoplasty business.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Bill. And then just one quick follow-up, on ICDs, Bill you said you thought you'd gained modest share OUS. Was that across the board internationally or was there one major region where you think you did better than others?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>KAVIAR is a ways out, it's a couple of years and similar for CAFE. So probably the next important point is the two year data on the FREE study, which will be in the beginning of next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you had also mentioned with respect to the CoreValve business just some progress that you are making on the front with the FDA. Can you just share with us whether or not your timing for the initiation of a clinical trial, the PMA trial has changed? I think, you had said mid-next year?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, that's &#x2013; we're on track. That's &#x2013; nothing has changed there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess just finally on de novo implants in the U.S., would you say that there's been any impact from kind of the broader macro issues, are they still trending flattish and what plans do you have to try to help stimulate that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing has changed really there. It oscillates around the mean of -- it's been in the flattish range. We see a quarter where it's up, we see a quarter where it's little bit down. But it's pretty stable, I would say. And the big thing is the JCAH (sic) [JCAHO] efforts that we have underway which we're really encouraged by and plus, I mean, just the data coming out of the MADIT-CRT plus REVERSE. So I would say the core measures from JCAH (sic), the MADIT-CRT and the REVERSE are all things which we believe will give this business a bit of a tailwind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think couple of years ago you guys had launched some promotional or educational efforts mainstream on kind of TV, are there any plans to do that again to help jump start the market or is it more just kind of going in and helping the referral channels?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you had a commentary on five to 8% growth for the foreseeable future and this is kind of an interesting year where you are benefiting from an extra selling week. But you are really sort of not seeing a significant number of pipeline enhancements. Next year you don't have the extra selling week, but you are getting a significant number of pipeline improvements or new products come to market. So as you think about that balance between this year and next year, are you confident that that 5 to 8% for the foreseeable future is a reasonable target as you look forward past one or two quarters given the pipeline is improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not giving sort of long-term guidance here, but I would say that, yes, we feel good that we're in the right range in the 5 to 8% and I think you've characterized it well. I mean, if you look at this year, we did benefit in the first quarter with the extra week, but if you look at this quarter where we didn't have the extra week, we delivered solid 8% constant currency growth and the outlook as Gary gave you for the rest of the year is consistent in terms of that 5 to 8% range.</p>
          <p>And going forward, you're right, we're going to benefit with a number of new products with CryoCath, with the InterStim fecal, with Kyphon in Japan with EnRhythm MRI, with Protecta, Solera on the spine side. So there's a lot in the pipeline that we think will enable us to manage the portfolio and take advantage of the fact that we have a diversified group of products and businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful. And then Bill you've been pretty outspoken on the topic of reform. I wonder, have you started to formulate in your mind from a corporate standpoint: to the extent that reform does happen and there is some type of tax that impacts your business, are you likely to let that tax fall through to the corporation and just sort of move on or are you likely to look to offset that tax through restructuring, cost reductions or buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, this is Gary. Let me address it, we really haven't got to the point of seeing what would be &#x2013; how would that impact us and what it would do to the organization. Obviously, we're trying to understand exactly what's going on in the healthcare reform, as you indicated Bill has been and the entire organization has been very instrumental in trying to help shape this and we've been clearly at the table trying to work on the issue, but we haven't made any decisions on whatever that tax ends up being, how that will be impacting the company, what that will do to &#x2013; you know our pricing, what that will do to our infrastructure cost and how much of that actually drops to the bottom line, we have not made any decisions on. That will be something we'll assess obviously, as we have a better understanding of exactly the cost is, and what the impact is to Medtronic.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one for Bill and I will jump back in queue here. International continues to be a significant driver of the business and Bill you highlighted a couple of areas here in this call. Are you comfortable that the infrastructure that you have internationally is enough to support the increased sort of growth outlook you have for that business or do you think there's going to be more significant capital expenditures to support that growth here over the next two and three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see any significant capital expenditures that we need to support the growth. You know I feel we've got good solid global footprint, we made some significant investments a couple of years ago in China to put a really strong infrastructure and we're seeing the benefits of that.</p>
          <p>China has been a very strong consistent growth, similarly we've made some investments in India which is a little bit behind where China is, but we think that that market will grow very well going forward. And I would say the same thing about Latin America, in fact I was down there not too long ago for the first time and encouraged by what I see for the foreseeable future for Latin America. So, but I don't &#x2013; it's not going to require a large capital investment to be able to generate that. We are continuing to invest disproportionately as it relates to adding selectively field people in different markets whether that's, again, in Asia or whether it's Latin America or whether that's &#x2013; and even in some of the under-developed Eastern European countries.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, Bill, how confident are you that the medical device fee will &#x2013; that the House Bill where it starts in 2013 will ultimately be adopted versus the Senate starting in 2010? Any speculation on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a hard question to answer. I mean, we are clearly going to put all our &#x2013; a lot of weight behind the 2013 start date. But we will &#x2013; we're going to learn a lot in the next month as the Senate debates the Senate Bill and so I can't comment beyond that other than we are going to really work hard to do what we can to help have it start, commensurate with what &#x2013; when we will see the benefit of coverage expansion, which is only logical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry just to add to Bill's comment &#x2013; to only add to his comment. That's why in our guidance we made a statement that our guidance even for fiscal 2010 here, does not assume any medical device tax impacts. We just don't know what's going to happen there. And it's possible that if in 2010 that Senate Bill would firm up, we would actually have a few months of expense related to that item even our fiscal 2010. So that's why we don't know the &#x2013; as Bill said, we don't know exactly what the answer is going to be. We're clearly trying to drive towards the 2013, because it makes more sense just from the standpoint of when the benefit is. But we will &#x2013; there is a lot of things that are going to have to occur between now and when the final bill comes out.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair thanks. And just some clarification questions on important pipeline products in the spine business. Kyphoplasty in Japan, at the analyst meeting this year, if I'm not mistaken I thought you said, you expected approval in the summer or fall of this year. That seems to have been delayed and Amplify was pushed out. Could you talk about the reasons for the delays in those two products please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first on the kyphoplasty, we've all along said that we'll get approval but reimbursement, as you know, in Japan, lags the actual approval and that reimbursement is not going to kick in until the end of the fiscal year so we are launching at the beginning FY '11. So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you do have approval, Bill, in Japan and you are just waiting for reimbursement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't gotten approval yet for Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Amplify, any color on what the hold up is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, there is no color. I mean, we do expect that there may be a panel for this &#x2013; for Amplify and so beyond the &#x2013; if there's a panel then &#x2013; that's why we put the time line out to that early FY '11 timeframe.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just comment &#x2013; maybe broadly on what we've seen so far through Med Tech earnings this quarter. You were one of the few companies and I think the only large cap one to generate any SG&amp;A leverage. Could you maybe walk us through anything you're seeing in the operating environment that your competitors are either getting more aggressive on sales and marketing and trying to build out an infrastructure that you already have? Is there something happening from a market share perspective that's different? Then I have one follow-up on the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make a couple of comments and then Gary can add to it. But again this goes back a couple of years ago, when we pointed to the fact that we were making some changes. If you go back two years ago, we actually started on some initiatives to reallocate resources and we took out close to 2,000 people back in FY '09. And then this last year we took out another 1,500 to 1,800 people. We, to some degree, anticipated one, with the changes in the market around CRDM that we needed to make some changes. And so we have been making those kind of changes the last couple of years, and so we're beginning to see the benefit of that now. It takes a little bit of time for things to really kind of kick in. So I think the initiatives that we put in place two years ago and even this last year are starting to pay a few dividends here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And those reductions in the sales force, are you now right sized for share stability, share gains, accelerating market growth? Maybe just give us some context as to what's on the base assumption regarding head count now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we have titrated the organization in line with what we see the market growth, which is in that sort of mid single-digits in the CRDM space. So we have, we believe, a structure that is appropriate for that kind of a market growth assumption. And if we see the market continue to accelerate, we'll make the appropriate decisions. And if we think that the market is going to, for whatever reason, go the other direction, we've demonstrated that we can be fairly nimble and we'll take the appropriate actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Gary. Just to add to what Bill said, I mean, as he indicated we've been obviously focused on this from the SG&amp;A and the cost of sales perspective for a period of time. And I guess, the way I look at it is, we saw this coming. We predicted that there was going to be a little bit more of an impact on some of our markets than we expected. And that's why we adjusted even our revenue guidance down to 5 to 8% about a year ago, because we could see that the macroeconomic conditions were impacting our markets more than what we historically have seen.</p>
          <p>So we took that down, we made &#x2013; and we obliviously were focused on trying to improve our overall operating margins, even though, again I'll remind all of you that our operating margins are some of the highest in the industry, so it's not like Medtronic has never focused on leverage on both product cost or SG&amp;A. We're constantly focused on that. And as Bill said, I think we feel that we've done the appropriate shift in &#x2013; between businesses and in the organization to get the resources in the right areas to continue to maintain and gain share in most of our markets. And we'll continue to focus on those markets that are growing faster which right now is some of the international markets. And &#x2013; so we're making investments in those areas. So we think we have the right mix and we think we have the right programs in place to address this that we've been really working on for the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, R&amp;D productivity, I think, is an issue people have addressed although it looks to be improving. Can you maybe give us some sense how to think about new products as a percent of sales and sales growth? Maybe this quarter what percent of new product sort of made up as a percent of sales and where we can see that go over the next couple of years and where that's been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I look at the numbers, I mean, we're in that sort of 40 to 50% of product sales have come from products launched in the last couple of years, okay? And arguably that's &#x2013; I mean admittedly that's a little bit down from where it used to be, okay? So &#x2013; but we have a major focus on enterprise-wide R&amp;D productivity and we're doing, I think, a lot better job on enterprise-wide portfolio management. I highlighted Rick's role following on to the structure we put in place a year ago and I think the work we are doing to really make better decisions across the enterprise is beginning to work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for two more questions here. I want to be respectful of your time as well, so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. First it's been touched on a little bit but this is the second consecutive quarter that Medtronic has outperformed and on top and bottom line, it feels like you are certainly at an inflection point. Part of it I am guessing is you are suggesting is the cost leverage from the programs put in place a couple of years ago. The question is with operating leverage now more visible, when we think about the possibility of upside from here, is it more from sales like OUS sales? Is it mix? Is it the cost structure? How do we think about the potential for outperformance from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be the success of our new products. the things, some of them which we've acquired, the CryoCaths of the world the CoreValves of the world, some of the things that we've got in the pipeline in the Neuromodulation business, the CRDM space with the launch of Protecta and the continued success we've had with the leads. So our goal is again to be able to deliver 5 to 8% top line growth and to generate marginal operating margin expansion on that by growing expenses nominally a bit slower and be able to continue to deliver on that operating leverage. So, that's kind of the formula we've put in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rick, this is Gary. Just to add to what Bill said, I mean, I would say even over the last couple of quarters and we might even say more than that, but over the last couple of quarters, it's not just been on the operating leverage that we've overachieved. We've obviously overachieved on the revenue side too and so as Bill said, I think we're happy to see that we're maintaining margins and gaining -- market share and starting to gain market share in some businesses and with our new product portfolios going forward. It's going to come that overperformance is going to come both from the top and bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Bill, you said that you were -- I think your words were you were excited about the pipeline and you've laid out some of those points, and I think that all ties into the point Gary is making about sales, but you also highlighted that in the ventures side, you are investing in new markets and Gary was also highlighting the fact that whatever is &#x2013; 5 billion in cash and you're generating 1 billion of free cash a quarter, maybe one, how much of that incremental growth is going to come from new investments outside the company? And two, maybe just your latest thoughts on this really substantial and growing &#x2013; rapidly growing cash hoard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't build into our plan or outlook things that we don't have inside or what we have that's a part of Medtronic today. So, the guidance that we give reflects the current outlook for the business. Although we have said that we will be doing small tuck-in acquisitions going forward but the guidance, the 5 to 8% really reflects, I think the underlying fundamentals of our current portfolio. We are investing for the long run with our ventures group.</p>
          <p>I don't think you'll see the rewards from that in the next year or two, but these are the kind of things we need to be doing so that, three, four years from now they will begin to kick in and whether it's the Hep-C or whether it's some of things we're doing in sciatica and post-op pain and some other areas that we're pretty excited about that we've been investing in recently. So, again this is all part of kind of the business model to be able to have a balanced portfolio of investments that will enable us to have sustainable growth over the long run.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>And the cash, Bill? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cash, as Gary has already talked about, I mean, we're going to return 40 to 50% in dividends and share buybacks. We will be opportunistic with the cash, the remaining cash, if we do see smaller tuck in acquisitions we may add something here and something there but we like having a fairly conservative position to be able to be in a good position in light of what could happen in the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one last quick on ICD trends. It &#x2013; obviously your quarter ends more in the fall and has one less summer month than your two major competitors. Can you just give us any incremental color on how the trends in the quarter went? Was it &#x2013; was August and September in fact just weak with the economy and seasonally more than usual, less than usual? Was October particularly strong? Are you accelerating as you head into November, December? Just any color would we welcome. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rick I can't really comment. First of all I don't have in front of me the kind of the details on kind of the weekly or monthly sales. I mean, as I said this was just a solid quarter for us. I mean, we didn't see anything unusual. I mean, this was &#x2013; it's always hard looking at individual quarters but this has been fairly consistent with what we've done for the last year. In fact if you look at our performance now in the ICD, after a tough couple of years ago with Fidelis, I mean, the last year I am encouraged that we've seen pretty stable market share position. And we're obviously going to do our best to try to improve that with a lot of the new technologies that we have in our pipeline that I've already talked about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. It's Tao from Deutsche. Talk about Europe specifically, are there any trends that you're seeing there that's different? We heard from some other companies where you're seeing some budget constrained healthcare systems that are affecting some trends there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Europe was very strong for us this quarter. We had a very solid performance in Europe in part driven by the &#x2013; well, the endovascular and the cardiovascular business, I should say. But Spine was good for us, the Neuromodulation was good. I mean Diabetes was good. It was really across the board. I mean we actually did very well in Europe this year, this last quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And when you mentioned acquisition, you mentioned a couple of times the small tuck-ins. What would &#x2013; is that sort of $1 billion in size? Kind of like CoreValve-ish in size or are you talking about larger...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean I have defined tuck-ins in the past to be fair, less than a $1 billion. But when I say small, that means obviously less than, considerably less than $1 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And I was a little bit surprised, Gary, on the gross margin you kind of kept the guidance where it was at, especially given the currency trends that we're seeing and how much that hurt you earlier on, that it wouldn't be higher than where you're kind of indicating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're correct, Tao. If you look at it going forward, I mean, the 75.5 to 76 we feel very comfortable with &#x2013; if foreign exchange rates stay where they are at for the rest year that would actually be a positive on the gross margin side and could actually push you up a little bit above the 76 range. As you know it did hurt us on the gross margin side, especially in Q1 and Q2 and if the trend continues you could see a little bit of a positive on that side as we go in the back half of the year. We're just being a little cautious right now, because we don't know exactly what's going on with FX rates, so that why we kept the 75.5 to 76%.</p>
