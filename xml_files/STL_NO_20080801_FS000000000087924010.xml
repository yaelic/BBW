      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentleman, welcome to this StatoilHydro second quarter earnings conference call. My name is Lars Troen S&#xF8;rensen, and I am the Head of Investor Relations. This morning at 8 AM Central European Time, we announced our results for the second quarter 2008, and send a release to Wires and to Oslo Stock Exchange.</p>
          <p>Report can be downloaded from our website, statoilhydro.com, together with presentation slides used in today's conference call. I would ask you please to with the expressions of our usual forward-looking statements, which is described on page 48 in the presentation with supplementary.</p>
          <p>Today's call is slightly different from usual setup. We've chosen to use a more simplified setup and slides and the telephone conference. The changed setup is accommodate, in fact, two of our peers, also having results out today and many of our investors and analysts would like to follow all three companies. From the next quarter, we will back on our usual format with a webcast and internet-based question handling.</p>
          <p>In a minute, StatoilHydro's CFO will take us through the highlights of the second quarter. After the presentation, we will open for questions, and the operator of this call will give you a short instruction as to how you should operate your phone in order to ask questions.</p>
          <p>And now, it's my privilege to welcome our CFO, Eldar S&#xE6;tre, who will take us through the second quarter presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Ladies and gentleman, thank you for joining us on this Friday afternoon. It's a pleasure for me to present StatoilHydro's results for the second quarter of this year. And results are in general very satisfactory. We are delivering record earnings and high production in a strong commodity market environment. However, I would like to emphasize that the most important results for us, as the management, are not ones created by the high prices, but the ones created by the strong performance in our organization.</p>
          <p>Our focus continues to be on delivering on the short-term and longer-term ambitions. Today, we are showing that we are on the right track to achieve what we have set up to do.</p>
          <p>Our focus areas are, first of all, on production. At the Capital Market Day in January, as you might recall, we estimated our equity projections for 2008 to 1.9 million barrel per day for 2008. Strong production and high gas offtake during the first half of this year makes this estimate more robust.</p>
          <p>Then it is about synergies. We are progressing according to our plans with respect to realizing the annual 6 billion in synergies from the merger. And this process also includes the ongoing process to restructure our offshore organization into a more flexible and efficient operating model.</p>
          <p>We also have strong focus on continuous business development, launching new projects as planned and continuing with a high exploration activity and securing new acreage. And finally, we have to secure, safe, reliable and efficient operations. But the trend so far this year has been positive, but we still acknowledge that there are too many unfortunate incidents like the gas leak on Statfjord A platform this quarter.</p>
          <p>Then I would like to move to the highlights of the quarter, which is on page two, the next page. There are four main characteristic of our second quarter deliveries. Firstly, we are delivering a 6% equity production growth compared to second quarter of last quarter, reaching an equity production of 1,898,000 barrels per day. This growth is coming mainly from solid production on existing fields and ramp up of new fields. The quarterly production is negatively impacted by the maintenance fees, which will continue over this &#x2013; over the summer months and also impact our third quarter production even more than has been in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, strong production during the first half of '08 and the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn pipeline being postponed to 2008 which are reverted and higher gas offtake makes the 2008 production for planning more robust.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have started production from eight new fields. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf we started production on five &#x2013; in the six fields: the Gulltopp, the Oseberg Gamma Main Statfjord, the Vigdis East, Theta Cook, and Oseberg Delta and as was announced this morning, also Vivelia  has started producing. Outside Norway production commenced at the Deep Water Gunashli in April and Agbami was also announced on the 29th of July this month.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we have sanctioned three new projects in the second quarter. These are the Troll Field projects, the Noatun Template of the Norwegian Shelf, and the TDF plan in block 31, offshore Angola. And finally, our pricing activities continue at a high level and is delivering good results. Wells &#x2013; exploration appraisal wells &#x2013; were completed in Norway as well outside of the Norway this quarter and out of these 34 wells we have announced 10 discoveries, most of them in Norway.  Three wells have been dry and we are waiting the final conclusions from 11 out of that 34 wells.</p>
          <p>I will revert to some of these topics later in my presentation, but let's turn now towards given overview of the financials on the next page. The net operating income for the second quarter is NOK62.6 billion. This is up 74% from the same quarter last year and 22% compared to the first quarter of this year. The increase from last year is mainly due to 44% increase in average realized liquids prices measured in Norwegian kroner. This price increase is comprised of a 48% oil price, including condensate increase and 27% average price increase in natural gas liquids. This is due to the wider differentials for these products in the current environment. NGL constitutes almost 15% of our total liquids production in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Natural gas prices increased by 49% in Norwegian kroner compared to the same quarter last year. Lifting of oil and gas was at 1,736,000 barrels per day, which is up 8% compared to the same period last year. Equity production is up 6%. Then there was an overlift in the second quarter of this year of 42,000 barrels per day compared to an underlift in the second quarter of last year of 66,000 barrels per day. Now, this shift in lifting position has also impacted our operating costs negatively due to the cost accruals that we do, reflecting our lifting position and I will also come back to this.</p>
          <p>The net effect of derivatives contributed NOK3.3 billion and I'll come to both of these and other infrequent items impacting our income statement this quarter later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>The net income in the second quarter amounted to NOK18.9 billion, which by the way, is the highest net quarterly results in our history, is up 36% from the same quarter of last year and up 18% from the first quarter. And it's primarily driven by the same factors as our net operating income.</p>
          <p>Net financial items amounted to an expense &#x2013; net expense of 0.5 &#x2013; 500 million in the second quarter compared to an income &#x2013; net income of 2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007. This reduction, adding up to 3.1 billion, was mainly caused by decreased net foreign exchange gains of 2.3 billion related to our long-term debt and liquidity management.</p>
          <p>The average income tax in the quarter was at 69.6%, which is up from 63.9 in the same quarter last year and is slightly down from 71% in the first quarter this year. An increase in the tax rate from last year was mainly related to higher &#x2013; relatively higher income from the Norwegian Shelf, which is, as you know, is subject to higher taxation than the average corporate tax rate and also reduced net financial items at lower than average tax rate.</p>
          <p>Let me then address more specifically our production volumes on the next page. As already mentioned, our equity production averaged 1,898,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. Entitlement production is up 2% to 1,710,000 barrels per day. And this implies production sharing effect of 188,000 barrels per day in the quarter, again compared to 115,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2008, equity production is up 7% to 1,973,000 barrels per day compared to 1,837,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year from the -- in the first two quarters last year.</p>
          <p>Entitlement production year-to-date is up 3% to 1.799 million implying a production sharing volume effect of 174,000 barrels per day. Increases in production between the quarters as well as on a year-to-date basis caused mainly from new fields coming on stream, ramp ups and also higher gas offtake partly offset by declining production at our mature fields.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention in this context that the production at the Sn&#xF8;hvit field resumed on July the 10th, this summer, following a two-month scheduled turnaround. Overall, the Sn&#xF8;hvit project is progressing in line with what we communicated following to our first quarter announcement in May.</p>
          <p>The turnaround was completed as planned and the damaged seawater heat exchangers have been repaired. However, we may still encounter problems with the seawater heat exchangers and are therefore continuously evaluating when and how permanent replacements can take place. Replacements of two of the heat exchangers are expected to take place already in the fourth quarter this year and is expected to require an approximately 30 days shutdown period.</p>
          <p>In addition, several extra monitoring and measuring instruments have been installed to provide more detailed understanding of what happens inside the refrigeration or the tooling box. We expect this fall to have a clear picture of the magnitude of the changes necessary to increase the production fuel capacity and to establish a plan to implant enhanced heat exchangers and we will come back at a later stage with this plan.</p>
          <p>On the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn pipeline issue, following recent analysis of testing of our repair solutions, it has been decided to postpone the repair project until summer 2009. Starting out the repair next summer will give us better time for planning, will also reduce the risk and possibly cut down on the repair period.</p>
          <p>Kvitebj&#xF8;rn turnaround schedule for this year it will consequently be reduced to around two weeks in August. Kvitebj&#xF8;rn will therefore continue to produce as it has done since production resumed in January. The impact of this decision on our production estimates for 2008 is not significant as it will mainly be relevant to the liquids production.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, strong production during the first half makes the estimates, full-year estimates more robust. So I would like to remind you that the production in the third quarter will be impacted by close to 100,000 barrels per day as a result of maintenance activities as well it will be impacted by lower &#x2013; somewhat lower expected gas offsite content through the second quarter offset.</p>
          <p>In addition, based on production forecast at realized oil price year-to-date production sharing effects for the full year are expected at approximately 200,000 barrels per day assuming that oil price stays at approximately US$125 per barrel for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Then a brief look also at our cost developments on the next page. Our production unit cost measured on &#x2013; based on equity volumes and adjusted for one-off restructuring costs arising from the merger in the first quarter as well as gas injection cost was at 32.1 for the 12 months ended on 30 &#x2013; ended in first half of this year. This is compared with 27.3 for the 12 months &#x2013; same 12 months which is ended then on the 30th of June last year and 31.2 for last year as a whole. The units costs have increased due to startup of new fields, higher maintenance costs and general industry cost pressure.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this slide, the cost increases have not been significant so for this year, but we do expect somewhat higher costs in the second half of this year namely resulting from the ongoing comprehensive maintenance activities.</p>
          <p>We maintain our guidance of &#x2013; a range of 33 to NOK36 per barrel for a period 2008 to 2012 as communicated at our Capital Market Day.</p>
          <p>So, let's now take a look at our exploration results on the next page. As already mentioned, our exploration activity continues at a high level and is delivering the results. Overall, we are satisfied with our exploration results so far. This year we have completed, up till today in total 50 exploration wells, of which 17 have been communicated as discoveries, 7 wells have been concluded as dry and 36 wells are still awaiting final conclusion for evaluation.</p>
          <p>On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, most of the 14 discoveries so far are located close to 15 infrastructures, which means that the development solutions can be quite efficient and the time from discovered to production can be relatively short.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue our high level of exploration activities throughout this year more than 70 exploration and appraisal wells are expected to be completed at a cost of less than NOK80 billion.</p>
          <p>On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the significant part of the drilling activity is expected to be in mature that is close to existing infrastructure. Plus we also plan to drill several wells in frontier areas of Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we will continue to pursue a high level of exploration activity combined with targeted business development in this which is consistent with our growth strategy. Rig capacity has been secured for the 2008 drilling program and we are well positioned for further exploration drilling beyond 2008 based on our current drilling program and our rig positions.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide some comments to each of the business segments, and I would like to start with the exploration and production in Norway on the next page. Net operating income for E&amp;P Norway in the second quarter was NOK53.8 billion, and this is compared to 27.8 billion in the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly due to a 43% increase in the average payment liquids price measured in Norwegian kroner which contributed 13.2 billion to increase and 38% increase in the transfer price of natural gas, adding 4.3 billion to the EBIT improvement. Realized volumes of oil and gas of 9% contributed 3.6 billion to the net income increase.</p>
          <p>The realized liquids price is an average US $114.3 per barrel in the quarter and this is comprised realized price of crude and condensate slightly above the Brent blends slightly above US$122 per barrels and average NGL price in the range of 72 to US$75 per barrel.</p>
          <p>The increase in net operating income was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of 1.1 billion. This is mainly due to higher activities as I have touched upon, as huge as somewhat higher gas injection cost relating to kroner is also due to improvements related to the change in our lifting positions from an underlift and an overlift position, and also some &#x2013; to some extent general cost inflation.</p>
          <p>Exploration expenses also increased by approximately NOK1 billion on a quarter-to-quarter basis and this is due to increased exploration activities and also increased expenditure of previously capitalized exploration costs compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Other income increased by NOK7 billion and this is related to a positive effect from change to the fair value of derivatives in connection with an earn-out agreement.</p>
          <p>Then some comments to our E&amp;P business outside Norway. Hence as on the next slide, net operating income from international E&amp;P in the second quarter was NOK9.6 billion. This is compared to 3.7 billion last year. Increase was mainly due to about 48% increase in realized liquids assets measured in Norwegian kroner and it has contributed 4.1 billion, due to the net gain of approximately 400.4 million from the sale of assets and reversal of impairments from previous quarters of NOK2.1 billion, and this has fixed approximately 0.9 billion in the positive contribution to DD&amp;A for depreciation and approximately 1.1 billion to the net exploration expenses. These increases were partially offset by approximately 500 million charge &#x2013; change in costs accrual relating to our lifting position.</p>
          <p>Total exploration expenses, we have 0.5 billion in the second quarter of 2008 compared to 1.4 billion last year. I think the decrease was, as already mentioned, due to reverse impairment of 1.1 billion related to acquired and proved exploration assets in the Gulf of Mexico partially offset by somewhat higher drilling and seismic.</p>
          <p>Then to our Natural Gas business. Hence on the next stage, on Natural Gas, statements shows an accounting loss approximately NOK600 million in the second quarter. This compares to an income of 1.4 billion in the same quarter the year before. The average sales price increased by 49% contributing 5.7 billion, and this is offset by higher cost of goods sold which reduced income with NOK4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The volume weighted average sales price in the second quarter was NOK2.23 per standard meter compared to 1.50 per standard cubic meter in the second quarter last year. The gas transfer price was at 1.73 and NOK1.25 per cubic meter in the same mentioned quarter.</p>
          <p>There were also significant negative changes in the fair valuation of derivatives which reduced net operating income with approximately NOK2.2 billion on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In addition, higher operating, selling and administrative expenses reduced income by almost 0.9 billion, mainly from higher transportation costs and also some other different cost provisions.</p>
          <p>Natural gas sales for the quarter was 10.1 billion compared to 10.2 billion cubic meter in the second quarter of last year and the entitlement gas sales was at 13% to 9.4 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And that's finally to our last segment on the next page. The net operating income for manufacturing and marketing was 1.2 billion in the quarter compared to 2.9 billion last year. The difference is mainly due to lower trading results and reduced refining margins, again in Norwegian kroner. Net operating income for the oil sales, trading and supply business in the second quarter was approximately 300 million compared to 1.4 billion in the second quarter last year. The decrease was mainly due to losses on inventory hedge positions which do not qualify for several hedge accounting, and also somewhat lower trading results, partially offset by gains from higher prices of sales and from operational &#x2013; from sales &#x2013; on sales from our operational storage.</p>
          <p>Net operating income from the manufacturing business was NOK0.8 billion compared to 1.1 billion in the second quarter last year. This decrease is caused largely by lower refining margins in Norwegian kroner and this is due to the strengthening of the Norwegian kroner versus US dollar on a quarter-to-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Net operating income for Energy and Retail was 0.1 billion in the second quarter compared to 400 million last year. This decrease was mainly due to an accrual of 200 million related to future restructuring costs in our Swedish operations.</p>
          <p>So, let me now summarize the non-recurring items impacting our net operating income in this quarter that you can see on the next slide. As you can see and already mentioned, the aggregate effect of infrequent items in the second quarter has an overall positive effect on the corporate results.</p>
          <p>The results for E&amp;P Norway NOK53.8 billion is positively impacted by 7.2 billion from so called one-off. And this is due to an overlift &#x2013; we have mentioned overlift situation &#x2013; impacting results positively by approximately NOK700 million and positive impact of 6.5 billion related to change in the fair value of derivative from, again these earn-out agreements which mainly is the lifting agreement which was entered into five years back actually.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that the impact of this derivative agreement can been significant, both in positive and in negative direction depending on future commodity prices outlook at any time.</p>
          <p>In the international E&amp;P segments the non-recurring items added up to a positive NOK3.2 billion this quarter. We've already mentioned reversal of impairments in the Gulf of Mexico portfolios was 2.1 billion. In addition, the change in the lifting position had a net positive effect of NOK1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas was impacted negatively with NOK2.5 for increase in items this quarter coming mainly from valuation of various derivatives.</p>
          <p>Within Manufacturing and Marketing, there was a net effect of zero due to a negative effect from inventory adjustment of 1.2, restructuring costs in Sweden of 0.2 as mentioned and a positive operational exploration effect 1.4 and it all adds back to the earnings in this illustration.</p>
          <p>And finally, eliminations had a negative impact of 1.3 billion related to realization of values from reduced oil stocks. Now, adjusted for one of these non-recurring assets, net operating income would have 55.8 billion for the quarter against 36.5 billion last year, which is an increase of 53%.</p>
          <p>So, let me now switch to the outlook for the third quarter, next quarter, next page. Previously mentioned, the third quarter would be heavily impacted by our turnaround program, the scheduled maintenance digit impacting quarterly production with close to 100,000 barrels per day. Further we expect production in the third quarter to be impacted as mentioned by somewhat lower seismic gas offtake compared to the second quarter. In addition, we are continuing our highest level of exploration activity to implement &#x2013; to complete at least 70 wells for the year as a whole. And finally, several new projects will be, or have already been put on stream in the quarter, like the Agbami in Nigeria, Saxi Batuque in Angola and Vivelia also having been put on stream today in Norway.</p>
          <p>Then to my final slide, the guidance, next page. As we came to the markets in January we estimated our equity production for 2008 at 1.9 million barrels per day and was mentioned strong productions and high gas offtake has made this estimate more robust. CapEx is estimated at around 65 billion for the year. And the main reason for the reduction from previous guidance now is the strengthening of the Norwegian kroner verus the US dollar, the exchange rate, which is now assumed and this is estimated to be at the current level for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Our exploration program is expected cost less then NOK18 billion mainly due for the same causes written. And finally production unit cost based on equity volume is expected to be in the range of 33 to NOK36 per barrel for the period '08 to 2012. And as mentioned, we anticipate somewhat higher cost in the second half of this year as a result of the comprehensive maintenance program as already mentioned. And for 2012 there are no changes to our guidance.</p>
          <p>So with these remarks, I thank you for the attention so far, and I return the microphone to Lars to ask if you have a few questions he has heard request from you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Eldar. We will start the Q&amp;A session shortly, but in addition to Eldar S&#xE6;tre and myself, we are now joined in the studio by the Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. Kare Thomsen, and the Head of Performance Management and Control, Torgrim Reitan. Before I leave the word to the operator, I would like you &#x2013; I would like to appeal to you not to bundle your questions, but try to ask one question at a time with possible followup questions in connection to the answer. Operator, could you please take us through the procedure for asking questions?</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Jason Kenney, ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Jason from ING. I just had a question on your sensitivity guidance. I noticed in your supplementary slides updated guidance on sensitivity for 2008. And it does appear that since the first quarter going into the second quarter, you're likely to be less sensitive to the oil price, more sensitive to the gas price change and more sensitive to FX. I just wondered if you could explain the moving parts there. Is it the base assumptions, the starting levels or is it just better modeling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is basically related to the modeling. This is now &#x2013; not statistically comparable deviations. So, this is really a US$10 practical number on the oil price, if the gas price of 50 &#xF8;re or NOK0.5 per standard cubic meter, and also 50 &#xF8;re per US dollar. So it's simply now practical numbers. So here speaking obviously, I mean we are very sensitive to the oil price, so I would say, the oil price is relatively changing where we have the highest consistency and due to that that is the most important part of our portfolio and the multi-portfolio and for that I can't comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I noticed in the press, you had exchange rate moves 0.5 there, I mean you used to look for a net operating income effective NOK13 billion, but that's now NOK19 billion, as for a significant change quarter-on-quarter to have that kind of sensitivity shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has to do with production volume and the level oil price that this is multiplied by. So, that &#x2013; that doesn't allow the sort of impact on those factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that not in the last quarter then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't got the numbers for last quarter actually is problem here. I don't think we can answer that more closely here. So, I'll let &#x2013; let us try to come back to that if you would allow me any better answers for that year. I mean we &#x2013; there are no big changes to the way that we have modeled it before, but it may actually have a different impact with the level of exchange rate and oil price that we are in now. That's the best argument you can give right now.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. You've had quite a number of discoveries this year. You mentioned there's quite a lot of noise. We're close to existing infrastructure. Is it possible at this stage to give us a feeling for the rough scale of the total resource base that you have captured, other companies such as Shell and E&amp;I are starting to do this at the half year stage as well? And could give us some guidance to which are the key wells that you're most excited about in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to your request, which I can understand for combining the resource base coming from exploration. We are not in a position to give any numbers on that. Obviously, we are following guidance generally, but we're not ready to an answer. That's something we will have to come back to on a connection with the Capital Market Day type of event talking about free cash, talking about that. But generally speaking, I can say that the additions to our resource base from exploration so far very is much in line with our expectations. When it comes to sort of individual wells, what I can say on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is that there is a lot of discoveries, 40 recoveries so far. And really that helps the nation, that's what we see on the Norwegian Continental Shelf that we are &#x2013; we see mainly for a smaller type of discoveries and medium size discoveries that there are no sort of new big discoveries turning out and that's the fact also for this quarter. So this consists -- there is a lot of discoveries and there is really now significant discoveries that I will be fair to get any numbers on at this stage without suffering that we will have to come back.</p>

          <p>We have our next question from Iain Reid, Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there Eldar. It's Iain Reid from Macquarie. Do you mind if I ask two questions? Firstly, international operating costs have gone up pretty significantly in this quarter. I understand this is being start-up to say. But could you perhaps point us to where do you think the kind of run rate of international operating costs is going, maybe by reference to previous quarters? And secondly, you're selling gas now in Europe, UK and US. I wonder, whether you give some sort up rough breakdown as to the various percentages and quantity going in this direction? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. On the international side, I don't think, I mean, there is an increase compared to the same quarter on the operating cost in the range of 500 million. And that is &#x2013; can fully be explained actually by the change from the underlift and overlift position. What we do when the account is actually to provide to make cost provision for the total cost &#x2013; the full unit cost or about the underlift, if you're in that position, it's negative. And if there's is an overlift, we have the full cost for the overlift. That requires now volatility in the accounts related to any given underlift and overlift situation. On this case, we have an overlift situation and the expense is actually all rising in the operating costs. So, on the international side, there wasn't new activity, not significantly new activities. And there is also a slight currency impact which is positive taking the US dollar and the Norwegian kroner. But overall there isn't significant change in the operating costs on the international side. If I come to &#x2013; perhaps I didn't quite get your question, Iain. So maybe you could sort of &#x2013; little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The total amount of gas sales you're reporting this quarter, I just wondered whether you could give us some rough idea, how much you're selling into Continental Europe versus UK versus US for LNG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, most of it &#x2013; LNG is not a significant portion of it due to the situation. We had a couple of months shutdown now on the service, so there hasn't been LNG in the portfolio. Obviously, between &#x2013; those are different markets. And well I could say that basically we have 9.2 billion &#x2013; 9 billion coming from the Norwegian side. And then there was the freight as the factor of oil and gas into this. The main part of this is going into the continental market. If you look at this on a sort of short term versus longer term, this is longer-term contract. I think long-term contracts represent more than 90% of the world portfolio. But &#x2013; and that probably should affect deals going forward. And so, the contract obviously has much lower share. The more specific elasticity in the UK and continental volumes, I haven't got those volumes and I'm not prepared to talk about that today.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking the time to take a telephone conference. I wish you could have a presentation that you used to actually always. It's so much difficult to hear you on the conference call, anyway. My question goes to the &#x2013; it's related to the production guidance for 2008. In the first half of the year, your production was 7.6% up year-on-year and it sticking to 1.9 billion barrels for by 2008, which implies that your production for the second half of this year is going to actually fall compared to the second half of last year. So either there is a huge drop in production in the second half of the year or you -- your guidance seems very conservative. So, do you want to comment on that? Or I have missed out anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your -- you comments are right. So what I can say this is the repeat statement that we have given. First of all, we have very strong gas offtake both in the first quarter and in the second quarter. Strong year revenue have been used to actually. But quite not so, and we do not expect that situation to be maintained going into the second quarter I think. That's something we take into account when we guide you on this. And then there is quiet a comprehensive maintenance activity, both actually on the international side and in Norway. Well, that's the most specific factor. We have the time issues, ordinary timing issues. I also mentioned that on this notice. We are now more firm that there will a 30 days shutdown in the first quarter compared to what we have sort of in <mark type="inaudible" />. So, that's now more firm plans than we have seen before. Adding all of this up, what we have said is that the even though the number is let's is the robust number, we're comfortable &#x2013; that is more comfortable with 1.9 than we were previously that we are not ready to give any new number. So, our &#x2013; you can say it's a more comfortable, number, more comfortable perspective that we are not ready to give any number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you could mention, of give a comment also to the gas offtakes which were very high in the first half for the year. Anyway do you expect that to be different in the second half of the year? And also maybe related to the fact that you are postponing the repayments of the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn pipeline? Is the gas take in the first half of the year have anything to do with that? Did you need the guys from &#x2013; the gas from Kvitebj&#xF8;rn for the second half of this year or was there anything or any thoughts about that behind the decision to delay the repair of the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn pipeline? Two questions really. And reason to expect gas offtake or gas take to be lower in the second half? And secondly, to the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn. It's related there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When it comes to sort of our perspective on what the customers would do, that is based on typically what we see. So &#x2013; and I've seen see increases, yes. But it's a seasonal pattern. So, yes, in second and the third quarter typically much lower than the third and first and fourth quarter. And the second quarter have been slightly higher offtake than we have typically seen. And then there is a gap here, which ends in the first quarter. So this is where the gaps are. And the fact that we have seen closing in the third quarter and the fact that we have seen higher offtake so far that take us the direction of lower offset in the first quarter. But as simple as that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the Kvitebj&#xF8;rn, I mentioned that the main indication should be better to be on the liquid side. You should not expect us to simply accrue &#x2013; I mean what &#x2013; our main concern is to create values in this terms. And we are looking into the future and have sort of perspective as to how market would develop and we also have flexibility actually now on Troll and on the Uterlag. So you shouldn't expect us to &#x2013; the fact that we did not come into production that gives us more flexibility to close the gap, but it's not necessarily a consequence that we will truly fall into the market at this time. So, it gives more flexibility about to conclude that it will come into the markets in there in this year, but we're not talking into sort of advice to you on. But it gives certainly that more flexibility. What was the reason behind I think the decision that was definitely not sort of market perspective. That was pure safety and technical aspect of that thing to that conclusion for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my final question is related to the exploration expenditure in Q2 in Norway. Norway had very high success rates in your drilling in the second quarter of the year. Still you expanse 1.5 billion out of 1.7 billion spend on expressed in Norway in the second quarter, and I would have thought that the exploration expenses will going to be somewhat lower due to the higher success rate, any reason why they expense so much on the exploration cost in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, there's a lot of factors going into the exploration costs and some of this is not &#x2013; quite a bit actually is not related to exploration success and all in all, that seismic and all that's expensed continuously. So, there is a lot of cost elements which is in case, I don't expect. This quarter what happened is typically it's slightly higher, exploration samples than we have seen both compared to the same quarter last year and the previous quarter and that's what you see on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Mainly it comes from two factors; higher rig activity driven by almost activity at higher cost and higher seismic costs in particular. And it also is related to the fact that we have expensed slightly more as more has been characterized in previous quarter &#x2013; this quarter compared to earlier quarter. Now, close to 500 million is actually expense and is a lot of wealth going into that from a consideration of the savings or wells that have been capitalized previously. How to do the activity level and the expensing of previously capitalized &#x2013; I mean we've not look at what is being capitalized, that's pretty much now around 50% and have been mostly in the same quarter now in the capitalization portion. Overall, there will be rises from quarter-to-quarter, but you look at this on a more aggregate basis, we house to overall activity level at more than the 70 wells less than NOK18 billion, and we have the success rate. So I think you should look at it perhaps more variances on a quarter-to-quarter basis but any further indication for revenue for higher cost balance.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just one question. You implied up front of your press release that you see prices for natural gas to be increasingly determined by the power industry, coal, nuclear, renewables to set the price. I am wondering given that you put this near the front of your press release, what are you trying to tell us here? Are you &#x2013; how do you see your portfolio of current gas sales contracts which are predominantly oil linked, if I understand correctly, evolving given that outlook and what you think the impact on the Statoil's average European gas price will be in that given that outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not prepared to go into sort of more consequences then I will have to extend my outlook here. But I think that's carefully prepared in this statement. This is what we have. They &#x2013; what we do see is that power payment is gradually increasingly representing being more and more important for the growth in the gas segment and the energy and with the natural gas. So this is basically reflecting that didn't affect common view, and given that is the case, your hub is into the power sector to gas then it's also very special important in the terms of determining the gas prices still eliminating weakening sales. That goes back to coal, obviously and the cost of taking coal into this. And also, there is more emphasis on the timing issues and the '07 is, so the impact of the divided assemblies on the elections at the time of issue. So this is taking the respective lead time of perspective and I will not be prepared to take this any further into contract purpose for the gas price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask a separate question then please? And that is the restructuring costs are clearly having a large effect on your current reported OpEx, when &#x2013; OpEx result, when can we expect to see an end to these restructuring costs, are we near the end of the program now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are at the end of the program. There is no additional restructuring costs now in this quarter. So this goes back to the one-off that we had in the fourth quarter for managing it. And there have been no additional restructuring costs in the first quarter or in this quarter. The only restructuring cost that we talked about is related to the Swedish retail business and that has nothing to do with the merger actually, that's something that we would have undertaken in any case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other reason why we talk about restructuring cost always, is because the production cost per barrel are calculated on a 12 year &#x2013; I am sorry, 12 months average basically. So in that sense, in the fourth quarter, the restructuring cost is distorting the future a little bit, and that's what we try to deal with. But there are no new restructuring costs as a result of merger remaining now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. I've got a request rather than a question, you provide quite a helpful breakdown of equity production per field for international E&amp;P on page 34 of your presentation, but it would be most helpful still if you could provide the entitlement productions, if that's obviously what drives the result in international. So that would be my request that you produce that in future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. That you, Colin. The only problem is &#x2013; was that we cannot talk about the individual PSAs, and if we talk about entitlement production and equity production per field, you will be given the PSA effect per field, which we talk about because of the agreements we have. So I would say, it's a little bit of a problem as we get both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe, the thing to do would be not to publish the equity and to publish the entitlement then, if you can't publish both together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be a possibility, but then we wouldn't be able to focus on what we are controlling, and &#x2013; i.e. the equity production. And I know that there are pro and cons with both and this is one of the cons with strong equity production, but we have to try to focus on what we can do something about, i.e., the equity production.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are continuously working on modernizing and updating our refineries. And we have just followed &#x2013; had issued an investment process now in Kalundborg to increase the capacity to take on heavier &#x2013; or heavier crude then &#x2013; and in its refinery. So the upgrading capacity on that refinery has been increased. Currently there are no specific times for doing that at the most top refineries, but that's something that we would continuously evaluate. But we are obviously now looking and we have a lot of more medium size investment projects at all our refineries, and now mainly at Mongstad, this is the time to increasing the yield and the addition of the other refinery.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me just ask one final small questions, do you have any derivaties in place that are fixed that might affect you in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Derivatives that might affect it, yes, all ordinary basically might affect it. We have derivatives but there is no smaller staff as well but the main thing is derivatives that we have on the E&amp;P Norway side. I mentioned that &#x2013; and I mentioned that basically the one out of Netherlands, which is the final derivative. And that will impact this quite significantly, and that would be depending some of the core practice within the next five years core practice at any given time. And that we would imagine go into the calculation of this and we would have an impact. And then on the gas side, the development in the UK gas market would have an impact to the extent that that's different from the development in the underlying component going into the other long-term contracts like old productions. On the downstream, again we would have derivative effects continuously or related to operating activities, and also impact on the story. So I think, this is a component is there to stay, I will put it that way, and we will have to do lot more equity to sort of making this a high quality and start value considerations in every quarter. And we will continuously report this customary piece, so that we can, if you like, adjust for these numbers in the quarterly announcement. But yes we will definitely see this both in the third and fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have got a few question on, maybe just going back on the natural gas price outlook, it may be leaving price to one side, and focusing in on your comments on supply and demand. You seem to indicate that the supply situation will be rather tight as a number of new supply scheme are delayed. Are you talking there from the supplier side of the market, in terms of coal or gas fired power plants or indeed renewables or new gas supplies coming into Europe that you see are being delayed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have definitely seen and used supply sources coming into Europe delays in these. That has been going on for some time. We expect that situation should be sustainable for few months, let's say, for the rest of this year. But then we should expect that this new capacity eventually will come into the European market, that is the arrangement for the European markets. So we think that this would still overall be a tight situation beyond the very short-term, also for the medium-term, but it's not as tight, Neil sort of, it has been over the last couple of years to put it that way. On the demand side, we &#x2013; generally we see a strong growing demand for energy, and we believe that gas is going to be represented as a strong product, significant part of this picture going forward for various reasons, and one of them is related to the climate issues one confirms, and so I say general additions for instance related to both energy efficiency and renewable share going forward, and I think, this is mostly support gas going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of that demand and supply outlook. When do you think that the proportion of your gas sales that are on current spot prices that are on length from the European long-term gas contract. When do you think that will substantially increase, so obviously your current gas sales growing from the new production going into the UK or based on UK prices? When do you feel that you will see some of your longer-term contracts rolling off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is complex issue, and I cannot &#x2013; I mean, there are things that &#x2013; take this &#x2013; support also, they continue to link to oil for quite a long time, and so I think, that we will &#x2013; you should not expect any sort of rapid or any dramatic tension in this balance in the few years ahead of us. So, it's definitely more precise on it, I wouldn't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe just a very quick last one, given where we are at versus the current commodity prices, and the fact that even your CapEx has come down a bit due to currency admittedly, where are you in terms of giving out guidance on any potential special dividend for the year, or indeed even discussing buybacks again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, the short answer to that we are not there to give any guidance. There is no plans we have &#x2013; no, we have net debt ratio at the moment at 2%. Our &#x2013; the future development of energy is obviously very much dependent on the commodity environment and we would just have to watch that going forward. But we are confident we will for the time being our priority is to find investment opportunities, and value creating growth for our shareholders. On share buybacks we have no mandate for the time being, and there are no plans to go to the general assembly, an operating mandate, neither &#x2013; not on share buybacks nor on any special dividend for the time being, but the situation is that this is &#x2013; we will have to look obviously at cost control.</p>

          <p>But you must admit that you didn't plan your budgets on an average price for $115 oil price this year. So I am just wondering at what point do you run out of near-term investment opportunities, and start looking towards the special dividend. Is that something that you've got the opportunity to do with Board over the next six months?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't speculate anymore on this. On the investment opportunities, we see definitely that to get access to the opportunities is something that you will have to do, but it means higher cost, and we are in that game even though if you see that our investment program is down due to the currencies. We have quite aggressive investment programs going forward, and we also see that going into 2009. So I think, that's our priority, but expect to add anything about how this picture going to look going forward, I am not prepared for that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am sorry, I have got a very, very bad line here. I hope you can hear me, because I didn't catch a lot of the stuff that was said, so if the question has been answered already, I do apologize. In the E&amp;P Norway, this comment about the change in the fair value of certain earn-out agreements, which accounted for 7 billion, quite a bit change, is that a one-off that you are sort of taking over &#x2013; that's been just building up? Or are we going to have that on a basis quarter-by-quarter because of the very sharp and increase in the oil and gas prices over the last 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is in many ways is one-off. This is based on the future commodity prices as it is seen by the forward markets, and our own assumption is beyond that. So depending on how the forward market is developing and how our own assumptions are developing, that might change the value of these derivatives from quarter-to-quarter. So that is the &#x2013; that will be &#x2013; might still be quite significant adjusting this quarter rises, both positive and negatives from quarter-to-quarter on this. And this derivative specifically is something that we were carrying for quite a long time in this specific case. So, yes, it's a one-off and &#x2013; but not more one-off that you would probably see effects on this in most quarters going forward, because it will move up and down, as I said, that's reflecting the former and current commodity environments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as long as the future price is above the spot price, there's going to be a little of an impact each quarterly report, is that what you're trying to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the forward price is higher than it was in the previous quarter...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the previous quarter, yeah, yeah. I understand that. All right. Okay. And it's just because the change has been so much larger in this quarter that 7 billion is as high, I mean, normally it would only be not even worth talking about, a little bit like what Shell said yesterday, that it is just something that has come up, because it sort of mucks up the numbers a bit? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I didn't get your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so I am just saying that is it &#x2013; this is something that &#x2013; it's because like you had a 47% increase in the oil price in quarter two, just between the first quarter and second quarter, thus it's because that increase has been so large. For example, if the prices are flat as you said then there won't be an adjustment at all. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have that two effects there. One is the realized effect. And one is the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- and one is the future effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And these are the derivatives, so it's reflecting the future earn &#x2013; potential earn-out from this contract. But you also has an effect in this, which is realized and &#x2013; in the quarter, and that is depending on the oil prices in any given quarter, but the derivative effect that's related to the future. Not in this quarter only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this has nothing to do with today's oil price, but it's the future oil price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the value, future value of this derivative &#x2013; of this contract, this supply agreement, and changes in the future value as defined by the forward market really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right. And then in your operating general and administration expenses up 18%, again, I might &#x2013; it might be asked before, that's up 18%. In the first quarter that number was only up 5%, is that &#x2013; were there any extraordinary items in there that apart from maybe exchange rate or something, which affected that number so much. And I think you may have made point that the adjustments or rather the &#x2013; yeah, the adjustments for the hydro merger, are virtually now coming out with the numbers, is that the last effects of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The merger has nothing to do with these changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase was just slightly higher this time, it related mainly to three factors. One is the higher activity, higher volumes just coming into production, like Ormen Lange and Sn&#xF8;hvit and so on, but they are also delivering volumes. So we don't see that in the unit cost, but we see it on the actual cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actual cost levels. The second one has to do with the cost provisions that we do, and I mentioned that previously &#x2013; you maybe didn't hear that, but it has to do with the way we make cost provisions for over-lifting, so this time we had a very significant switch from under-lift to over-lift, that is we took out more volumes and sold more volumes than our relative share of the production. And for this difference we accrued net cost provisions for the full unit cost, but there has been significant volatility, and that volatility was much bigger this time than it was in previous quarters. Actually for E&amp;P Norway, it was almost 500 million explained simply by the change in accruals, cost accruals. And the last element, I would mention has to do with the slightly higher cost related to purchase of gas for the ground injection &#x2013; gas injection. That's the reason unit cost is pretty much stable, although this is not the nutshell, this has nothing to do with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Because I mean although the number you gave for the unit cost per barrel was &#x2013; is actually &#x2013; is only accruing higher. If you look on &#x2013; what's it, on page &#x2013; one that &#x2013; on the OES on page four of the press release. It says that production cost barrel of oil equivalent and at a flat exchange rate is actually up 51% on the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that includes deferral &#x2013; deferred costs, that includes also the restructuring cost, that was accrued as a one-off in the fourth quarter last year. As a one-off. So, that sort of goes into and explains that. But we haven't seen any additional restructuring costs now in the first and the second quarter, as we don't expect any further restructuring costs. That was a one-off which explains that significant cost increase that you referred to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry the line is very, very poor. I didn't catch &#x2013; that was one-off in the fourth quarter is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Significant one-off in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember the production unit cost is calculated on 12 months basis, so...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- so when you compare the two numbers...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- that you compare the last 12 months, and you have compare the 12 &#x2013; the last 12 months a year ago basically. That has nothing to do with the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- that's one off restructuring costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final question again, do we &#x2013; do you expect the third quarter over-lift of gas as well, or thus as you had in the second quarter or is that, I think, you said something along lines, because you &#x2013; the third quarter is near the end of the gas year, that you are not likely to see that. Or again, I am sorry, the line has been so poor, I am afraid, I mean, your webcast has been always very good, but this has been very difficult today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we will have to do something about that. When it comes to gas, basically we don't have the issue of over-lift versus under-lift. This has to do with...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- oil, where we have shipments, ships from the source &#x2013; the producing source &#x2013; which are not sort of on a quarterly basis equivalent with your ideal percentage of the production. So this has to do with oil. Guiding on under or over-lift; that's impossible. What I can say in general, if you have over-lift in one quarter, it's more likely that you will under-lift in the next quarter. But it could be &#x2013; it's not necessarily like that, so it's very hard to be precise on guiding on over-lift versus under-lift. But over time, it will level out; you will lift what you are entitled to.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just the one question. I am just intrigued that the move in the dollar assumption from 6.0 to just 5.25 is the same in percentage terms as the most in your CapEx budget from 75 to 65 billion. I guess, one could infer that all your CapEx is therefore in dollars, I am sure that's too simplistic, but could you tell us how much of your CapEx is in dollars, and are there any other moving parts to that reduction, phasing for example? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at our investment spending, and at 65 million kroner a year, you will see that almost above 50% is related to Norwegian Continental Shelf, and the majority of the rest is from the international oil and gas business. And the international part is, of course, partly linked to the U.S. dollar. And on the Norwegian Continental Shelf you will also see that a lot of the costs are implicitly related to the U.S. dollar, as well. So it will have significant impact also on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. So the majority of the revenues, the investment line, is related to the change assumption for the U.S. dollar, and for the first half, we &#x2013; it's been U.S. dollar 5.20 in average, and for the rest of the year, for this purpose we have assumed 5.25.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>In the investment program, it's worthwhile to mention that this investment guidance is organic investment as you call it or mean it. From the development, we have excess, in addition to that number, you know we acquired 50% of the Peregrino field from Anadarko earlier this year, that will also be the part of the investment. That is not part of this 65. So any acquisitions of assets and so on will come in addition to the 65, and that is of course, a moving part.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question come from Gudmund Halle Isfeldt from DnB NOR. Please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have three questions for you. The first one is on your NGL realizations, they seem to be decoupled from the oil prices, is this going to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a good question. I wish I could give you an answer, and a good answer. Generally speaking, we have seen with the NGLs &#x2013; they have slightly lower density than crude, so to the extent that you see variances, if sort of crude stays at the same level you shouldn't see probably any relative change in NGL, but if you see movements, you will see smaller movements upwards on NGL compared to crude for that reason. Because there is lower energy in these products.</p>
          <p>Then the other component is very much depending on sort of the current demand for these products, which is typically for appliances heating and naptha and also butane in our case. There are typically seasonal variations in this, and then it depends very much on the gas end markets, and the refineries &#x2013; how the refineries needs to this the refinery of naptha, demand for naptha, and this has been quite soft recently, so there could be arguments that the gas midmarket would &#x2013; could strengthen a little bit going forward. That would strengthen this.</p>
          <p>Within the others sort of main scopes here, it flows into the petrochemical industry, and they are obviously the competing source, whoever receives the gas as such. And again, I wouldn't speculate too much, but what you all know is that there are additional petrochemical capacity coming into the market from Middle East, and that is sort of supporting these products.</p>
          <p>So what I am saying, so this is very difficult to add &#x2013; be very specific on this. But the disposition which takes us a little down but there are also some other forces that could take it up, so how this is going to end going forward I couldn't say. But what I would say is that even if we have this spread for the time being, it's actually the highest &#x2013; it's an all-time high also for any other, and the alternative for us would have to &#x2013; now this comes from the gas really and the alternative of the gas, for us would be to sort of leave it with the gas, and that sort of creates less value for us than taking it out and making it into liquid, so but I think this is the best way for us to create values for our shareholders and we are ready to take it going forward, that's definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a question on the start up of Victoria in the Norwegian Sea, I guess, it's going to be in 2012. If so, will you need a new pipeline and will it then take into accounts step into potential new fields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, the old issue of pipeline capacity from this area of the Norwegian Continental Shelf, we'll have to sort of be looked into very carefully, and include obviously all potential development in the area. So for this we will have to build the department in a holistic way, and to talk specifically to Victoria, we are not the operators, and I would be &#x2013; definitely there are no specific conclusions yet that that will have the required additional capacity. And then nothing can be done also without our expanding the current capacity in the existing pipeline, so what is the next obvious consideration that's realistic.  But obviously, all development potential in this region will have to slipped into this equation.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Thanks a lot. It's regarding the international production. In Q2 this year, the net entitlement production in percentage terms of the equity production was only 59% down from 67% in Q1. Where should we expect this to go forward? Will it continue to see the gap increasing and is there any chance that it will be reverted or it's only likely to be increased, that gap?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. When it comes to the figures PSA effects. We have given you guidance on the 2008 production, which I gave you in fact towards 2012 at the Capital Markets Day in January, so in general speaking, yes, the effects are increasing, and that is the pure consequence of the commodity market that we see that we earn a lot of money from this license. So this is all more related to the agreements that we have. And what we see that is as you know the loss of the large piece at Pemenrula has come through a loss of the tranches, so you see a diminishing effect as product cost increases. But when your specific question on the effect this year, I think, when you compare percentages you should take into account that we have sold our shelf production in the U.S. gone. So that is most part of the inflation this year and the production from Angola is very good and Angola is one of the areas with high PSA effects currently. I think, that explains half of the change that you got of it.</p>

          <p>Yeah. So for the second half assuming oil prices stay where they are now, ex vaporation to be flattish for second half or net entitlement being even lower in terms of the equity production for the second half? Given flat oil prices.</p>

          <p>Well, again, what I mentioned in my presentation was that you would, given that you have the current price situation for the rest of the year, you will see the production sharing effects moving from &#x2013; and share is different from the entitlement, and actually moving from 188 and this quarter, to almost 200,000 barrels at the end of the year. So, but &#x2013; that's transferred into percentages, I haven't got the number, but it was few thousand barrels.</p>

          <p>Hi. This is Scott Darling here from Lehman Brothers. I have got two quick questions. I think in the past you have used the forward curve to partly justify acquisitions in the near-term. Obviously we have seen the curve coming off recently, would you still be using that methodology if you looked at any further asset acquisitions? And the second question is you have been very kind enough to give PSA sensitivity for '08. Forgive me, if I've missed this, but is there any chance of giving updates up to $150 for your production outlook to 2012? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take that the last one. I think, when it comes to 2012 issue that's something that we will have to add up, the whole, when we get to the next more capital markets type of events, and then I'm sure we will be there to guide you on 2012, so again I am not prepared to guide on that kind of oil prices for the next four years.</p>
          <p>Your first point on acquisition &#x2013; I don't think we have been specific on assumptions related to any acquisitions other than sort of in the longer term, and price effects in a couple of &#x2013; and breakeven prices on a couple of occasions. So, what we do see is that there are definitely transactions made out there where presumably that kind of forward curve could not have been used, otherwise you wouldn't get to that kind of valuation. But in our case, I cannot confirm that we have used the forward curve in any of our transactions, but obviously this is &#x2013; the most important for us is to make sure that we actually can see value creation on top of this, and have a prudent perspective on both oil price, and value creation opportunities, and that's really all I can say.</p>
