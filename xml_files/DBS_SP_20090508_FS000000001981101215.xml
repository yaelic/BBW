        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. We reported net profit of 456 million for the first quarter, a 19% improvement over the previous quarter. The operating performance was strong underscoring the resilience of the DBS franchise. Revenues of 1.66 billion and earnings before allowances of 1.02 billion were both at record levels. Cost discipline measures resulted in lower expenses pitched together with the strong revenues reduced the cost income ratio to 38%, the best in several years.</p>
          <p>Underpinning the results was several positive factors. Customer loan and deposit volumes in Singapore continued to grow at a similar pace as the previous quarter. Net interest income was stable despite pressure from lower interbank rates. There was an improvement in customer fees outside of capital markets. Our trading performance recovered as previous losses in credit activities were curtailed.</p>
          <p>These positives were offset by a substantial increase in allowances. We took significantly higher general provisions of 182 million. This was twice the amount a year ago and four times the previous quarter, to reinforce an already strong balance sheet. Specific loan allowances were at 70 basis points, similar to the previous quarter were higher than the 13 basis points a year ago. An impairment charge for TMB of 23 million was taken as a one-time item, which is &#x2013; if included would have resulted in net profit of 433 million. The charge marks down our investment in TMB to 56 million.</p>
          <p>Net interest income of 1.08 billion was maintained at recent levels, despite a decline in market interest rates. SIBOR fell by almost 0.5 percentage points while LIBOR fell more than 1 percentage point during the quarter. This reduced our interest margin by 5 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.99%. The impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by improved credit spreads as well as better interest margins in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 3% during the quarter with around 2 percentage points of the increase due to currency translation effects. Underlying loan growth was driven by Singapore dollar corporate borrowing for infrastructure projects. In Hong Kong, loans fell 3% in local currency terms in line with the industry. The decline was led by trade finance and manufacturing borrowing.</p>
          <p>Net fee income rose 21% from the previous quarter to 317 million, but it was 10% lower compared to a year ago. Capital markets related fee income such as stock broking and wealth management sale activities continue to be subdued. However, other fee businesses from corporates and SMEs improved in Singapore, and selectively across the region included loan syndication and trade finance activities.</p>
          <p>Other income rose to 269 million, as trading performance recovered from previous losses to a gain of 150 million. The improvement was led by interest rates and foreign exchange activities, which benefited from market opportunities and strong customer flows. Gains from the sale of investment securities amounted to 106 million, similar to the previous quarter about half the level a year ago.</p>
          <p>Expenses fell 7% from the previous quarter to 638 million as both staff and non-staff costs declined. Staff cost fell 5% as savings from a recent organizational streamlining was felt for a full quarter. Headcount fell 2% during the quarter from a decline in contract staff hired for seasonal activities. Non-staff expenses fell 9% from the previous quarter. Adjusting for a non-recurring technology charge in the previous quarter, non-staff expenses decreased by 1%. We'll continue to manage expenses carefully and deploy some of these savings into growth markets and technology improvement.</p>
          <p>Turning to Hong Kong. The figures on this slide incorporate a 10% appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar from a year ago and 3% from the previous quarter. Operating conditions continued to be challenging as net profit of 94 million was half the level a year ago. However it improved significantly from the 16 million in the previous quarter as revenues rose 5%, while expenses and allowances declined. Net interest income benefited from higher prime-HIBOR spreads, partly offset by lower loan volumes and reduced yields on interbank assets and securities due to a lower HIBOR.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income rose 11% from increased sales of treasury products, as well as higher trading profits. Partly offsetting these were lower fee income as trade and remittences and stock broking activities declined. Expenses fell 27% from the previous quarter. Excluding non-recurring items in the previous quarter, expenses fell 10% from ongoing cost management measures. Allowances were 21% lower than the previous quarter due to sharply lower charges for private banking loans. Specific allowances for SME loans were higher and accounted for most of the allowance charges for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-performing assets rose 35% from the previous quarter to 3.2 billion with most of the increase due to SMEs in Hong Kong and corporate loans in the rest of the world. The NPL ratio increased from 1.5% to 2%. We have a conservative approach to recognizing non-performing assets with 34% of non-performing assets is being still current in interest and principle repayments. Cumulative allowances were a healthy 97% of non-performing assets and at 156% if collateral was included.</p>
          <p>The CDO investment portfolio was reduced to 1.01 billion with the repayment of 72 million of non-ABS CDOs during the quarter. Under Moody's Revised Rating Methodology implemented during the quarter, 75% of our non-ABS CDOs was investment grade. Our non-ABS portfolio is still performing. Nevertheless, we have taken additional general allowances of 49 million in this quarter for the portfolio. Increasing the allowance coverage to 36% from 27% previously. Based on our internal stress test using conservative assumptions this amount is sufficient to withstand potential losses. In addition we have hedges amounting to 252 million that are still in place.</p>
          <p>Our capital adequacy ratios stood at 16.7% slightly above the pro forma of 16.2% in December after taking to account the 4 billion rights issue that closed in January 2009. Tier 1 rose slightly to 12.5% from a pro forma 12.2% in December. While financial markets have shown signs of stabilization, the economic outlook remains uncertain. Against such a backdrop our focus has been to reinforce an already strong balance sheet. Our capital adequacy ratio has been boosted by the recent rights issue and remains well above regulatory requirements. We increased general allowances for loans and investment portfolios to insure against further economic headwinds.</p>
          <p>The strong set of underlying results we delivered this quarter reflect the foot of our recent and ongoing efforts to strengthen the franchise, including improving our customer engagement and our cost structure. We believe that these measures together with our balance sheet strength positioned us well to weather the uncertainties ahead and to perform strongly when the economic recovery is in full swing. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sok Hui. We will now open the floor to Q&amp;A. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Anyone would like to take the first question, Kevin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> the latest issue, can we confirm that you have narrowed down your CEO search to local candidates only &#x2013; internal candidates rather?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question has got nothing to do with our results. So I gather you are not so interested in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our internal process is quite clear. Whenever there is a CEO succession, we will conduct a global search for talent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is have you excluded the external candidates and are now focusing on internal candidates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not exclude anyone, we include both external and internal candidates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on that note, shall we move to the second question. Michelle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again this is not the results but I think there was <mark type="inaudible" /> rates and DBS publicly recommended <mark type="inaudible" /> can you comment on that? It was a rather unusual way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have already stated that what have &#x2013; it is now a private matter between the employee and the bank and we have nothing further to add.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is more about the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, someone is interested in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things. We've seen your loan growth has been the fastest among the three banks, 14% from a year ago. Could you give some color on why this loan growth is fast, have you been able to sieve market share from the sort of foreign players and in Singapore and outside Singapore? The other thing is, in your presentation you said that bad debt could rise. It's already gone and your non-performing loan ratio is now in 2%. Where do see the, say, end of the year given that there is some uncertainty about the second half of the year. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Sok Hui, would you like to address the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our loan growth grew by 4% during the quarter of which 3% was accounted for by translation effects. So the increase came primarily from Singapore corporate &#x2013; Singapore denominated loans, right which you can see from the results and it is the area that we are comfortable taking additional loan exposure. You notice that outside of Singapore in foreign currency terms actually the loan declined in line with the loan markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the year it was 14%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. But you'll find a lot of the increase has come from Singapore as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are taking more market share in Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Singapore, yes, we have increased market share slightly over the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't make specific forecast, you know that, although you will ask all the time. 34% of our non-performing loans as Sok Hui had indicated are of loans that are still current in both principle and interest. We've always taken a conservative view on how we do our NPLs. We do expect during this time of the credit cycle that you will remain high and because it is a lagging indicator. And we will &#x2013; but we're comfortable with where we are given the state of the economy and the credit &#x2013; state of the credit cycle that we are in right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow up question. There is a lot of talks about re-issues and bank issues, what's &#x2013; I mean based on your loan portfolio and dealings with customers, do you see any signs of a recovery or any bottoming up in the economies of Singapore and Hong Kong where you operate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; the &#x2013; especially in the export-related markets, there's been a dramatic decline over the last two quarters. This is in reaction to the dropping consumption in the U.S and the West. What we see in many of our customers is that therein the deterioration has stopped getting worse. So we're at a &#x2013; I feel that we're at a bottom and there are some signs that inventories haven't been depleted significantly over the last six months, that there is some pickup in orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So many questions from this side. <mark type="Inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm <mark type="inaudible" />. I have got a few questions. First, your trading income, can you give some color on that, where did that come from and is that just a one offset that you used to repeat in the next quarter or in the next few quarters? And on your net interest margins they &#x2013; they came off, right, this quarter? I thought interest rates fell and that was favorable to you, could you explain why they came off and what's the trend likely to be in the next few quarters. And in terms of your NPL &#x2013; in terms of your non-performing loans, which part of the portfolio seems stressed and which parts are looking good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think three questions there. One on trading income, whether it's one-off and why our &#x2013; second part was why our names came off, and the third part was which part of our NPLs are seeing stress. Sok Hui, would you like to address these questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've communicated that the trading income actually from foreign exchange and interest rates were actually pretty good even across the quarter and fourth quarter last year, but offset by losses we take on our credit activities. In this quarter, we have not had the offset from the credit activities, so the trading income from FX and interest rates trading remains strong. Going forward I think trading income could be volatile, but I think we have a team of traders who have demonstrated that they actually were able to perform well in difficult environments. On the net interest income, we saw a 5 basis points decline from 2.04% to 1.99%. I think that is credible given that the interbank rates have fallen so much. As you are aware, DBS actually has surplus deposit funds that are actually deployed in the interbank market. And the lower interbank environment actually &#x2013; would adversely affect our results. So given that interbank rates have come off to a fairly low point in the first quarter where SIBOR was at 10 to 15 basis points reflects actually a pretty good performance and we're able to offset that effect to better credit spreads and higher loan and deposit volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again just for comparison, interbank rates in Singapore fell off 50 basis points and in the U.S. dollar market almost a 100 basis points. So the fact that NIM fell only 5% basically is what Sok Hui is mentioning a function partially of the widening credit spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the NPLs for this quarter, we continue to see the SME sector, NPL rates continuing to go up but that reflects the SME portfolio in this market. So that is not actually different from the last quarter, we also saw some increases in NPL from the rest of the world, which are larger. But I can say most of them are actually performing and we've been conservative in identifying our non-performing loans early. And 34% of our NPLs are actually current as to interest and principle repayment. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess the current trend in interest rates if you look at SIBOR at 10, 15 basis points actually quite a low point. So if interest rates trend upward actually it will be positive for DBS, in terms &#x2013; for the net interest margins.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Francis from <mark type="inaudible" />. A lot has been said that the first quarter results for most of the local banks even will be very, very <mark type="inaudible" /> especially the first quarter of the year. Are you surprised with the results, are you pleased with it, I mean going forward what do you expect in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well DBS &#x2013; DBS's business has three engines, our Consumer Banking business, our Institutional Banking business, and our trading and market activities. Of course I really rely all three engines be firing at the same time, that's what they did in the first quarter. Going forward we have reason to be reasonably confident but the economic environment, we are not out of the woods yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions? Lisa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first quarter numbers on unemployment have reached a record high and you've said before that it's the unemployment, which will bring in the proof in bad loans so are you beginning to see those sings of weakness and can you tell us is it among your &#x2013; perhaps your mortgage customers of the high &#x2013; the record rate of unemployment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not seeing the effects yet. I think that if we could bring up the slide, I think we do have a slide that shows that our NPL for the consumer sector is still fairly stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think by compare &#x2013; in comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comparison, a 4% unemployment rate in Singapore isn't what I would call by any world standards dramatically high. It's still very, very, given the state of the global economy, I think it is a tremendous achievement that it isn't higher. And in the consumer part of the business we don't see any particular stresses at this point in time. So Sok Hui can explain the slide, it's quite clear out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, look at the housing loan credit quality for Singapore against the 0.11% in the last quarter, we are registering 0.12%. So it's very mild. If you look at Hong Kong for the last quarter it was 0.05%, it's now 0.03%. All right?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That is the credit practice the bank has followed, I think, pretty conservative and prudent &#x2013; are they really conservative and prudent all through the cycle? And I think what you are seeing here is just the outcome of those practices.</p>

          <p>One of the reports speculated that you might be a candidate &#x2013; I would like to ask...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Why would I want to do that if I can be Chairman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any further questions? Going once, going twice, <mark type="inaudible" /> last question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

            <mark type="Inaudible" /> say that you've managed the book very well in the absence of a CEO but that's not the question.</p>

          <p>Let me just say that we have a very good team of very experienced managers across the bank who have worked together for quite a long period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are saying that there was some stress in the SME sector for the NPLs. Of this &#x2013; is that Singapore or Hong Kong or the entire portfolio, that's one question. And then there was some allowances in Hong Kong in the previous quarter the allowances were for private banking declines and SMEs, what was it like in this quarter and is there any signs of that bottoming with the recovery in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the SME portfolio, I would say it's more pronounced in Hong Kong, Hong Kong has a larger SME portfolio compared to Singapore. The private banking NPLs that we are seeing in Hong Kong, I think, we said would have been addressed in the fourth quarter, so you don't see the effects in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Okay. Well on that note then, thank you very much for coming this afternoon. We have some light lunch served outside. So please help yourself. Thank you very much.</p>
