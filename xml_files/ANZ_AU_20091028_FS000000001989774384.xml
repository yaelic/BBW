        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for the announcement of our Full Year Results for 2009. Mike and Peter are going to talk for about 30 minutes, and then we'll hand over to Q&amp;A, and I'll take you through the housekeeping at that point. Welcome to everybody, who's joined us on the phone and on the web.</p>
          <p>I'll hand you over to Mike Smith.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks, Jill, and good morning to everybody here in Sydney and on the web and over the phone. As well as Peter, I have most of the Management Board either here in Sydney or on the phone, to answer any queries you may have about the presentation later.</p>
          <p>I'm going to open with some brief comments on the results, and then look at how we're traveling against the objectives that we set ANZ two years ago. Essentially, there are three messages, which are coming out of these results. The first is that, despite the global financial crisis, we've delivered, I think, a very strong operating result.</p>
          <p>The second is that there's no clear evidence that we've reached the turning point. We've had the drains up on the business over the past two years, and we've made significant progress in addressing the legacy issues like securities lending and the cottage industries, which have developed within the bank. And importantly, in getting on with fixing those issues, we haven't stalled the business or lost momentum. And I think that's evident from the very good performance you'll see from Australia and Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>We also made two major acquisitions, which has seen us add 2 million customers and $8 billion of deposits in Asia. They've established a foundation, I think, for a significant wealth business, and the integration plan for both the RBS and the ING acquisitions are on track.</p>
          <p>We've also launched the global brand. We put a new customer-focused business model and organizational structure in place, and we've invested in renewing our premises from Seoul to Sydney. Not this building, you might note, but a number of the others. And in Australia, we've also maintained the highest level of customer satisfaction of any of the major banks.</p>
          <p>Finally, our capital position means that we are one of the strongest banks in the world with the capacity to take advantage of opportunities to grow either organically or by acquisition. And as you know, we've reached this point by managing our capital position in a disciplined and ordered way over the past two years. I'd also like to reflect that we've achieved all this in a year that just began after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which I think was really close to the high water mark of the global financial crisis.</p>
          <p>It's been a roller coaster ride through frozen credit markets, share market volatility and unprecedented action by governments to save not only the global financial system, but indeed the world economy. It's also been a period in which we've seen over 100 banks go bust and many others now affectively in the hands of their respective governments.</p>
          <p>Now, let me go back to our results and just run you through the numbers. Underlying profit for the year was $3.8 billion, which was up 10%. Taking into account the impact of some of the one-off items and non-continuing businesses, statutory profit decreased 11% to $2.9 billion. We took some pragmatic decisions earlier in the year to conserve capital and bolster the balance sheet, and in line with one of those decisions the final dividend has been reduced by 25%. However, the combination of share price recovery, dividend and share issues means that total shareholder return has been extremely positive this year.</p>
          <p>The underlying business performance is headed exactly in the right direction with income growth of 17%, compared to cost growth of 12% i.e. positive jaws of 5%. The net interest margin increased by 16 basis points, although improvement in asset margins were largely offset by higher funding costs.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits were up 14%. At the business level, Australia was up 13% with both retail and institutional up strongly. Challenging domestic economic conditions in New Zealand saw profits decline by 32% and Asia Pacific profits were up 81%, reflecting strong contributions from our partnerships and the institutional business. And looking at institutional overall, the division delivered an underlying profit which was up 82% on last year.</p>
          <p>A feature of the institutional result was global markets. Their performance was extremely good, but importantly, both customer flow as well as trading revenues were both up strongly. However, in this environment, the most important feature of these results for me is that we are financially very strong. We have a very clear growth strategy. We have a very experienced team of real bankers, which will make sure that we keep hitting our targets and growing the Bank within an acceptable risk profile. In doing so, I believe, we've delivered real value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the next slide, which I know many of you who've seen more than you've heard the Melbourne Cup field, but if we look again at this and see how we're doing against our targets. In November 2007, we set a few immediate priorities over the first one to two years. First, getting the institutional back to system &#x2013; the Institutional Bank.</p>
          <p>Today we're reporting an underlying profit for the Institutional Bank of $1.4 billion, and we have Shayne Elliott leading a relatively new team of world class bankers. Second, we said we had to restore jaws or increase revenues faster than costs. Today, you saw revenues up 17% and costs up 12%. Third, we said we have to make money in Asia. Asia Pacific profits are up 81% and now represent 19% of Group earnings.</p>
          <p>Finally, we said that after we've done that we'd set our sights on not just being the best in Australia and New Zealand or even Asia Pacific, but to be on par with global leaders. And I believe we've already achieved that with our senior management team. At the same time, the new brand and advertising campaign are laying that objective out on the table for everybody at ANZ to work to.</p>
          <p>The next point was being the best of breed for customer experience, and that's what our tag line is all about; living in your world. And obviously, we're pretty well under way on the infill acquisitions in Asia and the acquisitions to address being under weight in key markets like wealth in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>So in closing, let me make two final points. In two weeks' time, we officially open our new group head office in the Docklands area of Melbourne. This is a building that Australia can be proud of. It's build to have the highest environmental rating. It has new technologies that encourage collaboration and reduce costs. And it's a great building to meet and work with our customers.</p>
          <p>The final point is that while we've been reshaping our business, we've also been reshaping our top management team. The latest addition was, of course, Phil Chronican, who will join us next month.</p>
          <p>But we also had Joyce Phillips join us as Head of Strategy, M&amp;A and Marketing, having been with GE and Citigroup in Asia and the US, and Shayne Elliott as Head of Institutional also from Citi and most recently from EFG Hermes.</p>
          <p>So ANZ is at a turning point. We're delivering on our commitment to shareholders. We're delivering real value for our customers, our staff and the communities in which we operate.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand you over to another star, guru with the numbers, Peter Marriott.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mike. I'm not quite sure how to respond to that, but welcome again to everyone here today. As Mike said, I'm going to take you through some more detail in these numbers. And clearly, the starting point is to look at that underlying profit growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>We'll also go into the slide, look at some of the non-core items that meant that the statutory profit was actually down by 11%, but we'll go through that and drill through in even more detail into some of the underlying.</p>
          <p>Cleary, the highlight of the underlying result was that growth in income. As always, the effect of derivatives caused a bit of a distortion between what appears in NII and what appears in trading securities. There's around $524 million of income in NII, which has then come out of other income.</p>
          <p>So if you made that adjustment, you would find that NII is up about 18% and other income is up about 14%. So it's been good growth both in the interest income and in other income.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the highlight of that 17% has been markets, which is up 77% across the year. But even you backed out markets and looked at the businesses excluding markets, there's still been just over 10% growth in income across the Group.</p>
          <p>Cost we'll look at a little bit more detail, but the story is that 35% of that growth in cost has come out of Asia Pacific, no surprise there given the growth story, again with positive jaws. 32% has come out of institutional, reflecting the investment within that business but also remuneration. And the actual, the domestic businesses here within Australia and within New Zealand have had relatively modest growth in cost, 4% for Australia division and 2% for New Zealand. But again, we'll look at that in a little bit more detail.</p>
          <p>Half on half, the underlying PAT is down 2%. I think there's a couple of things to allow for and looking at that. The main one would be to recognize that in the first half, we called out in the analysis that there's around $60 million of derivative mark-to-market gains on hedging customer exposures. Well, surprise, surprise. It reversed in the second half with the reduction in spreads. So swing around about $128 million. And if you adjust for that and you adjust for exchange rates, the underlying profit is actually up by 6% half-on-half. So maintaining the momentum in the second half.</p>
          <p>Credit provisions, again, pretty well in line with I think what you would have been expecting, maybe a little bit lower. I think we said they'd be up by 20% in the second half and they're up by about 13% here. What you'll see though as we go to the detail on that is that there's been more coming out of New Zealand and less coming out of Australia, is a basic theme.</p>
          <p>And you'll also see that from a collective regional point of view, we've maintained that $525 million of add-on, over and above our standard models that we had last year. It's been kept across the year.</p>
          <p>Let's look at &#x2013; some of the non-core items and then move back into talking about the underlying. I think there's no surprises on this page. I don't think anyone will be surprised to see the first line here, recognizing the developments in the quarter in New Zealand. We already had a substantial provision for this matter. We've now topped that up, and you see that there. The impact of that was flagged, I think previously.</p>
          <p>Economic hedging, this is the mark-to-market on some of our funding hedges that are economically effective, but don't meet the strict criteria under IFRS. And you see that last year, we recognized a $243 million mark-to-market gain. And this year, it's a $248 million mark-to-market loss. Literally, the gains that are being recognized post-Lehman with the way spreads blew out and basis risk changed et cetera, up to the end of September. Now the situation is stabilized somewhat, that's been reversed.</p>
          <p>It's purely a timing difference. You will notice in there, for example, that there was just over $1 billion of loss before tax in the second half and that meant that as at March 31, 2009, we had just over $1 billion sitting on our balance sheet as mark-to-market value, which really just said that the funding swaps and structures that we've put in place at that time, that the spreads at that time were economically worth much more compared to current prices, and that has obviously unwound significantly in the second half, so that there now is very little in the way of mark-to-market gain left on the balance sheet on those items.</p>
          <p>Looking into the items below the cash profit line, first of all, you might notice that, in fact, our cash profit growth is actually higher than the underlying. With all debates around what you include, where do you include, what and where, ended up, the cash profit number is actually slightly higher than the underlying profit. A further example of that, the One ANZ restructure line there, is the realigning the organization to a new customer model, was a very significant change for the organization. Again, I know there is some debate as to whether that should be included above the line or below the line.</p>
          <p>But if you took the restructuring cost that we had below the line this year and the restructuring cost we had below the line last year and put them both above the line, yes, you'll find that our cost growth would have been 10.4%. So it actually would have resulted in a lower year-on-year cost. But that was a clear &#x2013; very much a one-off item in making that restructure.</p>
          <p>Credit intermediation trades, again a reversal consistent with what we saw up on the economic hedging with spreads coming down, a reversal of some of the gains up there. There's been a reversal of the losses on the credit intermediation trades. So that year-to-date, the loss is only $69 million. And that was a result of the mark-to-market on the sole protection contracts reducing from what was $3.2 billion at the end of March to only $1 billion at the end of September, so a significant turnaround with the reductions in the spreads.</p>
          <p>Let's go back and look at the underlying result again and go through some of the observations around the result. I think Mike spoke about the profit after tax, let's look at the profit before tax for each of these divisions for a few moments.</p>
          <p>You see Australia overall is up by 18 and in fact when you drill down to that, there was some very good performances across most of the businesses. Australian retail was up by 17% in profit before provisions, Australian commercial up by 17%, institutional up by 21%. And what then brings the average back down again is that the wealth business was down by 59% reflecting the tough equity markets changing level of inflows and also of course the lower equity markets meaning less fees and less capital investment earnings. So again all the businesses in Australia say for the wealth side of the business had very strong results.</p>
          <p>Likewise in Asia Pacific, you will see that there is 77% growth in the income from partnerships, 77% growth in income from institutional and so all those parts of the business were doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is a bit more of a mixed story. Overall 5%, hence the institutional business was up 46%, did very strong markets business over in New Zealand, they did very well, but the retail business was down 14 and the commercial business was down 1% resulting in the overall average there of five and then of course on the back of that that relatively weak PBP growth. We've had a significant increase in the level of provisions almost tripling across the year. We'll talk a little bit more about that in a few slides time that meant that the overall profit was down by 34%.</p>
          <p>In a half-on-half sense, quite a bit of switch around in the portfolio, notably you will see just how strongly Australia geography was in the second half up 36%. The markets business did very well in Australia, you will have noticed in the numbers that markets income in the second half is actually saw the high level was in the first. There was a case of less overseas and more in Australia and Australia did very well particularly on the balance sheet side and we'll talk a little bit more about that later on. And likewise, the Australian division was up with improvements in margins and provisions were actually flat to down; so all of that culminated in a 36% increase in Australia.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific was down, but that reflects the drop in the level of markets income. Remember that the markets income in the first half was exceptional, and that came back a bit and &#x2013; meaning that the profit came down. And if you look at the Asia Pacific's second half profit compared to second half of last year that was still 31% up. So the business is still showing the momentum but clearly the first half was exceptional.</p>
          <p>New Zealand though was tough all around that &#x2013; its PBP, its profit before provisions was down because of less earnings from its markets operations in institutional and continuing margin pressure and that was coupled with credit provisions that nearly doubled partly impacted by a high collective provision that we'll touch on shortly.</p>
          <p>Looking more into the income, clearly, the top right-hand chart is a critical one. You can see this how strong the growth was in the markets income. As Mike said, a core component of that is, is the sales side particularly in Australia and New Zealand and up through Asia but across that the year, if you look at the growth in the income in markets, its around 32% came from sales so that 38% from trading and there was about 30% from the balance sheet and particularly in Australia and New Zealand and that's what drove the stronger income.</p>
          <p>Chart on the left shows that &#x2013; that the even excluding that the markets business, our income growth was up by about 10%. And that was a good result across the businesses in Australia in particular. Let's look a little bit more detail of the other income line and then we will move on look at interest.</p>
          <p>Clearly on this chart, big components coming out of markets, but we've just spoken about those. But looking at the fee line, it was overall flat but that was two stories. The lending fees have been increasing reflecting repricing but the other fees have actually been reduced somewhat and that reflects less earnings out of the wealth business and also less money coming from deal activity, which meant that the non-lending type fees actually contracted slightly and the fees overall were flat.</p>
          <p>Looking at the top bit, the other other, you can see that that's been dominated by growth in the Asian partnerships with that 71% increase that's mentioned there. Now, in that when you're looking through the comments we've in the results there is around $95 million of releases of credit provisions. Those are provisions taken at the time of acquisition and that have been reassessed and released but of course there is $95 million being released here but we've taken up just closed on $1 billion in individual and collective provisions that's a question of what line these things appear on, here it flows through into the partnership line because their equity accounted.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the margin, clearly it has been a strong result for the margin across the year, up by about 16 basis points. And really you can break that down into four components about the same size. Probably, the most important one from your point of view is the ones there shaded in the middle where we've progressively been able to call back some of the higher funding cost and &#x2013; both from deposits and from wholesale funding that have occurred over the last few halves. And been able to progressively reprice more for risk in this current environment. And so it's been a 4.7 basis point improvement there when you look at what's happened to our cost of funding both in deposits and wholesale and other factors.</p>
          <p>The markets business, not surprisingly with their strong balance sheet outcomes are up by &#x2013; had affect on the margin at least of 5 basis points. And then the fact we have more equity so the equity raisings adds about 4.5 basis points. And then finally on the extreme left-hand side of that waterfall chart of course is the normal accounting noise and there was a little bit of funding mix which affected the margin.</p>
          <p>I think that the chart on the right-hand side that was interesting to see what really happened here is that the margin was put under pressure by higher funding cost and now we're trying to call that back through recovering the higher funding cost and also some element of repricing for risk. But if you overlay provisions on top of that you can see that margin is still down.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the balance sheet, interesting set of numbers here. First of all, very strong customer deposit growth. You've seen all of our businesses with exception of New Zealand, has been good growth in deposits. In general, the system within New Zealand has been pretty flat.</p>
          <p>You can see, particularly the Asia Pacific pushed customer deposits up by 35%, Institutional by 23 and then they've got 16% growth here in the Australian businesses.</p>
          <p>On the lending side that was a bit of a mixed story. Overall, lending is flat. And what that has meant, it means, there has been 10% growth in mortgages here in Australia flat on the commercial lending in Australia leading to overall 7%, New Zealand as I said earlier has been flat overall.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific shrunk a little bit, that might surprise you, but at the beginning of the year recognizing the additional stresses in the economy, the business focused on exiting some of the higher risk lending within that portfolio, and that meant the lending is down year-on-year and then a very significant contraction in the Institutional lending of 18%.</p>
          <p>And that's why we've shown you that chart on the right hand side to remind you that in the Institutional portfolio there was this explosion of lending just leading up in the early days of the financial crisis, while the customer is drawing down on lines, building up their liquidity. And so we had that period of time, there was 29% growth in institutional lending, all at extremely low margins. And now we're getting back to what is actually a more sustainable level of lending with a lot of that low margin type business now unwinding of the back of, of course, record equity raisings, and &#x2013; topping corporate Australia, in particular, degearing.</p>
          <p>Looking now on costs, this is consistent with what I said in the summary slide earlier on. You run your eye down that cost growth column, and perhaps starting towards the bottom. So in New Zealand, the New Zealand domestic businesses, 2%. Australia division here, 4%. All of our businesses had had positive draws with the exception of New Zealand. New Zealand was more of an income issue than a cost issue.</p>
          <p>And then I'm sure you're not at all surprised by the continuing growth in Asia Pacific. And that's &#x2013; again, they've been able to have that 30% cost growth, maintain the positive draws and they've been investing in the franchise.</p>
          <p>Institutional is a mixture of, both, building the franchise, a lot of investment in infrastructure improvement and systems and so forth. But also, as I'm sure it doesn't surprise you, is increases in remuneration as well, recognizing the strong income outcome.</p>
          <p>Then, at the centre there were some transformation projects. Now, for example, in the second half there was around $50 million of restructuring that was absorbed centrally.</p>
          <p>Looking at those provisions, across the year it's interesting to note, that of our overall growth in provisions, 46% came from New Zealand. And that's against the profit before provisions; where only 18% of our profit before provisions is from New Zealand. So New Zealand clearly had a disproportionate growth in provisions.</p>
          <p>The good news story though, is you can see some evidence of the situation now starting to flatten out and maybe trend downwards here in Australia. And it continues to be fairly stable in the offshore markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at that growth in New Zealand, if you see particularly in the second half, a few observations, I think, are appropriate there. First of all, if you look at the provisions we have taken up this year, outside of unsecured to consumer credit, thinking everything else, more which is kind of commercial lending, et cetera &#x2013; our write-offs are only one-third of the amount of the individual provisions. So this is largely provisions recognizing current property prices, and has not resulted in significant actual losses at this point.</p>
          <p>Likewise, recognizing the economic conditions in New Zealand &#x2013; in an attempt to in part, perhaps get ahead of this increase in individual provisions, we have taken up an additional $124 million in collective provision here. We'll see a chart later on &#x2013; there's potentially less collective provision required here in Australia now that the situation seems perhaps to be stabilizing, but more required in New Zealand given this increase there. And even though the New Zealand economy is perhaps showing some, well &#x2013; positive signs, this still has to work its way through and that's why we've increased the level of collective provisions.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, looking at the individual provision charge, the trend is, I think, very much what we said we expected it to be. The level of provisions coming out of large institutional names is dropping down. But what we're seeing though is more coming out of the commercial, a little more than likewise out of consumer in the mix. So this is happening very much in line, I think, with what we had said it would do on the individual provision line.</p>
          <p>Looking at that collective provision, first of all, observation from the left-hand side that overall our collective provision balance of $3 billion is now 1.3, 1% of risk-weighted assets. So significantly strengthened since the end of the March half.</p>
          <p>And also, then when you look at the chart on the right hand side, you'll remember in 2008 we took up $525 million of economic cycle and concentration provision. Essentially, that $525 million of economic cycle and concentration provision over and above our normal model, are reflecting the unique conditions that we're in, that money's still in place. Where it's actually held is now changed slightly. There's less in Australia and more in New Zealand. But we've not released net-net any of that overlay, if you like, over and above our standard model.</p>
          <p>The charge for the current year though, doesn't have any volume component to it. Again, that's not surprising given that lending is being flat. And probably a little bit more in the way of risk component than last year. But overall you can say they're at $242 million.</p>
          <p>Looking up on our impaired loans, the level of non-performing loans. The growth in it slowed in the second half to be up by 23%. Once again, you can see that the story is, that the mix is changing. The large-end institutional has basically stabilized now, there has been nothing new &#x2013; sorry, nothing in the way of new names in that top-end of town emerging in there, some additional provisions have been required from the existing names, but there's not been the sort of new large names emerge, but we're seeing more come through in that commercial space, and secure the Australia-New Zealand exposures. And that's what's driven the increase.</p>
          <p>Overall, still, though, we have 59% of our non-performing loans out of institutional, but now New Zealand has crept up to be 22%. So New Zealand is the one that's been growing.</p>
          <p>Perhaps in terms of some positive emerging signs, but perhaps too early to call definitively. But in the bottom right-hand corner you can see that throughout most parts of the business in the consumer side, there's actually been a slowdown in the level of arrears in Australia and in New Zealand. Your eye might be attracted to that growth on the Australian mortgages, but that was about 41 basis points at the end of September. It looks like it's going to be closer to about 38 at the end of October. So, again the trend there.</p>
          <p>And what we're finding here in the Australian mortgages is the level of 30 and 60 days are coming down, and so that's finding its way through as well. So perhaps some signs of the consumer credit side starting to show some stabilization and improvement.</p>
          <p>Looking at the capital ratio, as Mike said before, clearly this is a very strong capital ratio on FSA basis. Even including the capital required for RBS and the ING acquisitions, we're just short of 12%. And probably the part in there that is a little bit bigger than what you expect or bigger in the sense of a bigger reduction, a bigger impact positive for the capital ratio, is there are lot of risk-weighted assets. So you can see there that we picked up 54 basis points in Tier 1 from risk-weighted assets that ended up being lower at the end of the year than what they were at the beginning.</p>
          <p>And when you go through that, the first component is all around the portfolio and the mix. We're seeing that overall lending was flat. But what is underneath that, of course, has been growth in mortgages in Australia and reduction in institutional lending. And of course, mortgages in Australia have a very low risk-weighting and institutional lending is much higher.</p>
          <p>So even though the balance sheet has been flat, the portfolio mix effects have been a reduction. And there's also been a run down of undrawn lines as well, not surprising though, as you tighten up in some of your facilities.</p>
          <p>So all-out that affects about just on 5%. The risk migration has been an effect of around about 4%. And in that number we have included both the risk-weighted asset movement because of risk migration and also the eligible provisions versus Basel II expected loss and growth as well. So being put together, because different products will appear in different components within the Basel II calculation.</p>
          <p>So that meant the risk-weighted assets went up by about, equivalent of 4%. And then as a result of us going around reviewing all of our portfolios, tightening up on the application of the Basel II rules. Cleaning up some of the data to make sure that all facilities were correctly classified as whether they are property exposures or not specialized property exposures. Whether all of their committed lines were committed or not committed. And it was being quite an extensive exercise over the last 12 months, that was the equivalent of adding a 6% reduction in risk-weighted assets from that.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the next question becomes what does all this mean for 2010 and a few observations. Obviously going into 2010 is, as always a number of tailwinds and headwinds and I thought we would just reflect on this. Because it's a particularly complex set and hard to judge overall whether these will fall. From a margin point of view and the top chart is margin excluding markets, because an obvious question will be that, there was a 5 basis points impact on the margin from markets. And let's look at that in the context of markets income rather than margin per se. And it's clearly a positive momentum there on the margin.</p>
          <p>Hopefully within New Zealand as well we'll start to see the effect of the mortgage portfolio, there repricing. You know how the New Zealand business has been impacted by its funding repricing, but then taking two years to reprice these mortgages. And hopefully we'll start to see a turnaround in that taking place for the first time in the first half. But here within Australia this is obviously the dynamic of BBSW drifting up, puts into &#x2013; how quickly can we increase mortgage rates in light of that.</p>
          <p>From the overall balance sheet momentum, you can see that actually our average interest earning assets is slightly higher in the period. That reflects the reduction in the institutional lending that took place in the second half. On the positive side though, our level of end of period customer deposits is much higher than the average, which should provide some benefit.</p>
          <p>Markets, clearly by any measure 2009 was exceptional. But let's not forget that a lot has been done within that business. Increasing the sales force, building the infrastructure, building the presence up through Asia and strengthening it within Australia and New Zealand. So it is a much stronger and a much larger business today than what it was in 2008. But nonetheless, clearly the high volatility, the broadening of spreads et cetera that occurred during 2009 provided some degree of exceptional boost.</p>
          <p>Top chart, provisioning. I think, if I were seen, make my comments to Bloomberg this morning that credit provision is clearly stabilizing. Perhaps similar levels in the first half of 2010 and then may be lower in the second half of 2010. Obviously, depending upon what happens within the Australia and New Zealand economies in particular. But certainly some signs that the credit provisioning charge is stabilizing.</p>
          <p>On the cost front, remember we have in place through Asia, the institutional businesses and also in Australia and New Zealand, quite significant programs of investing and strengthening the franchise. We're committed to those. They will continue. We will continue to have reasonable levels of investment in that, which will mean that cost growth will continue to be perhaps above our peers because of that.</p>
          <p>Then finally the Australian dollar. And just to show just how quickly things change, of course, you've seen that Australian dollar is trading at 89. 89 with change rather than 91 that was last night when we completed this slide. But nonetheless, this year 19% of our profits came from outside of Australia or New Zealand.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is essentially hedged; everywhere else in the world is un-hedged. So depending on what the Australian dollar does, 19% profits will be impacted by that translation. And it's obviously something that you cannot reliably predict. So a few clear tailwinds and headwinds in what would be quite a complex set of dynamics that will affect 2010. With that I will pass it back to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Many thanks, Peter. Let me just take a few words to talk about the global economy. And I think really the key word looking ahead is going to be volatility. The global economy particularly in Europe and the United States is still in a very sensitive position. And there's going to be both good news and bad news in between a very slow advance forward.</p>
          <p>And I think whilst we are through the worst of the financial crisis, the reality is that the world needs the US economy to start moving again. Overall the economic slowdown is continuing to play out very much as we expected.</p>
          <p>In this phase we've seen the bad debts emerge from the highly leveraged companies, more recently from the commercial sector and higher risk personal customers. We expect this will continue into 2010. However I think given the resilience of the Australian economy, we believe that credit quality as you've heard already is stabilizing.</p>
          <p>But I think despite many people in Australia wondering what all the fuss is about. I think it's prudent to be cautious. The global economy is still facing many difficulties and Australia, the economy is still fragile. We are still very dependent on what is happening in the rest of the world. In New Zealand, the worst is over, but it's &#x2013; I think it's now going to suffer what I called the pig in the python effect.</p>
          <p>Basically, the problems have just got to work themselves through the system. We've got a great franchise in New Zealand, but I would observe that banks in New Zealand seem to be doing their very best to price themselves out of business.</p>
          <p>And the regulatory environment seems increasingly intent on finishing the job. So I do hope that things will improve there. And in this context, I think it's worth remembering that healthy, profitable banks are in New Zealand's national interest.</p>
          <p>We remain very bullish on Asia. Particularly China and India. And the connections in the region are becoming increasingly critical as we can see from trade and investment flows. The bottom line is that the world remains very dependent on Asia. And the dependence is going to increase as economies wean themselves off the various government stimulus packages.</p>
          <p>Well at ANZ, we're also facing a number of specific headwinds in 2010. As you heard from Peter, including the strength of the Aussie dollar and a less favorable markets environment. I believe that our super regional strategy and our ability to meet milestones mean that &#x2013; I'm confident we can continue to deliver in 2010.</p>
          <p>With that I'll be very happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Just wanted to get a bit of an idea just on the trading incomes side or the market income. Now that you've obviously got Asia floating around in there, I'm just wondering what you guys consider to be a more normalized level? Obviously you've had two halves of very good numbers, when do you think the business will start to settle on to the new structure that you've got? And Peter, just if you could actually split out in the margin half-on-half how much actually the margin was generated from markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, James, the point is that the hub and spoke model that we've put in place for markets and indeed for the whole of the institutional banks throughout the region, means that we are producing far more customer flow off the back of that linkage. That in itself than creates its own intelligence to help us with the trading business. So whilst I think 2009 was a rather remarkable year in terms of its volatility, I actually feel that probably 2010 is not going to be too dissimilar. It may not be quite as extreme, but I think there'll still be quite a lot of opportunity. And it shouldn't mean that we actually reduce significantly. However it's a very difficult one to read.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think part of the question and remember we said for the full year there was 5 basis points impact on the margin from markets. It's 8.2 basis points, sorry, 8.4 basis points for the second half, so balance sheet impact was more positive in the second half.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's two components. The $524 million was this effect of where the markets income appears in NII, where it appears in trading income. And it's largely driven by &#x2013; the principle driver in fact, is the currency swaps that we've done, which have got settlement right agreements attached to them. Which means you actually settle, particularly do margin calls on them. And this year we received a lot of money from those and in the second half we actually paid money away. So year-on-year it's $524 million benefit. In the second half it's a $124 million cost, again that's set out in results announcement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin, RBS. Question for you Peter also Mike. Go back to the first half result, I was quite pretty critical at the time of your reduction in your collective provision to credit risk-weighted assets and releasing some of that provision. And your defense of that at time was that you thought 106 basis points was appropriate. I look now and you've increased the collective provision to credit risk-weighted assets to 131 basis points. Would you think that the environment from an outlook perspective is better than what it was back at the first half result? So I'm just -want to understand the rationale of and whether that increase of $341 million in the second half really is something that will quickly just roll off into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, what happened in the first half was an adjustment if you remember from collective, to individual provision. And I think that that was the important point. I think the point I made to you was, you don't need to look at just the collective provision number, you've got to look at the total amount in comparison to the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>What happened there was that we had some numbers in the collective provision, which in the first half had to be put into the individual provision. What we've done now, is again, think through what is a sensible number here, what would make sense for us moving forward. It's a hard one to judge but again, there is a fair amount of regulatory pressure that &#x2013; and an anticipation that there could well be an increase in the amount of collective provision required. So I think we put ourselves in a good position. If you want to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd add couple of comments to that. Jarrod, remember our risk-weighted assets actually gone down by 10% half-on-half. So we've increased collective provision balance so the denominator's gone down. Secondly, I think as is evident from the individual provisions in the second half, New Zealand that forced us to do a reassessment and to say it's appropriate to have more. Clearly, the level of collective provision coverage in New Zealand needed to go up and is one of the factors, which is behind. And so one, the balance sheet contracting a little. And then two, the less favorable outlook in New Zealand has led to saying that look we think now 131 basis points is the appropriate level of the collective provision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jon Mott from UBS. Just a question on the capital ratio and two years ago when you arrived, since that time you've increased provisions and capital materially. And you've got to say you called it pretty well, the economy deteriorating. But as we look today, the economy domestically and probably less so in New Zealand, but Asia and Australia are looking a lot better than we thought. 9.5% Tier 1 after these acquisitions is pretty high, and it does have an implication on your return on equity. How much longer are you prepared, to say, remain cautious, keep a high Tier 1 before you do want to start reducing that capital either by deploying it or by eventually releasing some of that capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very happy to deploy it. Basically, we have the capability to grow the balance sheet now either organically or through acquisition and we will look for opportunities. I mean, I think the opportunities that we've taken so far have been somewhat unique off the back of</p>
          <p>the global financial crisis, we have been able to purchase two or do two deals at the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>I think the global financial crisis is going to create two or three other seismic shocks to the banking system in Europe and US. You've seen the announcement with ING earlier this week, and the European regulators really insisting that things change. And I think there will be further opportunities. So I think we are well placed, we are well placed also to weather any further volatility. I mean we're not out of all this yet. And I think there's a degree of complacency and we shouldn't have that. This is still going to be a very volatile environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with the deployment of capital going forward, you have been prudent in the process you've paid with the two acquisitions today. But if you do want to deploy it in Asia but also rally pretty aggressively, probably coming back in the last couple of days, but have moved up as Asia has performed pretty well out of this. Are you still in a position where you do not want to pay goodwill for acquisitions or are you going to really wait to &#x2013; are you prepared to pay up to get good assets if they do become available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've always been prepared to pay goodwill. I'd rather not. Its just one of those situations that was a great opportunity, but in the end of the day an acquisition's got to</p>
          <p>to work for you. It's got to make sense. And we're quite prepared to wait and watch what happens so I think we're very well placed.</p>
          <p>The other issue there of course is the regulatory environment. We don't know where that's going. We said that our range is 7.5 to 8% and we still stick to that. But I can guarantee you that regulators will not say that we need less capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I am a dad of three children after all. But you've elected to join one of your peers in calling out that it's your intention to maintain mortgage price increases with cash rate moments. Does this reflect the fact that you expect the weighted average cost of funds to start to migrate down or alternately has the government now convinced the banks in someway that this is now a sensible business practice? And does this stance remain intact if APRA gets its way with the essence of its proposed liquidity rules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I said, and I think if you read my quote, which I think there's a degree of poetic license has been taken with particularly with some radio programs. But what I said is that I would be reluctant right now to move beyond an official rate increase because I actually believe the rate increase is probably a little soon and I feel that it would have been better to have waited until after the Christmas period to adjust official rates. But then again the Reserve Bank has better information on the situation than I do.</p>
          <p>However, in terms of looking at our credit portfolio, I don't want to increase provisions. Every dollar of provisions that we put on our books means that we have to write 10 new deals to pay for it and therefore provision management is critical. And if we can keep that stress out of the book for a little longer I think that the benefit will pay back.</p>
          <p>So no, there is no adjustment to funding cost. That continues to increase. So it's a balancing act. And as I said I didn't say I wouldn't do it, I just said I'd be reluctant to do it. That's a very clear distinction I think.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh on APRA, yeah, we are negotiating with APRA. We though the ABA we are putting our position forward. I think the problem that has arisen here is that regulation or increased regulation has been &#x2013; people have been quick to jump on that bandwagon.</p>
          <p>What has happened in the US and the UK is not necessarily indicative of what has happened here. I think there is a real danger of fixing something that's not broken and I think we need to be careful and we have to &#x2013; we have to say our piece in this. But there isn't one size fits all. Something like the leverage ratio I think is a clear point of comparison. I mean I can understand why you would a need leverage or &#x2013; to look for a leverage ratio of a bank like UBS, for example, but would ANZ or Westpac fall into that. And you know what, not really, it's different &#x2013; it's a different portfolio, totally different make up.</p>
          <p>So I think we have to continue to talk to Opera. But I think as I say, I think they're going to be careful not to fix what's not broken.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs JBWere &#x2013; sort of back here, right? And just a question on &#x2013; just &#x2013; when you look at the &#x2013; I know you commented on global outlook and how there are still some sensitivities there. Pete when you look at unemployment are you expecting that to get to 8% and when six months ago here in Australia and it's not only looking like you've forecast have come back quite significantly. And in that context, when you took those collective overlays and those economic overlays, the assumptions &#x2013; underlying assumptions around that, the risk setting in general business book and the growth in the portfolio, a lot of those. And last thing, the default assumptions that you would have made on other provisions already taken for specific issues. How conservative &#x2013; overly conservative with those settings and what are you expecting the impact to be on your provisions write-backs going-forward and also in terms of the growth of your business book, if you were to conservative on your risk settings around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; I think memories are very short. If we think back six months ago as to what the world was looking like, and as to where the banking environment was likely to go, it's like sticking your finger in the air and testing for the wind, wasn't it? I mean, nobody had any idea. I mean, really it was all about survival at that time and I think the question was more about who was going to make it and who wasn't.</p>
          <p>I think we've been incredibly fortunate in Australia to be able to weather that situation better than most and I think that that has been due to the fact that we've been quite conservative. And I believe we still need to be so. As I said earlier I don't think we're out of this yet and I think that we need to be cognizant of the fact that Australia still is very dependant on where the world economy goes. And West Asia was a critical part of all of this. Asia was also dependant on the rest of the world too. And so I feel that, whilst we maybe accused of being conservative, I can sleep at night with that criticism, if it is one. But there'll be those who say and I think that is for the best.</p>

          <p>Hi. Tom Quarmby from Macquarie. And could you talk a bit to the movement in restructured loan balances I think up to almost 700 million in the second half. And just to go back a step there was I think about 800 million restructured loans at the end of the last year. Where did they migrate to?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of write-off trends as well, obviously accelerated write-offs of impaired assets quite aggressively in the second half. Is that something that we're going to continue to see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking in terms of the restructured loans that are in the portfolio at the moment, there's four or five of them. They are classified as restructured under the rules because we have given the customers some concession and in particular this is a concession around the time at which they need to repay, standstill arrangements and restructuring the repayment arrangements. They are well secured and we still expect to recover all of our principle and our interest but nonetheless because we've given them &#x2013; we've restructured them and given them a concession on when they need to repay their money, they need to be classified as restructured. Otherwise, they would be regarded as productive accounts because we do expect to get our money back on them.</p>
          <p>In the case of the one restructured item at 30 September last year, I think everyone has worked out what that one was, and clearly, that was one that was in a very sensitive position and it was a &#x2013; very sensitive negotiations that were going on and it wasn't appropriate to put it as being non-accrual because there were still prospects of recovery. Subsequently, things developed and it was downgraded and provision was taken as you saw in the first half. But I think a different set of circumstances around that one for the reasons you'll speculate about than the circumstances around the ones which have been restructured at that moment.</p>

          <p>There was a write-offs question to Peter...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Yeah, write-offs in the second half were higher in the institutional book. And that was driven by &#x2013; in particular, and I think we've flagged this to a number of you in the discussions around the half that one of the things you need to manage from your capital ratio point of view is of course your deferred tax asset deduction. And that is about making sure that you are managing and doing &#x2013; avoiding carrying individual provision balances that you don't need to because it's better to &#x2013; where it's allowed, but from a tax point of view to say that you've now got a write-off from that account that you don't have prospects of recovery to write it off, get the tax deduction in the current year and avoid carrying it forward as a future tax asset for the deduction, which then becomes a capital deduction.</p>
          <p>So we consciously went through the institutional book and made sure that all accounts that were appropriate to have write-offs from a tax point of view had been written down and that took place in Q3 as part of our capital planning for the year. But, of course, along the way, the Australian dollar through the roof and derivative cash flows turned around the other way and didn't become an issue anyway. But back in Q3, we were planning to manage that and avoid a further blowout in that deferred tax asset deduction that could otherwise occur.</p>

          <p>Peter, just to confirm something, when you talk about writing off at the point where you don't see a recovery, you're talking very much in an accounting sense, right, rather than an economic sense?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So well my point being that &#x2013; are these genuinely 100% write-offs, and at no point in the future will we see any recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you can never say never, but under the tax law, you have to have reasonable grounds for being &#x2013; saying that the prospects of recovery will lie, and that's actually what would happen. As you look at an account, you've got, cite the number, $100 million provision. So if we might back 30, you may be on this, write off 70 is the sort of thing that you do. You keep, for precisely those sorts of reasons, back some. Hopefully, there will be, always be some level of recovery.</p>

          <p>Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Just following on from Tom's question, the title impaired assets including those restructured assets went up 26% in the September quarter having only increased 7% in the June quarter. But you just commented on the high write-offs in the June quarter which obviously had an influence. But could you comment on the trends for new and increased impaired loans? They are on page 27; 3.3 billion in the first half, 2.8 billion in the second half. Just wondering how that trended quarter-on-quarter in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and that there is a second &#x2013; the level of new impaired loans in the &#x2013; our fourth quarter was not out of step with what was in the third quarter. I think it might have been down just slightly, but I think there were signs emerging that it certainly was down in Australia, but was up in New Zealand which is a pattern that you see happening in here. But certainly as I also said in the presentation, there have been no new large names emerge; and so &#x2013; except those new names emerging tend to be smaller. But on balance, I think the trend is downwards &#x2013; querying New Zealand.</p>
          <p>And of course in terms of that impaired asset number, they restructured items, that was something which was done in the second half. Those accounts were, had their commitments were rescheduled. And as a result, they have to be classified as restructured in Q4.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. I've got to say I find it kind of funny to hear the prospect of write-backs. Peter at this point, when we're sitting here and we're seeing additional provisioning book-to life of bill resources, which at the time was well provisioned as well. But some 20 years later, we're seeing additional provisioning. But what I wanted to ask is there's been a lot of talk today about the first half reduction in the collective provision, second half, big increment to it. But Peter what I noticed is, when you have a look at the capital adequacy in the first half of the year, big increase in the expected loss deduction; second half, very, very small one.</p>
          <p>You've commented today that there was some regulatory pressure to increase the collective provisioning. Shouldn't we be adding the collective provision and the expected loss to really have a look at what the regulators saying your capital position should be? Because it's funny. If you add up all three of them together &#x2013; two of them together, you get a very similar result, half-on-half on-half. Is that the way we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when we presented that waterfall chart at what happened to our capital ratio, you'll also recall on the chart, risk-weighted assets is actually risk-weighted assets and expected loss and they were merged together.</p>
          <p>And what you had &#x2013; happened across the year though is, because there's been reclassification of some loans between whether they were slotted exposure or corporate loan exposures distorted some of the trends. But, no. You definitely have to look at both the Basel II expected loss and the risk-weighted asset numbers together. And that's the way we look at it internally because they're both sources of additional capital requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, is it reasonable to say if this regulatory pressure will increase your collective provision charge, it means we're going to see more of what we would have seen going through the expected loss in the past is going to go through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wouldn't say there is regulatory pressure right now. That's obviously something which is being talked about. There's been no requirement to do anything right now, but it's certainly something under review. But I suspect that that will be the case, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly, what APRA would be looking at would be to say what's the level of collective provision? Does that collective provision satisfy the GRCL requirements under the APRA rules and we believe it does. If they don't think the collective provision is sufficient, then they may require us to put aside some additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to compensate for that.</p>
          <p>But let's face it, our level of collective provisions to risk-weighted assets is probably, it's not the highest, amongst the highest of our peers. So I think it should be in a good position, but that's obviously something that the industry review is taking place on.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's TS from Southern Cross. You've got good growth in Australia. Can we get a feel for where this is coming from on a state-by-state basis? And then a related question, do you still have a tank parked in the Queensland lawn somewhere?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the growth in Australia has been across the piece. And certainly, we've been, I think, very aware that we were somewhat underweight in New South Wales. We were certainly a bit underweight in Queensland and WA. And we have tried to actually increase our presence in those states. However, I think as we move forward, we will be looking at the states and the businesses within the states on a very much more state basis rather than a national basis because I think WA is a very good example. It's almost its own country. And I think the economy there is very, very different from say here or Victoria.</p>
          <p>So yes, I think it &#x2013; I would say there are no standouts there. I mean I think it's pretty consistent across the piece, but we're confident that we have in place now a much better coverage than we perhaps did.</p>

          <p>David O'Halloran, Southern Cross Equities. Talking amongst your customers in the commercial side or institutional side over the past six months, it's interesting that your managers or relationship managers regarded as being oppressive, aggressive and so on. And that's clearly shown by the fact that there's no growth. But it &#x2013; the people I've talked to tell me it's almost like the lights came on at the ANZ at the end of July. So, can you talk a little bit about your commercial book, maybe the last couple of months? And I wouldn't have thought a bank would like a static commercial business, perhaps if you give us a little bit of color on what you're expecting for the coming year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't really understand your comments because &#x2013; and I think that if you've been growing your commercial business in a period of contraction, you'll be &#x2013; you're probably lending to the wrong people. And when you look at our provision numbers and the provision numbers of the other banks, you've got to say there was an awful lot of bad lending done. So I don't make any apology for not growing the commercial business. I think that what has happened is that there has been a lack of demand in the commercial business and I think that's quite natural. Why would you borrow money when you're not &#x2013; when it's very unclear as to where the future is taking you? And I can quite understand that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the repricing, risk has a cost. And we had to reprice our risk to reflect that, as have all the banks. And that is going to continue. I think what has happened is, that people from the middle of this year have started to think that, okay, things are getting better, loan demand is starting to come back. And we've been a very active part of that. But commercial is still a very large part of our business and is an incredibly important part of our business, and we wish to grow it. So &#x2013; but I want to grow good, profitable, safe business and not marginal, dangerous stuff.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jill. Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities. My question, Peter on this capital issue. On slide 41, you've got the &#x2013; there is a portfolio data review that led to $13.7 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets, but that same review seem to later $746 million increase in regulatory expected loss. Can you give us some indication as to how that happens or in particular some examples as to why you have a reduction in modeling, increase in the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Brett, in particular I think it was $595 million of accounts where we transferred them from being corporate loans &#x2013; the classification between the corporate loan was started exposure. This is the issue that Brian was raising before, that you've got to look at both the effect on the risk-weighted assets and also on the relationship between Basel expected loss and the eligible provisions. So here is an example where some changes were made that result in a lower risk-weighted asset but it actually resulted in a higher expected loss deduction. But net, net there was actually a benefit when you put the two factors together, the &#x2013; for that particular account actually overall the capital requirement was lower by making the reclassification. That's why you really got to look at the risk-weighted asset numbers and the expected loss numbers together and not in isolation.</p>

We opened the rural bank in Jianping and Chongqing which I think we were the third foreign bank permitted to open 100% owned rural bank. So I think our China strategy is on schedule. We have submitted an application to local incorporate which will allow us to branch more quickly. That is in the process and I hope we will get the first tacit approval by the end of this year with luck and hopefully we will get the whole thing opened by the Expo of next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of India, that has been more difficult. We have had the license application in there for two years now and we continue to go round and round in circles.

          <p>My question was on the margin outlook for next year and I guess the chart presented on slide 19 paints a pretty bullish picture in terms of momentum. You have flagged some potential recovery in New Zealand next year on repricing and if we look at all the asset repricing it's generally outstripped some of the funding cost and deposit pressures. So I guess I was just interested in firstly, how much upside you see in New Zealand next year and how much upside you see in Group margin potentially next year in light of comments from many of your peers yesterday that they saw margins likely to be more flat going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. My question is about what we use to call the benefit from interest fee and funds so the difference really between the net interest spread and the net interest margin which is on the page 109. I see a movement half-on-half from 38 to 24 basis points so down 14 basis points.</p>
          <p>Really one for Peter Marriot, could you take us through about the dynamics and in that figure and what you expect in an increasing interest rate environment to happen around that particular item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will &#x2013; okay my &#x2013; clearly what's being &#x2013; the reason for that drop-off was a reduction in the average interest rate appliance. An average interest rate on liabilities between the first half and the second half went down from what was 4.94 in the first half to 3.33% in the second half. And that's what's caused that significant swing around in the level of the interest margin. I think probably the best way of looking at that question, I think it came up at the CBI briefing, is around what's happening with things by replicating portfolios and investment of capital, because that's a real driver. This presentation on net interest margin analysis here is &#x2013; it does &#x2013; isn't particularly insightful. I think in the current year, we had around about 15 basis point benefit by having invested our sticky deposits and capital on a rolling average basis rather than at BBSW. And that eroded by about 5 basis points across the year as the average went down. On their current economic predications, it would be about another five would come up next year. If the market implies swap curves which will occur, there would be no impact next year. So, it is also is going to depend upon what does happen with the level of short-term interest rates.</p>
          <p>That's the factor really will affect the margin. It's just what happens with the investment of our capital and the investment of those sticky deposits. If the current market implies, spreads occur, there is no impact. If the market imply spreads actually continue to come down, then 5 basis points, taking the number.</p>

          <p>Michael there is a work through the modeling &#x2013; on that, in fact &#x2013; I think Rick Moscati is in the treasuries in the room in London as in London in Melbourne if he wants to give an answer at what point would he expect the current spreads that weighted average cost of wholesale funding to start to go down again, Rick?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick actually is in the room, so I'm not sure he is on the line somewhere.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It must be obviously be in the room, he obviously isn't.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, I can't give you a precise answer to that question. I'd expect the average to continue to go up for I'd have thought of leasing out another 12 month, 12 to 18 months but it's going to depend on how quickly spreads come back down again because we are still writing new borrowings at a much higher margin than we did before. So, that book is maturing and turning over it will take a while to work through to the point that you start to have the margins going back down again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question from Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. First off we got smoked on the credit intermediation trades. You are confident they are going to come back and that's work, but looking at it from the shareholders perspective I would have thought that the fact that you're punting US$11 billion of credit risk. When do we see you move to close these out and how much would that actually cost? Forget the realized cost because you have to marked-it-to-mark, but how much incrementally so when and how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think I have spoken about this before, Brian, is that I wish I'd never heard of these things and if I could get them off the balance sheet we would. There will come a time when there will be a cost which is acceptable to do that. At the moment the market is still very thin. The liquidity just isn't there but you will probably notice we have actually reduced our exposure slightly. We've done a couple of trades on that. And again, I've got no problem with the long-term issue with this; it's just the volatility through the P&amp;L which is just very irritating. So, when we can we will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I push my luck with one, final one, you asked about the liquidity today, but one of the proposals in the liquidity requirements of APRA, it would restrict banks to be able to invest in each other's paper. And pretend that's high quality liquidity, can you talk to us about what that would mean for ANZ if that was to go through all the Australian banks generally. In terms of your cost of wholesale funding? And could we also get a feeling on the proposed change in liquidity in New Zealand which actually talks about introducing a deposit cap what that would mean for ANZ, because they both going to be very big negatives &#x2013; very unpalatable to talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, both of these are areas which now have currently been in discussions with the regulators. I think the key thing is though that this will affect everyone. So, if it's a negative for us, it's going to be a negative for the whole industry. I don't think we're gong to be affected any more, any less than our peers, and that's why we said before when answering Craig's question that it ultimately become a cost to the system that we will have to be passed on because everyone is gong to be affected by this and you assume that regulators globally will be reassessing liquidity requirements so it becomes a globally the cost of borrowing money goes up because banks have to carry more liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me come back to it. Your cost of funding goes up, I mean it's interesting how you carry more liquidity but I suppose, if I wanted to get a feeling, what do you think that would do to the bank's wholesale cost of funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will increase, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us a quantum of how much it might increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we've done internal models and estimated that's entirely speculative depending upon where the final requirement settles, so any number is totally speculative at this point in time. There is going to be a lot of water power under the bridge here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But I'll get back to the point I made earlier. Brian, it's imperative that APRA think about the systemic impact that they have in imposing these things. And that's why we have to do far more work with them as to what we can do and what we can't do. In the U.K. and the US you got a huge amount of government paper available to you. You don't have that here. There isn't the alternative and whilst you might not think some bank assets are very good quality, some are all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the New Zealand proposed deposit cap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well indeed I mean that's a similar issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think yeah, we're done. Okay. Thank you everybody for listening in today. And if there is any follow-up question by all means give me a call this afternoon. Thanks.</p>
