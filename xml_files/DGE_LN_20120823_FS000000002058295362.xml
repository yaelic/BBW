          <p>Welcome to the Diageo 2012 Preliminary Question-and-Answer session. I will now hand you over to Paul Walsh.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q&amp;A session, following the presentation of our full year results, which no doubt you've just seen. This year we're going to take your questions slightly differently. Here in London, I have Deirdre, Ivan, Andrew and Andy Fennell with me, and our other market presidents will join us over the phone from their respective markets.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd like to turn over to the operator, who will tell you how to go about asking your questions. Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There will now be a brief pause while questions are being registered.</p>
          <p>And our first question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton of Nomura. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Paul. A couple of questions. You talked quite a bit on the webcast earlier on about the growth in scotch. Now I wonder though how you saw the opportunities for that growth almost to accelerate, with particular reference to what might happen in India with tariff reductions and where we are on that?</p>
          <p>And the second question was really sort of focusing on Asia and the opportunity to grow and whether you saw what was going on at APB in Asia as an opportunity or a threat to some of your existing business or agents or is it a way you can actually grow going forward do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask &#x2013; and maybe Gilbert could come on in a moment to talk about APB. I see it as broadly neutral. I don't see it as materially impacting our business one way or the other. But Gilbert will have his own perspective.</p>
          <p>Regarding scotch, as you saw, scotch grew 12%. A main driver of that was Johnnie Walker that grew 15% and I think there is the potential to keep those growth rates going for the foreseeable future. And if you get a material tariff change in India, you probably would see some acceleration. But I think it is premature to call that tariff reduction at this point in time. Discussions continue but as I've said, I'm not expecting any fundamental change in that market in the near term.</p>
          <p>One of the things that gives us great confidence, not only about scotch but also around our presence in these new high growth markets is the sheer number of emerging middle-class consumers that are reaching legal drinking age, that have the awareness of our brands and have the economic wherewithal to access them. So, they are coming to us and that is a wave that is going to continue and we are very well positioned because of the investments we've made, particularly in the last seven years or eight years, to capitalize on that phenomenon.</p>
          <p>So, scotch, confidence on the trends we're seeing at the moment continuing, could accelerate if we saw a material tariff reduction but we're not calling that and could I ask, maybe Gilbert to give us his perspective on APB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Hi, Ian. On APB, as you know, Ian, we have here a long-term relationship with APB and Heineken in Asia and in Southeast Asia specifically across Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. We believe that this consolidation will strengthen the position of both businesses in APB and Heineken in Asia and will be beneficial for Guinness. And we don't see any immediate changes into our business operations. We value the relationship that we have with both Heineken and with APB and we see this as an even bigger opportunity for Guinness in this partnership in the future.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Simon Hales of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple, please, if I can. Firstly, Paul, you talked a lot in your presentation alongside Deirdre with regards to the increase you've seen in route to market and A&amp;P investment in 2012. How should we think about the levels of investments going into 2013? Should we expect similar levels of increases next year in those two core areas?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, perhaps, on North America, can you talk a little bit, perhaps, about what drove the acceleration in the sales growth you saw in the fourth quarter? Was that, perhaps, innovation-led, perhaps, around the pouches innovations that's come into market? Was there any stock build we should be thinking about in relation to that?</p>
          <p>And then, perhaps, as an addendum to that, any recent comments on pricing that you've taken in the U.S. market as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, first of all on North America, I'll ask Larry Schwartz to give us his perspective in a moment. But yes, we have had another very good year on innovation, but singling out the pouch or whatever is relatively small in the overall scheme of things.</p>
          <p>We've had incredible performance of our high-end brands, certainly in North America, but actually across the piece. It's interesting that our reserve brand portfolio has now topped &#xA3;1 billion. &#xA3;1 billion in sales, up 27% in the year we just reported. And actually, that's across the piece. Europe was up 10%. The GB was up actually also 27%. So, there are a number of factors behind our growth. Larry can speak to it specifically in a moment.</p>
          <p>Regarding route to market, it's interesting you posed that question because we continue to invest in strengthening, in deepening our routes to market. And if I can give you an example of how we accomplish a material change in Turkey with the acquisition of Mey I&#xE7;ki, yes, we got a great brand, we also got a great route to market. We did benefit in the first half in Turkey because, of course, we were able to pipeline fill with our existing scotch brands. So, that certainly helped the first half and therefore, first half to second half was affected by that.</p>
          <p>When we acquired Mey I&#xE7;ki, I think our share of scotch in Turkey was in the 20s. By the time we finished this fiscal year, our market share was approaching 60% and it will go higher. That's what you get when you get a strong market &#x2013; a route to market. So, we continue to invest in that.</p>
          <p>Regarding A&amp;P, we'd like the notion of investing modestly ahead of our sales growth with that in investment very much tilted to the high-growth markets where we see the biggest opportunity. So, you can expect that to continue, but not at the expense of margin expansion. Larry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Paul. Thanks, Simon. Just in terms of the performance in the fourth quarter, there was no real material difference in our business from the first half to the second half. It was pretty steady. Yes, I think the pouches added a little &#x2013; all of a sudden we have a $30 million business that we didn't have. We sold every pouch that we could make, but all the brands seem to be performing well from the first half to the second half. And there was no material stock build. As a matter of fact, we actually reduced inventory on wine and spirits.</p>
          <p>In terms of route to market changes, as I said before, this only upside to our route to market change is in the U.S. So I'm pleased with the changes we've made. We have a single point of contact across states with each of our major distributors and at the end of the day we've got more financial resources and more human resources. So, we have about 20% more distributor resources dedicated to our business than we did last year and we will continue to refine it in fiscal 2013 with more financial resources and manpower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say though that we are encouraged by the trends in North America. The categories are healthy and as you can see versus category growth, our sales growth in North America is attractive. So we are gaining a bit of share on the back of that.</p>
          <p>You're also seeing the more premium brands perform better. So we have a good mix story there and we certainly don't see any sign that that's changing. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Philip Morrisey of Berenberg. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you. Could I ask on Asia? It looks like Q4 organic net sales growth was about flat and I just wondered what was behind that? Were there some technical effects?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you referred to increasingly challenging trading in Southern Europe. I appreciate, obviously, that's rather small part of your business now, but I wondered again, if you could elaborate on most recent trends that you've seen there?</p>
          <p>And finally, please, on the U.S. markets, you've obviously referenced second half recovery and I wondered, in effect, what's been happening within the U.S. on-premise business, whether that was also a part of the second half improvements that you've seen and also your most recent reading of those trends within the on-premise has there been any softening at all? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe Ivan you can answer the question on on-premise in North America. Andrew, you can address the whole issue in Southern Europe. Regarding Asia, and Gilbert, I'll hand over to you in a moment.</p>
          <p>There definitely was a technical change. We changed our route to market in Southeast Asia in the second half. That definitely had an impact, and we do not see any fundamental change to the underlying trends. So that was indeed a technical change.</p>
          <p>Gilbert, do you want to say more about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul. Hi, Philip. Philip, for us in Asia Pacific, Q4 was a tale of two parts. In developed Asia, we saw an NSV decline of 10% in the quarter, while in emerging Asia, we saw a double-digit NSV growth. Easter phasing into Q3 in Australia made Q4 weak for us in developed Asia. The good news in Australia throughout F 2012 we gained share. Our spirits business is up 7% and Q1 F 2013 started strongly in Australia which gives us higher confidence about our ability to deliver a better performance in Australia in F 2013.</p>
          <p>On emerging Asia, Paul touched about it. The route to market changes in Southeast Asia and the destocks in the Middle East impacted by the price increase impacted the quarter. However, our underlying momentum in Q4 in emerging Asia remained strong at 15% and we see emerging Asia resilient coming into F 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilbert. Andrew, Southern Europe and the Ivan you can talk on-premise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're still obviously seeing difficult conditions in Southern Europe and what that means mostly for us is we're taking a very conservative commercial position both in terms of debtors and trade stocks. That's been most significant increase in this just past financial year where we're down over 20% on sales. About half of that has been taking stock out of the trade and the other half is consumption drop less of an impact in Spain, whereas 7% decline is closer to the consumption trend right now.</p>
          <p>The point you made, Philip, is the important one is that the whole of Southern Europe is now less than 5% of Diageo sales. We'll continue to be conservative in our trading policy in Southern Europe. The good news is there is growth in Europe. There are pockets of growth and our job is to kind of mind them and so Germany, we were up 18%. Russia, we're up 23%.</p>
          <p>Some of our categories in Western Europe without taking into account Russia, Eastern Europe and Turkey, our reserve business is up 11%. So there's still plenty of areas for us to offset those declines in Southern Europe business and you'll see overall our Europe sales trend is only just below flat. And so, it's a very polarized picture right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Philip. The on-premise is healthy and running strongly, if you look at the last six months in the trends we're currently seeing. In fact, our own on-premise business is growing faster than our off-premise businesses in the most recent months. And I think this, to Paul and Larry's earlier points, I think gives me good confidence on the sustainability of the U.S. spirits market and performance. You look at our brands that are strong in the on-premise, Don Julio, Ketel One, our reserve portfolio, they're all doing very, very well.</p>
          <p>So, we see those trends as all our distributors are seeing stronger strength in the on-premise and the off-premise. And the changes we made in our route to market that Larry talked about, we have significantly stepped up our focus and our execution in the on-premise. And I'm very proud, indeed, of how Diageo is executing in the on-premise in the U.S. right now. Our share of the back bar, our share of menus of cocktails, we are intensely focused into making very good in-roads and you see that in the strength of the brand performance. So, it's healthy and we expect it to continue to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one has to draw reference to C&#xEE;roc in that market as well. It continues to perform incredibly well. We are now emboldened by our U.S. experience to roll it out progressively around the world. But high-end vodka has performed very well for us in the fiscal year we've just reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Can you just comment on other operation costs which I think were down by about 260 basis points in the year, can you give us a bit more detail on that and an idea of how sustainable that might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will hand that one quickly over to Deirdre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you're looking at total other operating costs, it is really the change year-on-year because we have fewer or lower level of exceptional operating costs in 2012 than we did in 2011. That would be the biggest. So, if you look at exceptional operating items in 2011 we had a &#x2013; there was a gain on a change in pension accounting where we're using CPI and RPI which was a gain of &#xA3;115 million that ran through operating exceptional items that had our net exceptional items about, effectively a minus &#xA3;40 million. Whereas last year, where we had some operating model changes and some charges, some other charges, we had a higher level of about &#xA3;150 million. And so the biggest change is going to be effectively what's running through exceptional operating item.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Earlam of UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have a follow-up question on the U.S., please. The organic sales acceleration was very nice in Q4. But I was just wondering about the level of operational leverage for the full year, which was perhaps a little lower than I'd expected. Can you talk us through some of the dynamics in terms of gross margin and marketing to sales in North America? And how we should think about operational leverage potentially accelerating into fiscal 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Melissa, Paul here. I think Ivan and Larry can cover that between themselves. You want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Why don't I start, Larry, and you can jump in. I'd say overall, Melissa, looking forward, we feel very positive and confident about ongoing operating leverage and margin expansion. What you see in the F 2012 numbers had been somewhat impacted by cost of goods and some bulk sales increases that have depressed the operating leverage there. The fundamentals, when you look at price mix and what that's going to deliver, both what it's done in F 2012 and how we feel about the future, when you look at our focus and the programs we have in taking our supply base to the next level, the operations plans we have including the footprint rationalization and world-class manufacturing, we'll get leverage there. And if you look at the overhead base, we're getting considerable leverage.</p>
          <p>So, I'd say the F 2012 numbers you're seeing an operating margin expansion now subdued because of some factors around our supply cost and bulk sales that have depressed it. The underlying fundamentals are healthy and I fully expect F 2013 to have more operating margin expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a critical element is, of course, the price mix. Maybe, Larry you want to speak to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah. I &#x2013; next year, Melissa, we expect to drive gross margin improvement and as well as benefit from cost savings from the changes in our line strategy and lower rum costs from the U.S. VI. So we feel pretty confident that we will get those gains.</p>
          <p>And in terms of pricing, which Paul talked about, so we've already engaged in implementing our price for fiscal 2013. To get a full year, you have to implement at the end of fiscal year 2012. And so we just need to really understand the macroeconomic indicators, employment, consumer confidence, all of the things that you watch. We probably have the same score cards but we're feeling good about being able to take price.</p>
          <p>And as you probably know, we sell at a real premium to our nearest competitors. We just need to keep an eye on that. But we think that our price mix will continue into fiscal 2013.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. Three questions for different regions, I think. Starting with Europe, it looks like Mey I&#xE7;ki margins were down about 400 basis points from when you acquired it. Just wondered whether that was maybe a tactical push behind A&amp;P and what the Turkish business has seen overall in terms of profitability?</p>
          <p>In Africa, for Nick, it looks like Nigeria was flat in the second half broadly speaking. If you could just give a bit more detail on what's happening there that would be useful. And then lastly, back to North America, Crown Royal sort of sticks out within the key brands as being an underperformer and I was just wondering what is planned to turn that business around, that brand around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's take them in reverse order. If I can just give you some sense on Crown Royal, down marginally. Clearly, we were lapping the Crown Royal Black launch last year, so that is partly to do with it. But I do believe there are opportunities for better performance out of that brand as we move into the new fiscal year. So, in part, because we're lapping up a new product launch, but also more to be done there and we still think we've got a great brand with great margin structure.</p>
          <p>Nick, are you available to talk about Nigeria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am indeed. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Yes, Nigeria. We saw the beer market as according to Nielsen down by about 5%, 6% for the second half. That was driven by a number of factors. At the beginning of the year &#x2013; excuse me, at the beginning of the year, the government reduced the fuel subsidy, which resulted in fuel prices being up by some 50-odd percent. And that resulted in about 10 days of stoppage, strikes in the country and that obviously impacted immediately our sales. But beyond that that had a sort of longer-lasting impact on the &#x2013; on consumer demand. And that was on top of in H1, an increase in electricity prices.</p>
          <p>So, the disposable income our consumers have was reduced that lay behind some of the decline in the market and then that was further aggravated by some of the social unrest, disturbances, there were some terrorist activity that in the northern part of the country that certainly reduced consumers going out to the outlets. So, the market was somewhat depressed in H2 but within that, however, overall for the year, we held share and in fact, we gained share modestly on Harp and on Guinness.</p>
          <p>In H1 we actually have &#x2013; at the very end of H1, we finished our investment program, first stage of our investment program so whereas in H1 last year, we were somewhat capacity constrained. As we go into H1 in the subsequent year, we're going to be free of that capacity and therefore, we expect to be able to accelerate our share gains. That said, the market currently has still not fully bounced back but in the medium term, I expect that to occur.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick. Just before I hand over to Andrew to answer the European or Turkish question, just to put in perspective, our total beer business actually grew 5% last year. So we clearly have strong footprints in some of the more challenged beer markets in Europe. But despite that, a very good overall performance of growth of 5%.</p>
          <p>Andrew, Turkey?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, there's no real decline in the margin structure in the Turkish business. What you see there is a result of the integration costs so that the margins on that business underlying are absolutely in line with what we told you when we bought the business. In fact, if you remember, this is actually almost exactly both gross margin and operating margin in line with our total European margins so it's not at all dilutive to the business, which I guess is a bonus in terms of buying a mainstream business in a growth market like that.</p>
          <p>I mean, the other great news, Paul told you about the impact of that business on our international brands. But we've also managed to gain significant share in the Raki category and in the vodka category, which Mey I&#xE7;ki leads in both of those, so our share now is up to about 85% of the Raki category in Turkey. So yeah, no that business is performing absolutely in line with what we've told you when we bought it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Two questions, please. One fairly broad one and one technical one. The broad one &#x2013; Paul, you explained a lot about the multiple moving parts between H1 and H2, which explains sort of the slight slowdown. If you look more broadly, you had to say, well, which of the two halves is representative of the current trajectory, would you choose H1 or H2?</p>
          <p>And second more technical question, Deirdre, when you're talking about FX for next year, you're talking about no material impact. But looking at exchange rates, I would expect some translational pressure from the euro and from emerging market currencies. So, I'm just wondering, is it hedged into 2014 or is it offset by something on transactional FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Trevor. Half one or half two? I would say half one if you then exclude the one-off benefits such as Turkey or half two if you then take the negative impact out. So, basically I would say the full year is probably the best trend to look at.</p>

          <p>On the FX in terms of our &#x2013; looking at next year, we are &#x2013; consider &#x2013; expecting some trans &#x2013; negative translation impact. However, that will be offset by a positive transaction FX because as you know, we hedge ahead and so we're expecting some benefits to flow through on a transaction basis, which effectively offsets the translation impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have a couple of questions. One, I don't know if you care to share anything about any discussions regarding the Cuervo brand? And then secondly, in North America you've had a great year of innovation. How should we think about innovation as it could contribute to results for North America for fiscal 2013?</p>
          <p>And then third, if I could just ask about emerging markets, as we think about your expansion there, will that be more from organic or acquisitions or a combination from both vehicles that we've seen so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask again Larry and Ivan to talk to the North American issue. First of all on emerging markets which I prefer to reference as high growth markets because you look at the level of sophistication in many of these markets and it is of a new order.</p>
          <p>Now, our first priority is always to grow organically. If we see opportunities for acquisition, we'll obviously pursue them with vigor. And what we'd like to see in an acquisition, and Mey I&#xE7;ki in Turkey is a perfect example, is a great brand in a vibrant category providing synergistic opportunities in route to market.</p>
          <p>If we can pick all of those boxes, we know that we have a deal, an opportunity that will create shareholder value. So the first objective is organic growth and it is then very targeted acquisition. Just because we've got a good balance sheet and just because we do want to disproportionately grow our presence in these markets do not &#x2013; does not both mean we will just pursue acquisitions for the sake of it.</p>
          <p>Regarding Cuervo, look, we're a distributor of that brand. I've said many times, we would like to deepen our relationship with the family and have more stake with its success. As you would expect, discussions continue and when we have anything to report, we will.</p>

          <p>Obviously, innovation was a great year this year.

And a lot of our innovation helped &#x2013; is helping us build our base brands. And having a view into our pipeline for the first half, that is looking really well and for the full year. So, we think innovation will continue even though fiscal 2012 was our best year ever in terms of innovation.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three small questions. First about Europe, the beer trends in Europe. First half, you had minus 5% and in the full year, you had minus 3%. So, it seems to be that second half has been quite good despite the, let's say, awful weather conditions in the last quarter. Maybe you can elaborate on the reasons for that if it's only that Red Stripe thing? Second one is the &#x2013; second question on the input prices, you're guiding plus 4% for 2013. Maybe you can elaborate on the most important items in this plus 4%?</p>
          <p>And finally and a very small question, it's about your pouches. What's the current status of the court case of American Beverage's against your pouches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right. I'll ask Andrew to talk about beer in a moment. On input cost, clearly during this past year, we have seen increases in agricultural based inputs. However, maybe some of the most recent spikes will not affect in the year ahead because we are hedged to a large extent. Also, always bear in mind that for spirits, that component of the cost of goods is relatively small; and therefore I believe very, very manageable.</p>
          <p>The other big component is, of course, glass and flexible packaging. That's what makes up the percentage figure that you've talked about. But I am whilst mindful of a bit of a headwind around input cost, it isn't an issue that gives me undue concern. Andrew, on beer?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Gerard, you answered your own question. There's no significant movement in H1 to H2 in our beer business, other than bringing the Red Stripe business in house. So, our more mainstream Guinness business for instance has not &#x2013; there's no big movement in the trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions, please. One on emerging markets; one on Europe. Now, on emerging markets, you've delivered some extraordinary margin expansion, particularly in the second half. Now, clearly you're getting the benefits from pricing, mix, scale, but you had flagged for this year limited leverage in Latin America. And I think, Gilbert, on a recent call you had suggested that probably margin expansion in Asia would be more muted in the second half. So I was wondering what has changed, generally, in the margins here across emerging markets, whether they're only one-offs? And what should we expect for 2013?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Europe, I think, Deirdre, in the presentation webcast, Deirdre, you said that you'd expect Europe to slow &#x2013; top line to slow in 2013, if I understood correctly. So I was wondering what is driving this? Whether it's a further deterioration in Southern Europe or a slowdown in some of the parts that are currently growing nicely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I ask Deirdre to comment on both the margin issue in the emerging markets generally and that may give an opportunity for Gilbert and Randy to offer more in market color and also talk to European.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think generally speaking, as we've said, we are looking to be able to expand our margins in all of our markets. In the emerging markets, of course, we're looking at premiumisation and as we gain scale to be able to get those scale benefits coming through off the cost base.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, in fact, there was not a significant expansion. You'll see at the back-end of the presentation where we show, there were some FX that we hold in corporate, which is allocated back to Latin America. The margin expansion was about 12 basis points. It was pretty much what we expected. We did have good margin expansion in Asia. Gilbert may want to comment specifically on the H1, H2 but I would say that we had strong margin expansion in Asia and we did expect to have that. We have a premiumisation strategy in Asia and we are looking to expand that.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to the comments that I made in the presentation on Europe, I think what I said was it's difficult to predict the trends in Europe right now, but we expect that it may well be more difficult. And that's really not so much about our underlying trading but about the macroeconomic environment. As things continued to be quite difficult in Southern Europe, there is credit tightening in Spain. It continues to be very difficult in Greece. We're making very clear decisions about how to manage our working capital in those markets. And so what I expect is that it will continue to be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; thank you. Can I just follow up on that? Are you still confident though that with the cost savings you have in Europe that you can still deliver profit growth in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we delivered 120 basis points in &#x2013; across Europe in this year just gone. And that will continue to be a focus for us. So we're doing a lot of work around the whole gross-to-net piece in our depth and frequency of discounting in Western Europe. And then obviously, keeping a very &#x2013; we've taken as you know, a lot of overhead costs out in this last year, where we're keeping a very tight focus on our overheads.</p>
          <p>We've actually managed to &#x2013; along with increasing our margin by about 120 basis points, we've actually increased our A&amp;P by 3% in the year. So it's very high quality, I would like to say, increase in the margin in our business. It's not about taking out the investment in the brands. And yeah, we're determined to continue to do that in the coming year.</p>
          <p>The other thing I'd say on the top line trend is, we do have the Turkish business coming in to be organic in the coming year, so that offsets little bit some of the Southern Europe &#x2013; the other Southern Europe trends.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. A few questions. Firstly, within your scotch portfolio, I just want to understand the outlook really for Windsor and J&amp;B. And in the case of J&amp;B, could you give us a feel for how that is rebalanced now in terms of market exposure? And whether it's just that rebalancing that hopefully can stabilize that brand? And then specifically on Windsor, are you reinvesting the reduction in import tariffs back into that market? And do you think that market can actually stabilize?</p>
          <p>Then a specific question on route to market in India, can you give us an update on where you are in terms of resources and sales force there because obviously, at some point, you will need access &#x2013; greater access to the duty paid channel.</p>
          <p>And then a final specific point on the transaction-related cost of &#xA3;60-odd million recognized in the year. You referred to &#xA3;28 million of cost relating to acquisitions not yet completed. I assume this is surrounding Jose Cuervo and the like because obviously Ypi&#xF3;ca has completed. And whether we should expect that &#xA3;60 million effectively to drop away in your organic number in the current year or whether there are further transaction-related costs of deals as of yet completed?

          <p>Fundamentally, in pure volume terms, J&amp;B was down about 1% of the Diageo level. It is still a brand very reliant on European performance, I want to say. 3 million of the 4.5 million cases come from Europe, where it was down about 4%. So, in the other part of the rest of the markets where it performs outside of Europe, it's doing quite well. So, it is still very much reliant on European performance, where [we remain] the best brand and we were down about 4%, but overall 1% down elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Gilbert, Windsor and India?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul. Hi, Chris. Chris, on the Windsor, if we step back and we look at the scotch whiskey category in Korea, the market declined by 8.5% F 2012. And in F 2012 when we look at our performance with Windsor, we managed to gain market share in this category. Although we were down 1%, we had 4 points of price mix, which means that we are gaining market share on the high end with 17 years old and the 21 years old and we managed to gain 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>We fought the ongoing contraction of the scotch whiskey market in Korea, but at a slower rate that we have seen in F 2012. And we are very well-positioned with Windsor to continue gaining market share and to continue leverage the price mix for this brand in the Korean market.</p>
          <p>If I shift to India, on India in terms of route to market, we have now a very good coverage in India for our international brands. We have over 80% weighted distribution in India. We have delivered the penetration into Tier 2 cities last year and this year we are into penetrating Tier 3 cities in India.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Gilbert. And, Deirdre, maybe the acquisition cost question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, I would point out that Ethiopia did not close until 2013. It just closed in the early part of this year. So in fact, when we say it was for acquisitions that had closed, Ethiopia would still be included in that.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to the ongoing cost in F 2013, as you know, there are a number of things that we're looking at. We continue to be active in terms of extending our footprint in emerging markets and I would expect that there would be some cost in F 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everybody. I have two questions, please. My first question is with regard to the strategic shift of resource within regions, I mean, among regions. I understand that you're not seeing, let's say, changes in the dynamics for the next year, meaning high growth markets should &#x2013; are likely to continue to drive high growth while U.S. is likely to continue to be pretty healthy while Europe on the other hand is not expected to improve dramatically.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering whether within this context, the exercise of shifting resource that you have been implementing and explaining that obviously has been very helpful for the dynamics this year are &#x2013; what are your thoughts to whether you are already at the minimum level possible, for instance in Europe? Are there likely to be further resource shifts if for instance Europe continues to deteriorate? meaning &#x2013; I'm sure you'll agree you have to balance long term and short term and maybe planned investment for instance in Europe and even in Spain or Greece is &#x2013; could not fully disappear if you're thinking long term ahead for the brands. And so I was wondering, I'd be interested to know whether your &#x2013; how are you seeing that in terms of whether we should expect further resource shifting or are we now with at the minimum level in Europe?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding wine, obviously, it is not a big part of your business, but there is little &#x2013; few comments on that. You're not seeing very dynamic trends there. Can you elaborate a little bit on how do you see the value creation in the wine business for Diageo and overall for the category? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on wine, it's a small component of our business. It is a part of the business where we have taken capital out from and we're okay with the returns from that business. We're happy with the portfolio that we've reconfigured. But it's fair to say that you should not expect us to be pursuing high growth opportunities there. I think it is globally, a category that has some economic issues and we're happy where it stands in the overall size and scale versus the rest of our business.</p>
          <p>Regarding resource allocation, what I would say is that Europe actually will get into modest growth in the year ahead, benefiting from the Mey I&#xE7;ki acquisition we've made. And I think we have to recognize that in the foreseeable future, nothing is going to change in Europe. That is the cards that we've dealt and we have to manage it accordingly.</p>
          <p>I would also draw a parallel, the reason we are performing so well in Latin America is when many of those markets had economic challenges themselves, we did not fully pull out. We were there. We scaled back. We did not withdraw and that will be a hallmark within Europe.</p>
          <p>Europe will get through this. We may have different views on the length of time it will take, but we are not prepared to withdraw or render our brands obsolete in those markets. So we will strike the right balance. Clearly, we'd make certain predictions around how we see markets evolve. I would say the state of the global economy is pretty much in line with the predictions that we've made. If anything, I'm a little bit more encouraged by what we're seeing out in North America.</p>
          <p>So I don't see a need to change fundamentally the strategic choices that we've made. But as you would expect, we will be ever mindful of economic shifts that take place and we will be very agile in responding to them.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. I don't know whether you covered this in the first couple of questions, but I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit about the gin business in the second half, particularly what happened in North America? And I was wondering if you could sort of evaluate the scope to return gin to the kind of growth in fiscal 2013 that you saw in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Larry to speak specifically to that. What I would say generally on gin is that it's seeing a little bit of a let on. And we saw sales up 3% driven by Tanqueray and Gordon's. We've got some nice momentum behind it.</p>
          <p>Larry, you want to talk about first half, second half in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Paul. The first half was okay. We haven't really invested in the second half. So, our A&amp;P budget was spent in the beginning of the year. We pulled back in the second half, and this year, we plan to spend the most money we've spent on Tanqueray in quite some time, probably in the last four years or five years.</p>
          <p>And actually, the campaign seems to be working. We started off the year well. One month doesn't make a year, but July looks good and we've got some estimates for August, which also look good. So, it seems like the campaign is resonating. And there's a little bit of interest in gin now, and I think Tanqueray is enjoying that in the States.</p>

          <p>Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Holland of SG. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Just a couple of questions. Just picking up on something &#x2013; Paul, that you said earlier around the performance of the full year was the best guide to trends. Thinking particularly of Latin America where organic sales were up 19%, do you think that trend can continue for 2013? Is there anything to suggest in any of your major markets a slow down FY 2013 versus FY 2012?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us an idea of what the organic growth in Mey I&#xE7;ki was in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Andrew to answer the Mey I&#xE7;ki question. Regarding the broad trends, we have not seen any major shifts; and therefore, we're very confident in the ability of this business to continue to grow in line with the growth we've seen this year, which is why we increased our dividend by 8% in this announcement.</p>
          <p>Now, the only thing I would say here is that we operate in turbulent times. The global economy will have some shifts in it. The great thing about Diageo is that we are very diverse, geographically, category and price point and therefore you should expect us to be agile. So if we do see things taking place, we will respond. But here today, we don't see any fundamental shifts in the regions' performances regarding forward growth rates. Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mey I&#xE7;ki, as I said, we're gaining share in all categories. The margins are good. The growth is double digit and we'll start to see that on a more specific basis as we move into that business becoming organic through 10 months of [the summer].</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As that was the last question let me, first of all, thank everybody for joining us on the call. I know that people are dialing in from all around the world and all time zones. I'd like to wrap it up with one key message. We are a strong business and we are now even stronger than we were a year ago. The results that we released this morning show that very clearly. I think we've proven our ability to grow our business organically and we have grown inorganically through the deals that we've done whether it's in Vietnam, China, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Turkey, these are very sound economic propositions that bring good brands, good routes to market, and certainly complement our global strategy.</p>
          <p>No matter what the future may hold, this is an agile business that is very, very well placed and very flexible in handling whatever challenges we have to.</p>
          <p>Thanks for spending time with us today and thank you for believing in Diageo and our strategy as we do. Have a great day.</p>
