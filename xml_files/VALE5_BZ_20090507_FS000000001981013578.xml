        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. It's a pleasure to be here with you. This is Fabio Barbosa speaking. I will start, and then after the presentation, Mr. Roger Agnelli will make some comments as well. Our agenda today involves two major items, first, how we are dealing with the current environment, and second, how we see the future.</p>
          <p>On the first topic, I believe &#x2013; we believe that the performance of Vale in the first quarter was a very solid one, given the environment that we are facing. And we posted adjusted EBIT margin of 31.6%, as you can see there, our EBITDA reached 2.3 billion, net earnings 1.4. We invested 2.6 billion, including the acquisition that we paid for in the first quarter. And we managed to keep a very strong balance sheet, with our liquid assets positioned at $12.2 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the next page, Vale was really affected by the shift we observed in the seaborne market. Vale was the most global &#x2013; it is the most global company in terms of iron ore markets exposure. So, we have a very strong presence in every single market in the world.</p>
          <p>And what we see here in page six, was a major change in the geography of the seaborne demand and, of course affecting Vale sales. We used to have 55% of our sales in the Western Hemisphere, and in the first quarter of '09 this percentage went down to 19%. At the same time, this has a direct correlation with the seaborne demand performance, that in the first quarter of '08, 79% of the seaborne was in the Eastern Hemisphere, and in the first quarter of '09 this number jumped to 93%. So, we were affected, more affected than the other players in this case, due to the specifics of the geography that we operate.</p>
          <p>What we face in this environment, we promptly react to the circumstances by adjusting our costs. You can see there in the next page that we made a major effort in cost reduction, almost $1 billion if we also add the &#x2013; more than $1 billion if we also add the R&amp;D effort that we did in the first quarter of '09, compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Of course the decline in EBITDA responded &#x2013; was a direct result of the decrease in sales volume and also price changes that we observed.</p>
          <p>But, as we mentioned before, we are not quiet, waiting for the better times. We are working very hard to slash our cost structure in order to provide the company with the financial strength it deserves and to our shareholders with the returns they aspire. So there's a major campaign underway to combine a short-term reduction with enhancement of the foundation of our long-term competitiveness as we put there, and we believe that those savings will be much more visible over the next six to twelve months.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of '09, what we can already indicate is that, in terms of discretionary spending, we reduced in 89 million several items, like infrastructure and support, consultancy services, outsourced services, travel, advertisement, et cetera. So very important items there, discretionary items, that we slashed by almost two-thirds in the first quarter of '09, compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Also, the working capital requirement was sharply reduced by almost $900 million.</p>
          <p>And the result of this is, could be visualized in chart 10, as it's also spread in our operations. As we see, the unit cost for iron ore and nickel declined visibly in the first quarter of '09 compared to the first quarter of '08, but also on a year-by-year basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the decreases were 35% and 33%, respectively, despite the reduction in volumes that were observed.</p>
          <p>We achieved that through several measures. We are trying of course to work with a leaner corporate center. We are in-sourcing some activities. We are re-sourcing, renegotiating contracts with suppliers. We are cutting costs of project development. We are optimizing plant and labor utilization, optimizing the flow of materials, streamlining line of products and shutting down higher cost operating units.</p>
          <p>At this stage, I would like to invite Tito Martins from our nickel operations to make some comments of what we have been doing in our nickel business to cut down costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fabio. I think it's important to stress, and I will not be long in my speech, but it's important to stress that, despite the difficulties we faced in the second semester of last year, due to the drop in the price in the market, we try to first to, as was mentioned before, streamline the production, and at the same time work on some overhead costs we had in our operations worldwide. We are right now working on a better definition of some functions, not only in Canada, but in the operations in Indonesia and in New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>We do have an extra effort related to the cost reduction when we're talking about the line of products, and some specific items of consumption, that could stress energy and fuel consumption. That's why we decided to shut down part of the operations in Indonesia by the end of the year, and that's why we decided to have the shutdown in the next, in the following weeks in Sudbury. We decided to do that as a response to the market conditions, and at the same time, to go for a maintenance process in our furnaces in Sudbury.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We also, we promoted a structural shift in our iron ore output towards Caraj&#xE1;s, as we put there in  slide 12. And, of course, you all know Caraj&#xE1;s is a low cost, high quality operation. And we just now released our 20th report and we filed our 20th report, in which we indicated that we are doubling our approval and proven reserves. And now total Vale reserves reached, in iron ore, reached 14.2 billion tons. In Caraj&#xE1;s alone, we had 7.2 billion tons of iron ore at 67% Fe content. It's a major reserve, the largest reserve, or the highest volume material available in the world.</p>
          <p>And so, we are supplying this high quality ore, and in relatively high proportion, so that we try to maximize the higher value use of our ore. And today 43% of our iron ore production is coming from Caraj&#xE1;s, against about one-third in the last five years. At the same time, we continue with our initiatives, in terms of strengthening our competitiveness through changes in our logistics and also in our iron ore marketing policy.</p>
          <p>In logistics, I would like to invite Eduardo Bartolomeo to comment on what we have been doing on the acquisition of ships and comment on the freighting group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As we mentioned, we keep on our strategy to increase our control over the Maritime freight towards mainly Asia. We have now under our control 20 ships, either ownership of the old ships we used to have, the three old ones. We bought five ships, and we have around 12 COAs. And we're very, looking to the markets, we see a lot of opportunities on that sense, conversion of tankers, so we are, we'll be able to secure a very, I would say right size of freight as these changes happen in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so we have ordered already 12 VLOCs. And we have options for four more, and we are looking for more ships in the market in order to speed up our, the coverage of our sales into Asia. So we are trying, at the same time, to increase our customer base by developing newer markets, new client base. We are, of course, with the idea of a distribution center in the Middle East and Asia, in order to optimize our product mix. And we are adopting a more flexible stance towards iron ore pricing. And I'd like to invite Martins to comment, make some comments on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As we have already announced to the market, we are flexibilizing our price policy in order to cope with the customers' requirements, and also with the competitors' moves. Cost-wise, we have the conditions to sell iron ore at a lower price, if it was needed, but we are always managing the price-volume situation. If we increase too much our sales probably, we are going to drive price down a lot, and on the other hand we can pressure freight to Asia.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, operating under these three points, which is the price that was needed to sell our production in markets where we really have this elasticity. Because, for instance in Europe, Japan and in the Western world market, price is not the issue. People will not buy because we have a lower price. The only elastic market today is China, because you have local production, which has a higher cost. So, our flexibility today is mainly related to the Chinese market because of this situation, and we also needed to cope with our competitors' movements. So, that's &#x2013; from now on, that's the way we are operating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so flexibility will be the name of the game, that's our policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's move to the second section of our presentation today, where we have some comments about the, how we see the future.</p>
          <p>First point we'd like to make is, of course the performance of the PMI, it's, yes, in the negative spectrum of the index, but it, in our view, is issuing clear signs of stabilization of industrial production, which is good news as industrial production is the most deeply correlated with mineral and metals demand.</p>
          <p>On the other chart, we see the very positive combination as well of the declining inventories and increasing and rising new orders indicating that we may actually have reached the bottom of the current crisis.</p>
          <p>This is a possibility we expect that is the case of course nobody could be absolutely sure, but very strong indications in this direction. Chinese PMI is also in the 50-plus region. It's also a very important indicator considering the rate of China, Chinese demand in total construction of industry and in slide 18, we see that the fixed asset investment responded very quickly to the incentive package, the stimulus package implemented by the Chinese government. So the growth of fixed asset investment reached over 28% in the first quarter in the last month of March.</p>
          <p>So global steel production of course reacted to the negative environment and, but now it's showing signs of recovery, particularly China. That's already showing a growth on a three months average seasonally adjusted basis, 40% growth compared to the previous level at the end of the year of 50% decline and this is driving back the global steel production is still in the negative territory, but less negative than it was in the last quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>As a result of this recovery, of course the Chinese demand for iron ore imports is showing a very strong performance and now on a 12 months, over the last 12 months the level reached was 476 million tons. So we believe that we are dislocating some high-cost local producers and we have been able to share part of this growth that was shown by the Chinese imports that they are growing now at 80% average, that is relatively closer to the peak observed in the mid of last year 2008 at 22%.</p>
          <p>Another element that would give us more hope about the future is that the loans to property sector is expanding very quickly as you can see in slide 21. So we are talking about growth of around nine to 10% that compares to the minus 2% observed in the last quarter of '08. So the tightening of certain credit market sector was reverted and then we have now an expression after that will get even higher than the ones observed in 2007. And the floor space, sold houses is showing the same trend after the trough over minus 25% in the end of last year, we are showing now a recovery and we are close to zero. It's not brilliant, but is much better positioned than we had in the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>And this is very important, as you can see page 22, this is very important for our market, our iron ore in particular, given the weight of the construction sector and the demand and the steel consumption. So we show that in page, in slide 22. That construction response of 51% of the steel consumption in China. And out of this property, residential property is 37%, commercial property 40%, infrastructure spending 23%.</p>
          <p>So it's very good news what is happening in this specific segment as it has a direct effect on the demand for steel and consequently iron ore. And in this connection, I would like to point out an important point that I would like Martins to comment as well, that how well Vale is poised today to capture the future upside in the iron ore market. Martins, if you could comment, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the worst of this first quarter result is the volume we lost because of this trend in geography, the geography of the markets. Okay? We lost a bigger part of the slowdown in the similar markets, Vale took it. So we lost around 100 million tons per year of volumes.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand from now on all our competitors are operating full capacity. So in additional market that will come and for sure it will come and mainly in Europe. Vale is prepared to take advantage of it. So we are now the only producer that have spare capacity to supply the market. And we are prepared to do it as long as it's needed. So we have this upside potential that for sure will be captured in the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, turning now to the nickel demand.  It's also showing that since <mark type="inaudible" /> there is some early signs of recovery.  And the stainless steel production is nearer the 5 million tons level it's far from the peak of 7.7 million in the last two years ago.  But it's moving up and this is good news.  And also the austenitic ratio is also starting to recover as you can, we can indicate there reaching almost 75% in the first quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>And the reality is that the prices of high nickel stainless steels have plunged, so the demand, the elasticity there is of course some elasticity of the demand regarding prices as we could see in the last few years, it's operate to bring down demand and it should operate the other way around now, when prices are low, very low compared to the peak levels we reached in 2007 and they are back to their levels of January &#x2013; of early 2004.  So, it's important to have the view that the combination of low inventories and low prices that could bring the foundation of better prospects for the nickel business in the future.</p>
          <p>A word of caution, of course, we are positive about the future considering the environment that we are facing, but we see that there are, there is still a long way to go before we can say that the crisis is over.  Recessions caused by global financial crisis as we put, they tend to be longer and that is precisely the case.  We have mass destruction of wealth worldwide.  We have an erosion of the capital base of banks, is still an issue today with the financial system.  And of course credit is a key element in the recovery of economic activity on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>Of course we are, we believe that we reached a situation in that of the downside is very limited and the development policies are having an important effect in bringing back the economy to the positive territory.  So, this is good news, and in this connection I'd like to stress again that Vale is very well prepared also to capture value in the recovery of the economy when it happens.  And we are of course prepared to as we put there to continue to generate value across the cycles.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.  Now I would like to turn the floor to Mr. Roger Agnelli to make his comments.  Roger please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fabio.  Well, good morning everybody.  It's a pleasure again to be here with you.  I think Fabio, Martins Tito ended where I could said almost everything about the results, about the performance of the company in the first quarter.  I would like only to add some comments about that.</p>
          <p>Last October, we started to face the crisis.  Our first decision was to rethink our business model, our strategy, rethinking our investments, rethinking the cost structure et cetera, et cetera.  And we've made some, some commitments to be achieved in the first quarter of 2009 and we said well, until March I think we needed to be, to go forward carefully, let's wait a little bit to see how the market will accommodate, how the market will be reacting different, in the different areas that we are operating.  And in March we are going to take our decision how to go forward.</p>
          <p>I think this is the most important thing to mention to you.  So everything that is happening right now or everything that we are showing in our first quarter results, I think we are happy.  We are happy because we reached almost everything that we were committed to achieve.  The first thing is the unit cost for nickel, for iron ore logistics and phosphate in our operations is right now the same as it was before the crisis.  Even considering a much lower volume, a much lower level of operation, I think this was a very good result for us.  Of course, we took some very tough decisions to shut down some mines here in the southeast and bring volumes to Caraj&#xE1;s.  I think that was correct, if you see the unit cost of iron ore or the cash cost of our iron ore business dropped 35% in the first quarter compared to what was last year.</p>
          <p>In the nickel business, the same thing.  We rethink the material flow, we rethink the working capital we involved in the operation and we reduced the cost a lot.  We adopt our corporate core activities to a new level of activity.  We were growing very fast and now we are, we can say that we are stable in terms of growth.  Of course we are keeping investing in our projects, but we are not really in a hurry to increase our production or increase our opportunities of M&amp;As et cetera.  So we are, let's say, calm, very, very calm and we are not in a hurry.</p>
          <p>So, from last September to last March, we reduced a number of employes involved in our operations or working now in our site by 2,000 employees, which is really very, very strong adjustment.  And we made that until the end of last year, until December.  So of course we are keeping our talents, we are keeping our people and we just in-source some work that contractors used to do for us.  So we've reduced the workforce directly and directly involved in our operations by 2,000 employees.  So this is something that wasn't good, but was imperative for the company to do, to achieve our goals.</p>
          <p>The other point is, we carefully drove our iron ore business.  We said well, we have the lowest cost operation in the world.  We have the best iron ore in the world.  We have our natural market, which is Europe affected much strongly by the prices than other areas in the globe.  We are far from China.  We, in the first moment we've reduced our shipment to China, we were talking with our clients and we discussed a lot with our clients about the future of the iron ore business, our supply capacity.  We discussed a lot about the benchmark system or spot market or index or whatever.</p>
          <p>Now I should say that we are prepared for anything.  We will be very happy if our clients decide to keep the benchmark system.  We will be very, very happy, because we clearly believe that this is the best model for the <mark type="inaudible" /> chain.  This is very important for everybody, brings a lot of stability with reducible activity off of the market and we can really predict the capital expenditure because we have long-term confidence.  But if our clients decide not to follow the benchmark system, and they decide to follow the short-term view, we will be very happy to do that.  We will be very happy do that, no problem at all.  Why that?  Because it will relieve the other market.  If there are no market for the coming years, it will very tight.  It's going to be very tight.  And as Martins said, our competitors they don't have room to maneuver, because they are working.  They are already working at the full capacity, and we have the market.  Any additional turn in the market I think Vale is much more prepared to supply these additional markets than the other competitors, so we are not in a hurry.</p>
          <p>In nickel, we are in the same situation.  We are finalizing two big, very big projects, Goro and On&#xE7;a Puma and the market just consumed all the stocks that they used to have in the last year.  So, today the market &#x2013; the nickel market is a little bit tight and we have capacity to bring it to the market and to take advantage of any recovery in the economy or in the following market.  In copper, we are okay.  We are working at full capacity.  We are not really a big producer in the market itself.  We are following the market.  And in coal, we are full steam ahead investing to be a player or let's say a significant player in the markets that we're not yet, but we will be a significant player in the market.</p>
          <p>Logistics, we are investing, still investing to repair or to restore our efficiency and I think today we are working, we have very good efficiency in the system and we are increasing the capacity for the coming years.  So we have a lot of homework to be done.  We finished almost everything.  Of course we are keeping renegotiating our contracts with our suppliers; we are reshaping the volumes or the necessity of our goods, or materials for the coming years.  I think we got a lot of cost reduction in the &#x2013; from our suppliers, they are our partners and we are working together and I think we are accommodating everything.</p>
          <p>So, in the point of view of the company today okay, the first quarter I think was the bottom in terms of all kinds of problems that would have happened in a crisis like we are facing right now.  We &#x2013; I should say that in Europe we are in a weather that is minus 30 degrees centigrade.  In China, today, we are working at maybe 35, 40 degrees centigrade.  So it's hot there and it's very cold here in Europe.  As an average I think we are okay in a very pleasant weather because from minus 40 to plus 40.  So, we are in a very pleasant weather.</p>
          <p>So I think we are, I believe that we are prepared to take advantage of any recovery in the market.  I feel that we are right now in a situation that we can at least see what's going to happen in the next 6 or 7 or 10 months that was completely impossible to see three, four, five months ago.  My feeling is that the whole market is not getting worse, it's not recovering yet, but it's not getting worse.  But at least nobody has stocks anymore.  Even ourselves, we don't have stocks.  We have a little bit in the nickel that it is going to take care about that, but it's a very, very, very low inventory there.  But the point is, in recovery, I think we are prepared.</p>
          <p>We are open to face any challenge in the market.  Financially speaking, we are very sound.  We are very strong.  We are &#x2013; we don't have any, any constraints.  We don't have any pressure to generate cash flow to pay debts or whatever.  So we are very comfortable in this regard.  So, again, I can't say that we are unhappy with the results or very happy with the current situation because I'm not and I think nobody is really happy, but at least I should say that compared to others I think we are in a very good situation and we should be very, very happy.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, I think we are much stronger than any other main competitor in the market.  So we can increase production, we can increase shipment to China, we can increase shipment to Europe.  We can sell more nickel, we can sell whatever is necessary to sell, the cost is &#x2013; I think we have the room to improve a little bit more and you are going to see that in the second quarter of this year, because some measures that we took in the past is, is maturing right now.  The level of goods in our warehouses are going down from April on, because of course last year we were working with a lack of everything.  And we increased our inventories, our spot market inventories et cetera, et cetera and right now is accommodating, we are starting to reduce.</p>
          <p>So those are the comments that I should give to you.  And I think Vale is in a very good position, I'm very confident that we are going to deliver very good results. Even in this very tough situation that we are facing in the market regarding to iron ore, everybody is betting if the benchmark will die or if the benchmark will survive or the spot market will be the market for everybody.  What I would like to say is that, listen, if this is benchmark great, if it's spot it's great also &#x2013; it's great also.  Our clients are going to decide. They have to decide, and now is a time to decide what they want.  If they want the benchmark, okay they should pay for the guarantee of supply, they should pay for the quality.  They should pay for the low volatility that we are bringing to the chain.</p>
          <p>If they decide to go for spot, I'll be very happy because we are going to have upsides.  We don't, I don't see that we are going to have downsides because the price in the market is a little bit tight right now.  That I can tell you.  If they wanted to have or to see the benchmark below the spot, I'm prepared to go to the spot.  If they wanted to keep the guarantees, if they wanted to keep their comfortable situation to have a very reliable supply with price that, they can't control, they can't see how it's going to be their cost in the future and how they will sign their contract with their clients.  Okay, pay for that.  If not, it's okay for us.  It's okay for us.</p>
          <p>We are now prepared to do whatever work our clients decide to do.  If it's benchmark, good, if it's spot, good.  The only thing is benchmark, guarantee, investment for long-term, creditability, et cetera.  This is something that costs.  And we are going to charge.  If it is spot, okay, let's go and  blame the spot and I think, I like that also.  It's not bad, it's good also.  That's it.  Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Banc of America.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone.  My two questions are related to iron ore and so in the last conference call you said at least in the first quarter you would ship about 50 million tons, that was pretty much what you did in the first quarter. What kind of numbers are you looking for the second quarter of the year in terms of shipments and for the whole year in 2009?</p>
          <p>And my second question on prices would be could you give us an idea of what's going on with the benchmark price negotiations, if we should assume that this 20% provisional pricing should be the price for the remainder of the year, or if you see any kind of risk that prices could be actually lower than this 20%?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, this is Fabio Barbosa speaking.  As for your first question, we have not provided any guidance of volumes moving forward.  So, as the year evolves, we will let you know what happened in our shipments.  And I'll pass the floor to Martins for the second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think as far as the price is concerned, look in the figures we presented and the volumes sold and comparing our sales performance against competitors' performance, it's clear that Vale was a very disciplined company during this period.  We did not reduce price to get the market.  And the volumes we lost is a clear demonstration that we were not the first to drive the prices down like it happened. From now on as we told before, we are applying a more flexible policy and also we are considering other forms of selling.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we didn't sold at all in the spot.  All our sales are based in long-term contracts with some flexibility, it's true. But all our sales, including China, was done based on long-term contracts.  We sold near 50 million tons of new sales in China for new customers at the benchmark price.</p>
          <p>So when you look forward from April 1, we start developing a price flexibility that is according to the market situation.  And another issue is as we told before and Jos&#xE9; stressed, considering that all our competitors are operating full capacity. Our flexibility probably will bring us additional volumes.  We face in the western world a huge destocking process that in the first quarter amounted to above 10 million tons of iron ore that was consumed based on the stocks, the inventories that the customer has.</p>
          <p>We also have some impact of capital mines from some of our customers, which amount to near five million ton in the first half.  So we lost almost 50 million tons based on inventories and based on capacity production.  But I think that this is the cap, they cannot go above it.  And from now on, even if they continue to consume the same quantities of iron ore they consumed in the first quarter, they don't need it to buy more ore.</p>
          <p>So, besides that, everybody knows what's going on in China.  With the present spot price in China, a huge quantity of local ore is being displaced.  And every day, we have more and more customers looking for imported ore.  And the only company that has <mark type="inaudible" /> available to sell more is Vale.</p>
          <p>So, it's a good perspective not only for volumes but also for quantities, and for price.  Why you think that?  If you look in the last three months, China bought almost 50 million tons per month in the seaborne market.  This is almost 20% above their best figures in the last year.  So, even with this huge quantity, spot price in China stopped going down and is showing some signs of recovery.</p>
          <p>So, we think that going forward considering our flexibility to work in this market or not only quantity, but also in price we see good prospective for Vale.</p>
          <p>Seaborne market, as a whole, has a huge impact in this first quarter.  According to our calculations, consumption was down 40 million tons, but above that we have this destocking and also we have this captive mine production, which together brought this seaborne market down near 55 million tons in this quarter that could be around 220 in a yearly base. And part of this 55 million tons was offset by the increase in seaborne imported from China in this quarter, which accounts for 25 million tons of additional ore being imported from China in this period.</p>
          <p>So, in general, seaborne market went down 30 million tons in this quarter. And by the figures you can see that we took almost all the blow. So, we don't think that the situation can be worse than that. And from now on, we really believe that all the odds are for a good upside for Vale, not only based on volumes, but also in price.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.  The first question is regarding iron ore as well.  What percentage of total volumes sold, also in the second quarter, do you believe are going to be on the provisional discounts, just like in the first quarter, 55% of total volumes were sold with the 20% discount, how much do you think in the second quarter will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I told you before, we continue to work in this flexible price policy. And as far as a provisional price, from April 1, all our sales based on long-term contracts are subject to the provisional price policy, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And the second question is regarding the &#x2013; what level of premium do you think Vale can charge for on-the-spot prices for the higher quality, the guarantee of supply, and the more stable quality of iron ore, when compared to other players?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcos, we are not going to provide any guidance about future price performance.  We'll disclose the results as we end the quarter and you'll see how much we manage to achieve every quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if I can just, a last question here on CapEx. Fabio, you if could qualify the maintenance CapEx was very low at $400 million in the first quarter.  If we annualize that number it will be like 1.6 billion for the year, the previous CapEx guidance for maintenance was 2.5 billion.  Do you think that for an extraordinary year, you could see a lower CapEx, even maintenance CapEx, in 2009?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You could see room for reduction, even on maintenance CapEx, that's my point?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we indicated in the press release, we are in the process of reviewing our investment program, as we commented in the last call, and this process is not over yet.  What I could say about the first quarter investment in sustaining, it's that there is a seasonal pattern, that usually execution of the budget in the first quarter is lower than the average of the year. So, it may not be a good sample to extrapolate for the whole year.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, again, please restrict your questions to two at a time.  Our next question comes from Mr. Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen.  Thank you for taking the question.  The first one is on China iron ore market.  How much do you expect the total demand for iron ore in 2009 will be from China? And at what price do you think the domestic Chinese production stops declining. In other words, at what price do you assume that the substitution from imports stops?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be, at what, in the first quarter, the production at Caraj&#xE1;s was around 20 million tons, thus down about six million tons from the peak in the third quarter of last year.  How much do you, can you produce from Caraj&#xE1;s going forward as volumes picks up, so that you continue to reduce your cost or maintain your very good cost of iron ore that you achieved in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>It's my, my feeling is that if volumes picks up, would you have to restart the Southern System range and of course, your costs of iron ore will go up a little bit?  Those are my questions. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the Chinese market is concerned, in the first quarter, China imported additional 25 million tons of ore, which means from last year we can guess that they will buy at least 100 million tons more.  Which means this volume, considering their production was almost the same as last year, this volume will come from local production.  I think to this price level that we have now in China, at least 100 million tons of iron ore will be displaced from local mines.  So that's the situation we see in this moment.</p>
          <p>As far as Caraj&#xE1;s, I don't know if everybody is aware, but we have one of the toughest rainy seasons in north of Brazil, and our production in the first quarter was below the production that we could have done in normal situation.</p>
          <p>In the north of Brazil, this year is running 20% above the last half that was in the year of 2000, so this impact our production.  But the situation we have now, we can produce up to 100 million tons per year in Caraj&#xE1;s, in the region of 100 million tons per year, which is around 80 million tons per month.</p>
          <p>In the Southern System, although we cut a lot of cost, as we keep a lot of people in the company prepared to restart production in these mines, okay.  Although we reduce production, we are prepared at any moment to recover production and it was needed.  So, we have a lot of flexibility as production is concerned, not only in Caraj&#xE1;s, which we can increase a little bit more, but also in the Southern System, where we have everything in place to restart production if it was needed.</p>
          <p>And that's the importance of the cost reduction we reached in this first quarter, because we have some redundancy cost in the company that we pay for it, but only to be prepared to resume the  productions if the market, if it's necessary according to our market sales.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  Quick question in terms of the bench on the pricing.  I mean you said that you don't really &#x2013; it doesn't really matter if the benchmark or spot prices, you're fine with either one.  But if everyone merges to &#x2013; goes to spot prices, don't you think it's going to put a lot of pressure on spot prices, because of the volume that's going to be thrown into the spot market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the contrary, I think the market today is tight, it's tight.  Anything that can happen in Europe recover &#x2013; if the market recovers in Europe, of course, our sales to China will decrease a little bit, and our competitors there are working at full capacity.  So, I think that any recovery in Europe means price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What could add to the &#x2013; Roger's statement, is we are a price sensitive company.  We manage &#x2013; we are in a condition now, more than before, to manage volume and price, so we are going to do what is best for increasing our profitability.  So, we are not through in the market volumes that could drive the prices down for amount bigger than the profit we can take from these additional volumes.  So we are going to manage it.  What is different now is, as everybody is operating full capacity, the only company that has the condition to manage the price volume game is Vale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  One second question, if I may.  So if my interpretation is correct, you're saying that, I mean because &#x2013; China at one point is going to start defending a little bit their local producers.  I mean, you've been gaining market share throughout the first quarter, but don't you think at some point China would have to start defending a little bit the local producers, and kind of step back a little bit in terms of importing iron ore?  And then will be &#x2013; you'll be a lot more rely &#x2013; dependent on Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the &#x2013; this is a possibility, but let's wait and see.  I think we cannot anticipate, we didn't anticipate what happened.  And we cannot anticipate what will happen from now on.  One thing is for sure.  Local customers that never used Vale's ore are now using.  And I can tell you, they are liking it.  So I think now they prove the good stuff that you can offer, they're becoming more and more interested in buying.  So I cannot talk about what the local miners will do or what will happen in China.  But we have to follow and to surf  the market and do what is best for our company and for our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one point is very important.  We shouldn't forget that the spot market price last year reached $200 per ton.  At that time a lot of low competitive, a lot of small miners were able to produce and to sell.  And today the market or the spot market varies 60, 65, $70 per ton, so they are not able to do that.  So if the government decided to do something to increase the local production, I think that our clients in China will not be very happy with that because they are going lose competitiveness in the world market.  So, I think this is a possibility, but there is a trade-off.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, could you talk a little bit more about your acquisition criteria, and what you're looking for? I recognize you've made an acquisition of some potash assets in the quarter, along with some thermal assets, what types of return in invested capital do you expect to generate, given the prices paid? And it would seem that, given your long term nature and the strong balance sheet that you have, that you would be a little more aggressive than you have been in the &#x2013; from an acquisition &#x2013; on the acquisition front. So could you address those issues please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think last year we made some comments about the &#x2013; our &#x2013; let's say guidance, for M&amp;A. We said that we were looking for small assets that could really increase our strength, our position in some specific markets, and we are following this kind of strategy.</p>
          <p>We bought, as you know, Corumb&#xE1; from Rio Tinto that is a very good asset to be addition to our portfolio. We are very happy with that. We bought this Colorado, Rio Colorado potash project in Argentina that is right beside our other project there in Neuqu&#xE9;n. And these are huge deposits of potash and very good one. And we believe that the market is going to be very good for fertilizers, or for potash and phosphate.</p>
          <p>We acquired some good assets in Africa also, a small amount of money, but with a very big potential, in terms of copper, so we are very happy with that. We are analyzing several different opportunities, but we are not considering to move ahead with big or huge acquisitions, and we feel that even at the current price, our projects are much more competitive. So we don't need to acquire any other additional iron ore deposits, because the deposit that we have in Caraj&#xE1;s is much more competitive than any other possible acquisition.</p>
          <p>In copper, we have several projects being developed like salud in Caraj&#xE1;s we don't need to go for major acquisitions, and to be honest with you, major acquisitions or big acquisitions today, I think you can bring more liabilities than assets. So I think it's better to develop, to keep our eyes on the clean, clean, very clean assets. And you do that when you buy a project or when you buy a small company because the big ones are, I should say, not really completely out of liability, and this is not the right time to bring liabilities to our balance sheet.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question.  The first question is relating to Chinese domestic iron ore production. With the expectation that the ex-China market demand comes back in the second semester and spot prices recovering, do you see any risk that the Chinese domestic ore production that has been displaced during the first quarter come back to the market? Because in that case basically Chinese imports could be potentially driven down. So, if you can please comment on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no free lunch, okay.  So, for sure, it's the prices, the spot pricing.  The same mechanism that took these guys out of the market can bring them back if the price goes up but that again will depend on how much ore can be sent to China.  We need &#x2013; we have to consider for instance that from now on, a bigger quantity of Indian ore will be out of the Chinese markets because of the monsoon.  So, I think there is a space for some price increase and some additional exports for instance additional sales from Vale to China even in this case because from now on probably we see a big volume of Indian ore getting out of this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> if I may, a part of the consumption of the Chinese ore happened because there was no alternative.  So, the market was sold out and they had to consume any ore they could fine.  And now, clearly Vale represents an alternative.</p>

          <p>We are not providing any guidance on the future performance of our costs.  We indicated the measure that we adopted, we indicated, we showed the result that we achieved in the first quarter and some of them have a permanent nature.  So, we'll release the results as the year evolves.</p>

          <p>Excuse me.  Our next question comes from Mr. Tony Risotto from Calman Rose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions.  I've got two, first of all gentlemen, on the iron ore side I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you see ore grades playing out within China.  And I realize a portion of that is going to be determined by the mix and the internal supply demand dynamics, but if you could talk generally about iron ore grades there?  And then also what you think about the level of marginal capacity in China from an iron ore perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood your question, you want to know about the quality of iron ore being delivered in China.  Exactly what the point would you like to get our comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, really trying to get at what you see taking place with regard to ore grades over the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as &#x2013; when you have very low capacity utilization, normally customers accept work with not so good ore, because they don't need too much productivity okay.  But as they're increasing their capacity utilization, more and more they demand good quality ore.  And the good quality ore is not only important because of productivity, but also because of carbon emission. High quality ore normally demands less coal to produce pig iron.  And so you have much lower carbon emission.</p>
          <p>So, if you look going forward as the market becomes more I would say sophisticated and as the market becomes more and more environmental conscious the need of high grade ore increases.  And, so that we see a very strong acceptability of our Caraj&#xE1;s ore in China.  Normally, we didn't deliver too much Caraj&#xE1;s ore in China, because we are always delivering this ore in Europe and Japan, Korea, so and so.  And we always delivered more Southern System ore, which is not so good quality as Caraj&#xE1;s ore.  But from now we'll have more Caraj&#xE1;s available, because those markets those traditional markets are not demanding.  And so the acceptability of this high quality ore is very good.  And also considering that they are buying more low quality ore, they need more high quality ore to blend it.  So, we have many mills that are only using in the past low quality ore that now have the possibility to blend it with this Caraj&#xE1;s or even Southern System good quality ore.  I see the prospects for our ore in China are very positive as going forward, okay?</p>

          <p>Thank you.  It's extremely helpful.  And if I may, I have one more question it's on nickel and I was wondering if you could just update us on the labor negotiations at Sudbury, I think it's a May 31 expiry, but I wonder if you could talk about major issues that you see going into these negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not much to say for now. Basically, we started discussions last week and so far we are still sharing views about the future with the employees. Those negotiations usually they are done in a way that both sides they provide their views about the future of the business. So we're still discussing most of the forecast and the future of our business. We haven't really started the negotiations, not the process of negotiations. Usually it happens in the last two weeks of the proper time. Of course, I cannot comment anything else about that, but I think it's going to be a very interesting negotiation, we are optimist, both sides understand that we're going through a very problematic time and we have, the nickel business was very impacted by the drop in price last year. So, I understand that the unions they know that and they understand that the future of our business depends on how they will react to what we will propose to them.</p>
