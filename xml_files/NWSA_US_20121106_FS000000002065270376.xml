          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the News Corporations' First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd now like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we'll give prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are quite pleased with the continued growth we are delivering at our Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Television segments so far in fiscal 2013, with double-digit segment operating income increases at all three segments. However, much of this growth is offset by anticipated declines at SKY Italia and our Publishing businesses. The current quarter operating income results also include a $67 million charge, relates to the ongoing investigations initiated upon closure of the News of the World in the United Kingdom, as compared to $17 million in the first quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>Excluding these charges from both years and a $5 million charge related to the proposed separation of the company's Entertainment and Publishing businesses, first quarter adjusted total segment operating income of $1.45 billion increased 3% from the year ago adjusted result of $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>First quarter reported revenues were up 2% driven by strong Cable Network reported revenue increases of 16%. These increases were largely offset by currency related decline at many of our divisions, led by SKY Italia. It's important to note that the stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted the company's financial performance this quarter. In constant currency terms, total company revenues and adjusted total segment operating income both grew 5% over last year.</p>
          <p>Our share reported results from our equity earnings of affiliates were up $69 million in the quarter, with this increase primarily reflecting this quarter's gain for participation in BSkyB's share repurchase program. Also included in this quarter result is $1.38 billion of income in Other primarily related to a gain on the company's sale of NDS, partially offset by $152 million of pre-tax impairment for restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Reported net income in the quarter was $2.2 billion with reported earnings per share of $0.94 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.28. Excluding the net income effects in both years of one-time items, principally consisting of the items I just highlighted, first quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.43 compared with the year ago adjusted result of $0.32, a 34% earnings per share improvement. Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. The reduction of shares outstanding versus last year from our buyback accounted for $0.04 per share to the adjusted EPS this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses and let's begin with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating over two thirds of News Corporation's total segment operating income. First quarter Cable segment operating income contributions increased 23% over year ago levels to $953 million with double digit earnings growth at the RSNS, Fox News and at FX, partially due to the timing of original programming and marketing cost at FX. This strong domestic channel growth was partially offset by higher sports cost at STAR India, reflecting the inaugural broadcast of the new BCCI cricket matches and the strengthened U.S. dollar that more than offset local currency profit growth at the Fox International channels.</p>
          <p>Cable Network growth continues to be top line driven, the segment revenues up 16%. Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 18% over year ago levels with domestic channel affiliate fees up 16% and our international fees up 25%. And about two thirds of the international affiliate revenue increase reflects strong local currency, organic growth at the Fox International channels and at STAR India. The balance of our growth was from the inclusion of Fox Pan American sports business partially offset by the impact of foreign currencies.</p>
          <p>First quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 5% over year ago levels led by domestic ad growth of 8%. And at the international channel, local currency organic growth was in the high single digit range. However, after reflecting the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollars, these revenues declined by 1%.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $156 million increased 17% versus the first quarter a year ago, due to a more than doubling of retransmission revenues and the higher political advertising, which more than offset a lower base market affected by the Olympics and the economy. Political advertising is generally coming in as expected with approximately $40 million of political ad revenue received in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $400 million, 15% higher than a year ago. This growth primarily reflects higher television production contribution that include increased digital distribution revenue. The quarter result also includes the successful theatrical release of Ice Age: Continental Drift, which grossed over $850 million in worldwide box office receipts to date.</p>
          <p>Turning to SKY Italia, segment operating income in the quarter of $23 million declined $96 million from a year ago. This anticipated decline was driven by higher program expenses, including nearly $70 million of costs related to this year's broadcast of the Olympics. The timing of this additional premium programming was not ideal given the current challenging economic environment in Italy, which is directly impacting gross subscriber additions and churn. SKY reported 4.86 million subs at quarter end, a net loss of 40,000 in the quarter. Local currency revenues increased 1% over year ago levels on higher subscription revenues although U.S. dollar reported results reflect a more than 10% negative impact from the weakening of the euro.</p>
          <p>In our Publishing segment, operating income of $57 million declined 48% compared to a year ago. This decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenues across all newspaper divisions led by declines at the Australian and U.S. publishing businesses. These declines were partially offset by contributions from the launch of the Sunday edition of the Sun and higher revenues at HarperCollins principally from the acquisition of Thomas Nelson.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment we reported a first quarter segment operating loss of $211 million versus $99 million in the same period a year ago. This quarter result includes $67 million of costs related to the ongoing investigations initiated upon the closure of the News of the World and $5 million of costs related to the proposed separation.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this quarter reflects higher development costs at the company's education business. Joel Klein is scheduled to give you considerable insight into our plans and strategies for this business at the upcoming UBS investor conference in early December, which is held here in New York City.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to update you on our $10 billion buyback program. Through November 5 the company has spent almost $5.8 billion repurchasing over 308 million shares and has reduced News Corporation's total average shares outstanding in the first quarter by over 9% compared to the first quarter a year ago. As indicated previously, we are fully committed to completing the full $10 billion of authorized buyback and we are targeting to repurchase shares at a $3 billion to $4 billion annual pace as we work through the details of the separation process. Our objective is to buy back our shares in a disciplined manner without artificially pushing our share price up during periods of low trading volume.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013, total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012 the $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom resulting in a base of $5.6 billion of segment operating income for comparative purposes. After excluding the full year effect of the U.K. investigation cost and separation cost and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2012 to continue to be in the high single to low double digit range above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base level that we outlined for you three months ago.</p>
          <p>And while this guidance now includes the estimated consolidated contribution from the acquisitions of CMH in Australia and ESS in Asia, those contributions are essentially offset by the inclusion of the first year's timing effect of the marketing cost of the initial releases under our new Dreamworks Animation distribution deal.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Before I comment on our business, I want to recognize that many of you who live in the New York, New Jersey area. I hope you and your family and friends are managing to recover from Hurricane Sandy. As a company we've done our best to help the relief efforts, both through donations, and also by working directly with FEMA to raise awareness of federal disaster relief initiatives through various media across News Corporation. We know this has been a difficult time for many of you, so please know that we wish all of you the best as our entire community works to make a full recovery.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the quarter. Our first quarter's provided us with a solid start to fiscal year as we continue to meet our growth targets and drive our businesses forward. While we're facing some significant challenges due to economic headwinds, particularly in a couple businesses, we are confident in our standing from both a financial and strategic perspective and continue to believe we're positioned for growth in both the short and long-term.</p>
          <p>As Dave noted, our results continue to be driven by our Cable channels business, which delivered $1 billion dollars in operating income in Q1. In the U.S. our strength in this segment was pretty much across the board. Fox News continued its strong performance, ranking number one in total day and primetime viewers for the 43rd consecutive quarter. At FX, American Horror Story and Sons of Anarchy had spectacular season premieres, laying the groundwork for solid seasons ahead.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. Sports channels also had a solid first quarter. Most importantly, we finalized key agreements with Major League Baseball and NASCAR that will collectively serve as a foundation for both our Cable and Broadcast businesses for years to come. In a world of increasing fragmentation and growing digital technologies, we believe key must-have content is more important than ever. Equally, I want to emphasize that we only make financial commitments like this where we're confident we can create real incremental value. We are very excited about the long-term growth potential of the broad and diverse mix of the must-have leading channels we're building.</p>
          <p>Internationally, our channels are on target and continue to execute well in spite of the economic woes in Europe and the adverse consequences of the strong dollar on our results. At STAR in India, our results are in line with our expectations, although down from a year ago, as we ramp up the sports business discussed last quarter and as we feel the impact of a weak rupee. We continue to be very excited about the long-term growth potential for our international businesses and believe they are stronger competitively than ever before.</p>
          <p>Our creative businesses continue to develop award-winning films and television shows across every genre, posting exceptional box office and ratings numbers and building loyal fan bases around the world. In fact, our TV studio recently won both the Best Drama and Best Comedy Emmys for Homeland and Modern Family, respectively. With those series, as well as traditional stalwarts like Sons of Anarchy and Glee, plus new franchises, like New Girl and American Horror Story, we continue to have a great pipeline of product for traditional syndication in cable outlets, as well as the ever-growing collection of digital distribution outlets. The digital market, both in the U.S. and abroad, continues to be a real area of growth, particularly for unique hit content.</p>
          <p>Our film studio is also well positioned. In the first quarter, Ice Age: Continental Drift was a worldwide box office hit and a testament to the growing strength of our Blue Sky studio, which has become a clear leader in the growing Animation segment. We're now gearing up for a great one with Taken 2, having grossed more than $300 million and the critically acclaimed Lincoln and Life of Pi waiting in the wings. We also continue to build additional distribution opportunities for feature films. Our recent ground-breaking digital HD initiative for advanced electronic sell through of Prometheus was a success and bodes well for more innovative opportunities to reenergize the Home Entertainment segment over the next few years.</p>
          <p>In our Broadcast business, our results have been mixed this fall. On the positive side, we continue to be on track with our goal of building a dual revenue stream business through both retransmission and reverse compensation with our affiliates. Our stations continue to do a great job maximizing margins and market share. However, our fall entertainment launches have been below our expectations and the four-game World Series was clearly not what we had hoped for. Nonetheless, we're focused on initiatives to build on some of our key franchises and look forward to the return of a refreshed American Idol in January and dynamic upcoming new series like The Following starring Kevin Bacon.</p>
          <p>The advertising markets have also been mixed. Political spending's exceeded expectations, while the base local ad markets were a bit softener in the first quarter, with trends down in the mid-single digits excluding political ads. Q1 was also adversely impacted by the Olympics. Second quarter looked a bit better with post-election results tracking up in the mid-single digits from a year ago. Nationally, we're still seeing broadcast scatter at a modest premium job-front pricing and National Cable is a bit stronger than National Broadcast. It is still clearly, however, a market with very limited visibility.</p>
          <p>Two businesses where we're clearly feeling the impact of economic woe is with SKY Italia and Australian Publishing. In Italy, a decline in subscribers, coupled with the weak euro and the one-time cost of the London Olympics made this a uniquely challenging quarter. And we assume the economic challenges are going to continue. Therefore our plan is to stabilize profits in the short term by focusing on quality subscribers to limit churn, and reduce programming and operating cost to the level appropriate for our current subscriber base.</p>
          <p>Our competitive position continues to strengthen as others struggle in the market, so we remain bullish in the long-term potential for this business. And when the market improves, we will be well positioned for growth from a streamlined base.</p>
          <p>In Australia Publishing, the decline in displaying classified advertising has clearly hit these businesses. As discussed previously, we have major plans already being undertaken by our management team to address these shifts. Most of our other businesses are pretty much on target. In the UK we're recognizing the benefits of the Sunday Edition of The Sun, while at HarperCollins we're realizing gains from the Thomas Nelson acquisition. That said these businesses continue to face challenges stemming from lower advertising revenues as readers continue to migrate to digital platforms.</p>
          <p>In closing, I'd like to emphasize that despite the challenges I outlined News Corporation is in a unique position to face challenging macroeconomic issues head on and to continue growing our core businesses while taking advantage of new opportunities wherever possible. We will continue to address off balance sheet assets as illustrated by our recent CMH agreement and we'll also continue to address our capital structure through initiatives like buybacks and strategic investments to strengthen our core businesses. As the company progresses towards its planned separation we are convinced our businesses are ideally positioned as leaders in providing the best in news and entertainment to our customers while delivering the greatest possible returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.</p>

          <p>Thank you Dave and Chase. Operator, now we'd like to take questions from the financial community, please.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our calls immediately from the financial community, then we'll move on to the press. And in interest of time we ask that you limit yourself to one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, this call is just for the financial community. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me. Our first question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks. Two questions, I guess one for Dave and one for Chase. If I look at your Other segment, even if I add back the one-time items that you talked about in the release, the $67 million, the $5 million and the $15 million, there's still an operating income loss of $120 million. And that did widen year-over-year. So I'm wondering if we could just take a step back and maybe remind us what's in that Other segment? Is it thin losses that continue? And what can you guys do to try to bring that segment to break even over time?</p>
          <p>And then second question is just bigger picture for Chase. Now wondering if you could update us on sports globally? You guys have been successful on your strategy of acquiring sports rights in different countries and leveraging those rights for higher affiliate fees internationally. Just wondering if you could update us on your efforts in that way? And what we should expect from that strategy moving forward? Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Anthony &#x2013; I'll deal with the Other. What's in other Anthony is principally, it's our head office, it's our education business, which I mentioned. And it includes our executive comp. And our executive comp what's slightly different than some others in that any of the related compensation that's related to our stock is mark-to-market. So to the extent that we have an increase in our stock price, that compensation is mark-to-market. And in this case our stock has improved significantly. So we've got a bit of a hit in the current quarter for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess in terms of sports, I mean obviously some of the recent deals I talked about we just saw and really, like in the U.S., the baseball and the NASCAR deals are new and just implemented. But I think the U.S. really for us, we're pretty much on track where we want to be. We think sports as I said in the opening comments are an increasingly important part of particularly building up real dual revenue business. And in a world that gets &#x2013; has more and more choices and more and more technologies, we think sports become ever increasingly valuable. And so we think it gives us an opportunity really to build all our businesses across the channels and really have a breadth of strength.</p>
          <p>Same theme is really true internationally. Most of the international initiatives other than the ones tied to the SKY platforms are pretty new. We're probably less than a year into Latin America. That's ahead of plan. In Asia, we're really just launching. It was just the first quarter in India. I think we're just closing now the ESPN STAR transaction. So we don't &#x2013; so we really haven't even &#x2013; I don't actually think we've closed it yet. So that is closing. I think the initial results of India we feel good about, we're very much in line with our expectations. Sports in Europe in the SKY platforms continue to be a critical part of that business, a place like Germany we launched the Sports News Channel a year ago. That's been a real success for us.</p>
          <p>The key rights we have acquired have certainly been an important part of building a platform like that. And I think as we look that at the SKY businesses, we think those sports have been critical to their growth and continue to really deliver what we expect. And I think we look for new opportunities. I think we announced a deal to take the Dutch football rights. That deal is still awaiting approval. But again, I think it's a transaction where they give us an ability to take those sports rights include them in a broad package of programming and really drive all our channels forward. Where we've had a chance to execute on that around the world, it certainly I think is very much delivering what we expected or more. Again, a place like Latin America is probably the one that at least has a year under its belt, the other platforms, the SKY platforms have actually been at it for a while and certainly it's been critical to their success and growth in the UK, in Germany, in Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we go to the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thank you. I guess a couple of quick ones. When you think about the profits for FIC, given the increase in sports, which is a very clear strategy, and the FX headwinds, have you changed your outlook at all for your goal that you've outlined? The $1 billion in profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I think it depends where the maturity of that is. It's certainly, in some of them like Latin America, because we're a year into it, it will be incremented. That would probably be on top of the $1 billion dollars. In some of the other places you'll probably have a couple of years of building costs. I mean right now, India will be a process where we're investing in building the sports business for a couple of years and really the gains come a couple years down the road. So yes, I think we haven't even started in Asia yet, we don't take possession of that probably until the end of the year, so in a couple years we'll still be in the early stages of it. So clearly a change of the perspective. I think if you look two years from now, you'll have some places that are mature enough to really be an incremental addition to it. You'll probably have others where we're still in the building process of building those sports franchises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Chase I'd love to get your point of view of what do you think is happening with viewers overall? I mean, some networks have very strong ratings. Many, many are down. It mean it really does seem like appointment viewing is a thing of the past. How are you guys thinking about it in terms of how you capture these viewers? What are the discussions like with Nielsen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I mean, I think there is no question that you are seeing an ongoing going change in how people view this content. I think the content viewership is actually as strong as it's ever been. In some ways it's stronger than it's ever been. I think the ability to access content when you want, where you want, multiple platforms, out of the home, in the home, makes this content more valuable. But the fact of the matter is people are watching in a lot of different places not just linear networks. Linear networks I still think are going to be tremendously important launching pads to the product but people are watching it on DVRs and digital platforms and on VOD inside the home. As I said, outside the home.</p>
          <p>And I think we need to continue to work with Nielsen and others to figure out how do we first measure that viewership. Clearly, parts of it like VOD after three days or mobile platforms aren't being measured and we need to get it measured. We need to make sure we continue to find ways to make sure we're getting &#x2013; I think the dual revenue stream obviously becomes increasingly important. TV Everywhere becomes a part of that to make sure you've got business &#x2013; you've got abilities to get rewarded for that viewership wherever it is. Some of it's going be through subscription based payments. Some of it's going to be through accum-ing advertising. We need to do both. We need to make sure we find ways to continue to maximize the value of that through things like dynamic ad insertion to make advertising more valuable. I think all of these are really opportunities for us to continue to grow this business.</p>
          <p>Again I think this actually is a real opportunity because this content gets more valuable, more popular, more important. But we need to make sure we continue to grow the business models that enable us to get rewarded for creating and distributing great content.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two for Dave on guidance. Can you talk a bit about what your expectation is for Fox networks for the rest of the year? Within your guidance do you assume it gets better with the ratings? Or are we assuming this is the way it's going to play out for the entire fiscal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think as we look at the ratings, look at the guidance, we're off to a really good start on the Cable. And at the Film business, we've got some ups and downs across all the businesses. But we feel very good about where the guidance is. And we have the &#x2013; obviously we know where we are after where the ratings have been, and we know where we are after the World Series. And I think that's pretty much all we're going to really say about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we take a realistic view of what we think will happen. As I said, we recognize we're below our expectations, certainly in the fall, both through Entertainment and the World Series. I think we're realistic about that. We've got some things coming. But it's a realistic set of assumptions about where we'll be.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then let me ask one more follow up on the Dreamworks impact. Is there anything else besides just P&amp;A expense that you're highlighting? Is there any other cost? Or that is what you're calling out, the effect of P&amp;A in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the effect, the timing effect of the P&amp;A. Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just happens the first, well it's not the first film, really it's the second film. But it is like released early July so you got all the P&amp;A in front and you got the release right behind it. We recapture everything on a first dollar basis. So it's just the reality of the way the accounting of our year-end works.</p>

          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>It comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was hoping &#x2013; a couple questions. One on film to follow up. You made obviously some changes in the studio management team. I was wondering if you could talk to strategically why and how to think about how directionally you may change with the changes? And related to that, kind of why Dreamworks Animation? What really drove that deal in your mind? What was so important about that deal for you?</p>
          <p>And then just, Rupert's been tweeting about Penguin. The press has said you're a buyer of Tribune and the L.A. Times. I guess just anything you could comment on in terms of your ambitions to grow acquisition-wise on the publishing side would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Long ago I learned not to comment on Rupert's tweets, but. On the film business, there isn't a shift &#x2013; there's not a shift in strategy and direction. You know how I feel about change but I think these businesses at times it's, for both sides it's the right thing to sort of give it some fresh perspectives. And I think change, stability is good and at times change, it's good for both. And but I think it's really continuing where we've been. For Dreamworks, look it's, we think that product is a great event product and a great worldwide product. We clearly have a, what we think a uniquely strong global distribution operation. It enables us to create incremental value out of that. And I think this is a business that really benefits from having a broad set of hit products. And we can make money off it. So it's not, I don't think, it's not rocket science. I think what we look to get out of it is make some real profits and have some hit films that we think can really strengthen our business. And we value the relationship with Dreamworks and look forward to working with them.</p>
          <p>I'm not going get too deep into all the rumors on what we're buying or what we're looking at. We always seem to be the topic of the day when it comes to a rumor of some transaction. We were quite clear on a couple of them, of where we are. I think those comments on some of them &#x2013; at least one of the ones you mentioned speaks for itself. The reality is, a lot of times what we're associated with just isn't true. They're sometimes kicking the tires on things. Obviously we should look at some things. But I'm not going to get into commenting transaction by transaction, rumor by rumor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And in terms of just from the Publishing business is there &#x2013; looking at Rupert's comment that you would expect &#x2013; I think you said on the call, maybe Dave said it, that you thought that you'd be relatively similar in profitability year-over-year in fiscal 2013. Is that still accurate despite what happened in Q1?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say that our overall Publishing segment would be down year-over-year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks so much. The &#x2013; let's see if you can cover this, but it seems like we get a daily email speculating News Corp's going to buy something. Any update on the level of M&amp;A appetite that management has right now, especially given the ongoing split process? And then I have a follow up for Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean I probably don't have a lot to add to what I just said. We're not &#x2013; I agree with you. We are &#x2013; there is a daily rumor. And I don't think we're making a practice on commenting on the daily rumors. So as I said, a lot of them are not true. There are a lot of places &#x2013; they're places where we think we should kick the tires on things, unless they're places where we think we can add something that makes sense for us. But our focus is really on building and growing our businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry if I missed that, if you had already answered that. So Chase, maybe this question's a bit unfair, but you talked, in answer to Jessica's question about how the TV business needs to change to capture monetization of usage as it moves more from live broadcast into the on-demand streams. And we've been hearing this from sort of all the media management for a couple years now. Why is so hard to change the TV business? And how big a priority is it for News Corp. right now? Is that this year's problem? Next year's problem? Any sort of context around the pace of change would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean I do think business has changed. I mean, I guess, look, one of the things I cited that is important to dealing with the world we're in is making sure you're building dual revenue businesses that are not solely dependent on advertising, they're &#x2013; they have the other leg of subscription revenues. And certainly our growth in retransmission speaks to it. So I think there are aspects to it. We actually today are monetizing our digital viewership in ways we weren't a year ago, so we're doing some of that. We are working with Nielsen, as you said, to continue to expand the measurement tools, things like TV Everywhere. As our transactions come up I think there are ways for us to create and we're sort of putting that &#x2013; I've said before, and we'd probably still say we're somewhat frustrated by the speed or the lack thereof of growth and implementation and execution of TV Everywhere. But certainly it's moving forward and I think that's important as a business model. Hulu, we're taking the Hulu+, which is a way to monetize and sort of create revenues for accessing content on mobile platforms.</p>
          <p>So you know I actually do think we're doing things. We're not &#x2013; we've got a lot more to do and clearly a lot of opportunities that we still have to develop, but &#x2013; and we're not where we should be on some things like TV Everywhere, so I'll acknowledge it's &#x2013; there's work to do. But I think we got a lot going on and I think we've made real headway on a number of fronts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So dynamic ad insertions sort of have to follow TV Everywhere, right? You have to get those deals done and then maybe that starts to become the conversation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we haven't been &#x2013; dynamic ad insertion, we certainly can't &#x2013; we can't do alone. You need &#x2013; I think everybody recognizes the opportunity inherent in it. There certainly are efforts trying &#x2013; in place to try to start to develop it and I think everybody, again, would like to see it evolve. Yes, it's part of a broader set of discussions, but everything's sort of intertwined. And I think that one &#x2013; that one I think is a win-win for all and hopefully we can find ways to move it forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions. First on retransmission agreements and the length of the contracts there. Some of your peers that have entered into long-term sports rights agreements, they also have entered into long-term retransmission or cable affiliate agreements as long as 10 years. I guess my question is, when you look at the deals that you've done on the sports side, would you also like to enter into those long-term type agreements? Or do you think that limits your flexibility too much going forward?</p>
          <p>And then second, just over on Latin American sports, there's a couple of big events coming up over the next four years between the World Cup and the Olympics. Will you participate in those events, and how will you &#x2013; how does that help your business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of retransmission, our goal and our &#x2013; what we've done to date is to try to keep agreements shorter rather than longer. They're all multi-year agreements, obviously, but we would refer and we strive to keep the agreements short. We believe content is increasingly important and we'd rather be able to continue to have the flexibility to get rewarded for being successful in creating great content and franchise the brand. So that's &#x2013; directionally that's where we've tried to go and that's where we look to go and that's where we've been successful to date in going.</p>
          <p>In terms of Latin America, I'm not going to probably &#x2013; I don't think it's ever the right thing to sort of speculate on individual franchises before they're &#x2013; you know, we don't &#x2013; before they're there. I think we evaluate an array of them. Yes, I think the backbones to those &#x2013; the backbones to those channels have been probably more regular season sporting events. But I think if we can strike the right deals in the right places we'd certainly look at it. But we don't have any arrangement with the Olympics today down there. And that's &#x2013; again, we'll see where the world takes us. But we like the properties we've got in Latin America; we're significantly ahead of our plans and I think we'll continue to focus on the path we're on. But not &#x2013; I don't want to get down the road on speculating on individual rights we don't have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just back on the first question then on re-transmission. Is it safe to assume then that you feel that the increases that you should get over time for re-trans, the value of your network should increase at a greater rate than the increases that are in these long-term sports contracts that you're entering into?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, look, I think it's &#x2013; and I've said it before so I mean yes &#x2013; we have &#x2013; we feel good about the re-transmission revenue stream we've built, but the reality is I don't think on any competitive basis, if you look at all the other channels out there, there's no question we're not getting rewarded comparatively for the value of the Fox network. And I think we've taken a real step forward. We've said &#x2013; we're looking to get what we think is something the market could manage, and moves us in the right direction. But it certainly is not competitively comparable to what other channels get given the breadth and importance of the programming that exists on the Fox Network.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we do have Mr. Juenger back online. Please repeat your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. Sorry about the technical difficulties. So I had one and a half questions if I would. So what about the cash? So you ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash from the balance sheet, some of that's from NDS and I think a new note you issued. I know, Chase, I believe you've said before that you &#x2013; I think you need about $3 billion sort of liquidity at steady state. So I don't know if there's any &#x2013; if there's blanks you can fill in between the $12 billion and the $3 billion that you might help us sort of run it out.</p>
          <p>And the half a question that I'd like to accompany that is just if you can be so kind as to talk about the role of the dividend in that answer. I think it's yielding less than 1% now. And I know you have a preference for buy-backs at share price but it seems like you could argue you could have room for both and. So love to hear your thoughts on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I guess the &#x2013; and I &#x2013; a couple of comments. One, we're in the process of completing just &#x2013; the acquisition in Australia, that alone is a $2 billion acquisition. So that is obviously on the short-term.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have the continuation of our buy back over the course of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and so we've got events in place. You know, that being said, I think we said before, recognize it doesn't get us to where I said, which was $2 billion to $3 billion of cash and up 2 to 2.5 times leverage. So I would say yes there are clearly there &#x2013; there are events that are on the short-term, on a very short-term horizon against that $12 billion.</p>
          <p>I don't want to get too &#x2013; again, more recently what we said, with the split coming, we don't want to get too far down the road ahead of having those two companies in place, balance sheets established, Boards in place for each, that enable each to come out with an appropriate picture. Obviously we're splitting the businesses because they're going to be businesses with different profiles and different needs and I think until we get there, I think it's probably better for us to describe where we go from there once those things are achieved. And I think that would include the dividend statement. I mean I think the dividends &#x2013; dividends should be a part of the mix of our discussions, they have been with buybacks. I think we've with our stock undervalued, I think we have looked at buybacks as a better path to returning cash to shareholders than dividends, but they should be a part of the conversation. But I think before we &#x2013; but I think with the split becoming more and more imminent, I think it's more appropriate for us to get the split and have the discipline to get the split done and then address where we go from there with the two separate balance sheets.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick question on the Fox Business, it seems to be getting some ratings traction during the September quarter. Wondering whether, Chase, if you could give us an update there and whether you have any plans for more extensive use of the Wall Street Journal content in the Cable space next year?</p>

          <p>Yes, actually the Fox Business Channel has made nice strides. I mean we still have some distribution issues we have to deal with. It's not distributed as widely as we'd like it, so we have to deal with that. It's making nice strides in ratings. I mean I just got to looking the other day at, it was Lou Dobbs I think beat his counterpart at CNBC in his time period. So they still got some nice momentum to that business. This channel will be profitable this fiscal year, so it's on a good track. We've got to continue to build, fill out the distribution. We've got good distribution but not the full distribution we need. But we think we have paths to addressing that in the reasonable short-term, in the next year or two.</p>
          <p>So it's on a good track and we feel very good about it and we feel good about the progress we've made there and the opportunity to continue to build that business. And look, we've got a great team leading the Fox News group. The results they've got speak for themselves and we have tremendous confidence in their ability to, as they did with building Fox News, to really continue to distinguish the Fox Business as a really exciting sister channel to the Fox News one. What's your second point?</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to track back on the issue of advertising, please, in the most recent quarter and in the current quarter. Could you give us a view again, please, stripping out all of the political and Olympic impacts, why do you think advertising was soft in the quarter just completed? And why do you think it might get better now in calendar Q4 year fiscal Q2, please? And I'm talking both Broadcast and Cable, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's tough to strip out the Olympics. I mean it's sort of I can strip out &#x2013; it's easier to identify political. So I do think for calendar Q3, clearly the Olympics, I mean stripping out political, the Olympics, a lot of money got in that period got stuffed into the Olympics. Again, that would be a more subjective valuation and I'd probably not do it but it's just a fact. I think in looking at calendar Q4, we're not even halfway through, so we're sort of looking at what we're seeing today. It's not a sort of &#x2013; yes some of it's assumptions on what will happen, I mean as I said, you get pretty short-term time horizons towards it, but we get reasonably, certainly we get a level of visibility to a quarter that we're close to the middle of, where they are.</p>
          <p>And look, I'm not saying that this quarter is rocking and rolling. I think the quarter's a bit better than it was last quarter. But underlying it I think you have an economy that clearly has limited visibility. I think a lot of &#x2013; I think there is some degree of people waiting for the election, year-end sort of what happens as you go through some of the events, the fiscal cliff and the like. And so I think you've got a market that is pretty reserved at this point, and pretty cautious and limited visibility. So yes I think if you tried to take the Olympics out of it, I wouldn't say there's a dramatic difference between Q3 and Q4. I'd say Q4 is a bit better. But I think the markets overall are okay. Not great. Not bad. But are okay, but that's it. I take a fairly cautious view of the world and a pretty short-term view of things.</p>

          <p>Okay and what was your comment on the scatter market in the current quarter? You said something. I just missed it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I said on the scatter market we're still getting a modest and on the Broadcast side we're getting a modest premium to the upfront pricing. So &#x2013; again that continues to be okay. We felt good about the upfront so we're getting a modest premium. We're probably &#x2013; and we're getting a better premium in the National Cable side, that's a mix of channels, but the channels, we're getting double digit scatter premiums with channels there. So the National Cable's a bit stronger than the Broadcast &#x2013; I mean the national scatter's a bit stronger than the &#x2013; National Cable scatter's a bit stronger than the National Broadcast scatter.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. My question is about your comments on SKY Italia in the prepared section. If I understood correctly, we're talking about the right-sizing the cost structure and to reflect the revenue opportunity there now. And if I'm correct, what kind of margin do you have in mind? If my model is correct, I think the peak margin was around 11%, 12% for SKY Italia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm really not going to get into that type of precision on margin. And your general assumption is right. I mean, look, we assumed, we're on track to have a higher subscriber count than we do today, that clearly affected the top line. I think we assume the net &#x2013; the subscriber growth will be reasonably &#x2013; our subscriber level will be reasonably flat for this year. I think with that in place we want to move to deal with both our operating cost and programming costs. Fortunately they're mostly on programming side where things are not very long-term and really get the cost reset for the revenue base, so we've got a lean business that as the market improves we can take advantage of it.</p>
          <p>And I think in some ways we can take advantage of the fact that while the market's impacting everybody, I think &#x2013; I do really believe our competitive position continues to improve. And in some ways as the strongest player in the market where a lot of people are struggling., there should be opportunities for us to take advantage of that intelligently while continuing to improve our financial position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to say that your current contracts, programming contracts and so on they would allow you to see a cost rationalization by next fiscal year already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean obviously we have a lot of programming contracts. They're not &#x2013; it's not all one. There are certainly ones that go past next year. They're not &#x2013; we have multi-year contracts, but we don't have long-term contracts. That's the nature of the business. It's like the agreement that started earlier in the year is on the soccer rights, is &#x2013; we're in the first of three years. So there's some that go for a couple years, there's some that are shorter than that. There aren't a lot of long-term contracts there. But we can certainly make strides this year. Make strides next year.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I guess, Chase, you commented more than once about how your broadcast re-transmission fees still seem to have a lot of upside compared to what the broadcast networks offer the consumer. I'm wondering if you just look more broadly across all of your cable networks and see, are there other networks where you see particularly large opportunity? And in particular I'm interested in comments regarding RSNS and the upside that they might have compared to comparable properties if there are any in their markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we haven't really had a large group of channels. And I probably, usually put them in a couple of buckets. I think there are channels that are uniquely strong within &#x2013; uniquely strong or with unique programming. And I think unique programming becomes more important than ever. Again, it's in a fragmented world. And certainly something like Fox News, as we've said before, we've made real headway, but I think Fox News continues to be a channel that is as important as any to a segment out there in the marketplace and we should get fair value for the importance that Fox News has.</p>
          <p>Sports we think becomes increasingly important and it's important for us to get &#x2013; to continue to generate fair value for those sports rights.</p>
          <p>I think there are channels like National Geographic where I think the opportunity for us is really to tap into something that &#x2013; we've got new management in place, they actually had an event that did really well on Sunday night, but tap into an opportunity to really build that channel to what it can be. And I don't think we have done that. I think we've got some national sports channels that really have been sort of below the radar screen and I think we've got enough breadth and the right franchises to really build them into something that can be special for us.</p>
          <p>So I think we've got properties. I think we've got &#x2013; identified strong franchises where we've got to continue to get value, we got room to do that, we've got channels that in all honesty aren't taking advantage of, that aren't really probably achieving what we think they can achieve. We've got some channels that we probably haven't strategically focused on enough and we're going to do some things to get value there. And I think channels like FX just continue to get stronger with more distinct programming than anybody else in that sector, so. Yes, I think it's a matter of getting fair value for unique content. I think we've got great content, great unique content. And probably in many ways, equally exciting, a number of franchises that haven't really been developed to anything close to their full potential. So that's where the growth comes from.</p>
