        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good afternoon. We are proud to be able to report excellent operational and financial performance in 2011. We reached record production in iron ore, pellets and coal, and we would like to highlight especially our record in Caraj&#xE1;s, our main sources for capacity expansion. Base metals, nickel and copper also had their best performance in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our financial performance was outstanding. better than ever before. We broke records for operating revenues, operating income, operating margin, cash flow generation and net earnings despite the high volatility in Europe. We think that the result was unbelievable. We are fully committed to value creation with efficiency in management of capital, a fundamental element in reaching that goal.</p>
          <p>Five new projects were completely in 2011. On&#xE7;a Puma, Oman, Moatize, Estreito, and Karebbe whose potential for growth with value creation we'll materialize mainly during 2012, 2013.</p>
          <p>We have to point out that we have obtained a permit to operate the N5 South area, the first operating license for mining at Caraj&#xE1;s since 2002. We have invested US$18 billion in sustaining an organic growth of our operation. We have returned to our shareholders $12 billion, and be $9 billion in dividends and $3 billion through share buybacks. Our investment in corporate social responsibility amount US$1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And now it is time to say thank you very much to our shareholders, our employees, customers, suppliers and communities. Thank you very much. We are open for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the call. So my first question is related to the environmental permit that you got on the N5 South mine. So I just wanted to understand what is going to be the impact on this on your production or what could eventually be the CapEx to open the new mine? And if these licenses in any form relates to the licenses that you are trying to get in the Serra Sul mine? Or if this N5 South pit would have the same issues, like caves or the biodiversity issues that you found in Serra Sul?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to the total CapEx that you talked about for the next few years. In your presentation, you mentioned that you are currently investing in 20 different projects that is going to consume something like $48 billion of CapEx. Should we assume that this is some kind of a guidance that you have for the CapEx in new projects for the next five years? Or can be this number be a much higher? And if or when you include or add any new projects to this pipeline? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as N5 assets, Martins will speak into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as N5 assets, we got finally the approval. We already made all the first moving, and we are preparing for mining. We already start mining. There is a very good mine. The iron ore is in the surface, high quality. You don't need it to concentrate, so it's very promising. For the time being, this mine will not impact the volumes. Because we have some restrictions, some constraints in the logistic side. So even if you produce more, we are not able to deliver it, for the time being.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, that mine will help us improve quality a lot, because it's a very high quality. And as I told you, is a mine that has iron ore is in the surface. So you always have the best ore on the surface. As you'll go down, the quality starts decreasing. So this mine will help us a lot. We are waiting for this since 2004. And finally, we got this license, and we are moving very fast in bring it to operation.</p>
          <p>The investment to prepare the mine is very smooth, talking about the $50 million. All the other investment was already done. The Plus 40 project and the Plus 20 project are already prepared to get this ore and process it. So it will be very good for the company. This development will help reduce cost. Will help to increase quality. And when you have the streamline in the logistic side, then we're going to have additional production, which means to push Caraj&#xE1;s to produce 150 million tons per year, since we completed the investments that we are doing in the logistics side.</p>
          <p>So we are very, very I would say optimistic about this. And I think it's a breakthrough, because for many, many years, we are not able to get any approval or any license. So we see a much better landscape on this subject. But talking about this environmental issues, I think Vania could be in best position to explain what we are doing, how we are moving all over this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Felipe. We are doing tough work regarding environmental issues here. We have conducted a review in our studies, and we are very confident that the new projects that were sent to the environmental agents, they are all in very good condition. We can assure that the studies are ready, are well done and well reviewed. So we are very confident that by the beginning of the next year, we are going to have the license, the necessary license and permits to start going forward in our projects, mainly in S11D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, it's Tito speaking. Regarding the question about the CapEx, what we have in our presentation, the $48.1 billion refers to the 20 major projects. Of course, this is a number that change from time to time based on the projects that we have already approved in our board. The project will be implemented during the time being. What happened is, as you know, we have a list in the release of the main projects. Those are the projects that as we have already announced before, the projects that we want to show more transparency about them. The projects that we are committed to deliver. So we cannot forecast today what is the number that we will be showing in one year time, because we will only be showing those projects that will be approved and we will be with the proper permits to be implemented. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Rohr from Morningstar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question, gentlemen. So my question concerns iron ore cash costs. So by my calculations, unit cash costs for iron ore were up about 22% over the prior year at about $35 a ton versus $29 a ton. Looking at the quarterly numbers, unit costs marched higher pretty much every quarter throughout the year, peaking at about $38 in the fourth quarter. It looks like the real was only 5% stronger versus the dollar for the year, so translation effects probably weren't a big deal. I'm hoping you guys could discuss the drivers of the unit cost increase and how we should think about cash costs trending in the first quarter from $38 a ton in the fourth quarter. And given that the new collective bargaining agreement only came into effect in November, do you think we're looking at a sequential unit cost increase in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try to explain this in a simple way. What happened is we saw, along the year a cost increase, most caused by external factors like exchange rate, okay. So what happened is, at some point during the year, the exchange rate has a huge impact in our costs. And the last quarter, what we had was exactly as you mentioned, the new labor contract here in Brazil, which increased the labor cost in Brazil 8%. And addition to that, we also have extra bonus that was paid, retention bonuses paid to all employees based in Brazil. It will not happen again.</p>
          <p>Which it means that if you look at what we have in terms of increasing costs in the operations, direct related to the operations, would be the labor. Of course, we are trying to compensate it through other measures. So what I can tell you right now is we are looking deeply in what we can do in order to have costs back at the same level we had, in terms of average, in the previous year. I mean 2011. compensate. But we cannot control on a regular basis external factors which affect costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another point, Martins speaking, is another point which is important to consider is the grade of our production is very big. We are producing 300 million tonnes per year. And as I told you before, we have been not able to open new mines in the pace we would like to. So as you move deeper in the mines and you go more distance to mine, the cost tended to increase structurally. So it's very important that we can develop new mines to open new pits because that will be very beneficial to cost.</p>
          <p>So, and if I add that we just open it, you help a lot to reduce cost in Caraj&#xE1;s area. Because it's a surface mine, so you don't need it to move iron ore long distances. High qualities, very low ratio of strip, very low strip ratio. So all those factors will help us to reduce cost. I think to tackle the challenge to reduce cost structurally, we really needed to open new mines, and that's our main task that we are putting all our efforts. Because we have a labor, we have energy here and there. This is affect everybody.</p>
          <p>But you needed to be aware about your structural cost, because that will really impact your competitiveness because the other issues will affect our competitors also. So the structural cost is very important and is very important that we are able to open new mines, new pits to get this cost going down.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Rodolfo de Angele from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on something that was discussed in the previous call in Portuguese, where Murilo mentioned that in &#x2013; regarding the regulatory framework &#x2013; that we'd probably see it coming in two stages. And the initial stage would address mainly how concessions work. I was wondering if Murilo could comment a bit more if possible on that. What aspects that could change for good or for worse, in this sense? And if you can already comment on any consequences for Vale or for the industry as a whole?</p>
          <p>And my second question is just wanted to hear from you, if you could have &#x2013; give us an update on Vale New Caledonia? How is it moving on the ramp-up? That's all. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Rodolfo. Thank you very much for your question. I think that New Caledonia, you are doing very well, and our integrated phases is going smoothly. I think that we can see in three different phase, the first one of 20,000 tons per year and the second the same size as the first equally. We are working with the first phase. I think that the production is going to reach our level, the level that we wanted to see. And as far &#x2013; so far, so good. I think that finally we're seeing this project go ahead. And I hope to continue with the same way.</p>
          <p>Regarding our discussion, I think that we needed to &#x2013; regard our discussion mining &#x2013; the new mining law and the royalties. What we can say that we have two discussions. And the first one is about the new mining code that they want us to address, mainly about the license process, the new exploration, and all the permits that we needed to receive from the Brazilian authorities in this regard.</p>
          <p>The second one is about the royalties. I think that it's in a different stage, as far as I know. I think that the idea of the government in the first quarter of this year to send to the Congress the new mining code, and later on, to start the discussion about the royalty.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o from Ita&#xFA; Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. First question is regarding the difference between production levels which were quite strong in 2011 in sales volumes. If you could explain a little bit the main reasons for the difference. Nearly 24 million tons. And on the inventory build-up at the Oman &#x2013; at Oman &#x2013; how much do you think it's going to be the sustainable inventory level at that place? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Martins speaking. As far as production is concerned, in the production numbers, we are considering this, our share on Samarco production, okay. So we have around 12 million tons there. That is our part on the Samarco production. So our real production is around 310. So we haven't increased our inventories yet, because we have some constraints in logistics, as I said before. So the situation is that as long as we can free our logistic, capacity, a lot of this will be solved.</p>
          <p>As far as Oman is concerned, we expect to have the Oman no more than 1 million tons, considering raw material for the operation, considering tariffs already produced and some materials that we send then for blending. Because it works not only as a pelleting plant but also as a distribution center. We send ore from Caraj&#xE1;s area with ore from South area, and we blend there, in order to improve quality and to become more marketable. But we don't believe that we needed to have there a big amount of inventories.</p>
          <p>Another point is that we are moving ore from Brazil to Oman, based on big ships, 400,000 ton ships, which reduce cost a lot. So at the end of this, all of this additional operations could be self-financed or self-paid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can make a second question regarding volumes on base metals, how much do you expect on the ramp-up of volumes for copper from Tres Valles and Salobo? And also from nickel on On&#xE7;a Puma?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tres Valles, we will be producing 18,000 tons. We are almost there actually. We're still struggling a little bit with costs over there, but it should be addressed along the year. And Salobo, the startup is in April, the first phase, right? So we should be reaching the full capacity of the first phase by the end of next year, probably. And the second phase would be starting the beginning of next year. So should be in full capacity at the second half of 2014. Right? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On&#xE7;a Puma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, On&#xE7;a Puma is a &#x2013; second line is start operation at the beginning of the year. First ferronickel was produced at the end of January. And we should have the first line in fully capacity at the end of this year. And the second line, full capacity at the end of next year. So the full plant will be operating in full capacity at the end of the next year. The 53,000 tons.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. I just &#x2013; couple of quick questions. First on the iron ore side, I noticed you shipped the lot more to China and Asia, as a result of the European crisis. I guess I'm wondering if you expect that trend to continue? If we should see more iron ore volumes being shipped to China at the expense of Europe? Or if you see that sort of normalizing at some point this year. And how concerned you are with the build-up of iron ore at the Chinese ports.</p>
          <p>My second question is regards to coal. I noticed in the coal division there was another operating loss. And I guess I am wondering when you expect that to become profitable? Is it the operations in Mozambique, or is it more due to the Australian coal operations? Any clarity on that would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as our sales, the trend to Asia is unavoidable, okay. We have some contributory factors in Europe today that reduced a little bit the demand in Europe, but in spite of this, as time goes by, more and more volumes is going to Asia and is going to China. And that's the reason we developed our shipping strategy to cope with this reality, okay. We have a huge cost difference from shipping from Brazil to Asia than shipping from our competitors to Asia, so we needed to address this issue, and we are addressing it.</p>
          <p>I don't believe that this trend will change. In my view, it will be bigger and bigger. And this is reality that you have it to live with, okay. So it's unavoidable, and you needed to prepare for it. We don't have any other strategy. As you know, we have some initiatives to produce steel in Brazil in order to keep some market share in the Brazilian market. But it's not something that could change the whole trend.</p>
          <p>If you look how much we sell in Asia and how much we sell in Brazil, you can see that today Vale sells nearly 75% of our volumes in Asia and in Brazil. Europe and western world has not big impact on our sales, and I think this trend continues to move that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. John regarding to coal, Eduardo Bartolomeo speaking. We have a position here, as you already mentioned, because we had three different scenarios. One in Colombia was a very good year. We ramp up operations there, and it did very well. Australia, we had a very bad beginning of the year due to the rain in Queensland, and at the end of the year, we had a non-recurring effect of around contingency. But again, it's an operation that is improving.</p>
          <p>But the best news and I think the biggest one is Moatize. We finally ramp up the operations &#x2013; we are ramping up. We delivered the first coal in the last quarter. Of course, there is no results on that. There is pre-ops. But as we're looking now, the operations is improving very well. The mine is doing fine. The CHPP, the plant, the BCH is doing fine. The logistics is responding adequately to the processing now. Of course, there is a challenge on logistics. Everybody that follows coal closely knows that. But we're doing fine. I think was a transition year. In 2012, is going to be a very good year. And we are on budget so far.</p>

          <p>Hello, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. First question related to the Simandou project, if you could provide us an update on how conversations are ongoing with local authorities, it would be great. And also an update on the time out of the project? It's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, thinking about your assets in Corumbaense, we have recently seen some players aiming to develop more efficient logistic solutions to the region. I understand you have many growth options right now at other regions. I just wanted to hear your strategic views on the assets you have in Corumbaense, thinking on a more long-term perspective. Those are the two questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Murilo speaking. Thank you for your questions. In Guinea, our right in Zogota is coming on-stream this year. I am not saying that it will be a big number, but it's coming on-stream this year. But other side, you are still evaluating the effects of the new mining code in order to see the numbers in the economics of the projects regarding the Simandou. I think that we are doing a big analysis and having some discussion with the government. And we intend this to pursue a solution and to have a decision until the end of this year. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Corumbaense. As far Corumbaense, Martins speaking. It's one of the best lump ore available mine in the world, and can produce around 10 million tons to 15 million tons per year. If you can find a feasible logistic solution. I think everybody that owned this mine before we are trying to create this efficient logistic, which is not easy. Because the best option is through the river, and the river only works for six months per year. So then you have it to invest a lot in barges and systems to cope with the seasonality. But we are improving the situation. We are developing better the system. But we don't believe that there will be any other alternative better than the river.</p>
          <p>We have analyzed the railway system many times. You can do, but the cost is skyrocketing, okay. Because it's around a 2,500 kilometers distance. So if you go one side, it's very distance. The other side, you have to cross the Andes. So the way you look is the best mine in the world, but not in the best place. So we are working hard to have efficient logistic, considering transshipment in the end of the rivers, beginning of the ocean, in order to improve the economical of the system.</p>
          <p>For the time being, we are prepared to ramp up there, up to 6 million tons. But we believe that the final capacity, once we get this solution, logistic solution &#x2013; and depending also upon the iron ore price &#x2013; 50 million tons will be the most that we can produce there. About the other project we see around, okay, we are following up. But we have analyzed the same alternatives many times before, and we never found it feasible.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. My first question for you, Murilo, regarding tax liabilities, still on the same theme of the previous call. I mean you talked about the very low likelihood of any unfavorable decision regarding taxation of foreign subsidiaries. Can you just please provide us an update regarding also the setting dispute and how likely a loss year could be and the potential timing of this specific dispute on the royalties, please? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is for Tito Martins. Just regarding, it's more of a specific question, but just regarding SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter. I mean, we saw an increase by around 26% quarter-over-quarter. In the release, you mentioned higher administrative expenses, mainly services and personnel. Just wanting to add a little bit of clarity on that line, exactly what's driving it. Is it basically the projects that are coming in and still not contributing in terms of revenues? Or is there something else that has been driving this increase in SG&amp;A? Those are my two questions, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Leonardo. Thank you. As you know, there is a committee composed by Vale and DNPM in charge of all the discussions, in terms of value issues related to these discussions. And matter for sure is not easy. We're talking about almost 20 years involvement in terms of documentation and we need it to finalize all the discussion regarding the documentation. But we are doing in a goodwill. I think both sides, we are doing in a very goodwill. And I hope it will finalize in the first half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of your question about the SG&amp;A, you're right. Part of it actually increases, not only given to the increase in the personnel but to the labor contract, but also the operating expenses and some depreciation relate to the pre-operating expenses. So what happen is we have Salobo. We already have more than 1,000 employees pre-starting the project. We have Moatize happening in part of the year. We had also Puma. So a lot of new projects coming up, and that's why we saw some increase in costs without related revenues happening.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the call. I have a couple of questions. The first one on the Nacala Corridor. Last year you spend $38 million, only the project, and it's supposed to be ready by 2014. I just want to check if the provided guidance, in terms of timing, it's going to be completed, if that is still valid.</p>
          <p>And my second question is in Moatize itself. If you could give us guidance on the production for 2012 and beyond and the blend between thermal and coking coal? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Galib Chaim speaking. About Nacala Corridor, it's going very well. We have signed the last month an agreement, the concession agreement with the Malawian government. We already started the construction. We have hired the company to do it, and they are in the mobilization stage.</p>
          <p>And for the Nacala port and the greenfield of revenue in Mozambique is also is doing very well. We are in final negotiation with the CFEM. CFEM is the state owned company in Mozambique. And I believe that everything on track. We don't expect any delay on this project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the second question, Rodrigo, I already mentioned, Moatize project's doing very well, both on the mine and the village station part. It's on the budget. Our guidance is 4.8 million tonnes, and is again as I mentioned before aligned with our expectations of ramping up as the first year. The main challenge is logistics. And again, I think we achieved 11 million tons, as we planned.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my call. It's hard for me to understand, in China, when your Valemax boats try to go there, they don't offer the Capitano a cup of coffee and the crew some hospitality after the long journey. And you invest so diligently and try so hard to serve China that they should be very courteous to you, I believe. I have two questions. Can the boats ship corn or wheat or some other cargo? And second, why not take a big fraction of your iron ore CapEx budget and move into agriculture, where the customers are more likely to give your emissary a cup of coffee if he wants to visit?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse my humor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it. Well, look this is a game-changer strategy, okay. And you do not expect, when you go for a game-changer strategy, to have a easy way for you. I think the strategy is very good for China because we reduce the cost of ore. It's very good for Vale. But it takes times for people to understand it and to accept it. For the time being, the restrictions are mainly technical restrictions that we needed to cope with. They have concerns about the safety. They have concerns about not only the safety of the ship, but also the safety of the port. And you needed to solve these issues in order to berth. We haven't been working with them before.</p>
          <p>And to tell the truth, at the port level, the understanding was very good. But you know, that you have other interests that are not helping. And as they clearly stated in the press, the Chinese ship owners. But long term, big ships is an alternative for them. So it's part of their business. And I believe that as time goes by, all of this issue, it will be solved. For the time being, I can assure you that we don't need to move corn or wheat. Don't need.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, or fertilizer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even fertilizer, okay. But because we have the options, we are prepared to &#x2013; for alternative solutions. And as you know, China needs ore, and they need the ore. And I think as time goes by, all of these things we will be solved in a good manner. We needed to understand the present situation as a transitory situation, and we needed to cope with the Chinese regulations. When you go, even if you &#x2013; if someone asks you to drink a cup of coffee, you have to follow the rules. So we are waiting the cup of coffee, under the Chinese rules. And we believe that we are going to get there. So this is not &#x2013; it's a matter of concern for us, but it's not a matter of a high concern. We are addressing the situation. And we are not intended to move into agricultural, unless to sell fertilizers, okay. But that's so far we can go &#x2013; sell fertilizers.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Tony Rizzuto from Dahlman Rose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Listen, I just wanted to pursue China a little bit, because I think certainly the Chinese economy has started out a little bit perhaps more sluggishly than many people expected at this point. And I was wondering, what kinds of things are you looking at, to signal that that economy is indeed accelerating? And what gives you the confidence that that economy is going to accelerate here over the near-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just came from China. I spent 10 days in China last week, beginning of the last week until Monday. And I had a very good view what's going on in China. And they are really slowing down on the construction side, but all the other segments continues to work very well. And we are in the winter now. Normally in the winter, construction side is not so strong. But you can see that there is some liquidity issues for the flow of money for &#x2013; the construction sector was not that one that was used to be. So &#x2013; and the numbers about their GDP shows that there is a kind of a deceleration of their economy, but nothing that you can be too much concerned.</p>
          <p>We believe that at the end of winter period, which is very strong in China, some recovery will happen. I think the government is using the monetary policy very cautiously, but they are doing it. And we really hope that the second half will be much better. China continues to have a huge infrastructure needs, mainly on housing, and they needed to cope with. They have to build at least 10 million houses per year in order to cope with what they have now. So we are not so much concerned about China, although we believe that the growth will be not be that big that was used to be. And also, some impact will happen in the steel industry and the iron ore business. So steel industry will not go so fast, and iron ore consumption also.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, they have a high cost to produce the ore. And also some supply from India are being reduced. In 2009, India exported almost 120 million tons of iron ore. Last year, they export something like 75 million tons of iron ore. And they continue to reduce their export in order to cope with the domestic market. So we are low-cost producer. We are well prepared to keep production full capacity and delivering at the market price. And we believe that the market price has some resilience, based on the cost of local ore. So we are not so much concerned with this trend. We believe that we can continue to see for the ore we produce very reasonable price, considering our low-cost position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's fair to say, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:48) speaking, that we can see some numbers regarding the consumption is increasing. We note that in the first quarter of this year, the investment is maybe &#x2013; is not so good as could be expected. But I believe that the second quarter, mainly with this housing that the government will provide it to the people, it is 10 million houses, I think &#x2013; the 10 million house program. I think that will be in place with good results for the remainder of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a follow up question for Murilo. Murilo, what &#x2013; I noted in the results and in also recent latest news articles from Vale that it seems that the government is much more friendly to the company. You reiterated in the call that you do expect the license for Caraj&#xE1;s Serra Sul, the preliminary license to be exact, in the first half of the year. And there were many news in recent days that government would be supporting Vale in the Valemax issue with China. There were public statements by the government. So I just want to get your qualitative view of how this relationship improved in recent months or in the last year? Thank you very much.</p>

I think that what &#x2013; the scenario that I am working today is a huge corporation. We are doing all the information, and we are receiving heavy meetings in a very open and constructive way. The relationship is very good, and I have to say, just thank you for the cooperation and support that they are giving us.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone. Thank you very much for the call. I have two questions. I would appreciate it if you could elaborate on your strategy regarding facility upgrade in Asia. In the long term, what is the percentage of total sales you expect to take to the ground through such hubs and what is the expected impact on OpEx?</p>
          <p>And the other point refers to Vale's business units and strategy. As Vale's resource remain highly dependent on its metals division, and iron ore price may go down in the future, can we expect some M&amp;A activity in new business, in order to reduce Vale's export into this market? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat your first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe you start taking the ore to the ground in some transshipment facility in Asia, like the one in Philippines and Malaysia. So this is just the start. In the long term, what is your plan in terms of volume? What's the percentage of your total sales you expect to take to the ground, and how you expect OpEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the first question, we are building a logistic complex in Asia, based on distribution centers. One in Oman, Middle East. Another one in Malaysia. Middle East is already there. Malaysia is being built to be ready end of 2013, beginning of 2014.</p>
          <p>And also we have a trans-shipment station. The trans-shipment station is a way for us to reach smaller ports in Asia. Even today, we don't supply many customers in Asia because they buy based on Panamax vessels because they have small ports. And you cannot send small vessels from Brazil to Italy. The freight cost is too high.</p>
          <p>So we used our ideas with this trans-shipment stations to complement the alternatives we have with the distribution center, but also to move ore from the big vessels. You made 85% of the trip very efficiently, and when we arrive nearby the ports, you can move ore to the small vessels, even to barge, the small vessels even to go to the rivers, directly to the rivers, okay. So then we open a very big logistic option for our ore.</p>
          <p>As far as Malaysia and Oman, we only will put ore on the ground when we can blend it, in order to improve the quality and to add some value by improving quality. It's not our idea only storage ore in a distribution center like that. The idea is just have the opportunity for blending ore from the Caraj&#xE1;s area, which is much richer, with ore from the south area, which is less richer. So it's a comprehensive strategy that looks not only cost but look at also quality.</p>
          <p>Another point is important to look is, during the last financial crisis, as we don't have a logistical options, we needed to stop mining, okay. So during 2008 and 2009, we lost 65 million tons of production, because we have no place where to put the ore. We didn't have &#x2013; the other ports were completely full of ore. We don't have an area to storage in the mine. So we have no place to move the ore. So our comprehensive strategy looks quality, looks at cost, and also have a very smooth production all the time. As we have some constraints in logistics, it's very important, when the market is not so strong, very important for us to keep moving the ore, so we, even we can make the revenues later.</p>
          <p>So that is the whole picture that we are working on it. It's not only about China. China is important, because it's the main market that we are looking for. But you have the whole Asia and all other alternatives that we have in order to reduce costs, improve quality, and to increase our presence in Asia. Asia is the future market for iron ore. It doesn't matter what you do. It's in Asia that the market will grow, meaning China, India or any other countries in Asia, the market will grow there. So we are preparing ourselves for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your second question, I'm going to give you a broad answer, because actually if I had to enter into details, we will spend a lot of time here. What happened is we've been saying and stating everywhere that we want to actually grow in different fields, right. So that's why we are spending a huge CapEx in fertilizers. That's why we are building up new copper projects. That's why we are building up coal, new coal projects in Mozambique, in Australia.</p>
          <p>So the company intends and has a target to be a diversified company. What happens is, of course, iron ore will remain as the most important product for us. I would say that in the short term, our priority is to deliver the projects that we are &#x2013; we have in our pipeline today. We want to actually be able to deliver as soon as possible the Greenfield project, the Brownfield projects.</p>
          <p>M&amp;A is a possibility for the future. It is. It is not a priority. We are always open to opportunities. But we &#x2013; of course, we want to preserve the value of our assets and the value of our balance sheet. We don't want to go for a &#x2013; let's say joint ventures. We don't want to pay more than what we believe that they also should have as a value. I'll give an example. Last year, the Metorex was a very good example. When we had competition that was up to pay a price for the assets that we didn't believe that was the proper one, we gave up the competition. We were not in the tender anymore. So it's a possibility. But the priority today is our projects and to deliver what we have in our pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Murilo speaking. Just to remember, we have good projects for organic growth. I can &#x2013; just to remember, we have Serra Sul, it's a big investment. The project in Argentina, Rio Colorado. And our project, the expansion of Mozambique. I think that our priority at this point of time is to go ahead with this project, to have the right implementation, a good management, and to pay dividends. Just in case of some good opportunities, you look for M&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Raphael Biderman from Bradesco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, good afternoon, Murilo, Tito, and Martins. My first question is regarding Europe, how you guys perceived the drop in sales &#x2013; there was a drop in sales in the fourth quarter due to the crisis. How are you guys perceiving demand in Europe in January and February of this year? And if you have a guidance for 2012?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to M&amp;A. Just more of a very vague idea. We were just like updating our models on the indigenous mining companies in Australia. And again, we saw that they are developing their projects, and they have sizable tenements some of them, sizable reserves. Some of them lack a big group behind them to help them. Some of them already found a big group to help them.</p>
          <p>Would it make sense for Vale eventually to partnership with some of these companies, like BHP and Rio Tinto in the past was helped by the good iron ore of Vale, blending their iron ore, making them more feasible to market it? Wouldn't it be good for Vale to do it themselves and have some big mine project in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as Europe is concerned, it was not a really big drop in Europe in the last quarter, okay. Was a stabilization, but not a big drop. And we hadn't really had a very strong production in that quarter. So we have to send more to Asia, but it's not because Europe was not taking. It was very interesting, because if you look Europe before 2008 crisis and today, they are only 15% below. So they already have this low level of production. They never recovered. So I don't believe, even with these crises now, that the European market will go down so sharply. I think only a minor adjustment we will have &#x2013; you have in Europe. So I do not see such bearish scenario for iron ore and steel in Europe. It will be tougher. It will be not so dynamic. Probably there will be no growth. But I think the market in Europe will go sidelines. And we have to send more to Italy if you produce more. So that's the consequence.</p>

          <p>And Rafael, it in fact is our duty to analyze all the opportunities through junior companies. We know just in Toronto we have roughly 1,200 juniors companies. It's mandatory to analyze most of them, and to see if you have some opportunity. But again, you are fully committed with the projects that we have in hand. I think that we have a bright scenario looking for the future. Thank you very much for your question.</p>
