          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We would like to welcome everyone to Banco Bradesco's First Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>This call will be conducted by Mr. Milton Vargas, Executive Vice President and Investor Relations Officer; Mr. Domingos Figueiredo de Abreu, Managing Director; Mr. Marco Antonio Rossi, CEO of Bradesco Seguros; Mr. Samuel Monteiro dos Santos Junior, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Bradesco Seguros (Insurance); and Mr. Jean Philippe Leroy, Department Director.</p>
          <p>This call is being broadcasted simultaneously through the internet in the website www.  bradesco.com.br/ir.  In that address, you can also find the banner through which the presentation will be available for download.  We inform that all participants will only be able to listen to the conference call during the company's presentation.  After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  At that time, further instructions will be given.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Security's Litigation Reform act of 1996.  Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Banco Bradesco's management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, because they relates to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.  Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Banco Bradesco and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Milton Vargas, Executive Vice President and Investor Relations Officer.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Good morning and welcome to our conference call.  As expected, the economy slowdown continuing in the first quarter, impacting the credit market and impacting delinquencies.  Despite these uncertain scenarios, Bradesco posted a net income of R$1,723 billion, 13% higher than the reported net income of the first quarter of last year, equivalent to our return on average equity of 21%.</p>
          <p>As we will see later in this presentation, Bradesco's balance sheet structure and the improved risk prospects for financial investments, along with the good performance of our treasury operations and insurance group, plus the improvement in the efficiency ratio, were key factors in overcoming this period of difficulty.</p>
          <p>It is also worth noting that we improved our methodology for calculating allowances for our loan losses, provisioning R$177 million for credit card operations, related to cash in installments per share. This effect can be treated as a non-recurring provision.  These are grown out and further adjustments will occur in line with any changes in the calculation base.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, an amount of R$793 million was invested in infrastructure, technology and communications, with the inauguration of 16 full-size branches and 151 advanced service branches.  We intend to open around 92 new branches in 2009.</p>
          <p>On April 30, our market capitalization stood at R$76 billion and our preferred shares in ADRs recorded a year-to-date appreciation of 20 and 28% respectively.  Our strategy is focused on domestic earnings growth in order to take advantage of the potential of the Brazilian market, which we view as very attractive.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the floor to Jean Philippe, and I will be available for further details in the question-and-answer session.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning and good afternoon.</p>
          <p>Slide Three shows the main economic and financial indicators that impact our assets and liabilities.  In comparison with the fourth quarter, the most significant variations were in the S&#xE3;o Paulo stock exchange and FX rate indexes and the reduced number of working days.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Four.  In regard to the first quarter's '09 net income, the main highlights were: one, the constitution of civil provisions for economic plans totaling R$175 million; two, and the constitution of allowance for loan losses from credit card operations of R$177 million as previously mentioned by Milton, plus the R$68 million of excess of provisions.</p>
          <p>These events were partially offset by gains from treasury operations, a little bit higher than the historical average.  The net income of R$1.723 billion represents an annualized return on average shareholder's equity of 21%.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Five.  On Slide Five, I would like to call your attention to the improvement in our cost-to-income ratio, which reached 41.5%.  We are dedicated to improve this ratio even further.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Six.  Bradesco's assets reached R$482 billion, 6.1% higher vis-&#xE0;-vis to previous quarter, and the shareholder's equity stood at R$35 billion.  The capital adequacy ratio remained at a sound level of 16% in March 2009 indicating plenty room for growth without depending on new rights issues.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Seven.  The unrealized gains that you see in the slide amounted to R$1.293 billion in the first quarter of '09, showing a positive reversal of the mark-to-market effect of long-term fixed income securities.</p>
          <p>Emphasizing the footnote, where we are reminding all that the participation in Visanet, Serasa, the potential goodwill in real estate owned by Bradesco, plus the impact of the increase in social contributions, which create tax credits, are not included.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Eight.  In this slide, we show a breakdown of Bradesco's net income.  The reduced participation of loans was due to two factors, one, the lack of loan book growth and two, the increase in delinquencies in the first quarter.  The growth in securities was fueled by higher gains from treasury operations including the reversal of the market-to-market effects of credit default swaps of the Brazilian sovereign debt.  We expect loans and insurance to return to their respective historical relative participations of 26 and 33% from next year on.</p>
          <p>Slide Number Nine.  We present in this slide the summary of income statement showing the main variations, which we will be focusing with more details over the next coming slides.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 10.  Our net interest income grew by 14.8% in the quarter and by 26.6% year-on-year, basically due to volume growth of interest earning operations and higher non-interest earning from treasury gains, including the recovery of the mark-to-market effect of the CDS and the portfolio indexed to CPI, Consumer Price Index.</p>
          <p>Slide 11.  Next we show the historical behavior of the result of interest earnings in grey and non-interest earnings in red.  It is worth noting that, although the non-interest portion is relatively insignificant in comparison to the total, it unquestionably represents an important and stable part of our results.</p>
          <p>Slide 12.  Regarding the interest earning results, the slide shows their proportion in relation to the average assets reaching an annualized ratio of 7.2%.  We believe we will be maintaining the net interest margin over the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 13.  We show here the breakdown of the net interest income from interest-earning operations.  It is worth noting: one, the decline in funding due to the higher cost regarding CDI, the Interbank Deposit Certificate Rate; and two, the decline of the Selic itself.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 14.  To complete our net interest income analysis, on this slide we show a summary of our loan operations.  The grey portion refers to the gross margin, and it's basically the difference between the interest that we charge, interest rates that are charged from the customers, and the variation of the Selic, the Brazilian base rate.</p>
          <p>The red portion shows the evolution of allowances for loan losses, adding discounts and deducting the recoveries, which represents 56% of the gross margin in the quarter, confirming our expectations of an upturn in delinquency thus reflecting in the increase in interest rates from September 2008 on.  Reminding the footnote, where we are showing that the excess of provisions that we have been building over the last quarters were not included here.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 15.  On this slide, we show the evolution of allowances for loan losses and their breakdown, highlighting the increase in expenses and write-offs.  As previously mentioned, the increase in allowances for loan losses was directly due to companies' and individuals' temporary loss of capacity to honor all their commitments, given the impact of the economic slowdown triggered by the global crisis.  We would like to highlight the low level of recoveries in the quarter-over-quarter net.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 16.  Bradesco's expanded loan portfolio closed the first quarter at R$214 billion, 26.5% higher on a year-over-year analysis, and stable over the previous quarter due to the crisis-driven reduction in client demand.  I would just like to point out that the new borrowers accounted for loans of R$23 billion over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Certain signs of economic recovery should lead to a likely rally in the coming quarters.  Since the peak of the crisis in September '08, our credit supply has been operating normally, thanks to our operational limit, high liquidity and objective to serving our client.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 gives actually a breakdown of our individual loan portfolio.  As you can see, the biggest year-on-year increase came from leasing, which has been replacing steadily but continuously direct financing, mortgages and rural loans, agricultural loans.</p>
          <p>The quarterly decline in credit card operations was due to the normal seasonal upturn at year end.  The reduction in mortgages reflected the credit securitization, which is accounted on another line.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 18.  We show the breakdown of our consumer finance operations, which reached R$58 billion in the first quarter.  As you can see the financing of goods is being replaced by private-label credit card financing operations.  In the same way, payroll-deductible loans are gaining a bigger share of personal loans.</p>
          <p>We believe the recent tax breaks may lead to an increase in consumption and financing needs.  Note also that payroll-deductible loans and auto financing already account for two thirds of Bradesco's total consumer finance portfolio.  Although the interest rates are lower in these operations, delinquency is also much lower than in other portfolios, for example in credit cards and personal loans, thanks to the collaterals that we have -- that are present.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 19.  Corporate loans moved up by 31.2% over the last 12 months, and remained flat in the quarter for the reasons already mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 20.  On this slide, we show the level of coverage of our provisions related to our expected losses.  The first curve represents total provisions divided by the loan portfolio, while the second one corresponds to provisions required by the Brazilian Central Bank.  Note that we have an excess of provisions of R$1.7 billion, the difference between the first two lines.</p>
          <p>The purple curve, representing the percentage of effective losses, the charge offs, is highly correlated with the green curve, which represents the level of non-performing loans.   Based on these historical trends, we can safely say that we have a very solid provisioning cushion in the range R$3.1 billion, allowing us to comfortably overcome any eventual difficulty.</p>
          <p>It is important to mention that the R$2.9 billion of provisions that we have built in the quarter were not using the extra provisions that we already had and that we even increased even further by 68 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 21.  The total delinquency ratio regarding the loans overdue by more than 90 days, which has remained stable recently moved up by 4.3% in the quarter for the reasons commented on the Slide 15.  We expect a slight increase in the ratio in the next two quarters, leveling off at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 22.  In this slide we show the delinquency trends between 61 and 90 days.  It is easy to see the upward trend of these ratios since December 2008, the slowdown of this growth and even a stabilization in fact in upper levels as of February 2009.</p>
          <p>These trends up to date and signs of improvement of the economic activity in Brazil makes us confident that the worst in terms of asset quality deterioration has already passed.  Notwithstanding as already mentioned, delinquency ratios for loans overdue by more than 90 days will also continue to deteriorate until the third quarter of 2009, but should be reaching at tops 4.9%.</p>
          <p>Slide Number 23.  Concerning funding, the decline in demand in savings deposits was due to the normal seasonal upturn in the fourth quarter.  Bradesco's liquidity remained high in order to meet our clients' needs.  Equities were a highlight in the industry moving up by almost 15% in the quarter, reflecting the stock exchange market recovery.</p>
          <p>The decrease reported in the third quarter -- in the quarter of third-party managed funds was due to a change in investment policy of part of our client, who opted for more conservative funds, in turn reflecting in the upturn of our fixed income portfolios despite higher demand for time deposits over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide 24.  Fee income remains flat compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2008.  The regulatory changes generated losses from fee adjustments and the elimination of some fees, like fees in individuals, which were offset by the growth in the client base and the increase in volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 25.  As you can see on this slide, personnel expenses reported a decline in the first quarter of '09 vis-&#xE0;-vis the pervious quarter.  The structural component was impacted by the greater concentration of vacation in the first quarter and the non-structural expenses by a lower management and employees' profit sharing.</p>
          <p>We highlight that during this quarter, we opened 16 full-sized branches and 151 advanced-service branches.</p>
          <p>Slide 26.  The reduction in administrative expenses over the first quarter was due to reduced expenses in advertising, 101 million, and outsourcing services, 61 million.  The increase over the first quarter of 2008 was due to the expansion of the distribution network and higher volumes, as well as investment in the IT-improvement project designed to optimize the technological platform, including the replacement of the architecture of system.</p>
          <p>Slide 27.  The coverage ratio comparing fee income and personnel administrative costs has been falling, basically due to flat fee-income generation as a result of the regulatory measures in early 2008 and continuous investments in expansion of our structure.  However, we believe the downward trend will be reversed in the coming quarters, thanks to the increase in volumes and client base.</p>
          <p>Slide 28.  As you can see on this slide, the net income from the insurance group increased by 18% vis-&#xE0;-vis the fourth quarter of 2008, due to higher financial income, improved efficiency, thanks to cost savings, and lower claims ratios in the health and auto and property and casualty insurance segments.</p>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter of 2008, the reduction in the net income of nearly 13% was caused by lower gains from the sale of equities and the increase in the social contribution, which affected the taxable income as the social contribution moved up from nine to 15%.  Up to January 2009, the net income from the insurance group, from Bradesco's insurance company, accounted for 36.8% of the Brazilian insurance market.</p>
          <p>Slide 29.  Revenues from insurance premiums, private pension plans and savings bonds reached R$5.5 billion, accounting for 23.8% of the Brazilian industry.  The 11.1% reduction in the quarter was essentially due to the seasonally year and growth in private pension plan sales. These results maintain us as the leader in private pension plans in the property and life insurance segments.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 and 31; on Slide 30, we present our own financial assets and technical provision guarantees, which amounted to R$73 billion equivalent to 34.6% of the industry in January.  Technical provision reached R$67 billion or 33.4% of the total industry as of January, again.</p>
          <p>In the Slide Number 31, we show a breakdown of the technical provision per business line.</p>
          <p>Slide 32, we show here the historic evolution of the combined ratio, which reflects the operating efficiency of Bradesco's insurance group.</p>
          <p>Slide 33, in response to requests from the market, we are here showing in this slide our tax credits in relation to the shareholders' equity.  We would like to point out here that the increase of our tax credits were basically due to credits derived from temporary addition, mainly in view of increasing provisions of credit.  I would like to call your attention to our low volume for other tax credits that derives from tax losses, goodwill amortization and others due to their characteristics, their offsets, is slightly difficult and longer.</p>
          <p>Concluding the slides, the realization of those fiscal credits will not taking more than three years for Bradesco.</p>
          <p>On Slide 34, we are showing the macroeconomic outlook for 2009 and 2010 in terms of GDP, interest rate, inflation and FX rate.  This is basically the scenario projected by our economic team.  Note that we expect a zero GDP growth for this year.</p>
          <p>On Slide 35, we are currently revising our guidance with possible disclosure going forward if we decide to change it.  In terms of loans, as you saw, we grew by 9% over the last six months, the loan book.  But we have to confirm the growth over the next month to definitively project better the expectations of growth for 2009.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, as we expected, this is a year of major challenges for the financial sector.  Increase in delinquencies and the modest growth of credits impact negatively the net income, and therefore, jeopardizing profitability.</p>
          <p>Despite this scenario, we believe we have a good performance in this quarter, taking into account the structure of our balance sheet with its high level of provisions for losses &#x2013; for loan losses, taxes, civil and labor contingency.</p>
          <p>As we previously pointed out, we expect growth in the volumes and in our client base in the coming quarters, leading to increased loans and fees.  Dues offsetting expected delinquency increased until September.  In the same way, we intend to continue improving our operational efficiency ratio.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I would like now to open the floor for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Our first question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jean.  Quick question, understanding that your guidance is under revision, as you said at the end in Page 36 of your presentation, would you say at least some preliminary thoughts of the way you're thinking on fee income?  Because it appears to me that what you show in the first quarter, only 1% year-on-year growth due primarily by this still lingering impasse of the new regulation, makes a seven to 11% growth for Bradesco very questionable.</p>
          <p>So would you comment on to what extent we can see better performance in fees and what's going to drive it in the latter part of the year or where this is one of the lines that shoots up or something if you can downward revision?  On the other hand though, you showed net interest income growth of 27% year on year in the first quarter, which would maybe 18 to 22% guidance a little shy to what extent what we saw in the first quarter because of the trading and treasury gains and should be considered one off or the 18 to 22% guidance may start to look a little timid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  In terms of the guidance, again, this is the guidance that we are showing to the market.  We are concluding our analysis to see if we are going to change the guidance.  In terms of fees, up to now I would say we are relatively optimistic about the possibility of maintaining this level of fees.</p>
          <p>In terms of the net interest income, I would say you also have to consider that the non-interest spots, the trading gains, the effect of the mark-to-market in the first quarter, I would say we're out of the curve.  So I believe that we feel also kind of secure that the net interest income should be maintained roughly in the level that we are showing in the Slide Number 35.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; again, Daniel, I wish I could be giving you the guidance, but again we have to conclude some different analysis to see if we are going to change the guidance or not.  The fact is that we have been seeing, over the last month or so, very good news in terms of the GDP, in terms of the economic level, and most of the economies that we are projecting a negative GDP trend for this year, they are beginning to go to the positive scenario of more than 0% or around 0%.  Again, when we will have the new guidance, if we change, we will be more than happy to disclose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But conceptually, but a little bit, income side, if you look at the different lines that are disclosed in Page 34, which are the different subcategories of fee income, where do you think we can see most of the rebound in the latter part of the year if indeed you're going to be able to give the seven to 11% guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, in the most of the lines, in car, in loan operation, in asset management, basically, as we are expecting growth in volumes and a growth of client base, it is expected that the volumes should be helping the lines to be growing higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone.  I have two questions, the first one, is it fair to say that given that you revised your GDP estimate downward from 1.5 to zero.  Your preliminary thoughts on your business guidance is to revise it downward or actually you're thinking of potentially revising it upward?  That's the first question.  Second question is on asset quality.  According to the presentation here, your total NPL ended up at 4.3% this quarter up from 3.6 in the previous quarter.  That's a pretty significant jump for one quarter.  It's actually, if you look at the long-term trend series, it's the most important sequential jump we've seen in many years.</p>
          <p>Can you just walk us through, more or less, what did you see during the quarter that drove that increase in NPLs?  And you also mentioned that you think that NPLs will continue to rise and will stabilize in the third quarter, if I understood correctly, at 4.9.</p>
          <p>So what are you seeing that you're assuming, I guess, a much lower deterioration in asset quality?  I mean I would have thought that given the big jump in the first quarter, then the next couple of quarters are also going to be tough, and yet you're basically expecting it to change very modestly from 4.3 to 4.9.  So if you can give us more color on asset quality, that'll be great?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jorge.  I would say when we have &#x2013; we disclosed our guidance on February the 2nd.  When we disclosed our 2008 numbers, at that time, it is true, we were expecting 1.5% GDP growth.  And now we are thinking about zero.  So I would say the trend would be that all the numbers of revenues should be coming closer to the lower end.  And this definitively is in the perspective of everyone.  But again, we are beginning to see some signs, and the month of April was quite good.  We have to feel a little bit more comfortable to provide a new guidance if we decide so.  But I would say coming closer to the lower end to respond to your question.</p>
          <p>In terms of the asset quality, we decided in this quarter to include a new slide, which was the Slide Number 22, because we had been already providing information about for the more than 90 days past due.  And we wanted to give a flavor of the shorter-term delinquency.  What we tried to explain in during the presentation was that based on this uptick in the delinquency ratio of 61 days to 90 days, let's say in December, and that we see the numbers that are much more flat since January, they stabilize.  We believe that we have a perspective of the asset quality to be going up.  Again, we are not saying it's not going to go up.  We believe it's going to go closer to 4.8, 4.9, up to August or September of this year.  But it is important to tell you different things that makes us comfortable about that.  I would say, first about the Slide 22, the trend of the 61, 90 days helps you to build the trends for a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>Second, when we make the loans to individuals, individuals is where we have more &#x2013; most of the risk.  Actually, after six months, you have a full provision of the operation and six months after that, you have the write-off.  So I would say, you'll begin to capture, in September of 2008, the deterioration of the economic scenario.  You have the unemployment rate beginning to move up since the end of last year.  So you'll begin to capture in individuals, already most of the asset quality deterioration.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of information that are proprietary information.  You know that Bradesco is responsible for 20% market share of the sales of the companies that are passing through banking systems as we were a 20% market share company of the CPMF tax.  So we capture a lot in our system, the company's behavior, who is selling to whom, if there are delinquencies, if you have problems, they have and where.  So I would say we have a lot of information that we can capture.  We have seen that the employment should be relatively stable.  We also see that the trends are positive for the mass of salaries, the real wages should be moving up.</p>
          <p>And we see already that, even though some companies are suffering, you have a process of M&amp;As, you have a process of companies deleveraging, so actually at the end, for individuals and for companies and also taking into consideration that we are in a pre-election year.  Next year we have elections in Brazil, so the investments in the program of the government of acceleration of growth should also impact more the economy.  So the expectation is that this 4.3% ratio should be going to 4.8, 4.9 up to August, and that it should begin to move down.</p>
          <p>Our chief economists have the expectation that the loans from the banking sector in this year should grow by 12% from all the banks.  And usually Bradesco grows a little bit more than the market.  So I would say the trends are positive for the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm good, thanks.  Couple of questions for you, one, on your effective tax rate I think you have about R$900 plus million of tax credits that you can continue to use to offset the increase in the social contribution rate.  When do those get exhausted and by &#x2013; what do you expect for the social contribution rate in 2000 &#x2013; in your effective tax rate in 2010?  I think Ita&#xFA; today in their release indicated that they actually believe that the courts will find the social contribution rate increase from last year unconstitutional.  Do you guys &#x2013; are you guys of the same opinion or should &#x2013; or are you guys thinking that your effective tax rate will actually indeed increase in 2010 by 6 percentage points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have a stock of R$926 million that we can activate.  It's a very large amount of money, which basically should be neutralizing all the effect of the social contribution this year.  We actually are questioning with lawsuit this social contribution.  It's difficult to know what is going to happen if we lose, it goes to 15%, but at least we are questioning that.</p>
          <p>And for the effective tax rate of this year, I would say it trends to be a little bit higher than 2008 because of the interest on capital, which is tax deductible, should be helping less to reduce the effective tax rate at the TGLP, the long-term interest rate is moving down in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So you think it's uncertain in terms of how this is going to play out in terms of the increase in the social contribution rate at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  It's difficult now a days to pre-size a little bit better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then just secondly on asset, a couple of questions on asset quality, first, your excess reserve of 1.7 billion, are you comfortable at that level?  Or what would need to happen for you guys to take to reverse some of those excess reserves?  Or are you more in the mindset that you wouldn't &#x2013; you would be more comfortable bumping that excess reserve up at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Referring to the provisioning level, maybe we could look at the Slide Number 20.  And I would say much more than the excess of provision of R$1.7 billion, we prefer to look at the expectations of future losses vis-&#xE0;-vis the level's total provision.  And if this is the case, our excess of provision would be up R$3.1 billion approximately.  We feel very comfortable.</p>
          <p>We basically said that during the presentation, and we are very comfortable with the level of provisions based on our portfolios and our expectations of future losses to the reason why we are not using the excess, and we are building provisions on a quarterly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just one final question, the 60- to 90-day color was very helpful.  Have you seen any &#x2013; do you guys have any idea of where zero- to 15- or 15- to 60-day delinquency rates have headed?  Are they trending in a similar rate to what you've seen for 60 to 90 days?  And the reason I ask that is, obviously we do get color from the Central Bank data.  And 15- to 90-day past due loans have been a very good forward-looking indicator for NPLs, and they've actually still been increasing for individual loans.  So I'm curious, if in your book, if you look at zero &#x2013; shorter time horizons, whether you're seeing a similar trend to what you're seeing for the stability you're seeing in the 60- to 90-day past due loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have our own analysis of a shorter period of time.  The trend is relatively similar to the trend of 61 to 90 days.  Although sometimes you could have some variations because you could have an operations being paid, and this affects the ratio.  So we prefer to show 61 to 90 days as we believe it's a more stable and better projects the 90-days plus past due loan expectation.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jean.  Yeah, just on the insurance businesses there, and you saw &#x2013; we saw in the quarter that you hit an ROE of 31%, obviously a good combined ratio.  How sustainable do you think this is going forward?  Is there any risk here that in any major business line that we see an increase in competition or price war in the near term?  Is there anything from what you see in April that tells you that, that situation is changing or do the returns in that business look quite stable, at least from the business lines point of view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sam Monteiro speaking.  Your question about the sustainable role, ROE of 31.  My answer is very easy to understand, and that is if you consider that, the social contribution, which increases six points, one make comparison between the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, your &#x2013; our ROE would be the same as the first quarter of 2008.  The big difference between social contribution in 2009 and 2008, would you explain you or could you satisfy you that the ROE would be the same as in the past year.</p>
          <p>In general, the combined ratio, I would say it's absolutely sustainable.  That be the tax rate of &#x2013; sorry, the financial rates in our investments drop down, as you know.  And the compensation would be in our stakeholders, which reduce &#x2013; will reduce the costs of the clients because, don't forget, you and everybody put in our mind that hospital, labs and dealers; they put the cost of interest in their costs.  And -- Bradesco has a huge portfolio, but the health we have is close of 44 million of people, 4 million insureds in cars, 1.5 million is a very huge.  But I just wanted to make the impression with our stakeholders to reduce the price of the costs, which directly reduce our claim duration.</p>
          <p>In term of a possible price war, in our view, there isn't price war for us.  We make very interesting movement since 2007 when the bank finished this RIM system, which show us what kind of insurance policy holder client the bank have.  And in this case, we've &#x2013; our focus was, in that time &#x2013; starting that time, our focus in our &#x2013; in the bank's clients, of course for the bank's clients, we have the best price.</p>
          <p>We know the client.  We know what they doing, what the kind of issuance they wish.  They're same as in terms of dental.  What happened in dental?  Dental wanted the insurance group of Bradesco, its fleet, operation, the health in terms of dental it put a specific company's focus in dental.  What happened?  We increased 50% as our income in terms of dental.  Why?  Because we have the best price for all our clients as if it weren't.  And the behavior of the market would be &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; I am not an opinion Bradesco view, the reason for us war price, price of war.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Jean.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I have a question going back to the guidance.  If you can give us some color on the expense guidance, you have nine to 14% growth in expenses.  I was wondering if that still holds, if you're still planning to open the same amount of branches that you were at the beginning of the year?  If not, where else can you save?  Where else can you cut back, given that now we expect a year with much less growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carlos.  I'm having to comment the guidance, which theoretically does not exist because we didn't change the guidance.  But I would say in general terms, cost definitively &#x2013; we are doing everything we can in order to keep the costs lower.  And I would say we have some initiative.  For example, we should be opening 100, approximately 90 to 100 branches, and before we had a budget of opening almost 170, 180.</p>
          <p>So you have, I would say some initiative that we are going to deploy in banking and in insurance, and we are also going to try to renegotiate the same way Samuel was talking about renegotiating the cost with each and everyone.  The bank will be doing the same, and also as we have good expectations for the inflation of this year, we could have less pressure on the annual negotiation of wages.  And this definitively is a positive for us.  So I would say we have to keep with the guidance, and &#x2013; but you have to keep in mind that definitively the focus on price reduction is one of the most important ones, and we emphasize that even more.</p>
