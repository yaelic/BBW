          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Nordea International Telephone Conference. My name is Bethy and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n, Head of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello and welcome to this fourth quarter '09 presentation. With us today we will have the introduction by CEO, Mr. Christian Clausen, and then we will hand over to CFO, Mr. Fredrik Rystedt and Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Carl-Johan Granvik, and then some concluding remarks and strategy from Mr. Christian Clausen.</p>
          <p>So, please go ahead, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this meeting. I will give a very short introduction on the highlights for 2009, and we are pleased to report today a very strong year, which is characterized with a consistent delivery on our growth strategy, income up and risk-adjusted profit up 22% for the full year.</p>
          <p>We see very strong development in the customer areas throughout the year and it continues in Q4 <mark type="inaudible" /> Nordic Banking and International banking see a fairly strong income growth.</p>
          <p>Loan losses are moderate; actually they are at expected levels. This is particularly a important note for management to be able to note today that they have actively managed throughout this severe economic crisis to stay within the expected loan losses which we put forward in 2002 on our risk levels and risk modeling that through the cycle will keep this approximately at 25 to 27 basis points and that has actually materialized and we strongly believe we will keep that level.</p>
          <p>Nordea is in a position of strength, strong position and capital funding and risk. We have gained customer satisfaction and our brand recognition has increased during the period. And based on this, we are planning to continue on our organic growth strategy, which embarked on in 2007, which means that we will continue on prudent growth for the next three years and we will have launched a number of good initiatives, which I will come back to after the presentation.</p>
          <p>So, Fredrik, if you would continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. I will give you an overview of the result that we presented this morning. And to start with the full year results, as you can see from slide five, we reached a total income growth of 11% for the year, cost growth of 4%, of course impacted by the restructuring charge that you have seen, and risk adjusted profit of 22% for the full year.</p>
          <p>The quarter income level was as expected, slightly down on the back of primarily lower net gains and losses, but strong contribution from net fee and commission in particular and rather stable net interest income. Net loan losses were slightly down as you can see.</p>
          <p>If I go through the details of the result, you can see from slide six that net interest income was slightly down. Lending volumes were pretty much similar to what we saw from Q3 and Q2 with a good and strong growth in household lending and we also took market share from all major markets.</p>
          <p>The corporate volumes were largely unchanged, and it's clear that the decline that we saw in Q3 and Q2 has now tapered off in this uncertain &#x2013; particularly the later part of the quarter was much more stable than &#x2013; or flat in terms of volume development.</p>
          <p>As before, the deposit margins were down although at a slower pace than previously as expected on course to negative impact in comparison to last year is very significant on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>We were pleased to note that the corporate lending margins this quarter as well continue to increase somewhat, and particularly that was the case this quarter for Finland and the couple other Nordic countries, but again a good development. We had, as expected, a lower contribution from Group Treasury, and that is of course a natural result of low returns on the liquidity buffer that we maintain in Group Treasury.</p>
          <p>You can see on slide seven, the underlying volume trends, and of course the impact on the quarter from total lending is relatively small. You can see that Nordic corporate is contributing with the negative result, although compensated of course by the household mortgages and consumer lending in general.</p>
          <p>Deposit side also grew by 3% in total, and particularly stronger in New European markets and also Nordic corporates in all of our countries.</p>
          <p>The change in net interest income, as previously, the volume side corporate lending volumes had a minor impact, negative impact, more than compensated by the household lending margins. And as you can see, we had also minor impact on the household lending margins, and also the deposit margins as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>The household lending margins was generally in Norway, mainly because of the lag effect that we have talked about many times before, so more of an administrative impact that we have seen before, and as I mentioned, a certain negative impact from &#x2013; among other groups, Treasury.</p>
          <p>Net fees and commission income was up 6%, and an extremely strong performance within the savings commission, it's partly a result of the performance fee, so on the back of a very good investment result in the asset management side. Asset under management is up, as I will come back to you.</p>
          <p>Lending commissions was down 9%, and of course that was due to an extremely strong Q3 more than actual development in Q4. Just a couple of words on the commission expenses, they are very much similar to what we have seen in the previous quarters of this year, slightly lower. And just to remind you, they will to the extent &#x2013; in Denmark they will expire at the end of Q3 of 2010.</p>
          <p>If we just look at slide 10, you will see the inflow picture and it was very strong, 9% annualized and 3.5 billion in the quarter. And on an aggregate level for the year, the total inflow has reached 10 billion. Asset under management on the back of that inflow and of course also the general pick up of the value of the funds increased by 6% or nine billion.</p>
          <p>One particular thing that we are proud of is of course the performance in the funds. And as you can see, 86% of all investment composites outperformed the relevant benchmark.</p>
          <p>Quickly on net gains and losses. As I have commented before, we've had a very strong performance in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 in particular, and Q4 was more or slightly lower both in markets and in treasury. This partly has to do with of course more &#x2013; you can say, normalizing margins within the market area, a slightly less predictable marketplace and little bit more competition that we have seen in the last six months of the year. And in particular for treasury, the fairly sharp increase of interest rates at the latter part of the year also had a negative impact.</p>
          <p>So in total, if we look at the income growth of Nordea for the full year, as you can see on slide 12, you can see that the underlying business of the customer area has grown throughout the year with just over 3%. And that is despite the very significant negative impact from the deposit margin that has been impacting Nordic Banking in particular. So, a strong performance and of course you can also see the strong performance in markets and treasury.</p>
          <p>If I quickly turn to the expense growth, the increase on the quarter was 12%, out of which roughly half of that 6% was due to the restructuring cost that we incurred in this quarter, and the other part is more of a seasonal nature. If you look at the full year, the underlying cost growth in local currencies is approximately 3% in comparison to last year.</p>
          <p>Just one comment on the FTEs; as you will recall, we set a target for 2009 to reduce the number of FTEs in the group was 2%. We did reach that target. In fact we reduced on a comparable basis to 3%. And we also acquired <mark type="inaudible" /> adding 1%, so in total number of employees were 2% lower than as of start of the 2009.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, you can see the expense growth development, restructuring charges as we have alluded to or as I have talked about. Pension expenses mainly as a consequence of the discount rate decreased that we have for 2009 has been a significant contributor. And you will also see the other items there. And of course there also a negative FX effect or a lowering FX impact. But in general, the underlying cost growth of 3% is something that we are quite pleased about.</p>
          <p>A few words on the impact of the initiatives, and just to remind you, Christian will talk about the investment a little bit later, but I will nevertheless give you a brief overview of the impacts of the results.</p>
          <p>For 2009, the impact was 64 million in Q4, spread in mainly four brackets &#x2013; four restructuring brackets. Growth plan Finland, the redundancy paid for seasonal sellers ; markets IT platform and IT restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we expect one-off investments of 240 million, 140 of that will hit the P&amp;L or as expenses. We will also have some increased running cost, but those will be mitigated by efficiency gains. So in total we expect running cost to be flat, or the impact from the strategic initiatives to be mainly flat on running cost.</p>
          <p>And total P&amp;L impact from the total program is expected to be neutral in 2010. Subject to of course market demand and customer demand, we expect to invest similar amounts also in 2011 and 2012. And there is an expectation from us of a positive P&amp;L impact for years 2011 and '12 and of course even more so thereafter.</p>
          <p>The dividend on slide 16, the net profit as a consequence of the higher loan losses for the year is down 29%. We propose a dividend of $0.25 per share for 2010, which is equal to a payout ratio of 43%. And of course, our dividend policy is 40% or above.</p>
          <p>Some brief comments on our capital ratios. We have all capital ratios slightly down in Q4, and the main impact on the core Tier 1 is due to a slight pickup on the risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>On the Tier 1, we've also had a call of hybrid. And you will recall from Q3 that we increased the Tier 1 ratio considerably on the back of an issue of a hybrid loan, and that hybrid loan was partly issued to actually repay the hybrid that has been repaid in Q4. So the main explanation is that call of that hybrid.</p>
          <p>We remain one of the strongest capitalized bank in Europe, which is of course not less important in the upcoming discussions on regulations that we will see during this year.</p>
          <p>On the next slide 18, you will see that risk weighted assets on looking at the year as a whole has been stable, it's up 1.9% excluding transition rules, and there are minor changes in the risk weights in Q4, <mark type="inaudible" /> 60 to 61% on the corporate portfolio and up from 15 to 16% on the retail portfolio.</p>
          <p>The funding position has been as before functioning very well for us. We have a continued strong demand for our long-term issuance. We have also seen that in January of 2010, so it's been functioning very well. We have one of the lowest cost of funding in Europe, and of course that provides us with the benefit in the customer business.</p>
          <p>Liquidity buffer has increased further from the size in Q3 and it's now 56.5 billion. Also in this area, the uncertainty is very high as regards to regulation, and we will talk more about that on the upcoming Capital Markets Event.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I will leave over to Carl-Johan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. I think the key to the credit portfolio quality is very much in the diversification that we have in the book, both between corporate and household, between countries and between industries.</p>
          <p>On page 21, we have the slide to illustrate that in another way, looking at the segments where we have our book. Almost half of it is classified as low risk, including the mortgage lending and residential real estate, finance institutions, public sector, but also some of the stable industries like telecom or healthcare.</p>
          <p>Most of the corporate book is then is what we call the medium risk areas 34%, including the capital goods, telecom, media, transportation, and most of the shipping and the small part of that containerships and tankers are included in what we call special attention areas, including Nordea commercial real estate, construction, private equity sponsored companies, and the Baltic countries and Russia. That mean that we would have had very high losses from all of these areas, but they are under special attention because potentially in a drawn out recession they could cause problems.</p>
          <p>When we look at the loan losses for the quarter, we were very much in line with the outlook, 347 million or 52 basis points, including again contribution for the Danish guarantee scheme of four basis points, and also divided between individual 40 and collective 12 basis points</p>
          <p>In terms of geography, you can see that Denmark still stands for the large portion of the losses, 44%; New European markets, which basically is Baltics as we've very small losses in Poland and Russia 80% and then <mark type="inaudible" /> Nordic countries on a much lower level.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans have shown stabilization. We only had 7% up in terms of impaired loans gross during the quarter, which is a slowdown from the nine and 90 respective for Q3 and Q2.</p>
          <p>54% of our impaired loans are also performing, which has been just worth noting, i.e. still paying interest but we consider that there is a potential risk that they might not be able to fully meet the future payments. Out of the total allowances, we have <mark type="inaudible" /> as well, 38% in what we call collective provisions, i.e. non-identified customers, but there you can see a potential risk also indicating conservative look ahead.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Baltic countries, we have shown here on page 24, the composition of the portfolio in terms of borrowers state and municipalities, Nordic &amp; International, large corporates actually account for quite a big part of the portfolio, and there we see no high impaired loans levels as you can see obviously on a Nordic level.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> mortgages, small local corporates and midsized local corporates where you see higher level of impairment. And also as we have shown before, we still have a strong feeling that our portfolio is better than the market. The past dues in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in all countries are roughly half of what the market is and that is some comfort going forward.</p>
          <p>But still there will be further <mark type="inaudible" /> Latvia and Lithuania particularly, Estonia shows some improvement in threshold performance, but we have a good impaired loans coverage ratio there as well, increasing to 60%. And the past dues have clearly slowed down, the impaired loans increased by only 2% in the Baltic's &#x2013; in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, a picture on the rating migration that we have been following quarter-by-quarter, it still is a slight more down-rated customer then up-rated, but it is leveling out. And the effect on the rating migration taking separately in terms of impact of risk weighted assets for the full year was 6.9%.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year, we said that it could be as high as 10, but it's clearly more slower which we of course are happy with.</p>
          <p>That would conclude my presentation. I'll hand over back to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and I will continue on strategy and our journey. And as you all know, we launched the Great Nordea vision in 2007, actually December 2006. And what we said was the Nordea would embark upon a journey towards Great Nordea, which was characterized by four elements, the strong profit orientation where we said to build a foundation of cost, risk and capital management is key for any bank through the cycle. And this we have been working with as of 2002 and to build a strong platform and I think it shown during the stress test <mark type="inaudible" /> years that it worked. <mark type="inaudible" /> were launched. We have become the leading audit bank to other risk adjusted profit in seven years <mark type="inaudible" /> and other things.</p>
          <p>And we also created growth strategy, which I will come back to. And then we also said that we will work on integrating a very strong value-based strong cost amount is key for our relationships strategy. So its part of the relationship strategy that we're exited with work with our values and have the values becoming part of D&amp;A. This particular part has been very successful and is probably key to how we have moved very close to our customers during this downturn and that has certainly help us so it's part of the relationships help us also on in handling the problems we're seeing.</p>
          <p>Beginning on the next slide, you will see comments towards the growth strategy. We launched the profitable organic growth strategy, which is explained as detailed organic growth, and we launched a number of initiatives back in December '06. We have delivered on that. I will not go through it now, but we are above the line in doubling risk adjusted profit in seven years.</p>
          <p>We are in <mark type="inaudible" /> and we are number one on return on equity. We increased our customer satisfaction compared to peers significantly, and we have actually improved our brand quite a lot also during the downturn.</p>
          <p>Last December, we said we will stay aligned to our strategy that we will take middle of the road approach because of the very, very difficult economic environment. We'll keep income growth momentum, but we would let cost, risk and capital to take the lead. So we could and things get more clear, and visibility increases we could accelerate out of the crisis.</p>
          <p>That we said in December, now one year later we have to say that's exactly what we did. And now we have decided that this visibility is there and we will move forward towards Great Nordea on what we call prudent growth with capital navigation between risks and opportunities. Because we still think risks are out there. We still think that the economic outlook is positive, but the economic situation is very fragile and there would be new relation. There are number of risks out there which is important to navigate, so it would be a prudent growth strategy.</p>
          <p>And here we confirm our organic growth strategy. You can say the next level of strategies based on our experience in executing this strategy and also based on our significantly strong compensation. And here we highlight that we are working with the top segments, that's why we have the highest potentials, the highest number of new customers potential, the highest margins, and the best profitability is also where we have the best opportunity to influence customers.</p>
          <p>The same thing goes for the corporate segment, where they are talking about the -bank strategy, where we will penetrate customer base on balance sheet management products, risk management products, cash management and other things. This is also proving successful and we will take the next steps.</p>
          <p>We will develop further our low cost multi-channel distribution, set up both to relationship segment to have our best customer service and sales on manual transactions but, also to the non-relationship segments, which <mark type="inaudible" /> will have full service on the electronic media.</p>
          <p>And finally, developed efficient and demand-driven value chains is key. The way we look at our operating model is, we have value chains deliver into the customer units efficient services and products, driven by demand from the customer side and we have here number of developments to do not list on the IT area.</p>
          <p>This strategy we will explain more in detail as we go out for the next full year of our capital market there that also goes for the initiatives, but I will give a few comments to the initiatives now, which we tend to look upon as growth initiatives, efficiency initiatives and foundation structure initiatives which will improve our foundation.</p>
          <p>Of course, some of them works in all three dimension, but anyway they have the key focus each of them. Future distribution is clearly the most important one. Here we are talking upon based on all our experience that we will actually optimize our branch network.</p>
          <p>We will make sure that we have the branches and <mark type="inaudible" /> also the customer potential is the highest. There will be new formats for branches, there will be advisory to branches without transactions, we've those specific service branches and we will make sure that we increase advisory capacity. We will reduce the staff, which are not handling, advising, just servicing on transactions and other things tell us, and then if that increases advisory capacity.</p>
          <p>So we will operate the underlying operation as I mentioned and make sure we continue on a high speed to migrate transactions away from the branches. This has already happened to a large extent, and we think we can speed it up, and we also think we can have a pretty large part of the customer initiated sales actually happening on the internet going forward, giving even more possibilities for the branches to handle the advice, 360 degree meetings and thereby growing the customer base and income.</p>
          <p>The new customer acquisition was geared up, and we will add it by the capacity as I said both on Nordic, both on both customers and private banking and we will make sure that, that acquisition, which is already growing at a pretty good level and stay at level or maybe increase a bit further.</p>
          <p>We have specific service and growth plan Finland, where we think we can firm up the position. We have cut back in a few areas and also little market share here and there, it's mainly due to the situation that the relocation here on new format of branches is particularly necessary, as we've seen quite a big migration of our customer base. We will also have to add more advices and implement relationship strategy even further.</p>
          <p>Why appropriate Our corporate merchant banking &#x2013; the large treasurer, it's a very important strategy all over. We have penetrated very successfully in '09 that we will continue with specific focus on Sweden, as I said, balance sheet management and risk management are key areas here. But of course also our approved cash management offering is also key to capture and relinquishing customers here. We've had very strong inroads during '09 with our strong brand and balance sheet.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> develop our customer-driven market business, which occurred many times is very successful. A lot of things continuously done here and we will allocate more resources to this, and we'll continue to build our Nordic corporate finance position.</p>
          <p>We already ranked very high on the league table both on debt capital market and equity capital market. We believe we have much more to do, and we can clearly see that the deal flow coming from our customer base is very significant &#x2013; and significant possibilities to expand &#x2013; and actually taking care of that deal flow.</p>
          <p>We will continue &#x2013; we continue <mark type="inaudible" /> start-up again. Our growth plan Poland, it has been slowdown a bit in '09. It seems only made 15 branches in '09, but now it will go back to the level of using 50 new branches per year, roughly one per week and our growth &#x2013; sorry, our branch factor we have held in Poland is still in place which site location, hire people, train people, and put in place a new branch. It's very successful and our track record of establishing branches with high profitability is good. On average, we have clear profitability after one year.</p>
          <p>You also know that Poland is a very interesting market with low banking penetration and where we see significant organic growth, but it's also a country which had managed right through the downturn and has a positive growth this year.</p>
          <p>IT performance is particularly important and we have a comprehensive program to reduce our IT cost in a number of areas, restructuring, reducing the number of vacations, improve efficiency, we will source more IT, and we will lean IT in a number of ways, mostly by assuring that the demand drive and IT becomes even stronger through our value chains. We will expand our already existing offshore center in Poland where we'll allocate more manual work into Poland on a very attractive business case.</p>
          <p>We will work on our product platforms, especially the cards and the payments platform, and thereby the cash management platform is important. We will develop that and we will take advantage of a number of the scale effect we actually have, so we see strong efficiency gains here, and also to increase the service levels mostly because these platforms are key to the next generation of the Internet service of our customers, which I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Then, infrastructure upgrade in a number of areas, the most significant in markets. Market is already running a very sophisticated platform with the new requirements under consolidation of the European securities infrastructure, the new derivatives platforms, and central counterparties and things like that, all the new regulations and not least increased customer demand and transparency is needed. And here we are taking significant next steps and investing in that.</p>
          <p>We will also work on making our financial processes more efficient and more transparent, and then we will improve our IT resilience and other areas. These initiatives that we went through have very strong long-term business case and will clearly contribute to our long-term target of doubling risk-adjusted profit in seven years. It will of course also secure our strategic innovation of making sure our growth strategy actually makes it possible to meet our target of being the best relationship bank, which we think is a clear winning model.</p>
          <p>I think we see several people coming out, now saying that in the wake of the financial and economic crisis, the next A group and banking will we be to make sure we take care of our customers, apart from that, and make them feel safe and secure. And that is exactly what our whole strategy is all about.</p>
          <p>And finally, one operating model, which is key to what we do, securing efficiency. And that gets me to the outlook statement, which I'm sure you already have seen. We are saying, but we expect the macroeconomic recovery to continue. It's fragile. It's depending on both the monetary and fiscal policy initiatives, so some sort of uncertainly remains.</p>
          <p>We will do the &#x2013; continue on the growth strategies as explained, and we expect cost growth to be largely in line with the growth rate we already have in 2009.</p>
          <p>Risk-adjusted profit is probably going to be lower 2010, and mainly due to the lower income in Treasury and Markets. And the credit quality continues to stabilize, but loan losses could remain at a high level in '10. It is very difficult to forecast when exactly loan losses will start to decline.</p>
          <p>So, key messages; strong year, risk-adjusted profit up 22%; stabilization of credit quality and loan losses at expected levels; and finally that we had launched group initiatives to support the strategy going forward, continuing the journey towards a Great Nordea. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes through from the line of Jacob Kruse from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jacob from Autonomous Research. I just have two questions. Firstly, if you could comment a little on your outlook for net interest income run rate, you're annualizing around 5.2 billion after this quarter. And I think you talked a bit on the press conference this morning that there maybe a headwind of a couple of 100 million from treasury portfolio &#x2013; the lower income from the treasury portfolio. So should we look at around 5 billion for the year assuming no increase of the interest rate or lending growth?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just to go back to the point of provisions in the Baltic's and the Russia. You seem to be having much stronger asset quality than other banks, but would you say that you expect those losses to remain at relatively high levels for some time to come for you? Whereas I think, for example, SEB today, the guidance seems to be that losses should roughly half in the Baltic's in 2010, so how do you compare to that guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start by commenting the net interest income outlook. First, we don't give of course outlooks for individual lines in the income statement. The outlook is that &#x2013; there is outline to risk-adjusted profit, so I couldn't give you our estimate.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of comments, however, I think that it is clear that we've had some benefit as you have seen throughout this year on treasury, and you have seen a slight decline in net interest income in Q4. And of course that's the consequence of lower income from the liquidity buffer. We will see that also happening going forward. However, there are of course other issues that are positive net interest, so I don't think you can draw any major conclusion from this. And as I said, we don't give any particular guidelines on net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Baltics, as we have mentioned many times, the recovery is very fragile and that certainly goes to be the <mark type="inaudible" /> we believe that they are severing out and particularly in Estonia we can see better trading conditions for this year than last, but in Latvia and Lithuania, the situation is still very unclear. So without &#x2013; the data gives specific outlook for areas for industries, but Baltic will remain one of those areas where we foresee that there is scope rather high provisioning also in 2010 and prevail.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes through from the line of Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Three questions, if I may. Firstly on the growth initiative, why now &#x2013; what's the point about the timing and is a kind of special program needed or could there been an issue that could have been done more on a running basis, and which items in the P&amp;L do you expect on the revenue side to be mainly affected by this?</p>
          <p>The second is regarding the volume growth, when do you expect that the corporate volume growth will actually start picking up? Is it realistic during 2010 or will we still see kind of very, very sluggish volume growth, and 35 majors done on the Nordic banking margins, it was still down in the fourth quarter. Do you expect that the Nordic banking margin, leaving markets and treasury alone away, have actually topped or will they still come down in the first quarter of 2010? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should start on the initiatives line now. Well, it's actually very much in line what we have been saying all the way through. We said in December last year, now we'll take the middle of the road approach. We'll stay largely to the growth strategy, but we will focus on taking down the speed somewhat in this very uncertain environment, and we will let credit and risk management take the lead.</p>
          <p>But the reason was that we wanted to keep the momentum in which we created in recent years, so we could accelerate out of the crisis, and we believe the timing is right. I think Nordea has gained very strong platform in capital, in funding, not the least branding as I've mentioned, I think that Nordea brand stands out strong in all the countries we work. We see that the number of new customers just coming into the bank, especially to meet the corporates who ask us to be the strategic banking partner and so on.</p>
          <p>So, I think, this strong position is one which is obviously one that we should take care of and continue our organic growth strategy. And then these initiatives are those which we have been breaking with for sometime, and it's clear to us that the relationship strategy is very profitable and it is also very efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>The number of investments we have to do to make it actually <mark type="inaudible" /> and we'll develop the potential of Nordea, and that's the reason we do it now. We are also not that worried of the future. As we already said, we think the credit quality is stabilizing exactly when we see loan losses come back, which quarter whenever that happens is very, very difficult, but not important to Nordea. We have demonstrated that this is well under control.</p>
          <p>We are not worried about the capital requirement. We think we are one of the strongest banks on funding. So whatever filing regulations comes out there, it's also an area which we think we can cope with based on what we know today. So, it is the right timing also because of course we have competitors who are not holding up to speed. So, there is a window of opportunity, and since we have this confirmation that our strategy moves in the recent years has been correct, we're doing the right thing, we will do more of these things, but we will do it in sort of the next generation way.</p>
          <p>Then, I think it's a fairly easy decision for us to come to and say, this we will do. So, I think the whole team is very much backing this, and it is very happy to be able to go this way and develop the <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>And what lines? Well, it's our lines. You can say, it's interest, it's provision, it's net gains and losses for the corporates and so on, it's all over the place. And we are not that &#x2013; we are not &#x2013; it's not that important to us on which line it actually comes up, because it is a relationship strategy. We will get the customers. We'll do all the business they do, and whether that is borrowing money, managing risks or doing transaction where we have commissions, that is &#x2013; that will vary quarter-to-quarter. So the profitabilities around these initiatives for us quite clear. Fredrik, will you talk about volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Volumes in corporate if I take that, you take the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's &#x2013; I really excited to see a big increase in demand but we clearly already saw during the last couple of months in 2009 that the corporate loan demand picked up and it's not so much based on new investments, but may be two added drivers, number one is a need for working capital. I mean, in 2009, our corporate clients very much took down their working capital needs because of lower turnover and to take cost management.</p>
          <p>Now, when they are being <mark type="inaudible" /> again that they need more working capital, so they withdraw more on their new or existing credit lines. And secondly, they also see that there will be more corporate sections in the market during 2010. Corporates-to-corporates private equity will come back and therefore we also see finest opportunities in that segment. So it will be a steady growth but not a fantastic double-digit growth but we will see increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And some comments on the Nordic banking margin, of course, the total Nordic banking net interest income has mostly been affected by the decline in the profit margin and that we expect to, of course, increase in line with higher interest rates more towards the latter part of the year and not so much in the first half.</p>
          <p>As relates the funding margin as you have seen throughout this year and also in 2008, we saw an increase in margin. We have kept that up also in Q4 on the corporate side. We generally expect margins to hold up fairly well. Of course, the levels that prevailed prior to the crisis did not reflect risk in the marketplace and we believe that is not a level that we're going to come back to.</p>
          <p>I think one additional comment maybe on this subject is the regulation part that, for sure, has an impact. It's difficult at this point of time to actually estimate how big that is for the banking market at large, but it has an impact and I think that will also support the margins as we go forward. Also household margins have kept up where we have, as I mentioned, the decline in the mortgage side in Norway, in particular, for administrative reasons, but I think in all fairness, we expect margins to also stay at good levels also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically, the Nordic Banking deposit margins would have reached bottom in the fourth quarter, assuming interest rates don't fall anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I think it's actually difficult to lower interest rates. As you know, it's difficult to lower interest rates much more than they are. So -- and particularly, you can see for Finland where interest rates are in fact lower than the official rates. So how long that will prevail is, of course, difficult to say but it's difficult to see a substantial further reduction of interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes through from the line of Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you so much. This is Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley. I have a couple of questions for you. First of all, I wanted to ask you whether you can tell us all your preliminary calculation, what you'd spend on the next stable funding ratio according to the Basel definition. My second question is, of course, on the guidance that you gave. Could you please help us to understand what base which you would be using there? Is it the stated or excluding the restructuring charges? And if so, what growth rate we are looking for into next year?</p>
          <p>Third question is on provisions. I just get the feeling that the tone that you are putting forward now is becoming a little bit more cautious than compared to in the previous quarter is that correctly understood? And finally, of course I have to ask &#x2013; it's a question on acquisitions. With your motivation surrounding capital and the buyback the argument that you put forward here, it seems that you are becoming even more clear that you want to make an acquisition, my real question is of course what and when and I understand it is very, very difficult to answer here for us but enlighten us as much as you can? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with net stable funding, I will refrain from actually giving you a number at this point and I guess no one is able to do that at this point in time. This is not transparent for us or anyone else how this will actually play out in the future. I will generally say that for the banking industry at large, the net stable funding put forward and that proposed and that measure is clearly the harshest one of the liquidity ratios. And it's not likely that it will stand in its current shape and form, but we don't in fact know enough yet to be able to even disclose the number. And of course, how to interpret is yet unclear for us, so we cannot do that. I can only maybe come back to what Christian also alluded to before. We perceive ourselves to have a very strong funding position in general. We have very low cost of funds and in more abstract or perhaps it is of course easier to be in that position talking about regulation than being weaker. So we will comment more on this at the Capital Markets event coming up in a couple of weeks, but it's difficult to actually provide you with a number. Maybe I should comment also on the cost guidance, and that our basis is the reported cost, the full year cost, which is 4% growth, so that's basis for that outlook for 2010 and of course as we have formulated it in the outlook is that inline with that level. Provisions any one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Provisions, yes, I mean you can obviously of course read it at your leisure, so to say. The reason why they are not precise is very much to do with our basic cautious standpoint on looking into the future. And also very much sort of pointing at the latter part of the statement that it's very difficult to say when provisions start to develop and therefore we want to be more awake because obviously we don't know but it is a matter of time, it's the time of course every year, it's very difficult to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to say that it's not, it should not be read as this is less or more conservative outlook than it was one quarter ago. I think we have exactly the same stance we have had for a long time. There might be a pretty long tail on this recession and that's very, very difficult to forecast quarter-by-quarter.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions, yes, you can say that we have the same stance as we had all the time. We think it's very difficult to pursue acquisitions right now with the uncertainty on regulatory issues. We think that a number of banking models in Europe, which will not be profitable going forward with the new regulation, especially on the funding side, and we're talking about those models where the balance sheet is mismatched too much and where the capital base is too weak. To see the spot banks like that continue like they do is difficult. So there will happen a lot of things when these things get clear, I'm sure.</p>
          <p>Another area which makes it difficult for larger bank transactions is the systemic risk regulation, which comes in several pockets, but it comes in the problem of being able to dissolve banks across border and thereby handling the systemic part. It comes also on the &#x2013; on a number of other areas of the systemic cross border issues. So in general I would say that larger cross border acquisitions are difficult right now until this becomes a bit more clear. We know a bit more what the requirements would be. So I think it's not likely we will see very big transaction in the short run. However, approaching the end of the year when the impact studies have been made on liquidity, when a lot of guarantee schemes from governments are running out when it should be a drawing liquidity, it will be a wakeup call for a number of banks where I think we need to see changes. So right now I think very little will happen, but during the year it will gradually become clear that things would have to happen. Whether that will place us in a position to do an acquisition or not it is difficult to say. We have our strategy. We can certainly deliver value with this strategy just presented and the initiatives, but we are open to look at other possibilities as we have been saying all the time so there is nothing new in this message.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just had a follow-up on corporate margins. I mean are you saying that they've peaked because I've noticed in Sweden, they have stopped going up, but obviously in some of the other countries they're still looking as if there's room to improve. Is it that they've peaked or you are not being that specific? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you a couple of comments. First of all, I think new lending margins is not increasing and has not been doing so for some time. So the margin pick up is largely due to the stock in average picking up, so old agreements. And of course, there is still repricing potential and as we have commented on before, that has the biggest potential has been in Finland and to some extent Sweden. And so, yes, of course there is still possibilities within that, but we have seen also a very, very significant pick-up in margins over the last several quarters. So the magnitude is of course difficult to estimate.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes through from the line of Torsten Bech from LD Investment Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, its Torsten Bech from LD Investment Markets from Copenhagen. Three main questions, two on cost, one on risk-weighted assets. Firstly on costs, you mentioned that FTEs were down 3% adjusted. Where are we aiming at in 2010? Is that flattish or where we are looking? Secondly, on costs also, I believe looking at staff cost in both Norway and Sweden, I noticed that we're looking at around 30% increase, both Q-on-Q and year-on-year on the staff costs in Norway and Sweden. And I was wondering if that's just normal seasonality or if there is any severance or restructuring items in the staff costs..</p>
          <p>And finally on risk-weighted assets, I was just trying to get an idea of the market risk increase. I see it on the trading book, non-book mark and what's happening? Is it due to Q3 was unusually low or could you just give some idea into this? That was my three questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the FTE side, we reached underlying 3% and we have not provided a target specifically for 2010, but there were several impacts here. First of all, we expect general growth of the business, which will require additional FTEs. We also have some impact both positive &#x2013; or not positive, but reducing and adding from the restructuring program or the Group investment. So in total we expect the number of FTEs to increase somewhat from current level, but we have not provided a specific forecast. The staff cost movement that you are referring to is mainly a consequence of restructuring. There were a couple of other seasonal impacts also relating to pension. So those are the main explanations. There are no level shift of any magnitude in any of those countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding risk-weighted assets and market risk, yes it's true that we had an increase at the year end and that was very much related to the fact that we had year high utilization of our market's limits. Just by the year end, we had increased our liquidity portfolios and we also have otherwise have a higher utilization of the risk limits. And there have also been some small changes into the models. And also if you put this in retrospect to what is to come, I mean there is a new Basel proposal already on the market is going forward, and that is very much in line with our expectations also that market is still requiring higher capital going forward in the new capital world.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew from Matrix. I've got two questions, please. Could you explain why there was a decrease in the core Tier 1 capital, please? Can you explain why there was a decrease in Tier 1 capital, but not why the core Tier 1 capital decreased?</p>
          <p>And secondly, assuming that base rates stay at current levels and taking into account mix effects going forward, at what point should be expect the Group net interest margin to stop falling? Would it be next quarter or two quarters from now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me start with the reduction in core Tier 1. You can also see from the main information of the course within the increase in risk-weighted assets in the Group between Q3 and Q4. We had a migration in the portfolio, which caused our risk-weighted assets increase and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry could I stop you there. I'm talking about the absolute value of the core Tier 1 equity, not the core Tier 1 equity ratio. If you look at the absolute value, then that falls to 17.8 billion from 18 billion quarter-on-quarter. And I'm looking at page 73 of the Fact Book, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes. Are you talking about Tier 1 or Core Tier 1?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Core Tier 1 in capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, partly this has to do with of course the acquisition of Fionia. And one of the reasons is, of course, that we had a goodwill payment for that acquisition, and as you are aware of the -- capital calculations that is actually reduced from the capital base. So that's the main explanation. There are also other items within this</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I also see -- the other deductions increasing there from 1.5 billion to 1.9 billion. Could you explain why that is, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. we are just looking through that. A number of smaller things I think is actually the answer, but while we are doing that, you had another question too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it was the time. And we can come back to that specific question, because there are lots of different things within that. And, of course, there is fluctuation in that. So we can come back on the details. But if we take a look at the net interest income margin and that's mainly related to the deposit margin, and of course in particular as we discussed previously, when interest rates would start to increase that's also when the net interest income margins will start to rise. Whether that is first and second and third or fourth quarter is of course anyone's guess. Our estimate is that it will happen more towards the latter part of the year, so maybe not so much movement in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also but if base rates don't rise, they stay the same, at what point would your net interest margin stop falling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you can say that has largely stopped already now because we have a slight and you can see that from our presentation that we have a slight pick-up in the corporate lending margin, a slight fall in household margins, which is due to as I alluded to before the Norwegian household mortgages. And of course also a minor decline in deposit margins for household side. So again this is you can say it has largely stopped at this point of time because interest rates are for the time being actually moving downward. So it is mostly due to the rise in base rates just as you alluded to, so that's pretty much the final. That's the full story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I see, that sounds like a commitment on your part that the net interest margin will stay about the same next quarter compared to this quarter with this quarter falling compared to last quarter?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Two question please. How much did Fionia add to NII in fourth quarter '09? And the second question is, what is the largest acquisition you think you can make until the regulatory environment becomes a bit clear? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will start with the Fionia -- it was marginally was, I think, it was &#x20AC;3 million, if I recall, very marginal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost review in there was roughly eight million, including some restructuring then we had revenues of fee.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's difficult to answer the question about the largest acquisition, I think you know the answer very well, it's difficult to say more or less impossible, because we don't know the capital equation, and we don't know the funding equation. So, I think, any activity in the coming months will be in this very small scale. But as I said more than close to the end of the year, a lot of hurdles will start to -- have to be met. And then it's probably also a different game, especially the capital side, I think, we'll have clear -- clarity on that towards the end of the year. But today it is very difficult.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions on your shipping portfolio. So first of all I'll be interested in getting to know the overall volume in the fourth quarter. Secondly some guidance on the loan loss ratio, whether the downturn experience in Q4 is going to continue in your view?</p>
          <p>And third question in the Q4 report you also indicate that you continued entering into transactions in the shipping finance during '09. And I will be interest in just getting some more flavor on the character of these transactions that you did. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think look &#x2013; now I am also looking for the actual number, but maybe I'll call you back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But basically I'll say that our shipping and offshore outstanding loan have been declining every quarter in the year, not a lot but slowly. And we are now in the Q4 we stand at 7.9 million, which is down from best start of the year which was 14.4 at the end of Q1. So not a dramatic but a slow reduction, basically indicating that activity overall has been rather slow. Then it's nice to note by the same token though that even given that profitability obviously has been kept up very well and reason being that the margins have increased more than the volumes have come down in comparisons so to say.</p>
          <p>And we have been active in a lot of restructuring cases where refinancing has been provided for maturing loans, but also for some other deliveries that were un-financed at the start of the year and that also glad to say that we have been able to syndicate each transaction that we have been underwriting put into the market. So there is still a good demand for shipping lease among shipping banks and that indicates as well that the risk in the shipping industry is not seen by banks, not only us but banks in general to be as severe as maybe many outside commentators has seen it. And we've also seen marked improvement in many segments, about segments more than others but also in the crude segment the rates today business are at very high levels. Of course they are spot rates and they are volatile. But also the real problem area it's really only containers that continue on a very weak and bleak level but then on the other hand is known that this segment where we are extremely little exposed.</p>
          <p>Loan loss ratio for the &#x2013; we had &#x20AC;15 million in the yearend and that was a low ratio. I don't have that now in my mind but it was not more than some thing like ratio of course in Q4 -- about eight basis points. And out of that two-thirds were correct information , so only something like 13, 14 basis points more in may be just provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. And the outlook for the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given any specific shipping outlook but I will say if you talk about the market as such, we see a pick-up in demand in lower growth and inward trade and these are sort of good indicators for an improved market. Then we have this in the counter balance still an over supply of ships coming into the market being delivered during 2010, maybe 2011.</p>
          <p>So it is &#x2013; it goes with the depressed market if you compare it to say 2006, 2007, but overall, we will see &#x2013; we believe a better market than we saw late 2008, early 2009.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, there is room for one more question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. One more question. The last question comes through from the line of Aaron Ibbotson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. I just got two quick questions, I guess. First of all, on the net interest income on the deposits margin expansion that a lot of the Nordic Banks seem to be sort of expecting when interest rates start to go up again. I was just wondering how much do you &#x2013; how much of that relates to salary accounts and how much of that relates to SME corporate lending and savings accounts where you potentially would see significant increased competition. Basically how much of your interest rate sensitivity is dependent on a repeat of the last cycle behavior?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to corporate margins and I am surprised that you are not seeing them expand basically despite economic improvements I guess. But the key question for me is if I take your expected losses of 25 basis points and look at your guidance roughly, I guess for sort of 11 to 12% return on equity under normalized losses and I sort of struggle to see how you are not going to see a repricing upwards on both the corporate and the household margin side. I am just trying to see what's stopping you? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe start with &#x2013; I am not fully sure I understand your question, Aaron, because the deposit margin, of course, the main impact comes from the transaction accounts within the household. Then of course that's a major part of our business as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But total part of your deposits, how much is transaction household accounts, total of your deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The transaction account is roughly 60 -- little over 60 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Savings and deposits, transactions. So of course, that's the major part and we have time deposits that will be influenced less. It's important, Aaron, to understand that now interest rates are so low, that the margin also on savings deposits &#x2013; or savings accounts is practically zero. And the reason is that we simply cannot lower the interest rates at these very low levels. So the pick-up you can say from the savings accounts will be equally strong, at least at the early part of the interest rate rise.</p>
          <p>So both of those parts will be very, very beneficial, I think, the banking sector for us in general. So at least for the first, let's say, 100 basis points, the positive impact will be large. Less so of course from the time deposits on the corporate side, which is also a big part of our balance sheet that will for sure improve. But there you're right, the competition is higher, and of course the margin pick-up is slightly less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the corporate margins, if I make one comment on that, I think also the fact that there are so few major transactions now makes it more difficult for the banks to reprice. Basically we have seen utilization of existing credits that is affecting the outstanding loan. When you come to refinancing, which we did quite a lot of refinancing right end of this year, next year, I'm sure that you can see again margins under pressure to increase because than they're talking about serious reforms that need to be put on the table. And they also see fewer players. And they also, at the same time, have this capital impact, which will be clear by then. And we expect that that will sort of show green light for higher margins rather than lower margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But on the household side, you are basically seeing constant refinancing of your -- more or less your entire mortgage book, let's say, half of it every three months. So why do we not see an expansion there? Well, if you have three months variable rates in Norway, it's 90%, no. So I'm just confused by the Nordic Bank seems to be targeting an ROE on their lending business of between 10 and 11%, even assuming basically no credit losses. I'm just confused as to how you make the equation go and what type of ROEs you're actually targeting for your lending business longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean the repricing in the mortgage book is certainly not that quick. Let's say the two biggest markets is Denmark and Finland, and there we are -- as you know, Denmark it's basically fixed 50 &#x2013; 50 basis points all the time. In Finland, the margin stays the same even if the reference period is changed. And the refinances sort of more a matter of 10 to 15% a year than one-third. So it is a slower process.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
