          <p>Welcome to TOTAL 2010 First Quarter Results Conference Call.  I'll now hand over to Mr. Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re.  Please sir, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hello, everyone and thank you for calling on a Friday afternoon.  First, I will comment on the results and then we will go to the Q&amp;A. I will not take too much time on the first quarter environment.  Globally, oil was trading around $75 per barrel but the price of gas remained low and the refining environment was still difficult, even if margins recovered.</p>
          <p>Looking at the first quarter results compared to the fourth quarter of '09, production was 2.43 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 2.1%. Adjusted net income was $3.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the fourth quarter and I would remind you that TOTAL was among the most resilient companies in 2009 in term of results. Annualized royalty for the business segments was 15%, which compares favorably versus our peers. The net cash flows were $3.6 billion compared to a negative $1 billion in the fourth quarter and our gearing at the end of the first quarter was 21.5%.</p>
          <p>So now I will comment on each of the segments. In the Upstream, the five major projects that we started in 2009 are performing well and in line with our expectations. The second train at Yemen LNG started up in March in advance of our summer target date. First quarter production was 2.43 million barrel of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 4.5% compared to the same quarter last year and more than 2% compared to the previous quarter. Part of the increase is coming from our energy volumes, which grew by 38% year-over-year. Also, another point to make here is that the improvement in Nigeria and the reduction related to OPEC's restriction was positive compared to a year ago and that's roughly in line with the fourth quarter. We confirm that we expect production to grow by 2% on average over the 2010 to 2014 period and we confirm the 2010 growth will be above the 2% average at current oil prices.</p>
          <p>In term of commodity prices, the average for Brent in the first quarter was $76 per barrel, up slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Our average realized liquid price was up by about 5% compared to the fourth quarter. Our average realized natural gas price in the first quarter was about $5 per million Btu, down slightly from the level of the fourth quarter. The price does not include sales of LNG from our equity affiliates, notably the new production from Qatar and Yemen.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our average gas price for spot and contract sales was modestly higher, although our long-term contract prices in Asia and South America were flat. But there have been some change in the portfolios that reduced our average realized gas price including mainly the addition of the Barnett Shale and of the Tabiyeh contract in Syria.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income from the Upstream segment was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 5% compared to fourth quarter. Given the higher average price realization and higher production volumes, the explanation for this is mainly an adjustment in Upstream taxes. In the first quarter, the Upstream tax rate was 60% versus 58 in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter tax rate was below the 2009 average and the first quarter includes some adjustment from last year. The annualized first quarter Upstream royalty continues to be very competitive at 20%. We are continuing to actively manage the Upstream portfolio.  In the first quarter, we acquired a 20% share in the Barnett Shale. We sanctioned the development of Surmont Phase 2 in Canada and the Laggan-Tormore project in the UK North Sea.  The Gulf project, deep-offshore Angola, has been sanctioned internally and we expect our partner to report it very soon. These three projects should start producing in the 2014, 2015 period and contribute close to 200,000 barrel of oil equivalent a day net to our long-term growth.</p>
          <p>We announced the sale of major and non-core assets in the U.S. and in Norway for a combined amount of more than $1.1 billion. The current production from this field is about 14,000 barrels per day net to Total. Exploration remains a key element of our Upstream strategy. In particular, we are pleased with the success we have had this quarter in deep-offshore Angola. We have one discovery in Block 17/06 and two discoveries on Block 15/06. Also, we added exploration opportunities in Kazakhstan and in France.  In addition, as you know, we are well advanced in negotiation to enter a giant new play in Uganda.</p>
          <p>Managing cost will continue to be a priority. We were one of the very few in 2009 to succeed in keeping our technical costs per barrel flat and we had the lowest technical costs among the major ones. Going forward, our challenge will be to control the world pressure on costs related to raw material and energy costs. Overall, our role is to position the company for future growth and to maintain capital discipline so that we can fully benefit from the increase in commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Now, some comments on the Downstream and Chemicals. Our European refining margin indicator averaged $29.5 per ton in the first quarter. This reflects a recovery from the very low levels of the second half of last year. The increase is positive but still reflects a difficult environment for refining.  Adjusted net operating income from the Downstream segment was $0.2 billion. This is an improvement from the fourth quarter but refinery throughput and marketing volumes were both lower.  Specifically, in addition to some price effect, we had unscheduled maintenance in the first quarter that affected Luanda, Flanders and Normandy and this cost us about $100 million.  Operationally, these three refineries are back on track for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>For the long term we are confident that the Downstream environment will improve, as the global economy continues to recover. But it is clear that there is too much capacity in the global system today. Total's response to this situation has been to manage cost and reduce refining capacity.  We have decided to close one distillation unit at the Normandy refinery.  We are in the process of shutting down the Dunkirk refinery and selling another refinery outside of France.  So we can confirm the target of reducing by 20%, our refining capacity between 2007 and 2011. Note that we also announced in the first quarter, the merger of our refining and marketing activities in Italy with ERG, which will further improve our competitive position there.</p>
          <p>Switching to Chemical segment, compared to the fourth quarter, adjusted net operating income more than doubled $2.2 billion in the first quarter. We are in an environment that has shown positive movement in response to the economic recovery, particularly in the Specialty Chemicals but we are still in a recovery mode. For the Base Chemicals in March, we started up the new 1.3 million ton per year ethane cracker at Ras Laffan in Qatar, which will contribute very positively to the petrochemical bottom line. This is in line with our strategy to develop this activity in the Middle East based on cheap ethylene feedstock and in Asia.</p>
          <p>In the Specialty Chemicals, earlier this month we announced that we closed the sales of Mapa Spontex unit for about $450 million. This is part of our policy to monetize non-strategic assets.</p>
          <p>And finally on the corporate side, cash flow from operations from the first quarter was $7.3 billion. Investments, including acquisition, were $5.0 billion, acquisition were $1.7 billion, coming mainly from the Barnett Shale and Laggan-Tormore. The investments were $1.4 billion in the first quarter.  This is essentially the ongoing sales of Sanofi shares. Our participation in Sanofi is now 6.2% versus 10.9% at the end of the first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Reducing our interest in Sanofi had a negative impact of slightly more than $100 million on the income from equity affiliates between the two periods. At the current market value, we have close to $6 billion left to sell and we expect to complete the process by 2012. The sale of the Upstream asset and the Mapa Spontex unit for more than $1.5 billion will be recorded in the second quarter. On June 1, we will pay the remainder of the 2009 dividend of &#x20AC;1.14 per share, which today represent a yield of about 5.5%. If we annualized the dividend and the first quarter results, this indicates that the pay out ratio is really manageable at around 55%. Our gearing was 21.5% at the end of the first quarter. The dividend payment in June will increase the gearing by around five points, so we should be well within our announced 25 to 30% range. The balance sheet is strong and in the current environment, cash flow from operation can stand our investments and dividends.</p>
          <p>To summarize, the first quarter was about delivering strong production growth and being very active in strengthening our portfolio by launching new products, selling non-core assets, restructuring Downstream activities and continuing to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second quarter, we remain very positive about production growth.  Oil price remains strong and our gas price realization should benefit from a positive lag effect. So, we are confident that Upstream will be in a good shape. Downstream and Chemicals are more difficult to predict. We expect refining margin and petrochemical margin to continue to be volatile. For both the Downstream and the Chemical segments, we must continue to concentrate on restructuring in major countries, expanding in growth areas and controlling cost.</p>
          <p>For the company as a whole, we are well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet and our main objective is to manage our cash flow to fund an investment program that will provide long-term profitable growth and a competitive return to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And now, we can go to the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  We have a first question from Mr. Jothilingam from Morgan Stanley.  Please, sir, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  Good afternoon, Patrick. It's Theepan here at Morgan Stanley.  Three quick questions actually, firstly, just on European gas realizations.  I was wondering, could you give us a little bit of color on how you see price realization in Europe evolving through Q2 and then into the rest of this year, particularly sort of from a contract perspective?  Second question just on taxes, it appears that your tax rate was a little bit higher this quarter.  I was wondering if you could give guidance for the full year where you saw that, if you left the oil price where it was.  And lastly just on Jubail, I was just wondering if you could give us a quick update there.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Theepan. I will start with the tax rate question, your second question first.  You mentioned, and this is true, that our tax rate for first quarter of 2010 is about 60% higher than the 57% tax rate we had last quarter of 2009. This 57% tax rate in 2009 was low and was extremely low, below the average of the year. So you should not take this as a real benchmark for us. The rest of the year you could expect a small increase of Upstream tax rate versus last year, due to higher oil price. So I would say potentially in the range of 59 to 60% for the tax rate, this is Upstream of course.</p>
          <p>On Jubail, works are going in line with our expectation. All contracts have been passed for at that time and I have no information of any delay of whatsoever and I think everything is going smoothly in Jubail as update.  I will move on the European gas price question, the first question you had.  In Europe, we benefited from an increase in gas price versus last quarter '09, mainly increasing the spot gas price, price slightly increased gas price from long-term contract, which are indexed on oil prices.  I am expected this trend to continue in the forthcoming quarter and I think that's all I can say. You have to recognize that spot gas price in Europe are about 50% higher than in the U.S. currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick.  Could you just remind us what your split between contract and spot is in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think let me think about it, it's something like 40% spot, 60% long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  That's very clear.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Theepan, bye-bye.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mrs. Lydia Rainforth from Barclays. Please, madam, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Good afternoon, Patrick. Two questions, if I could.  Firstly, you just talked about technical costs being flat in 2009. I was wondering how you see those moving in 2010?  And then secondly, just on the Halfaya project Iraq. I think Mr. de Margerie was making comments said Total doesn't want a minority stake in that field, and that we'd like it to be bigger.  I was just wondering what had changed since the initial bidding round.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On technical costs, we are obviously expecting both technical costs for the forthcoming year to go up because of higher DD&amp;A basically. On OpEx we will see, it will depend mainly on ForEx. On Iraq, more broadly, I would say that Iraq is an important country for us and it's a real opportunity for us to increase our exposure to new project in Iraq, which makes sense. I mean, which we can actually make reasonable money while developing resources in this country, we will try and do it. On, concerning Halfaya, a contract has just been signed with CNPC. CNPC being the operator and we are happy with that I think. I have no indication that this will change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Please, sir, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, Patrick. Two questions, actually. One is, are you able to give some indication of where the increment in terms of the LNG sales that you made either 1Q over 4Q or 1Q over 1Q went, i.e. the markets that those volumes went to? Just to get some idea about, I guess the potentiality of increase spreading over time as they get diverted back to higher value markets.  And the second is, is my impression has always been that Total has been reluctant historically to sell Upstream assets.  I guess that's partly a view of the upside potential in oil prices, but you typically have not churned your portfolio anywhere near as much as anyone else.  And I just wondered whether the disposals that you talked about doing is &#x2013; reflects a sort of change of philosophy in the way that you manage your Upstream portfolio now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Jon, for those question, I will ask &#x2013; answer first the LNG question.  I will give you, because we were prepared for this question actually, Jon. On Yemen LNG first quarter this year, we offtake four cargos, total offtake four cargos. Two went to the U.S. or Mexico and two went to Asia, one in Korea, one in China. On Qatargas 2, we offtake seven cargos. Three went to the U.S, Mexico direction, four cargos goes to South Hook and one cargo went to Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's basically in France. I would say that globally, for our LNG offtake, 60% went to Asia, 30% went to Europe and 9% went to North America. That was for the LNG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question, is there any move in our philosophy about selling assets.  First of all, I will mention to you that their offer, that it is difficult to refuse. So, the offer we had on Valhall was so attractive to us that we, with no hesitation, take it. Addition to that, I would say that we are ready &#x2013; I'm not saying that we will do it, will depend on prices but we are ready to be more flexible in our asset management and we are ready to sell what is believed non-core assets for us, including in the Upstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is a bit of a change, isn't it? From the way you used to manage that business, am I right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right, because we have done nothing in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company.  Please, sir, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon, just a couple of questions.  I wanted to follow up on the technical cost issue.  It appeared to me, at least upon initial analysis, that the technical costs in the first quarter were really quite high by comparison to prior periods. Do you agree that that is the case and is there anything in particular we could attribute that to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mark. Our technical cost first quarter this year was about $14.7 per barrel excluding exploration.  And it was 14.9 last quarter '09. So it was not as high as in last quarter '09. So I don't share exactly your view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We can talk about that perhaps later. I also noticed that it appears from the indication of price sensitivity per production sharing contracts that it seems to have increased fairly significantly in the first quarter.  Is there something specific or that has caused that?  And also, did you encounter any threshold effects in production sharing contracts that would &#x2013; that impacted first quarter and future volumes going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I well remember the sensitivity on price and I compare first quarter '09 to first quarter this year, was about 2,300 barrel per day, per dollar, per barrel. And this is not far from the sensitivity we had. In term of threshold, I think we figure some threshold in Angola but, I am sorry, I don't know them by heart but we will revert to you.  I will ask the IR to come back to you in that respect, to give you the exact timing when we match those thresholds.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We have a question from Mrs. Irene Himona from Exane. Please, Mrs., go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Patrick, it's Irene Himona at Exane. I had three questions, please. First, you had a positive working capital in the quarter despite the higher pricing and this drove quite a bit of the 30% increase in cash. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind the working capital and will it resolve in the rest of the year? My second question was on product sales, obviously they sell quite steeply in the U.S. and Europe. I presume part of that was due to the refining situation. But can you talk a little bit about oil demand trends that you are seeing so far this year?  And my final question is on Clov. The trade press is indicating a potential delay because apparently Sonangol may have rejected your recommended contractors. I wonder if there's any comment you can make. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Irene. Your first question about working capital, you may have noted that every first quarter we have a reduction of our working capital. This is due to a tax effect we always have last quarter of the year and first quarter of the following year.  In the last quarter of any calendar year, we pay taxes in advance. In Germany for instance, in Italy for instance, and we have this credit the following quarter. This is why we always have a reduction of our working capital first quarter of any calendar year.</p>
          <p>Some comment about oil demand trend. In Europe, we see a drop in volumes compared to first quarter '09 and last quarter '09, mainly due to business-to-business activity and mainly also due to drop in fuel oil sales. You have to remember also that in France, there were rumor for a special tax, which was aiming to increase the fuel oil prices late quarter &#x2013; last quarter '09 and these taxes did not happen actually. But as people were afraid of these taxes, there were buying a lot of fuel oil prior end of the year. This is why we also maybe were facing this drop in volume first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>In Africa, I would say and Middle East, we see an increase in volume in comparison to first quarter '09. And more globally speaking, talking to the traders, we see demand going slightly up on a worldwide basis, mostly driven by Asia and Middle East. On Clov, you know that we have internally sanctioned this project.  It is in the process of being approved by our other partners. It is true also that Sonangol and the State of Angola is willing to have more local content and this is part of the game.  And this is normal discussion in that process. It might be that some contractor are not happy with that but for us this is normal business.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I actually have two questions. The first actually is perhaps a revamp of Mark Gilman's question earlier, because I noticed exactly the same issue with the Upstream versus Q4. Looking at EBIT, so excluding the higher tax charge, you basically had slightly high oil prices versus Q4, you had an increase of &#x2013; in volume of about 50,000 barrels a day, flat gas price, flat exploration charge and yet your Q1 EBIT was flat in dollar terms versus Q4. So I'm just wondering if there is a start-up cost issues here. Again, the underlying issue is whether the incremental volumes, the new volumes are actually adding incremental margin, as you previously highlighted in presentations.  And then, just the second question has been asked in the past. I noticed, Patrick, that every number you quoted in your prepared remarks were in dollars.  You have commented about being the biggest company in the Euro zone, et cetera. But are you still considering reporting your results solely in U.S. dollars? Thank you.</p>

          <p>To answer your second question, by French law I cannot issue my books in any other currency except euro. I am sorry for that, but under French law and this is the same under Italian law, we are not permitted to use another currency.  Of course, we will use the dollar to give the market appropriate data but the formal books have to be maintained in euro.  Your question about cost and EBIT, you need to understand that volumes were up in comparison to Q4, but we &#x2013; by volume I mean production rate, but there were two day less in the calendar quarter, first quarter 2010 in comparison to last quarter 2009. And of course and also, and you didn't know that, we made less uplift in this last quarter, first quarter '010 in comparison to last quarter '09. So basically roughly, the sales are quite stable.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I just missed that. You made less, quarter, in Q1 versus Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean you have less calendar days.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So and we, in addition to that, we made less uplift.  So in aggregate the sale, despite the growth in production, the sale was stable.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick, it's Lucas at Deutsche.  Actually I'm just on to extend you beyond the half an hour.  But seriously, it was the same question, really, that Neill and Mark asked, but I guess part of me is just wondering as well in terms of the relatively strange profit performance on better volumes and better price. How much of that is actually the fact that for the LNG businesses in Qatar and in the Yemen, you actually are just consolidating income at the &#x2013; on the equity line? And so in effect, we're seeing barrels come through the &#x2013; we're seeing barrels coming through the Upstream line but clearly with no operating income. Is that an appropriate observation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Those equity consolidated are below the line but you also have to understand that the tax hike has an effect also in our bottom line. And as it was mentioned at the beginning, the tax hike we had this quarter was higher than the last quarter '09 in the range of 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Patrick, just going back to Europe and gas prices, I mean your comment with gas pricing in Europe was broadly flat, which I'm slightly surprised by, given that if I look back four to six months, there's been very marked improvement in oil prices. And you would have expected some stronger improvement on the contract side of your business this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Not in comparison to last quarter '09.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a slight lag effect, but that's it. I can give you some figures. The average gas price for North Europe was last quarter '09, $6.01 per million Btu, where it was 6.28 this quarter. So there is so much &#x2013; not so much difference between the two quarters.</p>

          <p>Patrick, I've noticed that the natural gas volumes from the Middle East were quite a bit higher than I would have thought in this period and were higher by a much greater amount than the increase in reported equity production. Can you comment on what was driving that, particularly given that the second train at Yemen did not, as you had indicated, start up until March?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on LNG, the growth was about plus 40%, which is in line of the target. In addition towards the LNG volume, you have the Tabiyeh contract in Syria, which increased the volume, and I think that's it.</p>

          <p>Yes Good afternoon to everybody. A quick question on the Laggan-Tormore final investment decision. In your strategy presentation in February, you showed the CapEx reduction obtained in the Surmont Phase 2 and the Clov. Can you give us some flavor also on the CapEx reduction achieved for the Laggan-Tormore and some more indication on the tax benefit you've obtained for this project from the UK government?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have in mind the exact figure for the cost reduction obtained in Laggan-Tormore, but this was part of the decision process we had. And this is thanks to both the cost reduction and the tax rebate we obtained. And then we decided to launch the Laggan-Tormore, which at that particular date, was matching our investment criteria. But I'm sorry, I don't have those figures. I think for the tax itself, it's two times $150 million, I think about.  So something like $300-320 million tax rebate. And this was necessary to launch a project.</p>
