          <p>Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's first-quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Web site at www.honeywell.com/investor.</p>
          <p>Please note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter, as well as our expectations for the second quarter and for the remainder of 2010, and of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. We have a great start to 2010, with better than expected improvement in many of our end markets, yielding EPS higher than the guidance provided last month. Sales of 7.8 billion, up 3%, at the high end of our previously guided range, reflecting stabilization across our businesses, selected growth with new products, geographic expansion, and overall improving conditions.</p>
          <p>We generated earnings per share of $0.50, including covering a $0.02 charge related to the elimination of the Medicare Part D subsidy, and excluding pension expense, on more of an apples-to-apples basis, our earnings were up 21% in the quarter. Our segment margin rate was 13.3%, up 170 basis points from prior year, reflecting margin expansion in 3 out of 4 businesses. This really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance and continued strong cost controls, while maintaining our growth investments for the future.</p>
          <p>Further reflecting earnings quality, we generated almost $700 million of free cash flow, up 190% from prior year, primarily driven by higher segment profit, working capital improvements and slightly lower capital spending. Given the strength of our first-quarter financial performance and improving end market conditions, we are raising our full-year guidance. We now expect earnings in the range of 2.30 to 2.45 a share and when you exclude pension expense, that reflects a 4 to 9% increase in earnings over the prior year.</p>
          <p>We're also raising our free cash flow estimate to 2.8 to 3.1 billion for the year, up from 2.4 to 2.7 billion. There is clear evidence things are getting better and end markets have stabilized. We're seeing orders growth across all of our businesses. Our early cycle businesses, where we saw the biggest hit, are also seeing the biggest improvements, namely turbos, sensing and controls, gas detection and safety products. That said, we are continuing to take steps in all of our businesses to ensure we and our suppliers are prepared for the recovery. The growth we've seen in our end markets is being supplemented by the results of our seed-planting initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our investments and focus in emerging regions are really paying off. Sales in Asia Pacific are up strongly, reflecting good growth in China in transportation and ACS, but also growth in Japan and Korea. We continue to build on our platforms for growth, as evidenced by the number and caliber of wins in our Process Solutions business in the quarter.</p>
          <p>ACS was selected to control boiler operations and help drive a 50% increase in production capacity for Thailand's first supercritical power plant. We are also awarded a significant $5 million commitment to supply instrumentation equipment to a Korean ship builder for their entire fleet. And RMG secured a $5 million contract from a Chinese gas pipeline distribution company to provide regulators for gas pressure reduction stations.</p>
          <p>Also important to note, as you know, we've been working to win a major role on the C919, the single-aisle commercial airliner in China. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, COMAC recently announced Honeywell's selection to provide our enhanced 131-9 APU, bringing significant growth potential with an estimated lifetime value over $7 billion on a very important platform.</p>
          <p>New product introductions continue to make a difference. For example, ACS introduced approximately 115 new products in the quarter, including the Honeywell Zephyr, the industry's most accurate airflow sensor for medical and industrial applications. ECC and Life Safety continue to have terrific uptake on their recent new product launches, including two new fixed gas detectors suited for the mid- to high-end industrial and oil and gas segments that are selling exceptionally well and are offering important new approvals and protocols in the industry.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, our fluorine products business launched a new EnovatePRO program, which features a new energy efficient foam insulation and sealants. The program is specifically designed to help renovators and contractors offer a broader range of energy-efficient solutions to home and building owners.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in our big process initiatives as well as other seed planting across the organization: the Honeywell operating system, Velocity product development, and Functional Transformation continue to be huge enablers for growth and productivity this year. With 80% of our manufacturing cost base now within HOS Deployment, we are expecting an acceleration in bronze sites this year which is where we really start seeing transformational results.</p>
          <p>While the organization is showing tremendous momentum, it is important to add that we will not sacrifice our performance and sustainability standards just to hit a targeted deployment rate. Go slow to go fast is still our watchword here.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we're committed to driving productivity enhancements across the organization and remain focused on flawlessly executing the repositioning projects that we have initiated. This focus on fixed costs remains a priority for us.</p>
          <p>So in summary, a strong start to the year, a better than expected quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute both commercially and operationally, and invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Good morning and thank you for joining the conference call. Let me start on slide 4 and walk you through the summary financials for the first quarter. And as Dave mentioned, as you can see, we are clearly seeing signs of improvement, reflected in the better-than-anticipated performance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Reported sales were up 3% to 7.8 billion, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange and better than anticipated growth in several of our key short-cycle businesses.</p>
          <p>We had obviously strong operating leverage, growing our segment profit by 18%. Margins increased 170 basis points to 13.3%. We saw further good margin performance from ACS, which was up 200 basis points in the quarter, impressive year-over-year gains in both TS and SM; they were up 1,000 and 300 basis points, respectively. It's kind of interesting to say 1,000 basis points improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>It is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>These gains were partially offset by lower margins in Aero, which was down 120 basis points in the quarter on lower revenues. Of course, we'll go into the segments in some detail in just a moment.</p>
          <p>Net income in the quarter declined only 3%. EPS declined 7%, including the unfavorable impact of higher noncash pension expenses in the quarter. When you exclude the pension expense impact from both 2009 and 2010 first quarters, the earnings were up an impressive 21% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>There's a couple things worth pointing out. First, as Dave said, we had 13 million after-tax charge for healthcare legislation. Think of that as approximately $0.02 of headwind in the quarter. We also had $40 million of net repositioning actions in the quarter, and also, finally, $37 million of one-time OPEB curtailment gain resulting from a planned amendment where we eliminated a retiree subsidy as part of a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>
          <p>So effectively the OPEB curtailment benefit, the 37 million and the repositioning expense of 40 really offset and the healthcare charge lives through. Therefore, relative to our initial guidance, the $0.50 of EPS reported in the quarter reflects a clear beat and a much stronger quarter than we anticipated, driven by better than expected operating performance.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was also strong, $673 million of free cash flow representing an approximately three times improvement over the cash we delivered in the first quarter of 2009. And looking at free cash flow conversion, if we stripped out the impact of the noncash pension expense on net income, a high-quality earnings story that equates to 127% conversion of net income, again reinforcing the core processes we have in place and the focus on generating strong cash.</p>
          <p>With that summary, let's turn to slide 5, just to take a few minutes on the update on our key market assumptions for 2010. Now, while a number of the assumptions are unchanged from our initial review and guidance back in December, we thought it would be helpful to just spend a minute updating you on where we are on each of these.</p>
          <p>I'd like to just take a moment first of all on Aerospace. Here, the assumptions for 2010 have not changed, and we're still anticipating flat to slightly down revenues in the total segment in 2010, although clearly we continue to see improved indicators for a recovery. Consistent with that, orders are up in Aero strongly in the first quarter, off the extremely low 2009 levels. BGA in Aero is seeing an uptick in mechanical spares orders as well as a rebound in long-cycle orders. While down slightly in the quarter, the ATR spares orders are showing sequential improvement. And as we said before, we're not counting on much recovery in ATR aftermarket in '10, which is reflected in our outlook for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving to -- down the chart and I'll cover obviously Aero in more depth in a moment when we get to their operating results for the quarter and their outlook -- moving down the chart, turning to ACS, and looking at the retrofit activity, as you know, the residential, commercial and institutional infrastructure verticals account for most of the non-industrial business, about two-thirds of ACS. That remains a bright spot, reflecting the continued growth in energy and regulation-driven retrofits and good penetration of new products. So as you can see, we've given a green arrow for that one.</p>
          <p>Looking just down to the industrial piece of ACS business, falling down the chart, looking at the industrial ACS business in developed regions, which account for about 15 to 20% of the ACS portfolio, we're seeing clear signs of improvement in many of these short-cycle businesses, including sensing and control, industrial gas detectors, industrial safety products. So industrial product production rates are ramping up in every region of the world, and we're benefiting from that. While it's still early, we're encouraged by improving order rates. For example, just to give some color, S&amp;P orders were up 46% in the first quarter on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>On the process industrial side, we're not seeing conditions get markedly better or worse; industry capacity utilization remains below historic averages, restraining capital investment. However, we are expecting U.S. capacity utilization to make gradual improvement throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to see positives on the emerging markets, which have been less impacted by the construction turmoil, obviously, and credit market issues. The consensus of industrial production growth in China and India continues to improve at 15.5% up and 11.6% up, respectively. These trends are showing up in our order rates, where we're poised to deliver strong growth rates across ACS. And I'll share a little bit of that with you when we get into the ACS review in just a moment.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at Turbo, the first-half macroindicators look great for the business. We are seeing better than expected European light vehicle production. It's up dramatically in the first half. However, the industry is expecting European production to increase only about 4% for the full year. Global production rates are looking good. The U.S. and emerging region production rates continue to be revised upward, reflecting improved demand. So a nice green arrow there for Turbo.</p>
          <p>As you know, another indicator we're track for Turbo is European diesel penetration. Versus our previous estimates for '10, we are now expecting diesel pen to regain about two points, two full percentage points over the reduced 2009 levels. And of course, very importantly, in addition to the macros, Turbo continues to benefit from a significant number of new platform launches during the year, which will be well over 100.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the chart, for UOP we continue to see good demand for products &#x2013; UOP's products and technologies across refining, petrochemical and natural gas markets, and while U.S. capacity rationalization in some of those markets is still in progress, we see continued new investments in emerging regions.</p>
          <p>So with that summary of key market assumptions, let's go to the first of the segments, Aero on slide number 6. You can see here that Aero sales were down in the quarter, about 9%, reflecting improvement in the rate of change over the fourth quarter, which was down 18%, and importantly, the sales of 2.5 billion reflect the high end of our first quarter guidance range that we set back in January.</p>
          <p>Segment profit for Aero declined 15%. Margins were down 120 basis points. Parts where lower sales volume really was the key driver of that, partially offset by volume-related material and labor cost reductions and also the benefits from prior repositioning actions.</p>
          <p>Now, a little bit of color in terms of the sales performance by segment within Aero. Total commercial sales, that is, the sum of ATR and Business Aviation &#x2013; Air Transport and Business Aviation, were down 17% in the quarter, primarily driven by lower sales to OEs, with declines across both of the ATR and BGA segments.</p>
          <p>Commercial OE sales were down 34%. However, it reflects stabilization from our fourth quarter levels. Air Transport and Regional were down about 16%, due to declining shipments, mostly in the region &#x2013; to regional jet customers. Business OE sales were down 59%, following the significant customer reschedules and delivery cancellations that occurred in 2009. However, it was an increase for BGA OE on a sequential basis. And we expect to see continued sequential improvement in the business aviation OE segment throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the commercial aftermarket, commercial aftermarket sales for Aero were down 3% in the quarter, although also reflecting stabilization from fourth-quarter levels. On the air transport and regional side of the aftermarket, those sales were down 4%, but were flat on a sequential basis, driven by lower spares as a result of higher parked aircraft and customer inventory initiatives, despite a 4% increase in flying hours.</p>
          <p>Now, again, we expect global flying hours to continue to improve this year. However, we don't expect our aftermarket sales to fully re-couple in line with utilization rates or flying hours until later this year.</p>
          <p>On the business aviation side, the business aviation aftermarket sales were up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher mechanical spare sales in the quarter, driven by improving business jet utilization rates, offset by lower engine maintenance events.</p>
          <p>Looking at DNF, the defense business within Aero, sales were flat in the quarter, however, up 2% when you exclude our commercial helicopter business which resides from a reporting standpoint within the Defense reporting structure. Now, growth in Defense is being driven in both U.S. and foreign military OE sales, including continued demand for T55 engines to power the Chinook heavy-lift helicopter which continues to see stronger sales and deployment around the world. In addition, we saw good growth in our Government Services business as we continue to provide logistics support and services to the military throughout the world.</p>
          <p>So in summary, standing back from Aero, we're seeing signs of stabilization in Aero in the commercial aftermarket business. We're seeing improving conditions in business jets, and we're continuing to see good, solid performance out of Defense and Space. And the Aero team is executing well across all the businesses, continuing to win attractive new business as Dave said, including their impressive APU win on the new COMAC C919.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to ACS, slide number 7. Reported sales for ACS were up 4% in the quarter, down 1% if you exclude the benefit of foreign exchange. The biggest increases that we saw for ACS in the quarter were in Asia which was up 12% on a constant currency, basis partially offset by slower growth in the Americas and continued weakness in European markets.</p>
          <p>Now, segment margins were obviously a terrific story in the quarter for ACS, up an impressive 200 basis points to 12.4%, reflecting the impact of continued cost controls, the benefits from prior-period repositioning actions, as well as new product introductions.</p>
          <p>Now, on the product side of ACS, those were up &#x2013; sales were up 5% in the quarter, showing very good organic growth since the downturn began. We saw continued growth in Asia-Pacific, with sales up 32% on a constant currency basis, strong growth in China, up 42% in the quarter. So that clearly, strong pockets of early cycle improvement, mostly in the industrial channels, as well as in the emerging regions, supported by increases in manufacturing production and the favorable impact of increased safety regulations.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, Testing and Control was very strong. Also, Scanning and Mobility. Those were both up approximately 15% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We also had good year-over-year growth in gas detection and personal protection equipment, which were both up mid-single digits. And Environmental Combustion Controls, ECC, was also up in the quarter, with good penetration of new product launches.</p>
          <p>On the Solutions business side, the Solutions businesses were up 2%, driven by favorable foreign exchange, growth in energy efficiency products and building solutions, and also the favorable impact of the RMG acquisition in Process Solutions, partially offset by continued softness in refining projects globally. In the quarter, Solutions saw an impressive ramp-up in orders, 8% up on a constant currency basis. Orders in Process Solutions came up sharply, rebounded very well, up approximately 20%, reflecting clearly a snapback in demand for our latest field instruments and solutions; Field Instrument Solutions had a terrific quarter.</p>
          <p>ACS segment profit as we said was up 24% in the quarter versus last year, reflecting strong operating leverage, representing 200 basis point increase in margins to 12.4%, due to indirect cost savings initiatives as well as the benefits of prior-period repositioning. So another very good performance by the ACS team, who continues to execute on commercial excellence initiatives, deliver a robust new product pipeline, and continue to expand and perform in emerging regions and internationally.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to slide 8 and Transportation Systems. TS sales were up an impressive 33% in the quarter, including 7% foreign exchange impact. Segment margins increased a full 10 points to 9.6%. And by the way, when I report now and discuss Turbo, we've combined Friction and Turbo in terms of our consolidated data that we'll be reporting on &#x2013; for that segment on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>So on a combined basis, Turbo saw a further improvement in the rate of change, up 45% in the first quarter, reflecting robust new product platform launches, as well as the favorable macrotrends that I referenced earlier. We saw continued sharp rebound in passenger commercial vehicle production in Europe, as well as in Asia, particularly in China and Korea. European diesel penetration, as I said, is also better than expected in the quarter. It was up to 52%, recovering almost all of the sharp decline that we experienced in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, we expect to continue to benefit from our high win rates on attractive new gas and diesel platforms and also increased production schedules in the second quarter. It's important to note, however, that the industry is forecasting, as I mentioned earlier, a slight &#x2013; a slowdown, rather, in light vehicle production rates in Europe in the second half of this year, reflecting the full effect of the expired government incentive programs, those scrappage programs you recall from last year, and also assuming that sales and production rates are in full alignment.</p>
          <p>For CPG, sales were up 6% reported, including FX. Improvements in sales across each of our major brands within CPG and the pass-through impact of higher ethylene glycol pricing, all of which contributed to another good quarter for CPG, including double-digit margin performance.</p>
          <p>So overall, for TS, again, segment profit up 100 million in the quarter, taking their margins to 9.6% due to increased productivity, strong volume recovery in Turbo and of course, the benefits from prior-period restructuring.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at SM on slide 9, Specialty Materials. Specialty Materials experienced a really good first-quarter performance: sales up 8%, segment profit up 36%, taking margins to 14.9%. So it's really a testament to the work Andreas and his team have done to drive both commercial and operational execution.</p>
          <p>As expected, sales at UOP were down 15% due to declining catalyst volumes. The Projects business, while still down in the quarter due to the timing of project launches in both the petrochemical and refining industries, did show sequential improvement. And long-cycle orders are improving in UOP, and we're expecting modest growth from the business in 2010. Catalyst sales, which were down 26% in the quarter, were unfavorably impacted by the timing of a big initial para-catalyst load last year and as always, there will be variability quarter-to-quarter in the catalyst shipments and the mix of licensing revenue in UOP, which of course is difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>The Resins and Chemicals business of Specialty Materials was up 34% in the quarter, benefiting from improved business conditions, demand for nylon in Asia and the favorable impact of higher pass-through raw material pricing. In addition, we're seeing significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in our Electronic Materials businesses which were up 60%, Fluorine Products which was up 20% in the quarter, reflecting improved end-market demand, again, commercial effectiveness and further penetration with new products. And in addition to the significant operational improvement we've seen in these businesses over the last 2 years, we've continued to invest in a number of new environmentally-friendly technologies that we'll begin to commercialize over the next year and a half.</p>
          <p>Segment profit for SM was up 170 million in the quarter. Again, margins up 300 basis points to 14.9%, reflecting higher sales volumes, strong plant performance, continued cost discipline, despite higher raw materials and lower UOP catalyst sales. So it's really impressive &#x2013; really impressive performance for Specialty Materials.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to a preview. Given that summary review of each of the segments, let's go to slide 10 and a preview of the second quarter, the outlook for the second quarter. We're planning, as you can see on the slide, for total sales in the second quarter, as you can see in the take-away at the bottom, to be in the range of 7.8 to 8.1 billion. That's up 3 to 7% from prior year, reflecting good organic growth, in fact, positive organic growth in 3 of the 4 SBGs. I'll cover those highlights above, the SBG highlights, in just a moment.</p>
          <p>We expect EPS to be in the range of 0.53 to $0.57. Excluding pensions, EPS is forecasted to be up 14 to 20% in the second quarter. So clearly we're looking at the continued strong momentum that we were showing in the first quarter continuing into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our first half is shaping up obviously to be strong, due to excellent cost controls, the repositioning benefits, the productivity, both in materials and labor that we're driving, as well as some small favorability from foreign exchange. Of course, that's a little bit of a wild card at this stage, but we feel we've appropriately balanced that in terms of our forecast and our outlook.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue to perform well operationally in the second half. And our EPS linearity is now back in line with pre-downturn historical levels. Think of that 45% first half, roughly 55% second half. However, we think it's important to point out that we're facing tougher second-half comps due mainly to the impacts of labor inflation and foreign exchange, and as you'll recall, the difficult actions that we undertook in the form of reduced work schedules and lower incentive compensation in 2009 that were heavily weighted to the back half of last year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to be cautious on the revenue outlook for the second half of the year. We think it's still too soon to assume the early-cycle upticks from the first quarter will continue at the same pace for the remainder of the year. On the other hand, we are generating obviously very good repositioning and benefit and productivity savings that will continue in the second half.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, just the highlights, with that background in perspective, the highlights then on each of the segments quickly. Aerospace sales we expect to be in the quarter, second quarter, in the range of 2.5 to 2.6 billion, still down on a year-over-year basis, however flat to up slightly on a sequential basis, reflecting modest improvement in the current commercial activity.</p>
          <p>For ACS, we expect sales in the range of 3.2 to 3.3 billion, up approximately 6 to 10% over the prior year, reflecting [audio skip] short-cycle general industrial improvement, new products penetration, the RMG acquisition, continued growth obviously in emerging regions, and of course strength in energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>For transportation systems, we see sales in the range of 900 million to 1 billion, up strong double digits driven by continued growth in vehicle production and new launches in Turbo. Finally, in Specialty Materials, we anticipate sales in the range of 1.1 to 1.2 billion, up 5 to 14%, primarily due to continued improvement in key end markets, the commercialization of new products, the favorable impact of formula-based pricing in resins and chemicals.</p>
          <p>UOP, of course, we expect to continue to be stable, delivering on project commitments and key catalyst loads for the quarter. So in summary, we believe we are set up for another nice quarter in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to slide 11, the 2010 financial guidance summary. On the top of slide 11, you can see that we've summarized the latest guidance and what's changed since February, denoted in the green arrows to the far left, and at the bottom of the slide we've outlined a few of the positive levers on the right and some of the headwinds on the left that define the upper and lower ends of our ranges. So let's walk through some of the specifics.</p>
          <p>Starting with total sales and segment margins for Honeywell, we now see sales in the range of 31.5 billion to 32.3 billion for the year, up slightly from our original guidance. Now, importantly, segment margins we expect to be in the range of 13.6 to 13.9%, compared to our original estimate of 13.3 to 13.8%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the businesses, we reflected the better than anticipated first-quarter performance and expected strong second-quarter performance into the outlook for both ACS and Transportation Systems, both their sales and their segment margins. These are now estimated above the high end of their previously guided ranges.</p>
          <p>At this time, we see no change to the Aerospace guidance. That's consistent with remarks that I made earlier. And it's consistent with what we discussed in February. Specialty Materials is on track as well against our February and our previous December guidance.</p>
          <p>That takes us to our revised EPS range for the year to 2.30 to 2.45 per share on a reported basis, $3.07 to $3.22 per share if you excluded the noncash pension expense, up 4 to 9% over 2009. Now again, what this reflects is a $0.10 increase on the low end of our guidance and a $0.05 increase on the high end, and again, it's really indicative of what we're seeing in our businesses in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>We're also increasing our &#x2013; as Dave said our free cash flow guidance for the year to 2.8 to 3.1 billion, from the previous 2.4 to 2.7. It reflects our higher earnings outlook as well as the positive impact of deferring a portion of the cash funding requirements for the NARCO 524(g) Trust. And approximately now we're assuming a split 50/50 in that funding between 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving to the left side, on the bottom, looking at the some of the indicators and some of the factors that can influence the outcome in terms of the range. Obviously, a slower Aerospace recovery than we've assumed that is muted by airline buying behavior and increases in parked aircraft, could put pressure on the Aero guidance range for the year. Further, the risk of the supplier constraints and European travel disruptions could delay the potential for recovery in Aero.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to monitor, of course, raw material prices and foreign exchange fluctuations in light of rising commodity prices as well as the strengthening dollar. We think we're well covered relative to our major raw material exposures through both firm fixed-price supply agreements as well as formula-based pricing agreements with our customers. Also, our $1.35 euro rate assumption seems at least reasonable at this time.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the right-hand side, larger production and volume increases in the second half, along with further new product launches and emerging region strength will continue to be positive contributors, and of course another lever of course is the additional indirect cost improvement and repositioning savings that could lead to the higher end of our range.</p>
          <p>So with that perspective on the updated and increased guidance, let's now just go to the last slide, just for a few summary points before turning it back over to Elena for Q&amp;A. Clearly, we had a strong start. We've had a strong start to the year, with the first quarter performance ahead of expectations. We saw notable rates of improvement, as we said, in revenue in Transportation Systems, in Specialty Materials and in the ACS short-cycle businesses. There's clear evidence things are getting better. And our sales conversion and our margin performance in the quarter reinforce the significant structural cost take-out that we've made and the strength of the productivity programs and volume leverage that we're capable of delivering.</p>
          <p>We think it also demonstrates that we're well-positioned to capture opportunity in this early cycle recovery, while continuing to win exciting new orders, grow in emerging regions, and build on our backlog for long-term growth. The second quarter and back half are shaping up nicely for good organic growth, with continued short-cycle improvement in a number of our end markets. The businesses are executing well. They're poised to deliver strong operating leverage and margin performance throughout the year. Aerospace is clearly very customer-focused, getting big new wins and growing share, and while recovery timing is still uncertain, we're encouraged by the improving short- and long-cycle order trends in the business.</p>
          <p>ACS has attractive new products. It's clearly leveraging its early-cycle general industrial exposure, as well as the longer-cycle megatrend of energy efficiency, safety and security. Transportation is already seeing a sharp uptick from the end of destocking as well as the benefit of share gains from winning a significant number of new platforms over the last 3 years. They will continue to benefit from favorable macrotrends such as energy efficiency. And lastly, Specialty Materials is producing terrific results and is much better positioned today to protect and grow its bottom line in various economic cycles.</p>
          <p>So the takeaway really is that we are confident in our revised outlook for the year, taking into account all of the &#x2013; both the puts and the takes. As always, we have levers in place to remain flexible, should economic conditions prove more positive or negative.</p>
          <p>And with that, Elena, I'll turn it over to you then for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Hey, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, glad to see the revised outlook and the confidence in the businesses. One thing I'm trying to understand is around the organic growth, though, that you actually achieved this quarter. I think normally I get to see that. Can you just break out for us by business unit the organic versus acquisitive part of the top-line growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. When you look at the organic growth for first quarter, Aero was down &#x2013; Steve, this is on a foreign currency adjusted basis and I don't have the M&amp;A data right in front of me, but they're pretty close, and I'll give you the approximates in terms of what that looks like. Foreign currency adjusted we were down 9% in Aero, down 1.5% in ACS, up 26% in TS, and up 7% in SM. And we had very, very modest M&amp;A impact in the quarter; very modest. We had just really &#x2013; I think it's almost close to zero in terms of any M&amp;A impacts, so think of those as full organic numbers that I'm giving you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. As you look at the M&amp;A pipeline and think about how that plays into your capital allocation strategy, given the environment we've heard also on a number of other calls, how are you thinking about that for the balance of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the M&amp;A pipeline is pretty rich. I think what we're seeing here in terms of the early indications, not only of general economic recovery, but opportunities &#x2013; clear opportunities in the M&amp;A arena, so it's &#x2013; I think it's an exciting time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also, I guess, just add to that, Steve, that, as you know, we're very disciplined in what it is we're willing to pay for things, and following our acquisition process, including integration up to a year later, and we're not going to forget any of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just two more questions on restructuring and CapEx. So the $40 million of restructuring -- that was a bit higher than -- I was thinking you guys were starting to tail off a little bit on that. How are you thinking about that going forward and the timing of the benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the repositioning -- you're right -- the quarter was a little higher than we had originally guided. Obviously, we had stronger than anticipated operating performance in the quarter. We also had favorabilities, I mentioned, of the OPEB curtailment gain, Steve, in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The other thing we saw is &#x2013; we saw another window of opportunity, just to continue to improve our cost base and the upside in terms of volume leverage. Most of what we did in the quarter, which is consistent with our past repositioning actions, are going to result in average paybacks, in the one &#x2013; cash paybacks in the one- to two-year timeframes, very attractive in terms of operating income. There will be a little bit of lift from what we've done in the first quarter in the back half of this year, not significant, but it will benefit us in terms of 2011 and it will become meaningful again in 2012, incrementally. So it's just continuing to &#x2013; it's part of that continuous improvement. I would say the guidance in terms of the full year -- originally we guided to around $50 million of repositioning. We'd say now that's probably 50 to 100.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd add, Steve, is we've always said that to the extent we had unusual or one-time gains, we would deploy them in a way that made the company better in the future. And I'd say any company of our size -- whoever says they're completely done making it better, I think they're kind of missing the mark. So we're always going to see opportunity and we're always going to look for ways to deploy those one-time gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, on CapEx, the 70 million seems lower than I would have expected. Was there anything unusual there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's just really timing related, Steve. Think of it as our guidance really to the full year remains intact.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Scotty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that happened this kind of time in the last cycle is we started to get some FAA mandates, particularly in kind of safety. I think it's been quite some time since we've heard anything out of those guys. And I know you generally tend to make a pretty good margin on those types of mandates. Is there any visibility on what is coming next or is that just &#x2013; was that just kind of once and done in the last cycle and not much here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the visibility of course is always tougher there, and I would never characterize it as that's where we always make good margin, because it depends on the product, how well we've deployed it, how technically advanced it is, so there's a lot of considerations that go into it. Now, there's some stuff that we think should be done and we actively work with them on resolving some of those issues and with the NTSB. It's not always the fastest moving organization, so we'll continue working with them to try to get some of these things deployed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I get it. The last question -- well, I shouldn't say last question, my next question is on UOP visibility. Is there such a thing as keeping track of kind of the potential for pent-up demand on reloads, an average age of catalyst or any type of indicator that you guys keep that gives us an indication of when that business could return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business certainly, Scott, tracks it to a very low level by plant, by customer approach in terms of that opportunity and pursues it from a marketing standpoint, whether they're the incumbent supplier or not. That's something that represents an opportunity going forward. I think we have guided, we think, appropriately conservatively for the first half of this year in terms of UOP catalyst reloads, but there clearly is pent-up, if you will, demand and opportunity. We saw that, as you recall, we saw that phenomena really as we saw the downturn in the global economy in oil prices and in refining margins. So it's there. We are forecasting, we think, appropriately conservatively, but clearly represents opportunity going forward. A little difficult to predict what it will be exactly right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; Scott, because in the U.S. you could expect that it will still continue to delay and it will stay pent up for a little longer. Outside the U.S., emerging regions, I think you're going to see it happen there faster.</p>

          <p>Okay. And last, just a quick follow-up on this C919. You know, nice win with the APU. Does it mean you're still in the running for the avionics, or does China &#x2013; the Chinese government kind of want to split around the business to a wider variety of suppliers?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Dave Cote, you have identified the supply chain as one of the top issues to track and manage for execution. Given what you're seeing, what's going on there? Are you still facing any kind of scarcity issues for, say, any sort of electronic components or other things and how are you managing, given what's obviously sort of an early phase of an economic recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You're right on the electronic components. There has been a scarcity there, and the whole industry is working that one. Beyond that, we're just trying to get ahead in every business, and it's interesting that when you look back at prior recoveries, it's oftentimes the same suppliers who create an issue, so it's not like it's a big surprise. And we're going to start working with &#x2013; we've already started working with those guys to start to sort some of this out, and I think it will probably show up the most in Aerospace, and that's where we've been actually assigning people full-time to just start working on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Were any aspects of your revenue or results this quarter, do you think, held back because of supply chain scarcity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really; not yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about airline destocking? I see the guide with respect to Aerospace. What's your sense of sort of channel destocking in that field? Are we at kind of a bottom and you're waiting for an uptick? I am just curious &#x2013; maybe this is a question for Dave Anderson -- how do you get comfortable with the timing for prospective aftermarket rebound later in the second half? How do you look at the world and sort of frame that timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, John, I think it is accurate to say that the destocking has effectively run its course and we're seeing now sequential stabilization in terms of the actual &#x2013; our actual aftermarket revenues, although it's obviously not in line with the growth in flight hours or utilization, as we talked about. We're looking at modest sequential improvement in the second quarter, so -- and usually on a seasonal basis we would actually see lesser volume in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter, in terms of our air transport aftermarket. I'm speaking strictly now, John, of air transport.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we see and anticipate a closer alignment, not full alignment, but closer alignment in the second half of the year. I mean, obviously, some of the events, the volcanic ash, other issues, are TBD, but frankly I think we're on path for a slight improvement in the second half, but we don't anticipate and our guidance does not assume a full connectivity, linear relationship between utilization and aftermarket demand or aftermarket revenues until the very end of this year. So we remain &#x2013; we continue to remain cautious in terms of that variable and its impact in our outlook. So that's a good question in terms of what we've assumed and what's inherent in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But the timing of the year-end, Dave, is that based on historical lag, when during prior down cycles airlines de-stocked and then there was sort of a two-quarter phenom waiting for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's one of the items, John, is just studying the historical recoveries and looking at those recoveries. Frankly, they can become relatively rapid when they do begin to occur, when you chart the prior experience in this segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't assumed that for this year, but we have assumed what you would say coming out of a downturn and a fairly dramatic restocking, stabilization and then a return to close to, as I said, but not quite, linear relationship between utilization and demand. What it really sets up for us is hopefully some potential upside for this year, and clearly sets up a very attractive, in terms of comparison, 2011.</p>

          <p>And then with cash flow looking stronger, you're still planning to contribute the same amount of equity into the pension this year, or should we expect maybe cash instead?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Still planning to do the equity, Jeff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And so I guess that's kind of a capital allocation question. I guess another capital allocation question could be, the only reason I could think to put Friction in with Turbo is CPG's days are numbered. Give me an alternative reason that Friction would be reported with Turbo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And a relevant customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, relevant customer base.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they move together. And rather than breaking it out, it's just easier for us from a reporting standpoint. We &#x2013; and we think the relevance is really lost in the process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll buy that for now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what happened to you? You go to start your own company and, wow, look at you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm going to ask you offline where this country China is, by the way.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why does it sound funny when you say it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, Specialty Material margins -- very impressive, given UOP was down in the quarter. Was there some kind of sweet nonrecurring price/cost dynamic there or something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. It's really what I said. Dave, you can add to this. I mean, it's really what Andreas and the team are doing to drive both &#x2013; I call it commercial and operational execution, but it's really commercial excellence, the sales and marketing, the new product introductions, et cetera, combined with plant attainment, just performance, basic operational performance and execution. So it just shows you what we've done in terms of the cost base of the business, but also the strength of their market positions and the strength of the technologies; we're leveraging that. So we continue to look at Specialty Materials as a strong performer through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd add on that, Jeff, is I'd say across all our businesses, we talked about this at our February Analyst Day. But looking at OEF, this organizational effectiveness more closely and I'd say comprehensively than we have in the past and that I think any other company does, has really helped a lot in terms of understanding and controlling fixed costs, so that you can really leverage sales increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question on the spec materials margins. UOP down and resin's up; both of those are negative margin swings, yet I think you're still guiding for 14.5 for the full year. So why &#x2013; once these wash through, why wouldn't the margin go higher than 14.9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're happy with it going higher. On margin swings or margin rates on businesses, variable margin in any chemical business is pretty high. To the extent you can leverage volume, it's usually a nice result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then just looking at the 2Q, just wanted to understand again the margin for 2Q. If we add back the $0.05 Medicare tax, $0.55 for first quarter, basically flat with your midpoint guidance, yet revenues are going higher. So I understand that TS is down but revenues for the other three businesses are going higher, so is there anything in the margin we need to think about for 2Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing that really stands out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then finally, I notice you picked up the CP by about $1 billion this quarter. I know you had a debt repayment as well. But is that a shift in your debt financing strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>

          <p>Do you plan to term out the CP at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's possible. There's no near-term plans to do it. It's possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just another final quick one. The process solutions order growth of 19% -- is that all organic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, Dave, Dave, and Elena. Congratulations on a good start to the year. And you touched upon a lot of the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Peter; what was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm sure you want to hear that again. On Aero, I guess on Aerospace -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have no idea how much I look forward to this feedback every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. For OEM side, we're expecting obviously slower deliveries this year and I guess it's never too early to already start talking about 2011, but we're seeing increasing wide-body production and looks like narrow-body, particularly at Boeing, is going to really increase double digits here, probably starting in the second half of 2011. How do we think about that for you guys in terms of lead times, and what do we expect to see on that initial demand for OEM turn? It seems like Aerospace is really going to be set up for a healthy recovery in both aftermarket and beginning to see that OEM as we get into the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would agree with you. There will be a good recovery in aerospace. More likely to be the -the more rapid, immediate effect will be whenever aftermarket really starts to take off, and for the same reasons that it has in the past, is inventory levels get driven so low that just demand catching up to actual usage levels represents a big increase and then you have flight hours on top of that and at some point some inventory restocking. Tough to know exactly when that takes off, just because of the &#x2013; nobody really knows exactly how much inventory is out there and as parked aircraft go up, how much can they really cannibalize. Now when it happens, though, it will happen quite smartly.</p>
          <p>On the OEM side, I'm a believer on all of this stuff that you tend to come out the way you went in and I'd expect it to be a slower, but steady, increase over time. And I wouldn't predict on any of the air framers, but I agree with you that that is going to happen, because air travel just continues to increase and we think is going to continue to increase as a macrotrend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And then just quickly on ACS, any changes in the legislation backdrop? Are you seeing any momentum there on further pushing the kind of the initial adoption of your energy efficiency products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're likely to see an energy bill get introduced sometime over the next week or two, and what we've been advocating and we're hopeful that this will be reflected is it has to be a focus on both clean generation and on energy efficiency. Having a smart energy policy for the country is going to involve both, and we're hopeful that that's what will get reflected in whatever legislation's promulgated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Dave, you had great operating leverage in autos or in transportation, on the order of 40%. I know it's down a little bit from the prior quarter, but is this sort of what you expect out of the organization for &#x2013; going forward on incremental sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say I look to Alex for 1,000 basis points improvement in margins every quarter, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From your lips to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll continue to see good leverage there. They did a nice job reducing fixed costs during the downturn and they've done a nice job of maintaining a good industrial base and a capability to respond. So to the extent that the industry does grow and that this isn't just a first half phenomenon, which we're unclear on right now, they'll be able to leverage pretty well, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two more questions. One is, as you go and talk to customers, what sort of anecdotal evidence might you be able to give us or a couple of takeaways that have really struck you in the last several months versus what you saw maybe three to six months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it depends on which areas of the world that you're going to. If you're in developed markets, I'd say in the U.S. it feels like most people are more bullish than they were six months ago. In Europe, the kind of business depression, I think, kind of continues in terms of how people think about how they're coming out of it. And in the emerging regions, it never really declined. They were always pretty bullish, still had big plans when I think through the refinery discussions, the airline discussions, everybody was always pretty bullish there. That really hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you're finding just opportunities to sell more things in places that &#x2013; I mean, that optimism has translated into your business plan or you think there's still a little bit more that can translate into the business plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure I quite follow, but I would say that there's business plan opportunities for us everywhere, but it's particularly encouraging in emerging regions, because they're just bringing the right attitude, the right momentum, the right interest. It's actually quite encouraging going to those places.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just following and then concluding, on late-cycle products, I mean, whether it's a little bit of process or in other markets, are there examples of where you really started to see a stabilization or there's still declines that you're fighting through, commercial construction being I guess the biggest example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, clearly some of the &#x2013; commercial construction would continue to be &#x2013; some of the non-residential, some pockets of that continue to be a challenge. But if you look at the order rates and the book-to-bill, they're all positive. They're all up.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll now take our final question from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was close. Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wondering if you have an estimate of what your capacity utilization was in the quarter or running currently versus the second half last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really track that all that much. I'd say in our Chemicals and Specialty Materials businesses, we've been running closer to capacity there, but really don't &#x2013; it's not a stat that we really track across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then do you see any potential for the Eyjafjallajokull eruption to have a big impact on demand, whether it's because of airline finances or the lower utilization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one of those things that we did have some trepidation about as we were watching it, but as you probably saw, the press reports from yesterday were actually saying that traffic was booming as a result. I think this is one we're going to have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other thing I would add there, Dave, is to the degree that the airlines, European airlines predominantly, used this opportunity to perform some of the deferred maintenance, planes are grounded anyway, so that represented an opportunity. I think some that sort of has to &#x2013; I hate to use the phrase wash out, but some of that has to play out for us to really understand the full impact, Chris. It's still a little early.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. All right, I'm going to turn it over to Dave. Do you have any final comments for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Elena. Well, we're off to a great start, as you could see. We performed in the last recovery. We've performed in the recession, and we're going to perform well in this recovery also, consistent with what we were saying in February. And it's all for the same reason: it's a constant, relentless focus on making progress on our strategy every day, every quarter, every year. Our strategy for growth and our strategy for productivity both get included in this and we are truly just relentless about making sure we're making progress every day. And unlike the last recession, we kept investing this time: new products, new services, new geographies, our enablers. I mean, the investment just kept flowing. So we're a better company. We're building off a better base and I think you're going to see us shine in this recovery. Thanks.</p>
