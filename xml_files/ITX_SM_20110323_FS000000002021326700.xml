          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Inditex Results Conference Call for the Fiscal Year 2010. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex' Deputy Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex Results for Fiscal 2010. I am Pablo Isla and here with me are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results, for fiscal 2010, show that Inditex continues its ongoing multi-concept growth and the global reach of our business model. 2010 has seen significant growth in sales and a strong operating performance. It has also been marked by the satisfactory evolution of gross margins, increased efficiency and tight operating control. As a result, the group has improved its financial returns.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow keeps growing steadily and our financial condition is stronger. Due to these facts and the significant opportunities to invest profitably, funds from operations have been devoted mainly to the expansion of our business. This growth has taken place through the addition of prime commercial space to our retail base in markets with high potential.</p>
          <p>Our financial condition allows us to propose a very significant increase in shareholder remuneration for fiscal 2010. We start 2011 with a unique platform that can access global growth opportunities. We will finish 2011 with operations in five continents, through eight formats, and a multi-channel presence in most markets.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight some key points of these results. In 2010, sales grew satisfactorily by 13% to &#x20AC;12.5 billion. Sales in local currencies increased 10%. We have achieved comparable sales growth of 3% in the period. Due to the strong sales growth and higher operating efficiency, Inditex' EBITDA increased 25% to &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Net income in 2010 grew 32%, to &#x20AC;1.7 billion or &#x20AC;2.78 per share. Return on capital employed reached 39%. As a result of our performance in 2010, Inditex' Board of Directors is proposing a 33% increase in the dividend to be paid in relation to these results.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our results for fiscal 2010 continued to show a strong growth in all the key lines of the profit and loss account. The ongoing expansion of our group has led to a widely diversified sales platform. I would like to remark that we have opened stores in 45 countries over 2010.</p>
          <p>Sales performance of 2010 has been satisfactory, with 13% growth. Like-for-like sales have increased 3%.</p>
          <p>Inditex' commercial space has grown 10% in 2010, to 2.6 million square meters. We have added more than 239,000 square meters to our retail park over the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the gross margin, we can say that we're pleased with the evolution over the year. Inditex' gross profit has increased 17% to &#x20AC;7.4 billion in 2010. The gross margin has reached 59.3% on sales, 216 basis points higher than in 2009, as a result of our flexible business model and sustained commercials policies.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 12.6% in 2010, mainly due to the addition of new retail space and include all the start-up cost for new stores and the launch of Zara e-commerce.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Ordinance of the working capital continue to show tight control, reflecting the flexibility of the business model.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the strong cash flow generation in 2010. Funds from operation have increased 23% over the year, to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Capital expenditure to ensure future expansions was &#x20AC;754 million.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will cover some details of the performance of the concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately two-thirds of Inditex sales, and the younger concepts, one-third. Let me add that all the concepts have significantly increased their sales platform and deepened their global penetration.</p>
          <p>2010 has been a year of a strong activity for Inditex. The group has opened 437 net stores across its 8 concepts. Proving the capacity of our business model to reach global opportunities, Inditex has opened stores in 45 different countries over 2010, to reach 5,044 stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>Zara sales in 2010 have grown satisfactorily at 14%. EBIT has grown 39%. Regarding the younger concepts, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home have performed strongly. In the case of Bershka, the change versus last year relates mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to elaborate on a number of strategic issues for Inditex. Regarding the outlook for our group, let me tell you that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities. We have a greatly diversified sales platform with stores in 77 countries.</p>
          <p>We operate a highly flexible business model, and the concepts offer a strong fashion proposition with attractive pricing. Our business model avoids the main fixed costs involved in expansion, allowing us to take advantage of growth opportunities wherever they are present.</p>
          <p>We have invested significantly over recent years in our infrastructure, and we now have in place the capacity needed to support future growth. We are currently building a global business platform that will soon be in 80 countries, in five continents, through eight formats and a multi-channel presence in most markets. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Our priority remains to focus our growth in Europe and Asia. Regarding Europe, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. We plan a balanced expansion between both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats. We see great potential to expand profitably in Europe for many years.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our priority is to leverage on the strong presence we have built over recent years. Asia accounts today for 15% of Inditex' sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition, focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are in transformation.</p>
          <p>We currently enjoy a very strong position in the region. And we have built a relevant presence in most Asian capitals. We are following a multi-concept expansion strategy in Asia, combining openings of Zara with openings for a number of our formats in the majority of markets. We see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asian markets.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight briefly our experience in China in a very special way. By 2006, Inditex had built a relevant presence in all the key capitals, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Macau. By 2007, we have started to build our presence in Tier 2 cities with more than 5 million inhabitants. By 2009, we had consolidated our presence in Tier 3 cities with more than 2.5 million inhabitants.</p>
          <p>2010 has been a year of a strong expansion in China. First, we decided to reach a full multi-concept presence in the country with the launch of all formats. Secondly, we started to enter Tier 4 cities with more than 1.5 million inhabitants. As a result, we finished 2010 with 143 stores in 30 cities in China. 2011 will see an acceleration of our growth in China. We plan to open around 120 stores over the year, and all Inditex concepts will be expanding in the different regions. By year-end 2011, we will be present in 42 cities.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we launched Zara in India in 2010, and we are starting to build our presence over 2011 with additional openings in Mumbai and Delhi and entering new cities, such as Bangalore and Pune. We see India as a relevant source of growth for Inditex in the medium-term. Our plans for the Americas are to build on the existing presence through a selective expansion process, with Brazil representing an attractive growth market for us.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remind you that we plan to launch Zara in Australia and South Africa over 2011, confirming the global reach of our business model. We will open in Australia in April, starting with Sydney and Melbourne, to be followed by additional openings in several cities. We are aware that expectations for the arrival of Zara to Australia are very high. We will also launch Zara in South Africa in the autumn/winter 2011.</p>
          <p>Inditex e-commerce operations have seen very significant activity recently.</p>
          <p>Zara has been an online sales presence in 16 European countries in just six months. On the 2nd of September, we have launched Zara online in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the U.K. On the 4th of November, we added Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg. On the 3rd of March, we added Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Monaco. Zara offers a strong commercial proposition in e-commerce and is also available in mobile commerce. Customer reception has been very satisfactory.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight our plans to launch Zara online sales in the autumn/winter period 2011 in the most relevant e-commerce markets in the world, the United States and Japan. Our teams have been working to ensure a successful launch and we feel encouraged by the opportunity to expand Zara online sales. We plan a progressive rollout of e-commerce operations in all markets in which Zara is present. Following the successful launch of Zara and Zara Home, all Inditex concepts will be present in e-commerce in 2011.</p>
          <p>We will launch Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Pull&amp;Bear, Stradivarius, Oysho, and Uterq&#xFC;e online sales in selected European markets over the second half of 2011. 2011 will be a year of a strong activity for Inditex. Our expansion plans include a range of 460 to 500 new stores globally. Capital expenditure for 2011 will be around &#x20AC;800 million. Additionally, there will be a &#x20AC;230 million extraordinary investment in the acquisition of unique retail premises at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York for a Zara global flagship.</p>
          <p>Regarding shareholder remuneration, the board of directors will propose to the general shareholders meeting, a 33% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2010 to &#x20AC;1.60 per share. An interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.80 per share will be payable on the 2nd of May and a final dividend of &#x20AC;0.80 per share, including the bonus, will be payable on the 2nd of November. The total dividend payment amounts to &#x20AC;997 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me tell you that the store sales in local currencies have increased 10% from the 1st of February to the 14th of March 2011. As you all know, the spring/summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period, due to its significant sales volumes.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />
          </p>
          <p>Thank you. The first question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Two questions, if I may, both on the fourth quarter, first one was on the gross margin. Can you give us some sense of the major drivers of that fourth quarter gross margin move, maybe split between bought-in gross margin and markdown? And the second one was just on e-commerce. Can you give us some sense of what proportion of group sales was e-commerce in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Well, regarding the gross margin, as you know we like to analyze the gross margin on a full season basis. We prefer not to analyze the gross margin on a quarterly basis. And regarding the gross margin in the second half of the year, we're satisfied with the evolution of the gross margin. And as we always say, it's a combination of many different factors. It has to do with the markups, with the markdowns, with the <mark type="ph" /> build management, the fashion trends, the mix, currencies. It has to do with many, many different factors. What we can say is that we are quite satisfied about the evolution of the gross margin in the autumn/winter season, where you can see also some gain in the gross margin compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>And regarding e-commerce, this season, it has just been the first season in very few countries beginning in some countries in September, in other countries when the season was more aberrant. So we prefer not to talk about any particular figure. What we can say is that we are quite happy about the evolution of our online sales.</p>
          <p>As you see in 2011, we have very ambitious plans. We have plans to enter into two very, very relevant markets, such as the U.S. and Japan, with Zara. And we have also plans to launch all our other formats in the most relevant European countries. So what I would say is that this last &#x2013; these few months of 2010 and the year 2011, we are quite focused on the launching of our online sales platform in many different countries, and we are quite focused around customer service, execution, everything involved with the online launch. So &#x2013; but in any case, in this very first season, only a few months, we prefer not to elaborate more about the level of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final one on e-commerce, is there &#x2013; what sort of launch costs it would be anticipating in the year ahead, given your plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will not be relevant. You have seen that in the year 2010, which was the real launch of our Zara online sales, we were talking about &#x20AC;12 million. So you should not expect anything above that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everybody. Andrew Hughes from UBS, here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I mean in past years, you very often said that the gross margin outlook is broadly flat. I mean is that something that you would be prepared to repeat for this year or should we be, you know, expecting more pressure than usual in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the gross margin for the year 2011, yeah, we could elaborate a little bit about the gross margin. As I was saying just before, when we're talking about the gross margin for the autumn/winter season, first of all, I would say that the gross margin is a combination of many different factors, as I was saying just before, fashion trends, product mix, markups, markdowns, product management, currencies.</p>
          <p>And then regarding 2011, well as we were saying in December, there is some cost inflation in some countries or regarding some raw materials. You know that our business model is mainly dependent on sourcing in Europe by neighboring countries. So, we have a lot of flexibility to offset any of these factors, so that we operate in the high fashion market at affordable prices.</p>
          <p>So, we think we have quite significant protection against these trends. And then, if we think today, at this stage just at the beginning of the year, I'm taking into consideration all the different factors, what I would say is that our best estimate for 2011 is that we will be able to lock in a minimum of 50% of the gross margin gains achieved in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that's &#x2013; going back to your comment on pricing, that is assuming some adjustment to your prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is assuming a stable prices in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. So half of your gains last year <mark type="ph" /> will divert back to sort of the broad guidance for the current year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A minimum of 50%, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a minimum of 50% will be locked in, or a minimum -</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, guys. Two questions, actually. Firstly on the CapEx for the year just gone, at the half-year stage, you were saying &#x20AC;570 million, and you reported &#x20AC;754 million. I was just wondering what the quite significant deviation in that was?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I appreciate your comments on Bershka and that the comps were tough, but it is the only brand where margins fell year-on-year. I was just wondering if there are specific issues around the segment they're in, or geographically, or any sort of start-up losses that may have affected the results of Bershka?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I will begin answering your question regarding Bershka. No, nothing. There isn't any specific issue regarding Bershka. If you look to the return on capital employed of Bershka, it's about 50%. So it's &#x2013; yes, it had that very high comparable based on performance over the pervious years. And then this year, it's relatively lower. But Bershka is one of our &#x2013; well, and you see the openings that we are planning for Bershka, it's quite a significant number of openings in different markets within Bershka. It's quite a strong brand and we are &#x2013; we have no doubts about Bershka's potential and evolution in the coming years. Perhaps, Marcos, you can explain a little bit more about the CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the CapEx side, what we can see &#x2013; what we can say is that the space addition in 2010 was approximately 50% higher than it was in 2009 at the end of the year. And this is why CapEx is around 50% higher as well. If you look at CapEx per square meter dedicated to new stores &#x2013; to new stores openings, it's remained broadly flat in 2010. And this is very much we expect for 2011 as well. So it's mainly link &#x2013; the link to the higher <mark type="ph" /> specialist over the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. I was just wondering what a change between the guidance you gave at H2 and the full year, though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think that's very clear, we've opened 437 stores, which is clearly above the initial range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Fred Bjelland from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering, in terms of the input cost inflation that you're seeing, I was just wondering if &#x2013; have you guys &#x2013; do you hold any raw materials in your inventory? And do you buy any cotton or other raw materials forward? And if so, how far in advance do you buy it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. What I can tell you is, well, first of all, anything related with the gross margin, what I always like to say, that the gross margin is a combination of many, many different factors. So, we prefer not to isolate any particular factors. But in terms of raw materials, no, no, we are not hedging any raw materials.</p>
          <p>You know that according to our business model, and having in mind the flexibility that we like to have in the way we operate our business model, sourcing in proximity in which we work with fabrics and then we have a long-term relationship with external suppliers for the sewing of the garments. But it's something that is very much in-line with what we always do with our business model, the way we manage our business, the idea to have this flexibility, sourcing in proximity. So answering a &#x2013; specifically your question, if I have understood it well, we are not hedging anything related with raw materials.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably, in your factories in Spain and elsewhere, where you're doing the cutting, et cetera, there will be textile or there will be raw materials in those factories. So, I was just trying to get an understanding of how far in advance or at what point you've been buying those materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no but not very much in advance, and nothing has changed compared to the way we manage typically our operations. No, not really in advance, I mean, during the season &#x2013; with some of course amounts just before the beginning of the season, but it's something &#x2013; so we are not having a biggest bulk of raw materials no, no. And nothing has changed from that point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about markdown during the course of the year, how that changed? And also, what happened to average selling prices? I mean if it's easier to talk about one brand in particular, maybe we can talk about Zara, what happened to ASPs during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, very similar, I mean nothing special. These &#x2013; we think about the whole year, I think we have had a successful year in terms of sales growth and like-for-like sales growth in the different markets. So the &#x2013; from a point of view of markdowns, it has been a normal season in which you have positive like-for-like sales figures. And then regarding average selling price, not big differences, and so like-for-like growth has a lot to do with volume growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great and just the final question from me is, can you give us some indication of your expansion plans in China beyond 2011? I mean you seem to be adding nearly 100% new stores every year. And I was just wondering how long you think you can keep doing that for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we think expansion in China will be very relevant during many years, because there &#x2013; well first of all, as we were saying during the presentation at the end of the year, we will be present in 42 cities, so the opportunities to continue growing are huge. And also having in mind that this year, 2011, we will be present with all our brands, because today we are present with Zara, with Massimo Dutti, with Bershka, with Pull&amp;Bear and with Stradivarius and we are also launching Zara Home, Oysho and Uterq&#xFC;e in the year 2011 in China.</p>
          <p>So we will be present with all our brands in 42 different cities, so &#x2013; and you can see all the developments that are taking place there, shopping mall developments. We are also finding a good High Street locations in the different cities. So we see significant growth potential during many, many years in China. To quantify, if every year we are going to multiply by &#x2013; I prefer not to enter into this type of estimations, but you can assume a very significant number of openings, say in the coming years in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one on Spain, please. I wondered if you could comment, Pablo, on your &#x2013; on the sort of relative performance of Inditex in Spain over the last year, in particular the Zara brand. It looks like you're now performing much more in-line with the market, maybe even a little bit worse. So I just wondered if you could give a comment on that, please, performance in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About our performance in Spain, what I would say is that our sales in Spain have been stable during the year 2010, as was the case during the year 2009. It &#x2013; and what I would say, is that about our performance in Spain, we feel quite comfortable. I mean, consumption has decreased in a significant way in the last two or three years, and we have been able to maintain our level of sales as stable during this period. And in Spain, of course, like-for-like and total sales are the same. There is no difference because we really don't have openings this year. We have some, <mark type="ph" /> Raffio, Oysho, Zara Homes, but not really openings we have in Spain.</p>
          <p>So like-for-like and total sales is something similar and we feel quite comfortable. As we have explained before, Spain is a market that we know quite well. We operate in Spain since many years ago. We think it's a clear advantage for us to be present with-- so all these different brands, with our eight formats. And globally I would say that we are happy with our stable performance in the Spanish market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just on the &#x2013; I see you've taken an accelerated depreciation charge relating to Uterq&#xFC;e, the accessories format. I wonder &#x2013; what's the reason for that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason is that the, you know that Uterq&#xFC;e was launched in July 2008 and has seen a very strong expansion period. We have now 80 stores in 16 countries. So applying very conservative accounting criteria, we have prefer to go for the accelerated depreciation of some of these assets. But if you exclude this charge, Uterq&#xFC;e is in breakeven. And we're fully convinced of its capacity to grow and this is what we will keep on doing this year. So it's very much following a very conservative accounting approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Marcos. And just finally on &#x2013; just going back to the Bershka format, I just wondered if there are any sort of special factors impacting the profits during the year. You mentioned that it was a tough comparable. But I wondered if there are any special factors or higher markdown than you expected in &#x2013; that impacted the profits of Bershka.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of Bershka, return is very much as we have mentioned &#x2013; the fact that last year, EBIT grew by 27%. Remember that even this year, Bershka return on capital employed is 52%. So, it's very much the comparable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there wasn't any impact from sort of store openings, or anything like that to mention &#x2013; or new space expansion, or anything?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. My questions focus pretty much on China. And firstly, can you confirm what the price difference or price level of China is versus Euroland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding our prices on &#x2013; in China, well first of all, I would say that our pricing policy in the different markets &#x2013; what we have in mind is, as we have explained before, what we have in mind are many different elements. When we &#x2013; regarding the decision about what prices &#x2013; what pricing policy do we follow in any given market, first of all, of course we have in mind the competitive landscape. But then we have in mind all the costs involved in the process, if we have need to pay customs or not, transportation costs, or we have in mind all the different elements.</p>
          <p>And then regarding our prices in China, what we can say is that they are slightly above our prices in Continental Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for your experience where you are today, are sales densities pretty much in-line with the European level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't see any big difference in the case of Chinese stores. We are not seeing any big difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we shouldn't expect any sort of dilution from the increased expansion out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no nothing, nothing relevant from that point of view, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, has there been any sort of new thoughts vis-&#xE0;-vis the <mark type="ph" /> great structure, given the expansion and the increase in proportion of the business out in Asia, whether &#x2013; you know, you have sort of local hubs in Asia rather than sort of things sort of essentially based through Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, here my answer would be the same as I always say, we are not planning anything specific, right now. And &#x2013; I mean we're not expecting &#x2013; regarding our logistics investment, we're not expecting any big investment in the next two or three years. And then the possibility of having some third party logistics capacity in Asia is something, which is always there, we are permanently analyzing. But currently, we think it's better to maintain our logistics in a centralized way.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a bit about the extraordinary EBIT margin performance of Zara in the year? I think it's the best EBIT margin you've reported since becoming a public company. So how much of that is your outperformance relative to the group in gross margin? Is there a significant regional impact on that trend? And do you think it's sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, what I would say is that whatever metric you follow, what you see in these results is the best we have ever had in our history, because the global EBIT margin is 18.3% of sales. So, whatever metric you follow, it's the highest in the history of the company. This is something applicable to all the other &#x2013; to all the other brands.</p>
          <p>And then, well regarding Zara, you can see that this year, the evolution in terms of EBIT growth is above the average of the group. It has had to do with the evolution of sales, with the evolution of gross margins for Zara. But globally, when we compare Zara with all the other brands together, we don't see a so big difference. And we think that there is no reason why we should see a big difference between Zara and all the other brands together regarding the EBIT margin, or regarding whatever metric. But yes, it has been a quite a successful year for Zara.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you think 19% is a sustainable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has to do with many different factors. We were talking before about the gross margin. I mean, it's &#x2013; we were talking before about the gross margin, we were saying that, having in mind all the elements for 2011 at this stage of the year, our best estimate is that we will be able to lock in a minimum of 50% of the gross margin gain that we have achieved in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>It will have a lot to do with the evolution of like-for-like sales figures. Of course, we will continue managing carefully our costs. Also, during the year 2010, we have managed properly our cost. Like-for-like cost growth has been below 1%. So, it's a combination of the global management of the company, beginning with the level of sales, the gross margin, costs. We always try to have the best possible margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So &#x2013; and just on that gross margin, just to be completely clear, you're saying that the worst you would expect the group gross margin to be in the current year would be down 110 basis points, that's the worst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's our estimation at this stage of the year. That would be the worst that we expect at this stage of the year, yes.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the inventory levels that you had at the end of the year. I know it's just a snapshot in time, but it looked like it was up about 22% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The inventory position is just <mark type="ph" /> not opportunistic, does not properly reflect the commitment at any given point in time. The growth rate of fiscal year 2010 is influenced by the 6% decline in inventory of fiscal year 2009. Our commitment is that <mark type="ph" /> the manage remains broadly the same as last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I didn't look at a &#x2013; excuse me, at a single snapshot in time, but rather over a month period, it would be more or less in line with what your sales growth and <mark type="ph" /> corporate growth had been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Karen. I didn't understand your question. Can you repeat it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sure. I mean, because obviously the single snapshot in time, it was up 22%. If I looked at it over a, let's say, month period or so, it would be up more like 10%, in line with your sales growth in constant currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I think at the last quarterly results, you talked about how you expected the gross margin for the second half of the year to be flat. It seems that that's obviously reversed quite a bit, and you saw quite a bit of positive gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could comment at all, what was different than what you were expecting back in December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the result, the gross margin increased 71 basis points over the second half. You know, a definition of flat is around 50 basis points higher or lower, so there is not a very big difference. As Pablo mentioned before, it's very much the way we've managed the supply chain and the product over the whole of the second half, and this is the result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there wasn't any one-time benefit like you saw in the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. It was the normal management of the company. Obviously, flat for us is 50 basis points higher or lower. 71 basis points shouldn't surprise you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, on your pricing policy online, am I right that the pricing policy is the same as on a country-by-country basis? So, your online business in Spain would be about 90% of what &#x2013; would be indexed at 90% of the price of what it would be in the euro area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's it. It's the same prices as we have in our stores, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And haven't seen any issues with that since the launch internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. No, because we followed the same approach as we follow in our stores. So, makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my last question, can you say what the sales growth in constant currency in the fourth quarter was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We prefer to look on the year, and this is why it's true that there was some positive effect. But we prefer to talk about it for the full year, which was three percentage point <mark type="ph" /> Operator: Question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just, in view of the big acquisition of freehold property in New York, can you just talk a bit about your strategy in the U.S? Obviously, you've taken on some other significant flagship properties as well during the year, in Chicago and other areas. So, can you just talk about the &#x2013; your ambitions for the U.S. and how this is going to pan out, in terms of store growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first of all, what I would say is that the acquisition in New York is more than a U.S. flagship. It's a global flagship. This is the first thing I would like to say. There are three or four streets in the world and, of course, New York Fifth Avenue is not only one of them, but number one of them. There are three, four streets in the world.</p>
          <p>You can think about Oxford Street, you can think about Champs-&#xC9;lys&#xE9;es, you can think about the Fifth Avenue, you can think about something in Hong Kong, in harbor area or in central area. But there are four or five streets in the world, and probably Fifth Avenue is number one between those. So what I would say is that this acquisition is much more a global flagship than a &#x2013; it's not only a U.S. flagship. Of course it is a U.S. flagship, but it is also, and it is even more relevant, a global flagship.</p>
          <p>And then, regarding our strategy in the U.S., we're not planning any big change regarding our strategy in the U.S. in the near future. We will continue seeing some openings every year, but at this stage, we're not planning a big expansion in the U.S. What I think is very relevant this year is that we're launching our online platform in the U.S. And we have significant expectations and ambitions about our online sales in the U.S. market. But regarding store openings, we are not planning a big change in our strategy.</p>

          <p>Okay. Can you just talk about the logistics of the &#x2013; of e-commerce with the smaller brands? Will they all be, like Zara, be run out of the &#x2013; each brand's individual DC, wherever they are located?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most probably. Well, it's something they were talking about details, because another possibility is all of them to be together, where we have &#x2013; you know that we have Bershka, Stradivarius, Massimo Dutti, and Oysho based in Barcelona. So, we are also considering the possibility of having all of them together in one of the platforms that we have there around Barcelona, that we are already operating. But it will not be relevant from the point of view of costs or investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, just to go back to your comments on gross margins for the current year. I assume that cost pressure goes up as we go through the year. And first half of the year, you have tougher comps in terms of quite low levels of markdown and quite buoyant buying conditions. So can you just talk us through whether you think there will be any noticeable phasing of that guidance as we go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what you mention, <mark type="ph" /> Simon, is a relevant factor, but we prefer to stick to what we said in the sense that &#x2013; that as of today, our best estimate is that we will able to lock in a minimum of 50% of the gross margin gains achieved in 2010. What is also true is that the comparable in the first half, in terms of the gross margin, is higher than in the second half. But to elaborate on the different factors at this point in time, I think, is not &#x2013; is not something we are going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And can I just ask one final question, you &#x2013; the &#x2013; obviously, the dividend is up 32%, but the payout ratio is flat and the &#x2013; obviously, the cash pile is continuing to go up. Can you see that strategy changing at any time in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is, first of all, that we're increasing the dividend 33%, which is not a minor increase from the point of view of dividend policy. And regarding the use of &#x2013; what the company, we are generating a significant cash flows and our &#x2013; as we always say, the first priority is to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company. And then combining these, of course, we want to have flexibility in our balance sheet, but at the same time, we want to have an attractive and predictable shareholders' remuneration policy.</p>
          <p>The payout ratio is 58% this year, with a 33% increase in the dividend. We think that this policy is combining these two elements. First element, in &#x2013; based in the long-term profitable growth in the company and maintaining flexibility regarding our balance sheet, and second element having a predictable and attractive shareholders' remuneration policy. We are distributing &#x20AC;1 billion in dividends, so we think that it's a relevant amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Fraser Ramzan from Nomura. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple of questions; first of all, on space growth, it was great to see the 10% square meters increase in the last year. Is that a similar amount, in terms of square meters you're planning for the current year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, if the current year finishes in the upper part of the range, yes, we would be around 10% space growth, yes. But we can say that we are seeing many opportunities in the different markets with the different brands. You can see that we are planning to increase significant &#x2013; to have a significant number of openings with all the different brands in the different geographies. And, yes, the upper part of the range would be equivalent to 10% space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And within that guidance, do you have &#x2013; I mean, normally, you highlight some major flagships at this point in the year. I guess Fifth Avenue is a very major flagship, but are there others that you have in mind at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but typically we do not highlight flagships in the full year result presentation. We typically do in the first quarter results presentation. So we prefer to wait until then, but as any year, there will be flagships, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the New York flagship, what was the rationale behind that purchase? Was it purely opportunistic? Or should we expect to see more &#x2013; more of those kind of real estate investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well of course our general policy does not change. We &#x2013; our store openings are &#x2013; I mean, we prefer to lease, of course, the sites. That is the general rule. This was a very unique opportunity, in a very unique location, so something very exceptional. And we should consider it as something very exceptional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a final question on operating expenses for the year ahead. Any change to the view that they would, you know &#x2013; should broadly grow in line with space contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no change, broadly in line with the space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With space growth or space contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the space growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay the final telephone question comes from Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Anne Critchlow from SG. I've got a question about the productivity of new space. It looks as if it's come down a bit to 70% this year. So you had a 10% average space expansion, physical space, a 7% contribution from new space. I think in the past you've guided 75% to 85%; wondered if you could explain why it's come down and also what we should expect in the future. Are you going into the type of store locations which might mean lower space productivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anne, productivity has not changed because, in <mark type="ph" /> monitoring productivity, you should look at it over a two to three year period. Obviously, over a quarter is not something which is very material. And we -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm looking at it over an annual &#x2013; over the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> will remain at 75% to 85%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason why you see productivity &#x2013; a lower ratio of productivity, if you look at the quarter, is the fact that store openings, very special in the second half, have increased very strongly, as we mentioned early in the answers to some of your colleagues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not looking at it over a quarter. It was 70% for the year on my calculation, compared to 80% last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, is better to take two to three years. If you do that, you will see that the productivity ratios remain the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just one further question on current trading from the 1st of February. It looks as if it has picked up a bit compared to Q4. I just wondered if there were any positive impacts there, from either calendar or weather, that you could mention?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, we prefer to provide a number, so you can estimate where we are trading at this point in time. It's 10% growth in local currencies from the 1st of February to the 14th of March. And I think this proves how <mark type="ph" /> we're starting decision, but I would not read anything before the Easter period.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. We're now going to go through the questions that have come in through the webcast platform. Some of them are related topics that have been answered already, such as expansion, gross margin and online. And we have a question from <mark type="ph" /> David Russell of Fogson Associates asking what are the key challenges in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say is that to continue operating our business. I mean, as we were saying during the presentation, we are present &#x2013; we will be present during 2011 in 80 countries and to continue managing properly our business. It's very difficult for me to isolate one, two or three as key challenges. We think we have our platform. We have growth in the different markets. Our brands are strong, so to continue operating our business in a positive way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question regarding Asia. First, what percentages of sales do you expect from Asia in the coming years? And also, how many of the stores that you operate in China are currently in the like-for-like calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the number of stores, which are in the like-for-like calculation of the year 2010, I think it's slightly below 70 stores, or 60-something stores that are in the like-for-like calculation for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>And in terms of what could be the weight of Asia, well, if you remember in the last year &#x2013; in the 2009 full year results presentation, we were elaborating a little bit about the different geographies. Asia should continue gaining, I would say, around three percentage points per year in terms of its contribution to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think that all the other questions have been already covered during the conference call. So thank you.</p>
