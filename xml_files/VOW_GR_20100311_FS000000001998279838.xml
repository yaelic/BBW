        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and colleagues. And welcome to the Annual Press Conference and Investor Conference of the Volkswagen Group here in the Autostadt.</p>
          <p>As is the case every year, we're very pleased that so many of you are interested here. We'd like to welcome 350 guests today, many from abroad, in fact from total of 17 different countries.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we've made our stage here a little wider because there are two new colleagues here for the very first time that I'd like to welcome. One person is Christian Klingler, who is the Group Board of Management Member for Sales and Marketing. And right next to me is Rupert Stadler. Rupert Stadler is the Chairman of the Board of Management of Audi AG. A position he took up at the beginning of this year is the position on the Group Board of Management. So that's something very special.</p>
          <p>We will do things as we usually do, which means to start out with Prof. Winterkorn will talk about the past year. Then Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will tell you the details about our financial results. After that, Prof. Winterkorn will once again give us a look at the current business year.</p>
          <p>Subsequently, you will have an opportunity as always to ask any questions you might have. So, I'd like now hand over to Prof. Winterkorn.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, it isn't only the Volkswagen Group that is looking back on an extraordinary year 2009 today, because 2009 really put the entire automotive industry to the test. We experienced the first global economic downturn in more than 60 years. Automobile markets all over the world were affected, in some cases quite dramatically. And today we can say that Volkswagen not only passed this grueling test, in fact Volkswagen proved its strength and coped with the crisis much better than many competitors.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we made 2009 a pivotal year for our strategy. With the integration of Porsche, we are taking our successful multibrand strategy to a new level. And through the envisaged partnership with Suzuki, Volkswagen will be taking a quantum leap in the ultra-compact segment and will finally open the door on Asian growth markets.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, 2009 really hurt the automotive industry. Some businesses faltered and others in fact where brought to their knees. Volkswagen demonstrated the strength and resilience of the foundations of our group. Financial soundness, our presence in all major world markets, our engineering expertise, our multibrand strategy and in my opinion the youngest, most environmentally friendly and broadest product portfolio our industry has to offer. And more than ever, these strengths have proved their worth. We delivered 6.3 million to customers in 2009, which represents a year-on-year rise of 1.3% and a new delivery record. Obviously the crisis has left its mark on us too.</p>
          <p>Shifts in the model and country mixes have had an impact. Sales revenue ran at &#x20AC;105.2 billion, 7.6% down on the prior year. Our earnings also showed a considerable decline. But where others reported losses, the Volkswagen Group demonstrated sustainable profitability, posting an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>So we have shown our ability to generate strong earnings, even in difficult business environments. And it is worth bearing in mind that this operating profit does not reflect the strong business development in China, because our Chinese joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.</p>
          <p>These achievements would not have been possible without the skill, commitment and flexibility of our employees.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen team produced an excellent performance throughout the entire year. And my colleagues and I would like to express our sincere thanks to all employees in our group.</p>
          <p>A look at the market underscores our above average performance. In 2009, the global passenger car market contracted by about 6%. Volkswagen bucked this trend and attracted new customers worldwide. We were able to expand our share of the global passenger car market quite significantly to 11.3%. This growth was primarily based on strong developments in Germany, Brazil and China.</p>
          <p>Our second home market, China, was an especially powerful growth driver, with deliveries up by 37%. Group deliveries in Germany rose by 17.6%. This means that one in every three new vehicles registered came from the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>Markets in Central and Eastern Europe as well as North America suffered, some of them dramatically. But here too, the Group clearly held its ground better than the competition. Volkswagen is the most successful multibrand group in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Our nine brands cover the entire spectrum &#x2013; from high value for money to premium, from small cars to 44-tonne trucks. In 2009, we once again introduced 75 new models, successors and product upgrades for our customers. And this broad lineup has proved its worth, particularly in the crisis.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Passenger Car brand put on a strong performance, continuing its successful growth course of previous years. Deliveries to customers were just under four million vehicles, an increase of 7.8%. Volkswagen achieved high growth rates in Germany, Brazil and China. The decisive factor in this good performance was the best product range in the history of the Volkswagen brand.</p>
          <p>One great example is the Polo, which scooped up almost every award our industry has to offer, from the Golden Steering Wheel to the Car of the Year Award. And we've sent a strong message with the Polo BlueMotion, the most economical five-seater in the compact class, for proving it's possible to be economical without comprising on driving pleasure.</p>
          <p>Audi made good progress towards the top of the premium segment in its centennial year. In total, the brand delivered roughly 950,000 vehicles worldwide, thereby surpassing its own sales target for 2009 by a significant margin. Audi naturally felt the effects of the downturn in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the brand held its ground much better than its direct competitors thanks to attractive new models such as the A5 Sportback. Audi is already the leading premium brand in Europe and China. And above all, Audi demonstrated consistent high profitability. So this all goes to show that Audi's place in the Volkswagen Group is an essential ingredient for its success and it gives the company a key competitive edge.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda has increased unit sales fourfold since joining the Volkswagen Group in 1991 and therefore ranks as one of the highest growth automotive brands of all. &#x160;koda achieved a new delivery record of 684,000 vehicles in the crisis year of 2009 with its practical and high value for money cars. The Simply Clever brand positioning and innovations such as the &#x160;koda Yeti epitomized the spirit of the times. Hence &#x160;koda will continue to raise its profile, because after all, one thing has become clear over the last few months. High value for money and technically robust cars are becoming increasingly popular all over the world.</p>
          <p>SEAT was hit by the massive impact of the crisis, in particular in its core market of Spain. All in all SEAT deliveries to customers were down by 8.5%, but the brand did grow in Germany, France and in United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>SEAT is structurally sound. They're on a good foundation. Product quality, design, and sportiness set the brand apart from its competitors and SEAT has the youngest buyers in the entire group. SEAT successfully entered the B segment with its Exeo and Exeo ST vehicles. Both cars represent the systematic use of synergies in our group. And we will stay focused on this path. The new Audi Q3 will begin rolling off the SEAT assembly line in Martorell starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>The luxury segment was and is the one hardest hit by the economic crisis. Bentley adopted a resolute response, cutting costs and adjusting production capacity to lower demand. We will see a sharp upturn in the premium segment as soon as the economy picks up again, particularly in markets such as China or India. And Bentley is well prepared for this, as is confirmed by the brand's new flagship which debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the Bentley Mulsanne, which emits 15% less CO2 even though it has a more powerful engine.</p>
          <p>The economic crisis took its toll on Lamborghini too. Deliveries declined to 1,500 vehicles. In engineering terms though, Lamborghini is still in the fast lane and is therefore systematically preparing for when markets take off again. Lamborghini once again underscored its unique position as an extreme and uncompromising super sports car brand at the Frankfurt Motor Show, with models such as Revent&#xF3;n Roadster.</p>
          <p>In 2009, deliveries by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles dropped to 362,000 units as a result of the economic crisis. Nevertheless, the brand significantly expanded its market position in Europe. The light commercial vehicles segment will witness strong growth in the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand will be taking advantage of the opportunities that this growth presents even more effectively, working closely with the Volkswagen Passenger Car brand. One example of this is the new Amarok pickup, which Volkswagen will be positioning in a further promising segment in South America, South Africa and Europe.</p>
          <p>The market for heavy trucks above 15 tonnes shrank by more than 20% in 2009 and Scania was not immune to this development, of course. Deliveries for the full year fell to 43,400 units.</p>
          <p>Scania responded to the crisis decisively by reducing working times and postponing investments. And as a result, in 2009 Scania continued to make a clear profit. I believe that this is an impressive achievement.</p>
          <p>In the commercial vehicle sector too, efficient vehicles are the foundation for success. Scania launched the new R-series, which was chosen as the International Truck of The Year, not least because of its outstanding efficiency. We are convinced that there will be a strong pickup of the cyclical truck and bus segment in the medium term.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group remains in a good position with Scania and its stake in MAN. Step-by-step, we will be taking advantage of opportunities for cooperating in the fields of development, engineering and components.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen Financial Services also pulled out all the stops in 2009 to steer safely through the crisis. Financial Services supported the sales activities of our brands in last year's tough economic environment, and was again a mainstay of the Group's operating profit. Financing, leasing, insurance and direct banking are an attractive strategic field of business for Volkswagen. In 2009, one vehicle in three sold by the Group was financed or leased by Volkswagen Financial Services.</p>
          <p>The contract portfolio rose by nearly 9% to 7.2 million contracts. And Financial Services has also provided specific support as our brands develop new markets, such as India, where a new Financial Services subsidiary has been set up.</p>
          <p>Financial Services will continue on this clear course toward further growth and greater internationalization in close collaboration with our Group brands. Ladies and gentlemen, we planned to merger Porsche SE with Volkswagen AG during the course of the next year to form a strong integrated group. We are seizing a historic opportunity for both companies in doing this.</p>
          <p>I am persuaded and convinced that Volkswagen and Porsche can together write a growth story that is almost unparalleled in the automotive sector. As you know, in a first step Volkswagen took a 49.9% stake in Porsche AG last December.</p>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will be giving you the details of the planned capital increase in a few minutes. At the same time, we are working on the way operations between the Volkswagen Group and Porsche AG interact.</p>
          <p>A joint project team is currently identifying synergy potential, for instance in production, purchasing and financial affairs. In a long-term context, we see the potential for a &#x20AC;700 million improvement in the Group's annual operating profit.</p>
          <p>Our current new joint developments, the new Touareg and Cayenne hybrids, show just how meaningful this integration is and how much sense it makes. Our longstanding development partnership will enter a much more intensive phase now. We can envisage many promising new concepts in this context. However, one thing is quite clear. There will be no compromising on Porsche's exclusivity and unique character. The 918 Spyder concept car with hybrid drive showcased in Geneva is the latest impressive conformation of the charisma and fascination of the Porsche brand.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our stack in Suzuki Motor Corporation represents a further quantum leap for Volkswagen. Some of your colleagues have talked about the automobile industry's new perfect couple. And they are quite right. We complement each other ideally.</p>
          <p>In strategical terms, this cooperation is of paramount significance for both companies and for the entire automotive industry. Little-by-little and step-by-step, we are bringing our partnership to life. We have set up a joint project office here in Wolfsburg to coordinate our cooperation.</p>
          <p>Work on concrete ideas and vehicle projects will begin in the next few weeks. The main focus is on environmentally friendly power-train technologies, and above all, cooperation on ultra compact cars.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that finishes my outline of business in 2009 and the strategic foundations we laid last year. And now Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will explain the most important financial indicators in detail. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would also like to give you very warm welcome to today's Annual Media and Investors conference here in Wolfsburg. The global financial and economic crisis impacted our business during the past fiscal year. Nevertheless, Volkswagen defended its outstanding position well in a tough economic competitive environment and it performed significantly better than most of its competitors.</p>
          <p>But we too were not entirely immune to the effects of the economic downturn. Our sales revenue fell by 7.6% to &#x20AC;105.2 billion. Also our operating profit was positive at &#x20AC;1.9 billion. It was well below the previous year's level. Accordingly, our return on investment at 3.8% lay below the current cost of capital, which is 6.9%.</p>
          <p>In net liquidity in the Automotive Division at &#x20AC;10.6 billion increased year-on-year, even after the 49.9% indirect investment in Porsche AG via Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, amounting to &#x20AC;3.9 billion. The primary reasons for the healthy liquidity trend were a clear improvement in working capital from the optimization of our stocks and inventories and the continuation of our systematic cost and investment discipline.</p>
          <p>In light of our satisfactory results in the difficult environment that prevailed in 2009 and our relative success in outperforming our competitors and in addition to our expected positive prospects for the future, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are proposing to the AGM to resolve a dividend of &#x20AC;1.60 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;1.66 per preferred share for Volkswagen AG.</p>
          <p>We not only managed the crisis in 2009 well in terms of our operating business, we also forged ahead with the strategic development of the Group, particularly through further strategic partnerships. Our investment in Porsche AG in December 2009 was followed by an agreement on a long-term partnership with the Suzuki Motor Corporation.</p>
          <p>We took 19.9% stake in Suzuki in January of 2010 at a purchase price of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Both of these partnerships are an excellent addition that will help us reach our goal of becoming the global economic and environmental leader in the automobile sector by the year 2018.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to take a more detailed look at the past fiscal year. Sales revenue dropped by &#x20AC;8.6 billion to &#x20AC;105.2 billion. Our cost of sales was 5.2% lower year-on-year, resulting in a gross margin of 12.9%.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;10.5 billion, distribution expenses were on a level with the previous year. Net other operating income declined by &#x20AC;0.9 billion to &#x20AC;1.6 billion due to lower reversals of provisions and a decrease in currency hedging gains.</p>
          <p>Overall, even in this challenging economic environment, we were able to generate an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.9 billion. Also this represents a significant year-on-year decrease, it is still a very good performance by our team in the prevailing competitive conditions.</p>
          <p>These figures which I mentioned do not include the &#x20AC;8.4 billion proportional share of the sales revenue of the Chinese joint ventures and the &#x20AC;774 million proportional share of the operating profit recorded by our Chinese joint ventures. These are included or consolidated using the equity method and are therefore only reflected in the Group's financial results.</p>
          <p>The Chinese joint ventures thus continued the positive earnings trend with these figures recorded last year &#x2013; for the last fiscal year and again achieved a healthy level of profitability. There are two main reasons why the financial results still declined by &#x20AC;870 million year-on-year. On one hand, the positive earnings effect in China was partly set by the negative result at the MAN Group. On the other hand, in particular the low level of interest rate reduced net interest income and net income from securities. In total we recorded a profit before tax of &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The tax rate declined slightly year-on-year to 27.7%, resulting in a profit after tax of &#x20AC;911 million for 2009. I would like to note at this point that you will find presentation of the key figures or key indicators for the fourth quarter of 2009 on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to examine individual items of our income statement in somewhat greater detail. This chart for sales revenue shows the following: last year, despite the difficult economic environment, we sold 6.3 million vehicles, which means 0.6% more than the year before. This was largely due to the substantial growth recorded by our Chinese joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Excluding China, the Group's unit sales declined by 6.1%. As the Chinese companies' equity accounted, consolidated using the equity method, sales revenue was down 7.6% year-on-year at &#x20AC;105.2 billion. Sales revenue was further reduced by volume effect amounting to &#x20AC;7.9 billion, mix deteriorations of &#x20AC;1.4 billion and unfavorable exchange rates amounting to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The sales of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business to the MAN Group resulted in &#x20AC;1.9 billion lower sales revenue compared with the previous year. Positive effects included higher prices &#x2013; this amounted to &#x20AC;0.7 billion, the first time full year inclusion of Scania, which increased sales revenue by &#x20AC;2.5 billion and the Financial Services division, which contributed &#x20AC;0.7 billion.</p>
          <p>If you look at the breakdown of sales revenue by market, we can see that in Europe, including the remaining markets, it was 9.2% lower than in 2008 at &#x20AC;75.2 billion. Because of the slump in the overall market, we recorded a 10.4% decrease in sales revenue in North America.</p>
          <p>In the South American market, sales revenue was only down slightly year-on-year at &#x20AC;9.6 billion, despite the removal of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business from our books. In the Asia-Pacific region, on the other hand, we increased sales revenue by 6.3% to &#x20AC;9 billion. I would like to note at this point that the sales revenue figure for the Asia-Pacific contains only the deliveries to our Chinese joint ventures, and not their own sales revenue in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>We have also modified our regional presentation. The South African market is no longer included in the South America region but it is now part of the Europe/Remaining Markets region. Prior year figures have been adjusted accordingly.</p>
          <p>The chart that you see right now shows operating profit by brands and business fields. As you can see, all brands were affected by the financial and economic crisis. The Volkswagen Group's operating profit was &#x20AC;1.9 billion, corresponding to a 70.7% decrease compared with the prior year figure. This included the proceeds from the sale of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business to the MAN group, which amount to &#x20AC;0.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Audi made a significant contribution to group earnings, with a clearly positive operating profit of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This demonstrated the Audi brand's ability to compete very successfully, even under extremely difficult economic conditions. In addition to Audi, Financial Services was again a mainstay of operating profit at &#x20AC;606 million.</p>
          <p>The operating conditions described earlier impacted the development of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand as well. In particular lower unit sales and deteriorations in the mix led to its operating profit declining to &#x20AC;561 million.</p>
          <p>The &#x160;koda brand's operating profit was affected by the continued unfavorable exchange rate situation and lower unit sales, declining by &#x20AC;362 million year-on-year to &#x20AC;203 million. The SEAT brand was unable to escape the effects of the continuing tight situation on the Spanish market. Its operating loss widened year-on-year by &#x20AC;261 million to &#x20AC;339 million operating loss. We know that we cannot just rely on the Spanish market to recover. For this reason, we have started implementing a comprehensive program at SEAT to return the company to profitability.</p>
          <p>The Bentley brand felt the impact of the pronounced slump in the luxury segment in fiscal year 2009. Consumers are reluctant to buy luxury goods in the current difficult environment. As a result, Bentley's operating profit declined by &#x20AC;204 million, with the company posting an operating loss of &#x20AC;194 million.</p>
          <p>Please note that figures for the brands and divisions or business fields also include intra-Group transactions, in particularly intercompany profits, whose elimination is contained in the Other category.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this category includes the depreciation and amortization expense from the purchase price allocation for Scania.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the movement in operating profit you will see that the largest negative factors at a total of &#x20AC;4.6 billion were primarily volume and mix effects, so they were the largest negative factors.</p>
          <p>The shift in volumes towards smaller vehicle had a particularly adverse affect. Unfavorable exchange rates reduced operating profit by &#x20AC;1.2 billion, also due to the influence of currencies such as the Russian ruble, the Swedish krona, or the Polish zloty</p>
          <p>The improvement in our product costs due to optimized procurement activities and productivity enhancements again had a positive effect on our operating profit. Over the course of 2009, we were able to record savings totaling &#x20AC;1 billion here. This shows you that we are pursuing our systematic work on our company's cost structures and that we are continuously optimizing our processes. This demonstrates the Group's ability to generate strong earnings, even in a very difficult operating environment. Improvement in fixed costs made an additional positive contribution to operating profit amounting to &#x20AC;0.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The sale of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business to the MAN Group increased operating profit by a total of &#x20AC;0.3 billion. This figure includes the proceeds from the sale of &#x20AC;0.6 billion, which were partly offset by the fact that the Resende's operating profit starting in March 2009 was no longer included in the books. Resende's operating profit was &#x20AC;0.3 billion in 2008 compared with an operating profit of only &#x20AC;21 million for the first two months of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Despite the sharp decline in demand on the truck market, Scania helped lift operating profit by &#x20AC;0.1 billion. This figure includes the significantly lower depreciation and amortization expenses from purchase price allocation. This profit is an impressive achievement in a particularly difficult year, 2009. Because of this and also due to the upbeat future business prospects, there was no reason to recognize an impairment loss on Scania.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services Division again made a significant contribution to the Volkswagen Group's operating profit in fiscal year 2009. This was &#x20AC;0.3 billion lower than in 2008 because of the difficult conditions prevailing in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, declining results automatically depress almost all financial indicators, including return on investment. In the Automotive Division, this decline from 10.9% in 2008 to 3.8% in the year-end report 2009. This means that we did not earn the current cost of capital of 6.9% in 2009. Nevertheless, we made further progress last year in our cost management, and as I will show you, in our management of working capital and liquidity, establishing a sound basis for 2010. Because simply saving as much as possible is not enough for us. We would rather save sensibly and in the right places. In particular in our investment decisions, we ensure that our upfront expenditures are focused on safeguarding the future of our company and generating adequate returns.</p>
          <p>Equity in the Financial Services Division decreased by around &#x20AC;250 million year-on-year to &#x20AC;8.2 billion. The decline in the return on equity from 12.1% to 7.9% was due to the disproportionate decrease or was due to the disproportionate decrease in profit before tax from &#x20AC;931 million in the previous year to &#x20AC;657 million; and also due, among other things, to higher risk provisions.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the equity ratio. At &#x20AC;37.4 billion, Group equity was on a level with the previous year. An increase in the Automotive Division was offset by the decrease in the Financial Services division I have just mentioned. Additionally, total assets rose in both divisions, with the result that the equity ratio in the Automotive division declined by 2.4 percentage points to 30.2% and in the Financial Services Division by 0.4 percentage points to 10.2%. The aggregate figure for the Group was 21.1%, following 22.3% in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as I mentioned last year, safeguarding and expanding our financial strength remains our top priority, so that we can secure our sound, our solid financial position and our ability to act at all times, even during difficult market phases. Our systematic cost and investment policies create the necessary conditions for this. That lies that the heart of the implementation of our Strategy 2018, which is our springboard will becoming the world's leading automobile company.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the individual items in our cash flow statement. At &#x20AC;8 billion, net liquidity in the automotive division was already at a high level in 2008. In fiscal year 2009, we succeeded in increasing our net liquidity even further. It grew by &#x20AC;2.6 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;10.6 billion. This is an impressive performance and it gives us a good financial basis.</p>
          <p>There were several reasons for this growth in net liquidity. First, our disciplined management of working capital generated a cash inflow of &#x20AC;6.2 billion, mainly as a result of the sharp reduction in stockpiled inventories. Of course, an effect of this magnitude cannot be repeated in a company that is growing again &#x2013; as we expect for the Volkswagen Group in 2010 &#x2013; or certainly this growth cannot be repeated.</p>
          <p>Now secondly, we generated additional cash from the sale of the Brazilian commercial vehicles business to the MAN Group. The acquisition of the indirect stake in Porsche AG via Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH reduced cash by &#x20AC;3.9 billion. The market driven decrease in earnings reduced gross cash flow by &#x20AC;4.4 billion to &#x20AC;6.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The Automotive Division's ratio of investment in property, plant and equipment to sales revenue declined by 0.4 percentage points to 6.2% and was thus in line with the forecast level. All in all, investments in property, plant and equipment decreased by approximately &#x20AC;1 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;5.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition to the new production facilities in India, Russia and United States, we invested mainly in expanding our product range. This relates primarily to the successor models to the Polo, the   Sharan, and the Touareg, as well as the new Audi A8, Audi R8 Spyder, Audi S5 Sportback, Audi A1 and the Amarok models. Well, additions to capitalized development cost also declined year-on-year by &#x20AC;0.3 billion to &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>After deducting investments, net cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;2.6 billion, which represents a &#x20AC;5.2 billion improvement over the previous year. We are moving into the year 2010 with a very healthy net liquidity position and we will continue to invest prudently in renewing and expanding our forward-looking product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Despite our continued high net liquidity, we still think it makes sense to strengthen our capital base. To this end we are planning an increase in preferred capital during the first half of 2010. This serves to preserve our long-term financial flexibility, particularly as regards the further development of the integrated automotive group with Porsche. Additionally, it gives us a healthy financing structure at every stage in the realization of our medium-term strategy.</p>
          <p>This morning, we also published the notice convening the Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft to be held in Hamburg on 22nd of April, 2010. Apart from the usual resolutions associated with an Annual General Meeting, the agenda also includes a proposal by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board concerning a resolution to issue bonds and authorization to issue to bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds with options or conversion rights for a maximum of 40 million preferred shares.</p>
          <p>Due to the offset provision in the proposed authorization, the sum of the shares issued under the approved capital increase and the shares subscribed under a subsequent issue of bonds with warrants or convertible bonds may not exceed 135 million shares.</p>
          <p>Such an authorization would give us a further financing instrument which we consider to be standard for increasing the financial flexibility of the major joint stock companies such as Volkswagen, but which is not available to us at the moment.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by summing up as follows. The Volkswagen Group's profit after tax attributable to shareholders of Volkswagen AG for fiscal year 2009 amounted to &#x20AC;960 million. This corresponds to basic earnings of &#x20AC;2.38 per ordinary share.</p>
          <p>All the indications are that the worldwide crisis has bottomed out and that the global economic picture has brightened a little. We are now cautiously upbeat about future developments. Nevertheless, 2010 will be a very difficult year for the global automotive industry, and thus also for the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>Safeguarding a solid financial position is a top priority in such a situation. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are therefore proposing to the Annual General Meeting to resolve a dividend for Volkswagen AG of &#x20AC;1.60 per ordinary shares and &#x20AC;1.66 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will continue. Ladies and gentlemen, 2009 was really a pivotal year for Volkswagen. In operating terms we proved our strength. In strategic terms we laid key foundations for the future of our Group. We are very systematically building on this positive momentum in 2010.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen will continue to play an attacking game under adverse conditions. Our targets are clear. We want to continue to gradually expand our good competitive position and we want to make a success of the integration of Porsche and the partnership with Suzuki. We will stay calm, focused and purposeful.</p>
          <p>We are aware that 2010 will not be an easy year. There will be a market downturn in Western Europe and Germany. On the other hand, though, we will enjoy a good tailwind in China, Brazil and the United States. The basic trend is a positive one.</p>
          <p>The global passenger car market is expected to grow slightly to between 53 and 54 million vehicles. But it's already obvious that anyone who claims the boom is just around the corner is ignoring reality. The economic environment is, and will remain, uncertain. Setbacks cannot be ruled out. And that is why we are staying on the rock solid course that has brought us, our Group safely through the crisis.</p>
          <p>Our production and sales divisions are responding very flexibly to demand trends. We are further raising productivity at our plants and in administration. The Volkswagen Way is a key driver in this context. In 2009 alone, we organized some 6,400 improvement workshops attended by well over 100,000 employees. We are making processes and systems leaner and are introducing standards across the group, for instance in our plants and in IT. And we are continuing with our strict cost and investment discipline, not least because this safeguards our high net liquidity and our good rating. What's crucial is that the Group remains 100% committed to strategic vehicle projects and technologies, because anyone who saves in these areas does sold at the expense of the future.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to earmark around &#x20AC;8 billion annually for development and investment in new models and environmental technologies. We will be investing some &#x20AC;26.6 billion in the Automotive Division from 2010 to 2012. Investments in property, plant and equipment will account for &#x20AC;19.9 billion. Approximately half of this amount will be invested in Germany. The ratio of property, plant and equipment to sales revenue in the Automotive Division will remain at about 6% in the medium to long term.</p>
          <p>And there is also another Volkswagen principle that we will be sticking to. Our human resources policy will continue to be guided by a sense of responsibility and proportion. We will continue to deploy our flexible working time instruments to safeguard the jobs of our core workforce.</p>
          <p>We know that we can only raise productivity year-after-year with the support of motivated and well trained employees. And that's why the Volkswagen Group will be recruiting some 3,000 university graduates and some 2,900 apprentices in 2010 &#x2013; despite the crisis. Volkswagen must and will attract the sharpest minds for the future of the automobile. Our Top 100 program has a similar goal. This is a program aimed at creating 100 additional specialists and managerial posts for highly-qualified experts. They will be mainly created in those regions where we enjoy our strongest growth.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the past few months, there has been much heated discussion about the future of the automotive industry. It's true to say that our industry has a long, hard road to travel.</p>
          <p>We will not return to pre-crisis unit levels before 2012 at the earliest. In the medium to long term, however, our business offers excellent prospects. The automotive industry is not a phase out model. It is one of the sectors for the future with the brightest future.</p>
          <p>This is due in no small measure to the BRIC countries, where demand for private transportation or individual mobility continues to soar. Forecasts predict the market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles will grow to some 89 million units by 2018. That would be an increase of more than 40% compared to 2009. However, it's also true to say that the automotive industry is at a structural and technological watershed. Such phases are risky and at the same time, they offer great opportunities for efficient and well positioned companies.</p>
          <p>At times of fundamental change, one thing is absolutely vital. And that is a clear and strong orientation. Volkswagen's Strategy 2018 sets the goals and defines the direction.</p>
          <p>By 2018, we intend to transform the Volkswagen Group into the world's leading automaker, economically and environmentally. It is not only size that is a factor for us. Our focus is on qualitative growth. We want to hold the lead in customer satisfaction and quality by 2018. By 2018, we want to increase deliveries to over 10 million vehicles per year. By 2018, we intend to achieve a profit margin before tax of more than 8%, making us one of the most profitable car makers in the world. And by 2018, we want our brands to be employers of choice.</p>
          <p>We've set ourselves clear milestones on this road to the top. The Group has set its sights on a medium term EBIT margin for the automotive business of at least 5%, before considering the integration of Porsche. Unit sales will grow to eight million vehicles in the medium term. These goals are ambitious, but they're nonetheless realistic. And I believe we've proved that this is the case in the past few months. And with Porsche and with our partnership with Suzuki, our strategy for 2018 is gaining additional momentum.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the multibrand Volkswagen Group has set three clear focus points on the road to 2018. First, our modular system strategy to intelligently manage diversity. Secondly, our growth initiative in all major regions of the world. And third, engineering leadership combined with responsible mobility.</p>
          <p>First, let me tell you about diversity. For many years now, the automotive industry has been experiencing an ever-growing trend for greater differentiation with respect to mature and new markets, vehicle segments and models, efficient powertrain technologies and the wishes and expectations of customers all over the world with regard to the cars themselves.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen is one of the carmakers best prepared to respond to this increasing differentiation with nine independent brands today, with some 200 different models in all segments, with a broad presence in all of the world's key markets and with a technology portfolio that ranges from Bugatti to the one liter consumption car.</p>
          <p>A core element of our Strategy 2018 is managing this diversity in economic and engineering terms. And the key for this lies in our modular systems. They will help us meet our ambitious growth and return targets that we've set for the Group and its brands. And they will allow us to maximize brand and model diversity, while at the same reducing complexity.</p>
          <p>We've already set the benchmark with our modular longitudinal system. The Audi A5, the Q5, the A4 and the new A8 are all based on our modular longitudinal system. In the medium term, we will be increasing the number of group models based on this system to around 15. The modular transverse system is the technical foundation for our vehicle fleets in the future in the A0, the A and the B segments. Across the Group, we will be launching more than 30 models based on this technology in the next 10 years.</p>
          <p>The new Audi A3 will get the ball rolling. And the next version of our most important volume model, the seventh generation of the Golf, will also be based on the modular transverse system in the future.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group has ushered in a new era with its modular strategy. This strategy has already become our key competitive edge. One-off expenditure and unit cost targets can be lowered by 20%. There is a big cut also in manufacturing time and complexity and there is a huge drop in the number of variants. Take air-conditioning for example, where the reduction is more than 70%. And we are now systematically continuing this approach with our modular diesel and infotainment systems. Looking to the future, there might even be a modular sports car system developed in cooperation with Porsche.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the second strategic pillar is our global growth initiative. This has its roots in the Group's market leadership in Western Europe, which we will be extending even further. But it is the automotive markets of the future that are crucial to our expansion.</p>
          <p>In China, we anticipate that the passenger car market will grow by more than 50% by 2018. The Indian market is expected to double over the same time period and there are also enormous opportunities in South America and Eastern Europe. The Volkswagen Group is considerably underrepresented in the United States at the moment and our US target of annual one million vehicles by 2018 remains unchanged. In all these markets, we aren't merely aiming to develop in line with market trends, but are pushing for growth that is well above the average, and the conditions for that are quite favorable. Volkswagen ranks among the automotive pioneers in China and South America and we are systematically expanding our strong positions in these regions. In China the group is looking to sell over two million vehicles per year in the medium term and we are already producing to a maximum capacity in China. That's why our joint ventures will be investing some &#x20AC;4.4 billion in new vehicles designed specifically for the Chinese market as well as in production capacity by 2012.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, by 2014 we will be investing a total of some &#x20AC;2.3 billion in plant expansions and new models. And by then, annual unit volumes are expected to rise to approximately one million vehicles there. Our new, state-of-the-art plants in India, Russia and the United States are laying the foundations for profitable growth. But local production alone is not enough.</p>
          <p>Anyone wishing to be successful in global markets must, above all, have a model portfolio tailored to the respective regions of the world &#x2013; and that's why we are for a version of the Polo specially designed with emerging markets in mind. Production has already successfully started at our Indian plant in Pune. A notchback version for Russia and India is in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Another example is our new midsize Sedan. This is a B segment model specially designed for our US customers. This car will begin rolling off the line in Chattanooga starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>And our new A00 car family, the new Small Family, will be available in a version for Western cities and another one for emerging markets. Cars produced in the region, for the region.</p>
          <p>Here lies the future of the car industry. In this context efficient, local supplier structures and high local content, are the prerequisites to competitive costs and profitable growth. And that's why we are constantly increasing the local content in terms of parts and components and we are also increasingly purchasing raw material such as steel and plastics locally. The local content rate for the Volkswagen Gol in Brazil for example is already at between 80 and 90% and we will systematically continue along this path.</p>
          <p>The uncompromising quality and safety of our vehicles and our high quality standards in our 60 plans have top priority at Volkswagen everywhere in the world &#x2013; in Germany, in China and in India.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, for the Volkswagen Group, environmentally compatible mobility isn't a tiresome obligation, it's our core business. And the race for the powertrain technologies of the future is on.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group already heads the field when it comes to efficient combustion engines, lightweight construction, DSG and intelligent electronics. For the foreseeable future, these technologies will continue to drive efficiency improvements and emission reductions.</p>
          <p>Our leading role is confirmed for instance by the fact that our model lineup already includes 176 cars emitting less than 140 grams of CO2 per kilometer, 60 have CO2 emissions of less than 120 grams and 6 even emit less than 100 grams. And now we are making electric cars, or electromobility, our second strong pillar.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen is the carmaker that will take the hybrid out of its niche and into the volume market and Volkswagen will be the carmaker to bring the electric car to the mass market.</p>
          <p>A few days ago, we presented our ambitious strategy for electric cars. This year, 2010, Volkswagen is putting the hybrid into standard production with our Touareg Hybrid. Over the coming months, our electric drive test fleets will begin trials in Europe, North America and China.</p>
          <p>Then 2012, we'll have the Jetta Hybrid. The year after that, we'll be seeing the Passat and Golf Hybrids hitting the road, then 2013, that will be a pivotal year for purely electric cars with the launch of the E-Up!, the E-Golf and the E-Jetta. It isn't only the Volkswagen brand that is moving into the fast lane with hybrids and electric cars, the other group brands are doing the same.</p>
          <p>Audi unveiled the A8 Hybrid and the A1 e-tron at the Geneva Motor Show, demonstrating the true meaning of Vorsprung durch Technik. The Q5 Hybrid goes into standard production at the end of this year. And at the end of 2012, we'll see the launch of the e-tron, Audi's first electric car. Fiat and &#x160;koda are also involved in our Group efforts to find solutions for the era of the electric car. And Porsche too is making great progress in electric cars with the Cayenne Hybrid and the 918 Spyder concept car. Given these efforts, our target for electric cars by 2018 is a 3% share of the vehicles we deliver. And based on current plans, that would be about 300,000 cars per year.</p>
          <p>So as you can see Volkswagen is at the vanguard of electric cars or electric mobility, electromobility. Because more than anyone else, our multibrand group has what it takes to achieve the breakthrough in electric cars. And because our modular systems allow us to develop all types of power trains in all model series and across all brands, flexibly and economically.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we believe in the knowhow of our component plans, particularly as regards the manufacturing of powertrains and storage modules. However, the real sticking point will remain battery technologies. In this area, we're expanding our knowhow in cooperation with expert partners such Sanyo, Toshiba and Bosch-Samsung</p>
          <p>There is one thing, however, that we have to be absolutely clear about in this context. And despite all these developments, the automotive industry will be making upfront investment in electro mobility to the tune of many tens of billions of euros, and no one today is in the position to say when this investment will pay off.</p>
          <p>This means that real progress can only be made by working together. Carmakers, energy, utility companies, as well as national and European policymakers. And that means massive support for research, particularly into battery technology, short-term incentives to encourage the purchase of electric cars and for setting up of efficient and strong infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Our automotive industry can only defend its technology leadership against new and aggressive competitors &#x2013; for example, from China &#x2013; by making a strong collective effort.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group set a fast pace in the past year and has no intention of slowing down in 2010. This year, we will once again be launching almost 70 innovative new products. This include important models such as the Volkswagen Touareg, Sharan, Passat, and Jetta successors, the Audi A1, A7 and A8 successors and the SEAT Ibiza ST and the Bentley Mulsanne.</p>
          <p>The enormous frequency with which we are presenting new and attractive models will help the Volkswagen Group to systematically extend its position in global markets. Our goal remains unchanged, to clearly outperform our competitors.</p>
          <p>In January and in February this year, we already succeeded in doing so. The Volkswagen Group got off to a strong start this year. We delivered more than one million vehicles to customers, one-quarter more than in the weak period at the beginning of the last year. We reached new heights in Germany and China, Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and &#x160;koda are well up on last year. The luxury and commercial vehicle segments remained difficult.</p>
          <p>In light of these figures, we are approaching the challenges that lie ahead in a mood of cautious optimism and expect the following. That the Volkswagen Group will deliver more vehicles to customers in 2010 than in the previous year, and we will increase our sales revenues. And we will earn more money than in 2009, raising operating profits.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, difficult tasks undoubtedly lie ahead for the automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group has placed itself in an excellent starting position with strong, fascinating brands and a compelling product portfolio, with targeted, controlled growth in all major world markets and with top notch engineering expertise.</p>
          <p>Let me put it this way, Volkswagen is starting the race in the first row. We are entering this race with 100% concentration and the necessary attacking spirit. And we will make very sure that we stay on track.</p>
          <p>Our sights are set firmly on our long-term goal to take the Volkswagen Group to the very top, economically and environmentally.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
