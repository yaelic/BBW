        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Telef&#xF3;nica 2011 results conference call.</p>
          <p>It is my pleasure to chair this call. Today with me, I have the members of the Executive Committee, so during the question-and-answer session they will have the opportunity to answer the questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the highlights of the year 2011. It has been a year of significant progress for the Group, not only globally, but also vertically.</p>
          <p>First, we have reinforced our franchise in Latin America, a region, which already accounts for over 35% of our results. We have strengthened our leadership in Brazil, the key market in the region and our main growth engine.</p>
          <p>Second, we have surpassed the 300 million accesses mark, further increasing our scale.</p>
          <p>Third, we have led the mobile broadband adoption across our footprint, a key cornerstone of our growth facility.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we have reinforced the value chain expanding vertically and increasing our scope through Telef&#xF3;nica Digital.</p>
          <p>Fifth, we have continued building competitive advantages with significant investment in mobile broadband, retail broadband and spectrum.</p>
          <p>Sixth, we have strengthened our liquidity position. On top of that, we have posted a solid set of results. We have delivered top-line growth, retained industry leading profitability and made operating guidance despite worse than expected trading conditions.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have delivered leading cash returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide, all these milestones have been achieved while reaching best ever free cash flow generation results. We are clearly outperforming our peers. We are the most geographically diversified integrated telecom player in the telecom industry. And despite market concerns, we have the lowest exposure to European markets among our peers.</p>
          <p>Our unique diversification and active financial management have been key to post this strong performance, despite higher level of investments to bolster future growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number seven, I am particularly proud of the new strategic boost implemented from last summer, to accelerate the company's transformation journey and to increase our growth potential. In the last six months, we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:20) of our asset base, reaching several agreements with third parties and selling non-core assets.</p>
          <p>We have also taken decisive actions on the commercial side to regain momentum across our markets. Moreover we have set a remuneration target, which allows us to maintain a very competitive remuneration, while increasing our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Finally, and key for the future of Telef&#xF3;nica, we have implemented a new organization that will allow us to speed our execution in digital world and to fully exploit all the benefit of our scale through the recently created global unit Telef&#xF3;nica Digital and Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight shows that the commercial repositioning just mentioned is already showing very positive results. We have recorded a very strong acceleration in net adds in the second half of the year, especially mobile, driven by record smartphone sales and a solid increase in the contract segment, which already accounts for one-third of our mobile base.</p>
          <p>The Q4 figures were particularly strong, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:41) campaign. We have invested to bring enhanced propositions to our customers, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:46) than have otherwise to grow our customer base by 7% year-on-year, setting the basis for future revenue expansion.</p>
          <p>On the mobile data business, a key and strategic area for Telef&#xF3;nica, we are positioning <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:01) strong results. We are leading that adoption and monetization in our markets, allowing a very fast expansion on mobile broadband penetration across our footprint with levels our around 30% in Europe and a huge transition ahead of us in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Data revenues continued to lead an outstanding growth and already account for 31% of mobile services revenue, and were 40% in the case of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. Non-SMS data revenue were very strong, up close to 40% year-on-year, to account for 52% of total data revenue. Again, we are outperforming main competitors in this market.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number 10. To get more color on how we are monetizing the mobile broadband explosion. First; we are mainly focused on smartphones. In Europe, over 90% of handset sales on the contract consumer segment in Q4 were smartphones. And the penetration in the prepaid segment is still very low. And this is clearly an opportunity head of us as every day, there is a wider portfolio of handset at cheaper prices.</p>
          <p>Our pricing mix strategy based on these prices across our footprint, along with integrated tariff in Europe is leading to a positive signs of profitable data monetization. Let me stress, that our smartphones have data rates attached and therefore, are active uses on the service. With an average uplift in ARPU of 1.5 times in the case of regular contract customer, the profitability of the smartphones versus a regular contract customer is 1.4 times higher. This figure varies across countries, depending on local subsides, improving our longer time, and will leverage lower handset prices, lower commissions, and we control network costs with our limited target plans.</p>
          <p>The strategy is working, with traffic growing, growth decelerating in comparison with the revenue growth, which is accelerating and growing very nicely. I will like to draw your attention to the case of Telef&#xF3;nica Germany, a good example of successful data monetization with non-SMS data revenue growing at 47%, and traffic at 32%. Looking into 2012, we will <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:50) to execute our growth strategy. Thanks to our healthy expansion in the last year to increase diversification, we are now in a very good shape to succeed.</p>
          <p>Trading conditions in Europe are difficult, but close to 50% of our sales already come from other geographies. And as I said before, we have the lowest exposure to European markets among our peers. Moreover, Latin America continues to grow very strongly. In respect to our growth potential in the region remains intact. We are in a very unique position to capture this growth opportunity, despite regulatory noise, our net exposure to mobile termination rate and roaming in Europe is very limited.</p>
          <p>We are in an industry where scale is a must. In Telef&#xF3;nica &#x2013; grow our franchise cannot be replicated. Being number one or number two in most markets is key to deliver profitable growth, and we have already built this local competitiveness advantages in key markets. Traditional revenues are under pressure. But we have gradually increased the contribution of mobile data to our sales, and we are taking the right actions to profitably monetize the mobile broadband boom. Telef&#xF3;nica Digital will begin in this area.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, in changing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:30) we have already the right platform to monetize this opportunity based on very solid foundations. First, we have 307 million billing relationships on the overall IP multi-access network. Second, our strength in enterprise and government market segments places us in a very good position to exploit changing value chain. Third, we have a timing advantage over competitors with 18 months experience on digital services development through the verticals and the unique experience we have in United Kingdom, and more European advanced digital markets.</p>
          <p>Therefore, this huge cross-sale opportunity arising from managing existing customer relationship from basic access to media portals like Terra, to social interaction like Tuenti, and leading players to play in customer services at giffgaff.</p>
          <p>This unique combination of assets and capabilities is already driving growth for new digital services by forcing the transformation of our core business, and we are already seeing as the best partner emerging digital players given our unique combined position of Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In the core digital environment, a global, open and scalable network becomes the major differentiator in the whole value chain, as it complements our digital asset with its unique combination of higher speed connectivity with computing and distribution capabilities that will help us throughout the front in the digital world.</p>
          <p>A complete set of assets, including physical elements and intangibles such as spectrum and unique telephony address space, are key to guaranteeing end-to-end control and quality of services.</p>
          <p>As an example, we are already providing differential content delivery services especially fit for video. And also innovating on digital communication services for end users, offering a single and ubiquitous customer experience on a variety of access technologies, including fiber-to-the-home and LTE.</p>
          <p>Let me now put some numbers in context. We have invested &#x20AC;31 billion in the last four years. Our full IP core network has up to five million kilometers of terrestrial fiber, connecting more than 100,000 servers with capacity to handle more than two terabits per second, equivalent to 250 billion CDs per second. Wireless accesses are supported by more than 100,000 base stations. And we're offering fiber to end customer in six of nine main markets, with 50% mobile base stations are already connected.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong R&amp;D franchise with more than 1,000 engineers developing digital services for Telef&#xF3;nica that includes an open interface to more than 10,000 external developers. In addition, technology innovation is reflected in the close to 100 patents registered annually, half of them being part of actual products and services.</p>
          <p>In 2012, our first priority is to foster revenue growth. Leveraging further commercial momentum, we focus on fixed and mobile broadband, a key driver for faster growth. The launch of Telef&#xF3;nica Digital will further push our revenues up. We will execute a tight control on cost to start efficiency gains to run as growth and profitability. And we'll increase cost on the investment to support topline expansion, and improve market share.</p>
          <p>Capitalizing on scale benefits in Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources and taking advantage of integration and restructuring plans to maximizing in-country efficiency. We will continue strengthening our network with focused investments in broadband to improve network capabilities, including a selective deployment of fiber and LTE where appropriate, and depending on the relations.</p>
          <p>This strategy will be compatible with maintaining a very attractive and sustainable shareholder remuneration policy and lower debt levels.</p>
          <p>In 2012, total shareholder remuneration will amount to &#x20AC;1.50 per share, including the payment of a cash dividend of &#x20AC;1.30 per share, and a share buyback for the remaining amount. And we expect to reduce our leverage ratio below 2.35 times net debt to OIBDA.</p>
          <p>Regarding operating guidance, we expect revenue to grow about 1% in 2012 at current exchange rates. We continue to remain solidly profitable &#x2013; profitability with an OIBDA margin decline lower than in 2011 and CapEx to sales ratio will be similar to 2011 figures.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide number 15, free cash flow generation comfortably exceeds expected outflows linked with dividends and share buybacks. In 2011, free cash flow per share was &#x20AC;2.06 and our remuneration target for coming years are around &#x20AC;1.5 per share. So, there is a very ample room.</p>
          <p>And we have the leading dividend yield not only in the sector, but among the top largest company by market cap worldwide. I'm very sure that this anomaly will reverse and the correction will not come from the numerator, but from the top place.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand the floor over to Angel.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, C&#xE9;sar. Please turn now to slide number 17 to start with a detailed review of 2011 results. In the second half of both 2010 and 2011, we booked several very significant extraordinary items, so to better understand the underlying performance of the company we are providing a P&amp;L excluding those non-recurring effects and non-cash impacts.</p>
          <p>As such, revenue reached &#x20AC;62.8 billion in 2011, growing by almost 5% excluding regulation. Underlying OIBDA totaled &#x20AC;22.7 billion, down about 1% ex-MTRs, despite increased commercial activity. Net income totaled almost &#x20AC;7.5 billion resulting in an underlying earnings per share of &#x20AC;1.66.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18 reviews Telef&#xF3;nica's organic performance. On this basis revenue growth excluding MTRs was 1.4%, while OIBDA margin posted a year-on-year decline of two percentage points. CapEx, excluding spectrum, was below &#x20AC;9 billion. So, revenue, OIBDA margin and CapEx performed in line with our full year targets, resulting in an organic operating cash flow figure of close to &#x20AC;14 billion.</p>
          <p>As slide number 19 outlines, Latin America continues its progression as the key engine to revenue growth, and more than offsets lower sales from our European businesses, accounting for almost half of total revenues, up four percentage points, thanks to the higher contribution of Brazil.</p>
          <p>In terms of OIBDA, Brazil will soon account for about one-fourth of consolidated figures with Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America already representing 48% of Group's OIBDA.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 20, in 2011, we posted a healthy 36.1% organic OIBDA margin, which remains as a benchmark among our peers. This profitability level reflects a strong cost control and benefits from our scale amid strong commercial activity, record smartphone sales and increased network and IT expenses, mainly-related with the rollout of our mobile broadband networks and enhanced customer care.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we have also invested heavily to support long-term growth. Total CapEx excluding spectrum was roughly &#x20AC;9 billion with growth across most businesses, being Latin America and Spain, the main contributors to year-on-year organic growth.</p>
          <p>CapEx to sales has stood at 14%, slightly higher than in 2010 and in line with our peers. On top of that we invested &#x20AC;1.3 billion to reinforce our network through spectrum acquisition in several geographies. As a result of these and past efforts, we can affirm that we are not under-investing in the business.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 22, let me highlight that in 2011 our strong free cash flow generation could allow us to reduce net debt by &#x20AC;1.6 billion, pre-discretionary and non-cash items. Financial investments comprising the purchase of Telef&#xF3;nica, Vivo and China Unicom shares led to a net debt increase of 1.3% by year-end.</p>
          <p>Since year closing, we have materialized significant debt reduction actions. Agreement has been reached for Colombian restructuring and some minority stakes have been divested. As a result, net debt will be down by &#x20AC;1.5 billion versus December 2011.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt to OIBDA stood at 2.46 times or at 2.63 times when, including commitments and excluding asset sales; once post-closing events are considered, net financial debt to OIBDA stands at around 2.4 times. Please notice that with the share purchases already included in our debt balance at year-end, the cash outflow for the next interim dividend payment should be significantly lower, since up to 30% &#x2013; &#x20AC;0.30 of the next dividend distribution could be in kind.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our active financial management has been key to minimize debt cost and maximize cash preservation. First, effective interest cost of our debt stood at 4.91%, 9 basis points lower than in 2010 on a comparable basis in spite of current debt market conditions.</p>
          <p>Second, we have demonstrated our cash upstream capabilities with record cash repatriation from Latin America exceeding &#x20AC;3.3 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>Third, our working capital management has led to further cash available over &#x20AC;1.35 billion cash generation while an appropriate tax policy has resulted in a 5-percentage-points cash tax rate reduction versus 2010. In both cases, we are beating the guidance.</p>
          <p>I would now like to highlight our strong liquidity position. At year-end, we held &#x20AC;5.1 billion cash position excluding the cash in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>On top of this in 2011, we renewed and increased by &#x20AC;1 billion, our undrawn committed credit lines, so that at year-end we had over &#x20AC;10.1 billion available, so 76% of those credit lines are long-term, and year-to-date we have additionally, extended approximately &#x20AC;0.6 billion undrawn lines to 2014 and 2015.</p>
          <p>Amid demanding credit markets, we raised around &#x20AC;11.5 billion during 2011, maintaining a balanced approach to the credit markets and diversifying our funding sources first, by getting continued support from banks, second by our successful access to the bond markets and third by benefiting from other alternative funding sources such as multilateral facilities, export credit agencies or local market financings.</p>
          <p>In addition, in the first two months of 2012, we have also been very active and have made strong refinancing progress. Year-to-date, financing activity amounts to &#x20AC;2 billion, with a &#x20AC;10 billion order book on our recent bond issuance. This syndicated refinancing is in various stages and will be closed very shortly. These, together with the preferred shares, which are extendable to perpetuity at our discretion, allow us to say that 2012 maturities are substantially refinanced.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2012, we have as financial priorities to increase balance sheet flexibility and to maximize shareholder value. We will continue working to progressively reduce the leverage ratio and to protect our rating. We will continue to be opportunistic and to proactively refinance our debt looking beyond 2012. We will maintain M&amp;A discipline with focus on active portfolio management as shown by the progress made so far in restructuring the Colombian operation and the existing non-core stakes. We will further execute strict working capital and tax management measures to maximize cash flow generation, and we expect again to beat cash tax guidance. All of these will strengthen our position to deliver premium returns and value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me now focus on the performance of our businesses by region, starting with Latin America. 2011 has been a year of very solid growth in the region and the strong performance recorded on the commercial side, especially the second half of the year has led to a healthy expansion of 10% in our customer base.</p>
          <p>Particularly strong was the momentum in mobile with net adds growing by 66% year-on-year in the fourth quarter to reach 7.5 million. Our targeted actions on high value customers have led Telef&#xF3;nica to reach the largest contract base in the region and to lead the mobile broadband adoption in Latin America.</p>
          <p>It is important to highlight that increased customer spend is flowing into revenues, leading to an acceleration in revenue growth in the last quarter to 6.3%, excluding regulation. Driven by a 9% year-on-year growth in mobile service revenue, this sets the scene for a promising 2012.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide number 27, higher commercial costs drag OIBDA growth by close to six percentage points in a year. The good news is that we achieved superior commercial performance with lower mobile subscriber acquisition costs, which are down 10% year-on-year. So, the increase in costs is a direct consequence of higher volumes, not of higher subsidies.</p>
          <p>There are other factors affecting our OIBDA year-on-year comparisons like the impact of regulation in Mexico, and the lower contribution from regional projects that more than offset our sales in 2011.</p>
          <p>CapEx to sales reached 18% of our Latin America revenues, up year-on-year, on the back of higher investments, showing our commitment with the region and our total confidence in its growth potential.</p>
          <p>Let me now comment on the very strong performance recorded in Brazil. 2011 has been a year of multiple progresses, completing the corporate restructuring, and executing the integration process, with synergy benefits coming above expectations, which led us to upgrade the initial synergy targets.</p>
          <p>On top of that, in the second half of the year, we have enhanced commercial activity, being active in all fronts, new tariff plans were announced, new services were launched, and we entered into new areas, leveraging the best spectrum portfolio in the market and very attractive prepaid propositions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we have widened our quality gap versus competitors, increasing the difference versus our peers in three [3G] coverage and further expanding selectively fiber in S&#xE3;o Paulo to increase speeds and quality in our fixed broadband business.</p>
          <p>All these actions have led to very strong results as shown in slide number 29. In 2011, we have further expanded our leadership, winning value share in the mobile market, while we continue to lead the fixed broadband market in S&#xE3;o Paulo. Strong commercial momentum translated into revenue, with year-on-year growth accelerating in the fourth quarter on the back of mobile service revenue acceleration and some fixed broadband and TV revenues performance. And our margins are the best in the market, despite the strong drive in commercial activity, leveraging on synergies realization, which are more visible below the operating lines in the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>No doubt, we are in the best to position to continue leading the growth in the largest market in Latin America. These excellent results are being recognized by the market with Telef&#xF3;nica do Brasil shares appreciating in the market since the results announcement and accumulating a 30% relative outperformance versus the index in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide number 30. I just want to stress that some commercial activity across our properties in the South Region setting the various for further revenue growth combined with some margins. This operations generated in 2011 closed to &#x20AC;2 billion in operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>There are different market realties across the region, but one thing is common, Telef&#xF3;nica is leading the transformation in the business. Our mobile broadband penetration is a much, and we are step ahead. In these countries our integrated approach becomes a true competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I want to highlight the acceleration in the North Region revenue growth. Regarding Mexico, where results were heavily impacted by regulatory headwinds, we are focused on quality growth with a very marked improved in outgoing revenue trends in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2012, we expect growth to accelerate in the region. In Brazil, we will leverage from the foundation set in 2011 and integration synergies will be key to free resources and support our aggressive growth strategy. Commercially we will benefit from the attributes of having the best plant in the market nationwide and for all our service, as Vivo will be the single brand as for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>We aim to consolidate our mobile leadership across all segments with special focus in mobile broadband. In fixed broadband, we will leverage network upgrades in S&#xE3;o Paulo, and we have already started to move outside our operational area of influence with very attractive propositions in a potential market of more than 50 million households, representing 65% of the Brazilian GDP.</p>
          <p>In the rest of the region, we will prioritize the mass market adoption of fixed and mobile broadband on the back of bundles, tier pricing, cheaper devices and enhanced network capabilities. Commercial strategies will be adapted to particular market conditions with a clear focus on leveraging our integrated position in markets like Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our operations in Europe starting with 2011 performance. As C&#xE9;sar mentioned before, in the summer, we decided to revisit our commercial strategies in key markets, launching new propositions that together with the solid uptake of smartphones led to an outstanding improvement in commercial momentum in the fourth quarter of the year, both in mobile and fixed broadband.</p>
          <p>Our lead in the mobile broadband market resulted in a strong performance in mobile data with the smartphone penetration, up eight percentage points year-on-year to 27% of our base, and non-SMS data revenue delivering a solid 30% organic increase, clearly outperforming main competitors across key markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to the specifics of Spain on page 34, I'd like to highlight the significant commercial improvement across businesses. The new tariffs launched allow us to better compete in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband net adds turned positive in the fourth quarter with a marked evolution through the quarter. There is a clear preference for the higher value products with two-thirds of the customers opting for the new tariffs of &#x20AC;24.9, a price point that is above previous promotions, and allows to sustain the improving trend in connectivity ARPU.</p>
          <p>On the mobile side, net adds reached record levels since the end of 2010 with better results across segments and the best-ever net adds in mobile broadband, over 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Mobile data ARPU showed a very strong evolution along the year. We've sustained double-digit growth in the last quarter. On the other hand, voice ARPU worsened in the fourth quarter, impacted by a weaker private consumption, cutting MTRs and price repositioning, which will drag revenues in the short-term, but will help increase gross adds and reduce churn in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In 2011 we also took other decisive actions to make structural progress in Spain that is already bearing fruit. On the cost side, the increased flexibility on personal expenses led to a rise in salaries below the CPI, while the fast execution of the new redundancy program will lead to savings of over &#x20AC;200 million in 2012. Close to 2,400 employees have already left the company and another 2,000 will join the plan this year.</p>
          <p>We also increased CapEx intensity, not only in absolute term, but also in relative terms with a 12% CapEx to sales ratio as we continue to expand capacity and coverage in mobile broadband and to selectively rollout fiber. On top of that, we invested over &#x20AC;800 million to ensure the best spectrum in the market.</p>
          <p>Finally, Q4 financials reflect the impact of price changes and lower usage in a weaker economy, which impacted mobile service revenue. On the other hand, fixed revenues proved more resilient, posting sequential improvement. Top line pressure flew directly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:50) in the quarter as benefits from the workforce reduction were not visible and increased commercial activity limited savings.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 priorities for the Spanish business are outlined on slide 36. We have a clear roadmap to turn around the performance along the year, starting with improved commercial results on the back of more competitive propositions, and new measures to increase customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>These actions should allow us to improve gross adds, reduce churn and stabilize market share performance. As a result, we expect customer growth to help top line evolution, although tariff repositioning will impact revenues in the first half.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, savings from the redundancy program will flow since the beginning of the year while lower churn should positively impact commercial costs. On top of that, we will further benefit from OpEx efficiencies derived from outsourcing, handset portfolio optimization and the support of Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 37, Telef&#xF3;nica U.K. finished the year with strong traction in the contract segment, recording the best quarterly net adds in the fourth quarter driven by the new commercial focus introduced in August.</p>
          <p>Our priority was to increase loyalty within the highest and most profitable smartphone base in the U.K. market. To achieve this goal, we encouraged the adoption of new integrated tariffs and offered the newest high-end smartphones first to existing customers coming out of contract, which led to a 35% year-on-year increase in upgrades in Q4. The renewed commercial momentum against sustained top line pressure impacted our OIBDA margin in the quarter, which stood at 24.2% and 26.5% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Despite strong competition, we continue to lead smartphone adoption in the U.K. expanding penetration in our base by close to nine percentage points in 2011. More than 80% of contract customers in the consumer segment were under tiered schemes at the end of December, with most of them opting for one of the two top tier data bundles.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the service revenue waterfall, mobile data, including SMS, is adding the most to 2011 performance, four percentage points, to represent 47% of the total. But this was not enough to offset the drag from regulation and a weak macro environment, which is accelerating lower tariff options and fit to bundle consumption from customers. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:31) risks continue to be well addressed, with 75% of service revenues in the contract segment included in a bundle. This is three percentage points more than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 39, we have completed a very successful year in the German market, maintaining a strong commercial momentum and improving monetization of mobile data thanks to the continued development of the O2 Blue tariffs and the traction in business and no value segment through exclusive partners.</p>
          <p>Contract net adds ramped up in Q4, while we maintained our leadership in smartphone adoption at 90% of total shipments. Mobile service revenue growth excluding the impact from regulation recorded a strong growth at over 7% year-on-year in 2011, mainly driven by mobile data with non-SMS revenues rising close to 50% in the year.</p>
          <p>A solid sales performance, coupled with full benefits from efficiency plans led to a 39% organic growth in operating cash flow, while OIBDA margin increased to exceed 24% in 2011. In summary, very strong improvement in Germany.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2012, we aim to strengthen our position both in the U.K. and Germany, two key markets for Telef&#xF3;nica. In the U.K, we aim to recover momentum and stabilize market share to raise better revenue dynamics, capturing and retaining high value customers while keeping our leading position in the mobile data market. This will be achieved through significant commercial spend, coupled with increased focus on customer experience, including innovation around new digital services.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we aim to continue outperforming in a very profitable market. Network quality, customer satisfaction and converged approach in the definition of products and services will be key to achieve our goals in a more stable regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>LTE will be a main driver for future growth. In 2012 centered around smartphones and German network deployment, adding the benefits from network collaboration with DT in the backhaul.</p>
          <p>Finally, I just wanted to highlight the continued improved performance recorded in the Czech Republic, both commercially and on the financial side, which together with the new shareholder remuneration structure, lift the stock price to rise over 7% on the day of the earnings release.</p>
          <p>To finalize, let me now spend a few minutes to explain how we will maximize the benefit arising from the launch of the new global units in 2012. Telef&#xF3;nica Digital will continue to develop its strategy of growing revenues above connectivity from digital assets in high potential marketplaces, exploiting profitable partnerships with main actors in the industry, while protecting Telef&#xF3;nica's core communication business in tight correlation with the regions.</p>
          <p>We are making significant progresses, as evidenced by the recent agreement signed to launch financial services or the brand new long-term contract with OnStar on the machine-to-machine space. We will provide a specific update of Telef&#xF3;nica Digital strategy and goals ahead of Q2 results.</p>
          <p>In parallel, the launch of Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources is already allowing us to accelerate the generation of additional synergies to fully exploit economies of scale. We are already working on several flagship projects with high value impact. In fact, main projects are already underway in key area, such as procurement, particularly on the devices side and network and IT, which together should lead to benefits of over &#x20AC;1 billion in 2012. On top of that, we will further advance in network collaboration schemes with third parties and on the sale of non-core infrastructure to get additional efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand it back to C&#xE9;sar for the closing remarks.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I wanted to ask about your guidance for 2012. Do you expect to sell more towers in 2012? And is that likely to help your EBITDA performance during the year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on SMS substitution risk, if I've got the numbers right there was an acceleration in the decline in SMS, both in the U.K. and in Spain in the quarter can you talk a bit about trends in SMS and IP substitution risk in your European business? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>This is Julio Linares. Thank you for your question. When we set out the guidance for this year, as always we tried to maximize our operational assets and in order to do so, we always analyze what assets are strategic or they are not strategic, what assets we should control or we do not need to control, in such a way that it is able to externalize those assets that we believe that are not strategic for us. And then we focus on the resources in the best possible way.</p>
          <p>This has been the way that we set up our OIBDA guidance every year, and we are keeping this practice in the year 2012 as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question as evolution in Europe, there are different realities across different units, for sure, dependent on the tariff structure, but let me highlight that, for example, in the case of Germany, the number of SMS has been significantly increases all along the year, even though we have <mark type="inaudible" /> (45:16), because we have a bundle strategy of bundling voice and SMS in the German market. So, in the German market, it has not been an issue so far.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., it is true that the number of messages or SMS for customers, it's showing a slight decline, but it is also true that we have bundle and flat SMS tariff and therefore, in terms of revenue, we're not exposed to that evolution, because we thought that was going to be the case, and we prepared our tariffs for that.</p>
          <p>And in the case of the Spain, as you know, that we recently changed our tariff structure in Spain, because in Spain we're exposed to the SMS evolution and therefore, we bundled, at the end of last year voice, and SMS and data having a flat rate, whereas SMS included in some of our tariffs.</p>
          <p>So in Spain was the case where we were more affected, but we've been trying to immunize ourselves to this evolution through these bundles and through these flat tariffs. So, for the time-being, we are &#x2013; we think that we are protected with the current tariff schemes that we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have two questions, please? First one is a follow-up on the previous question, whether you can give us some idea of the magnitude of tower sales that you expect in 2012? And if I would put it differently, if we look at the portfolio of your guidance for a 2% decline in EBITDA margin, could that be the case, even if you have a fairly significant program for tower sales this year?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the data you gave us on page 38 about around three quarters of service revenues coming from integrated tariffs in the U.K., is it possible to give us a similar number for Spain, a comparable number for Spain? And perhaps, if you could give us an idea of how this has been evolving during 2011? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your second question, we don't have here the exact information replicating the page 38 for the U.K. for Spain, but I can give you some flavor what has been there &#x2013; what have been the main reasons behind the evolution in Spain: churn, that has eroded part of our value customer segment; then the ARPU, the worse mix between low and high end customers for the Spain all along the year; the decline in SMS revenues till we launch this new tariff; and finally, we have been taking away some promotions and some actions that were not meeting our customer satisfaction criteria and therefore, that has affected the revenues in the short-term.</p>
          <p>But I would ask you to get back to our IR department to get more clarity on the specific evaluation because we don't have the specific data here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Spain, it will be very useful if you could share a bit with us, if you perceive any change on consumer trends in Spain in the first two months of the year given that we have austerity measures now hitting the street? And eventually and depending on how the year is going, if there is potential further OpEx costs in Spain also for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of consumer trends, remain weak in Spain in the first two months, so similar trends to the last quarter of the previous years in terms of overall market sentiment from the consumer standpoint. So, for the time being, no good signs on that side.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our OpEx reductions so far of &#x2013; we keep looking for efficiency; remember that this year, we will fully benefit from the employee reduction program that we launched last year, so that will flow during this year through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And, on top of that, you should expect from us that we will be more, I would say, we'll be adapting our subsidy strategy during the year in Spain in order to be much more focused on our existing customer base, and therefore, having the bulk of our efforts in the commercial sites, retaining our high end value customers, and therefore, trying to avoid significantly churn.</p>
          <p>So, those are the flavors that I can share with you right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Angel Vil&#xE1;. With respect to leverage, we have closed 2011 above the level that we guided to the market. This has been the result of deterioration in the macro and financial environment across Europe, so our debt figures have been impacted by adverse foreign exchange movements, the euro appreciation versus other reporting currencies. Obviously, it also affected our operations as it has been expressed before by some of my colleagues.</p>
          <p>One other matter affecting the increase in the leverage, when you include commitments is that we have had a higher take-up in our employee redundancy program in Spain to 36% instead of 33%. And this clearly will impact in better savings for next year.</p>
          <p>Also, having seen the excellent progress of our free cash flow generation, we decided to dedicate further resources to the share buyback in order to anticipate cash saving for 2012 shareholder remuneration. So, this has led us to finalize our leverage above what we had guided for year-end.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2012, we expect leverage to be reduced based on several factors. First, as I expressed in the presentation, we have some actions that have taken place post the closing of the exercise where we are already reducing net debt. We have the Colombian debt restructuring. We have been selling stakes, minority stakes in EspaSa, in Portugal Telecom, in ZON, and some other assets.</p>
          <p>Also, we are going to continue progressing on measures like working capital management that this year has had a very positive contribution to our free cash flow, and we expect to also be the case in 2012 albeit could be a smaller positive effect.</p>
          <p>If you take into account all of these effects, we expect &#x2013; well, and also, as you have seen on slide 15, the cash out, which is related to shareholder remuneration, is going to be significantly reduced as compared to the one that we had in the previous year. So, we expect to have organic deleverage by year-end in addition to what may come from further streamlining of our portfolio of assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, a couple of things. Just wondering firstly if you could be a bit more explicit about your commercial costs in Spain? Vodafone when they cut price initially in May 2011 made it pretty clear that they were hoping that a lower ARPU price would lead ultimately to lower SAC. We haven't seen that yet in the market, but do you think that strategy of yours on lowering commercial costs is really part of that process, and that we should see the Spanish mobile market become also a more profitable across the markets later this year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I notice your relatively positive comments about mobile data in the U.K. and the question of tiering a lot of your customers on higher tiers. We're seeing again Vodafone questioning whether tiering is working. Are customers really spinning up to higher plans? I was wondering if you could share any of your experience. Perhaps you are having a more positive experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trying to be more precise on the comment that I made about the commercial costs for the year in Spain. What we have done at the end of all along year 2011, starting in July and keep going in November, in terms of repositioning all of our tariffs. We're trying to do two things; first of all, aligning our commercial effort, because we were out of the market, and we were losing relevance in terms of the market, and we wanted to get back some commercial momentum, which we did, again, starting by the tariff that was launched in July and keeping in September and back again in November.</p>
          <p>And we are back in, that thanks to that, we will able to able to reduce churn, because at the end of the day, we are there either in Spain we have the largest customer base, and we have probably the most valuable customers, and we wanted to reduce churn as a way to try to preserve the high end customers, and therefore, to stop the erosion in terms of service revenues.</p>
          <p>That, it's too soon to say because it's just two months after the last launch of the tariffs, but it is going into that direction, so the first signs are positive. So, we'll keep going into this path. And on top of that, you're right, we think that the next step should be more rational behavior in terms of the subsidies policies in Spain, because we, at the end of the day, we want to invest this amount of money or to use a significant part of this amount of money to preserve and to give our best value to the existing customers, and therefore, once again trying to reduce churn.</p>
          <p>So, if I had to summarize what are the main guidelines between our &#x2013; below our strategy of our commercial repositioning is to try to be much more competitive today in commercial momentum, which we have done, and to be able to reduce churn because us, having the largest customer base, we are the most ideal candidate to churn on.</p>
          <p>We have been doing several actions in terms of bundling, in terms of bundling data with SMS, in terms of bundling data, SMS and voice, cross-bundling with broadband with fixed &#x2013; with wireline broadband, and this is taking traction.</p>
          <p>So we think we are on the right track. We think that this is the right direction within this &#x2013; it is the role of the leader of the market to show the way of the rationale behind the market, and that's what we're trying to do, and as you might imagine, we are monitoring very closely.</p>
          <p>And in terms of your question about the U.K. market and the comments, we are not going to comment on the comments of Vodafone as you might imagine, but we did a tariff refresh in August last year, which help us to gain more commercial traction in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In the month of November, we, with the launching of the iPhone 4S, we bet on the existing customer base precisely to try to avoid churn because keep in mind that we have the most valuable smartphone customer base in the U.K. market, and as you might imagine, we are closely monitoring every single movement on the U.K. market, but for the time being, with the traction that we got from the August refresh of tariffs, and with the current strategy, we are seeing that we are on the right direction. We're gaining some commercial traction. Were the conditions of the U.K. market to change structurally, then we'll reconsider.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I have two questions on Spain and both on tariffs. The first one is on the new mobile packages that were launched in the fourth quarter, and whether these packages are behind the accelerated decline in ARPU in the fourth quarter, whether you've seen any material tradedown effect that could potentially turn into ARPU accretion in 2012 as upselling succeeds? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is again on tariffs, but now it's on DSL. And whether you could give us some kind of indication on what percentage of existing DSL customers were also mobile contract customers, and therefore, could apply for the &#x20AC;25 tariff, and also, what percentage of them have actually migrated to this tariff already? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks, Luis. Taking your question on the effect of the bundles, I mean, again too soon to say that with information because it was just launched on &#x2013; in November. But as you might imagine, we are monitoring that on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
          <p>With the information that we have right now, the effect that we are looking for with this repositioning is being in the right direction, which means that we do not see on the new &#x2013; on the customers being on the new portfolio having a worse performance at customers so far on the preexisting portfolio, which means that all other things being equal, I mean, all of our customers been affected by the overall market sentiment. The customers that have chosen to go into the new portfolio of products are showing a better performance than the others.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, churn of those customers are going into the right direction. Churn of those customers are lower than the one before. Even though churn is a very early stage because it's just two months, so it's too soon to conclude that this is going to be the behavior along the year, but so far, it's going into the right direction.</p>
          <p>So we think that the market repositioning is working well, because it has allowed us to be much more competitive, and to get commercial traction. It shows a lower ARPU decline than the customers coming from the preexisting portfolio of products, and helped us to be much more relevant from a commercial standpoint.</p>
          <p>And taking your question on the DSL, I don't have here the figure of how many customers of DSL are subject to bundle, but what I can say is that as of this tariff of the 19.9 and the 24.9. The current mix is two-thirds, 24.9 of net of new adds, one-third of 19.9 new adds.</p>
          <p>So, again, going to the right direction, the value-added services looks to be attractive in terms of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:05) and the additional bundles, so, again, too soon to say, but things look like going into the right direction.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much. I've two questions if I may. The first is, we seem to be seeing huge value being sucked out of the industry by handset manufacturers, and in particular, Apple, and that looks like what I'm seeing in the U.K. Q4 number. So, I'm wondering, if there is anything that you or your competition can do like investing significantly more in a differentiated network or something else to stop that process?</p>
          <p>And then second question is about your net debt to EBITDA targets, which is &#x2013; am I right in assuming that you're going to include asset sales of towers in the EBITDA number when you think about those net debt to EBITDA targets? And isn't that little odd given that the tower sales will presumably have a negative impact on your EBITDA going forward?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>And as I said before, we will prefer not to provide early information about the sales that we could do through the year, taking into account the market conditions, and we will provide that information on quarterly basis, as we've executed the projects</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Two questions, the first one the tower sales contributed I believe, 100 basis points positively to the 200 basis points decline in margin, was that more or less than you saw, say six months ago, when you guys were thinking the second half could get better?</p>
          <p>And my second question, you highlighted &#x20AC;1.5 billion of debt reduction from Colombia, could you remind us what the &#x2013; the sort of equity side of that is, and if you &#x2013; if there is any book value changes you need to make?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you about the tower sales, if you looked at our number in 2011, the regional projects in 2011, which were lower than 2010 than more &#x2013; than the sales of tower sales. I said, during the presentation, we have 100,000 towers, okay. And you can believe that many of those 100,000 towers are not strategic at all. They are not part of our core business. They are not strategic at all, okay.</p>
          <p>Why we have less regional approach in 2011 because the potential we have now in the value chain because of the new digital position now we have, and we are putting the effort in the end value that digital chain, where we are going to grow a lot is we are going to make the efforts in 2012. So, the number of towers this year is irrelevant for the growth potential. So, don't get so much worried about the tower sales because it's irrelevant, okay.</p>

          <p>Okay. With respect to Colombia debt reduction, the &#x20AC;1.5 billion figure is not only Colombia, the Colombian figure will be about &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And this is a result of an agreement reached with the Colombian government that has been approved by the Parliament of such country and has been published in a Presidential decree. Basically what is public already is that the Colombian nation will be taking on their books 48% of the liabilities that corresponded to our fixed line business as part of capitalization of that company. And our share of capitalization of the company will be taken by merging the company with our mobile operation in such country, deriving synergies from that fixed and mobile integration. This process is very, very advanced. We have reached agreement, and it is pending some formal execution steps that will take place in the next couple of weeks.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. related to the repositioning and commercial offer, in particular, what you've done both in the U.K. and in Spain to move away from the value positioning and more towards the commercial positioning to maintain customers and basically go back into the market as you are now positioned. Can we take as a given then that this is going to be the trend moving forward and thus the positioning for value for money is no longer relevant as was stated in the Investor Day in April? That will be my first question.</p>
          <p>And second, related to the net debt to EBITDA target of 2.61 or 2.63 now does that relationship reform compromise your possibility of having &#x2013; considering you have negative outlook in ratings, with two agencies, that this could &#x2013; I mean, that you could be downgraded? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, taking question on the new tariff launch in both in the U.K. and Spain, and if it is volume or value the worst case scenario is that being under position. And I would say not well-positioned commercially speaking. We have the threat, we will suffer in the fact of a high-end valuable customers leaving us. And therefore, we wanted to be back on the market precisely to be able to both retain the valuable customers and be back relevant on the commercial side, and that's what we have done both in the U.K. and in Spain.</p>
          <p>In Germany, our commercial launch &#x2013; our commercial tariffs were &#x2013; are in very good shape. So, I would say that it is not giving away volume or value, it's that we were, I would say not relevant commercially speaking, and we were losing a significant amount of very valuable customers to our competitors, and that's precisely what we want to avoid. And that also explains the fact again that, you will see along this year, namely here in Spain, that we will be much more rational on the subsidies, because the last &#x2013; the preference is going to go to preserve the most valuable customers that we have and therefore, most of our commercial efforts are going to be devoted to our valuable customers. In every single market, namely here in Spain, but as well in the U.K. in terms of the smartphone base, we have the most valuable customer base, and that's precisely where we want to preserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with respect to the leverage ratio, our target is 2.35 net financial debt to OIBDA. We stand today at 2.46, and after the post-closing debt reduction actions, we would be around 2.4 times. This objective of 2.35 in net financial debt to OIBDA is equivalent to the previous net debt plus commitments divided by adjusted OIBDA of 2.5 times, which we will continue to report, so you should not be concerned about this change, because it's equivalent what we're stating in one or the other ratio.</p>
          <p>By the way, this ratio is not only known by the rating agencies, but put in some of the recent reports for instance, Moody's they were using these ratios when they published. So, the financial position is known, is public and regardless of whether you are using one ratio or the other, what we're committed is to work in the direction of reducing leverage, which, again, as I said in the first two months of the year, we have made substantial progress in that direction already.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, two questions, please? First on Spain, is there any chance you can quantify the impact you have seen in revenues in the fourth quarter from rebalancing the SMS tariffs into the bundle &#x2013; into the voice package, how much negatively influenced revenues?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Latin America, it seems in a few markets competition is increasing: Chile, Brazil, some of your other markets. Is that a trend you expect to continue in 2012? And given that you started increasing commercial activity also to gain customers last quarter, do you continue to spend on customer acquisitions, therefore, driving growth via customer acquisitions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question about SMS evolution and the impact that the new tariffs may have on the revenues coming from the reduction of SMS in Spain. It is very hard for us to say because we have bundled that. And therefore, for us, it's now &#x2013; it's much more a central location. We're approaching that through our data. We have seen data expansion into those consumption. So, it is very tough for us to see that.</p>
          <p>For us, we have come in Spain to the same strategy as in U.K. or Germany, bundling in order to be much more inelastic or less exposed or more hedged toward the reduction in SMS. So, we don't have information here to tell you that because it is now bundled. And therefore, we have not seen that impact in revenues, because we would see now that bundling today &#x2013; tariff that we have.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you some &#x2013; the only information that we can give, help you to conclude. Let me remind you that our SMS, it was 6.5% of total mobile service revenue in Spain before the bundling. So, the exposure is very limited and is now bundled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Torsten, this is Santiago. On your question on Latin America it is certainly the case that competition is picking up. But it's picking up for the right reasons. In one case or in some cases like say, Chile, because the market is approaching maturity, new entrants are trying to carve a niche in the market and therefore, the temperature rises. There where the temperature is rising, we have however, the strongest starting point, and it's difficult to assail an already established position.</p>
          <p>In other markets like, say, Brazil, what's happening is that growth is accelerating. So, yes, commercial expenditures are up, but they are up for the right reason. The right reason is that net adds are rising, the quality of these customers is rising. And again, the newcomers are trying to establish a point and not quite succeeding all the time.</p>
          <p>So, short answer would be, yes. We still think that the commercial activity is going to be performing very well. Net adds are going to increase and the already established operators like ourselves are likely to derive some benefits, although, not in the short, but more in the medium term, let's say, four to six quarters ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, everyone. Sorry, two questions on LatAm. Firstly, can you provide some color on how much support we should get from the Vivo synergies in 2012 versus 2011? And can you also give us some color on what the integration cost will be like in 2012 as well?</p>
          <p>And secondly, following up on the question on commercial activity in LatAm, from that should we interpret the EBITDA delivery in LatAm will continue to be weak in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago again. On the Vivo synergies, we have little to add to what we have already said. We think we're approaching nicely and gently the upper end of the synergy band that we set for ourselves on both the non-operating and operating synergies. Remember that the top line number was about 4.4.</p>
          <p>The strictly operational synergies are proceeding nicely and I think we should be able to provide some detailed &#x2013; some detailed numbers about them sometime in the first half of this year, because the restructuring is not fully complete, and we are worried that some numbers might compromise our position in some of those areas.</p>
          <p>And in terms of commercial activity, I think I have to reiterate what I just said regarding other markets. I don't feel particularly challenged in any special markets. So, the Brazil is certainly not an exception. And I think that what you're likely to see, is an acceleration of the effort of the substandard players in the market to gain share and probably not much success stories coming from them.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just briefly on Venezuela, can you refresh on your foreign exchange assumption, specifically whether you see any reason for changing from the official 5.56 exchange rate to something closer to the implied grey market, which I think is closer to eight to nine new Bolivars per euro?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on Mexico, if I strip out the &#x20AC;217 million gain on the tower sales, it looks as though Mobistar had a 17.5% service revenue margin despite losing sub share, and since Mexico is the only country where you go to market with more of a pure mobile focus, my question is, what changes specifically in the commercial mix between distribution, tariffs, brand, subsidy network to rebuild back towards your performance levels of a few years ago, or do you really need a change in asset mix in addition to potential changes in regulation?</p>

          <p>Hello, Stanley. First on Venezuela, we are accounting at the official exchange rate in the country. This situation may evolve, but at this stage we will have a better estimate or an assumption that we may share on this topic. I would maybe just add that we have also been able during 2011 to repatriate over USD 200 million from such operation, which continues to perform quite nicely.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Stanley, Santiago again. Three quick comments. Mexico is a complex place because competition is established and not relative to all other markets in the region. We're working on two main fronts; one is to make it service &#x2013; make a healthier customer base service. So, we are trying to be more demanding on what we require of our commercial distributors. Our distribution sits in one channel. We're working on and making progress in. This is likely to provide a healthier customer base where churn is easier to manage.</p>
          <p>Is the &#x2013; are we satisfied with the margins? We are certainly not, and we are working towards expanding those margins on the right way, which is not by increasing activity, but by increasing the stickiness of our own customers.</p>
          <p>The numbers of Q4 &#x2013; there are a number of things, not all of them are easy to disentangle, but you might also look at some negative effects, which are substantial relative to the size of the order generated in the quarter to the total of 23 million. So, I don't want to play with the numbers saying this is recurrent and not recurrent too much, let's say &#x2013; that may add to the apparently lowish number that we have published.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Two questions please; firstly, in the U.K. on slide 38, you show quite a large optimization impact depressing U.K. mobile revenues. Given how many customers are on integrated tariffs now, I wondered whether you could sort of explain in practical terms how customers are optimizing their usage in order to sort of spend less at this point.</p>
          <p>And then the second question on Brazilian fixed line, it does look as though if we adjust the reported numbers for the TVA acquisition in Q2, revenue trends have deteriorated somewhat in the last couple of quarters underpinned by what looks like worsening lines and rather weak pay TV adds. Just wonder whether you could help us sort of understand the outlook for the Brazilian fixed line business in 2012, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking you first question on the U.K. market and trying to split up, the mobile revenue deceleration, reduction of basically 3.7 percentage points in the quarter. I would say 20% of this reduction namely 0.8 percentage points are coming from lower customer base growth in &#x2013; both in pre-pay and in post-pay and precisely we are trying to address being much more relevant in the market. So, part of the deceleration is because we have less customers, because we've been less active in the market.</p>
          <p>And 80% of the remainder is due to lower incoming and out of bundle traffic. We are suffering from the consequences of a soft economy, of course, and lower consumer sentiment. And on that side, the consumers have been much more; I would say they are optimizing much more of their bundles. So, it's roughly 20% coming from a lower base, both in prepaid and postpaid and 80% coming of out of bundles. That's why in the quarter where we have seen a high number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (80:32) and contract re-signs, we need to be <mark type="inaudible" /> (80:35) certain, assured that we are focusing our retention efforts precisely to address that. So, that's the explanation of the split out of this 3.7 reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jerry, Santiago again. On Brazilian fixed line, I think I would summarize the situation as follows. You have a decline in revenue trend from voice fixed services. This is unlikely to be stopped, and it is falling a bit faster than broadband adoption, and increases in penetration are rising. So, the net effect is either small negative or a small positive, depending on the quarter. And because we are by far the largest player, we are likely to continue suffering some erosion from traditional fixed lines.</p>
          <p>What I think the good news are, is number one, that the total size of the pie is increasing. If you have &#x2013; if you take a couple of quarters' view, you will see that because the market is expanding and underlying incomes are rising, the overall value of the market is actually rising, and eventually we think this is the trend that is going to prevail.</p>
          <p>On TBR and acquisitions of TVA last year, those are events that happened in specific times, but we would not ascribe a lot of interest to them because they depend a lot on tactical reasons of deployment here and there. You know because we have published data when we published the Telef&#xF3;nica Brazil numbers that we're trying to expand seriously on the fixed &#x2013; I'm sorry, on the fiber to the home activity that we had, a lot of homes passed, and we are now shifting the trend and the attention towards homes connected. This is not an easy thing, but we think we're uniquely positioned, along with our cable deployment, to get the best value out of those large investments that I already have made, but not quite developed yet.</p>

And then we will start our conversations with creditors of the total debt of Telco &#x20AC;2.1 billion is bank debt, and that's the one that will need to be refinanced by mid-year.</p>
          <p>The reduction in the dividend of Telecom Italia, clearly reduces the income for Telco, but still provides the ability to refinance that debt at what we think are going to be the new market conditions for it. We will start negotiations with financing entities very early on this refinancing and obviously, we will be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (84:20) with the result of it. Free cash flow, Telco becomes &#x2013; continues to be free cash flow positive, even after this dividend cut.</p>

          <p>Yes, Luigi, and in terms of the possibility of the Brazilians introducing ULL, well, it's anybody's guess. The Brazilian authorities and the government entity, regulatory agency, Anatel, are moving very fast in very different directions. I'm sure that not all of them can be brought to a conclusion this year. And ULL is probably too late; if you ask my own personal opinion, it's probably too late in arrival, because the Brazilian the S&#xE3;o Paulo market is already well-developed, and well-served. It is unlikely that opening up the ULL, which is a European invention of dubious consequences and benefit, will be successful there, because most of the broadband is already developed on either cable or fiber grounds, and since 2008, VDSL is also present.</p>
          <p>So to be plain and straight, I don't know what the outcome will be. We do not think as a company that ULL is such a great regulatory piece, but if it comes, a little hard to adopt. Let's also not forget that we are talking of the S&#xE3;o Paulo market, but that we have just entered selectively the non-S&#xE3;o Paulo market, which is 60% of Brazilian GDP. We can access that, not by ULL, but also by fixed wireless telephony, and this is a great promisingly fast growth area.</p>
          <p>So whether or not it comes, I think it's going to have very minimal consequences because number one, most of the birds will have been taken by other cable or fiber or the existing VDSL, or we will be successful or we will possibly deploy outside of S&#xE3;o Paulo, which is exactly what we've been doing since Q4 of last year.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a quick question, should we still consider China Unicom stake as let's say a core asset, so not to be included among something you might dispose of? Thank you.</p>

          <p>We are extremely happy with our participation in China Unicom the potential of China Unicom is tremendous. The potential of the collaboration between Telef&#xF3;nica and China Unicom is tremendous. One thing you &#x2013; just to have in mind that we work together very closely on many fronts, all the fronts, all the value chain and together we have nearly 700 million customers, which is a big thing, the collaboration between China Unicom and Telef&#xF3;nica is increasing every time, and we see a lot of potential in synergies and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (87:03) together with China Unicom.</p>
          <p>So I think both of us, Telef&#xF3;nica is very happy with the participation we have in China Unicom and China Unicom is very happy with the participation they have in TEF. And the only thing we see ahead is a much stronger relationship between the two companies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I had two questions, please? The first one is just regarding your dividend policies from Telef&#xF3;nica Brazil, and it strikes me that that company is fairly under-levered at the moment, the dividend you approved for year-end was only about 70% of underlying free cash flow. I was wondering, is there new reason why you're not gearing that company up further to repatriate more cash. I mean, are you potentially thinking about doing more M&amp;A from that company, is that the reason why you're keeping the balance sheet under-levered?</p>
          <p>And, the second question I had, was regarding O2 U.K., I mean, there has obviously been quite a lot of optimizing going on within the customer base at the moment. The commercial costs you are undertaking though, is that a one-off really for this quarter, or do you see that now as a kind of increased level of commercial costs over maybe the next 12 months to reaccelerate revenue growth within that business? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, James, this is Angel. With respect to the question that you had on Brazil to over leverage that company to receive a divided would potentially not be the most efficient financial measure for the group given the financial cost that you have for that in Brazil.</p>
          <p>And in any case, we, through the group cash management mechanisms have all the benefit of that cash, which is sitting in Brazil. Obviously, we evaluate continuously, which are the ways to have the most efficient capital structure taking into account not only Telef&#xF3;nica corporate balance sheet, but also Telef&#xF3;nica do Brasil balance sheet.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm taking your question on the U.K. commercial cost. I don't think you should consider it's going to be just for the last quarter. It's going to keep going into this year, so in the last quarter we'll have retention cost and this quarter we are having as well commercial efforts, so we want to get traction on the market, and we want to be relevant on the market and therefore, you should expect from us to keep investing on the commercial side.</p>
