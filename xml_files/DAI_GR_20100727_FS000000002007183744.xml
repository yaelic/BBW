        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you to our second quarter presentation. We are happy to have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche, the CFO, Bodo Uebber, and the head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler.</p>
          <p>In order to give you maximum time for your questions, Dr. Zetsche will begin with a short introduction, directly followed by Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Dieter Zetsche.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Muhlbayer. Gentlemen, welcome to our second quarter conference call. You may have expected that our second quarter numbers would be good, and in fact, they are.  Earlier this year, we promised that Daimler would emerge from the crisis generating a lot of talk. Now we are delivering results.  Sales, revenue, and EBIT are all up.  Year-over-year revenue increased by 28%.  We've posted EBIT of &#x20AC;2.1 billion, and net profit was &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow is also developing very positively despite ongoing investments in future technologies and markets.  Accordingly, Daimler's strong industrial net liquidity position further improved.</p>
          <p>Several positive developments contributed to these results.  Let me name just a few.  Unit sales were up by double digit rates in all of our divisions.  Our model mix has improved significantly.  Our industrial cash flow was very strong.  The same goes for our pricing.  Efficiency gains and cost reductions are proving to be sustainable, and we're making substantial progress in terms of improving our regional footprint and building forward-looking corporations.  Those are the headlines.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look, starting with our passenger cars division.  Mercedes-Benz Cars posted EBIT of &#x20AC;1.4 billion in the second quarter.  Return on sales was 9.8%.  In other words, this is already very close to our financial target of 10%.  And with our almost-complete renewal of our product portfolio in the coming years, we're confident to post those 10% on a sustainable basis from the end of 2012 onwards.</p>
          <p>Now, what are the reasons for success in the second quarter of 2010?  First and foremost, our products are in great demand.  Our E-Class sales nearly doubled with the introduction of the new model family.  Across all models from April to June, unit sales increased by 19%. In fact, last month was our best June ever.</p>
          <p>A key sales driver was China.  In the second quarter, we tripled our sales there compared to the same period in 2009.  At the same time, let me emphasize that, as clearly as the importance of the Chinese market is growing, we are not putting all our eggs into the Chinese basket.  In fact, we'll maintain a regionally balanced sales structure.  In the U.S., for example, we increased our vehicle sales by 16%, and of course, we won't lose sight of our home market.  Granted, the German market was weak in the second quarter, one might add, as expected.  Still, Mercedes-Benz managed to increase its market share significantly.</p>
          <p>Now, what is the situation in our commercial vehicle business? Daimler Trucks achieved an EBIT of &#x20AC;300 million in the second quarter and a return on sales of 5.1%.  Sales rose by 55%, mainly driven by growth in Latin America, Indonesia, the U.S., and parts of Europe.  However, the absolute volume in the drier markets still remained on a low level.</p>
          <p>Our structured measures clearly supported the success of our Trucks division.  Our Global Excellence strategy works.  Our new generation of heavy-duty engines improves our commonality rates. And, with the repositioning of Fuso and Daimler Trucks North America, we've reduced breakeven further.</p>
          <p>On the product side, our pipeline is fully loaded.  In 2010 alone, we have lots of new products including the launches of the all-new Freightliner Coronado, Fuso Super Great, and Fighter.  In general, our performance in the second quarter confirms the potential that Daimler Trucks can deliver in a better market environment.</p>
          <p>Next is Mercedes-Benz Vans, which showed a positive earnings performance as well.  EBIT rose to &#x20AC;127 million in the second quarter.  Return on sales was 6.4%.  Unit sales went up by 42%, partly because of our new sales organization in U.S., and partly because of the start of delivery to the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses posted EBIT of &#x20AC;79 million in the second quarter despite a less favorable model mix.  Return on sales rose to 6.6%.  The main sales driver was Latin America.  European sales were up slightly.</p>
          <p>In line with a higher sales volume of our automotive divisions, business volume at Daimler Financial Services is picking up as well.  Earnings increased to &#x20AC;171 million.  This increase was primarily due to the lower cost of risk and higher interest margins.  In general, and throughout the financial crisis, risk management at Financial Services proved to be highly effective.</p>
          <p>Looking at the earnings development at the group level, we can state an ongoing improvement over the last quarters.  Our strategy is paying off.</p>
          <p>Now let's get to the outlook. What do we expect for the second half of the year? At this point, most available indicators suggest that the upswing of the world economy will continue.  That's why we expect global demand for passenger cars to grow by approximately 8% in 2010. In Western Europe, the end of scrappage schemes will dampen demand, but that will mostly be on the low end of the volume market.  In the U.S., the market for passenger cars should recover gradually, although from a low level. Demand for cars in China and India should continue to grow substantially this year.</p>
          <p>Based on these assumptions, we expect passenger car sales of the Mercedes-Benz brand to increase by a double-digit rate in the full year of 2010.  Sales will be supported by our very competitive model range. Worldwide demand for commercial vehicles should increase as well.  Market volume in Europe is expected to be between 5 and 10% above the level of 2009, and the other major regions will show double-digit growth.  Against this background, Daimler Trucks anticipates higher unit sales in 2010, with Indonesia, U.S., Brazil, and Europe as main drivers.</p>
          <p>What's more, we will launch new models and engines toward the end of the year, including, for example, the Mercedes-Benz Atego and Axor face lifts. The engines coming out of our new heavy-duty engine generation will boost demand for our trucks in the U.S., and in Asia, we will introduce the all-new light-duty Canter. Incoming orders significantly picked up in the second quarter and exceed current sales.  Our book-to-bill ratio is developing very positively.</p>
          <p>What does all of this mean for our earnings in 2010?  On the strength of our recent performance, we raised our EBIT guidance for the Daimler Group from its ongoing business to &#x20AC;6 billion.  At Mercedes-Benz Cars, results should benefit from continued high unit sales and improved margins.  That's why we target EBIT of &#x20AC;4 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks will post better results in the second half of the year than in the first.  For the full year, we want to achieve EBIT of approximately &#x20AC;1 billion, thanks to our successful repositioning in North America and Asia, high order backlog, and very competitive products.  Mercedes-Benz Vans will generate earnings of approximately &#x20AC;350 million, due to increased sales and efficiency enhancement. At Daimler Buses, we anticipate significantly positive EBIT in the magnitude of the prior year.  And for Daimler Financial Services, we're expecting EBIT from ongoing business of approximately &#x20AC;800 million.  Cost of risk should continue to be moderate, and efficiency enhancement actions will have a positive effect.</p>
          <p>Of course, this updated outlook assumes that automotive markets will continue to be stable and remaining risks will not materialize.  This may not be the only scenario, but we are convinced it is by far the most likely.  And even if external conditions were to worsen, we will still have reasons to be confident about our future. We have a balanced product portfolio and a balanced regional footprint.  We significantly reduced breakeven levels.  We have an efficient working capital and cost management.  We've improved global material price and risk management. And, we have very good access to global capital markets.</p>
          <p>To conclude with, our starting base is rock solid, and we've defined clear goals for the future.  We want to bring the operating performance of each division to benchmark level, and the results of the first half year 2010 confirm that we are well on track.</p>
          <p>And now, Bodo Uebber, Andreas Renschler, and I will be happy to answer your questions.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Dieter Zetsche.  Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now.  I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization before asking your question.  Two practical points. Firstly, please avoid using mobile phones, and secondly, please ask your question in English.  Before we start the session, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First in line is Jochen Gehrke [Deutsche Bank].  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  Three questions, if I may.  First of all, could you &#x2013;  Mr. Uebber, could you just give us a guidance for CapEx, what we should expect now for the second half? Are you going to spend as much as your initial guidance now indicates, or should we go for a lower CapEx number than what you were originally envisaging?</p>
          <p>Then secondly, on your financial income, you're obviously showing a very strong increase in net liquidity. This is yet to show a strong positive impact on the financial result. Could you just share your thoughts there? I see the pension impact, but even net of that, seems that your more expensive bonds from earlier last year are still painful. What's your view on that?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, for Dr. Zetsche. Obviously at the beginning of this year, you had a much more cautious view on the assessment of the current fiscal year, and the delta, where we are now, just a couple of months thereafter, to your assessment earlier in the year, is very significant.  I think it would be interesting to see, what were the elements that surprised you so massively on the upside? As I understand that volume cannot be the only driver. Was this mix, was this pricing, or is this really the increasing reliance on China?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, thank you for your questions. First, let me comment. You asked for CapEx, let me first tell you R&amp;D.  I do think our run-rate there is in line, but we have already told you, in the beginning of the year, with a two years' assumptions, where we roughly said 50/50 in 2011 and '12 for your two years' expectations.  The run-rate you have seen was total R&amp;D expenditures which includes the capitalized R&amp;D cost on the 1.2 billion level. That should go further with the quarters as we will invest in what we have also &#x2013; that we have told about you.</p>
          <p>About the content in CapEx, we are little bit backloaded, so to say, for the second half.  You have to keep in mind that we do, for example, we have the now &#x2013; successfully the agreement on the Foton joint venture with NDRC in mids of July &#x2013; one week ago.  That will of course will impact for example Q3 and Q4.  So we are in line with our guidance on the CapEx side, what we have given also on February. But I do &#x2013; of course, we try to be, as we said before as disciplined as possible, so there might be an opportunity that become lower in &#x2013; as compared to the number which we have given you in the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>From a financial result point of view, of course the pension expense we have in that basket of course will stay as it is for the next quarters, because it's already defined in the beginning of the year.  For the interest &#x2013; pure interest results, from net liquidity and cash point of view, we have some impact on derivatives, which of course are negative when the interest level is going down. This impact is included also in the second quarter. So if the current interest rates, of course, on the one hand, let's make the assumption that it's &#x2013; will be constant, we will have a positive impact.  Positive, so to say, means the interest expense will go down in the Q3 and Q4 number. And I said it before, sometime in 2011, we might change to the position of a positive interest result, but that would be subject to a discussion for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your third question, first of all, I think it's very consistent between all economists that they are increasing their forecast for the worldwide GDP development almost on a monthly basis.  The same applies to a number of regions, including Germany, for instance.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the total market expectation has been increased by all participants &#x2013; observers and participants on a consistent basis throughout the industry as well. And in consequence, we have increased our volume expectation significantly, not mainly driven by China, but by the combination of basically all markets. China is one element of that.  Their &#x2013; the magnitude of sales volume increases coming from China, to the total increase, I would consider something in the magnitude of 20%, something like that, 20, 30%.</p>
          <p>But volume, as rightfully already stated, is just one element, an important element of course.  The other one is mix. We see a very positive development on mix. So there &#x2013; highest increases are with S-Classes, with E-Classes, there are with SUVs, and these are certainly the ones with the best sales contributions.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, while those two indicators are developing very positively, we are, and I think to quite some extent, against market trends, able in realizing better price execution, reducing discount rates beyond our own objectives.</p>
          <p>And if you combine all three elements, you have the main reason for the significant improvements in profitability and in our forecast.  One element goes along with it. As you all know, we have accomplished significant cost reductions last year.  We always said that our objective is to maintain these new cost levels, but now to maintain them while volume is rebounding significantly is perhaps even more than someone could have expected, and that is obviously then the missing part to the total picture which has such a positive development.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our next question is Kristina Church.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes. It's Kristina Church from Barclays Capital.  I've got a couple of questions.  Firstly, on pricing. I was just wanting to get a bit of an update from you on your outlook for &#x2013; you obviously had very strong pricing in the first half of the year. Just wanted to see what you expect for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And then more specifically, on pricing in China, I know there's been press reports recently about there being pricing pressure at the mass end of the market. I was just wondering whether you had any worries or were seeing any signs of that spreading to the luxury end of the market, or whether the pricing in China is still remaining extremely firm?</p>
          <p>Then, second question is on cash flow. I know you've talked about CapEx already, but I was just wondering &#x2013; at the Q1 results, you did give some indication that you would have significantly positive cash flow for the full year as a whole, but that working capital would be negative.  Can you again give any further update on that and what we should expect in the second half, based on what we've seen. Obviously with very positive payables in the first half of the year, will we expect some of that to pull back in the second half, or should we still expect a very positive cash flow? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as pricing is concerned, our objective is obviously to at least maintain the pricing levels we have accomplished.  Meanwhile, our mid-term objective is to further reduce the discount levels.  As I said before, this is not necessarily in line with the total market developments.  Among our peers, we did see different behavior of more aggressive or less aggressive actions as far as pricing is concerned in the market.</p>
          <p>China, in some segments, we have seen, by especially one competitor on the premium side, pretty aggressive pricing actions in the sense of lowering prices.  That is not our objective and our strategy. We will not fight for the last unit to be sold there.  And on that basis, objective is insofar our expectation is that we can maintain our price level in China as well, once again, acknowledging some pressures in the marketplace, as you rightfully mentioned.</p>
          <p>Working capital, Bodo certainly will add.  I would just make one comment that, given the structure between our supply side and our downstream side, a increase of our revenues tends to give us somewhat better relation between their &#x2013; between our supply and our distributor credit situation. And therefore, we basically add working capital &#x2013; no, we reduce our working capital based on growing revenues.  But that's only one effect.  And our inventories of course is another important element.  There again, when your &#x2013; or, not again. There, when your revenues are growing and you have the same days of supply, obviously you have an increased need for working capital. But altogether, at least in the first half, we have managed that total balance very positively, and we see good chances to stay positive in this regard throughout the year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Dieter explained many things of the equation.  So, I don't want to give you our half year cash flow guidance.  We told you in the first quarter that we will be significantly positive with the free cash flow industrial in the three-digit numbers.  I don't think we have to raise the bar right now.  We are at 2.8 billion roughly now for the half year, and Dieter said, okay, there are some elements in where we have, for example, accounts payable financing our growth, in &#x2013; of course, and that we have to keep in mind, looking further in Q3 and Q4. We have also to keep in mind that we have to provide for some growth in the first quarter of 2011 with our inventories for example, for China, for the U.S., but of course also for maybe some model changes &#x2013; changeovers which we have in 2011.</p>
          <p>So, keeping that in mind, I expect a very good free cash flow industrial better than we had expected.  And as I said before, first quarter we said a high three-digit number. I do think that could be at the end of the day a far higher number than this, in the billion area.  So, it be up far more than the 1 billion free cash flow.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question we take from Arndt Ellinghorst please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot, and good afternoon.  It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse.  I have a bit more strategic first question.  I think in all our discussions with your investor base, it becomes very clear that your capital goods related businesses are really doing well.  They deserve evaluations similar to Volvo and so on, you know all the arguments.  And it seems that the car business is mistrusted to a large degree.  People just don't believe that there's better sustainability in the profit generation from Mercedes. I know you stressed that this will change after you de-merged with Chrysler, then we went into the crisis, obviously things went very bad and everything.</p>
          <p>Now, where you stand now, what confidence do you have that your car business can really run on this 8 to 10% profitability window roughly, and that we're not getting major negative surprises in the future?  Is that your cost base, is that the new regional setup really? But just give us some color if you may.</p>
          <p>And the second question just quickly, a bit more technical, please update us on your current net dollar exposure and pound exposure, and to what degree you're hedged for this year and for next?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question.  When I look at the last five years, I think in 2005, we were in a difficult situation with the Mercedes Car business.  Low profitability, significant costs on the quality side, and number of other issues, smart and so on.  We addressed all of them.  We had a major program, CORE, as you know, which delivered significant results. We addressed the quality side to the extent that we are now basically leading in most markets in this regard, far ahead of our peers, far ahead of volume makers who claim to produce good quality.  Same is true for reliability, or appeal, all these third-party indicators you can see.</p>
          <p>In the past, we never were famous for customer satisfaction. We have started a major program in this regard called CSI Number 1.  Meanwhile, basically in all markets, we have on the sales side and the service side, leading positions as far as customer satisfaction is concerned for the first time in the 125-year history of this company.</p>
          <p>We significantly, through CORE, as I said before, have improved our cost basis, and we are in most areas at benchmark levels compared to our peers. And those are basics of the business, which I don't see any area where we would be disadvantaged against our main competitors. To the opposite, at most, we are in a leading position.</p>
          <p>Now comes the most important part, which is product and brand.  We &#x2013; especially on the brand side, especially in Germany mainly and little bit beyond, have shown some horizontal movements or even worse for some period of time.  This has changed dramatically. In areas like China or the U.S., we always were by far the strongest brand anyway, but we are coming back big time in Germany and other countries here in Europe as well, based on great product, based on a consistent and more and more emotional styling, and based on a very competitive C02 situation, different from the past.  So basically, all of the main parameters of the business are going to the right direction, in many cases benchmark.</p>
          <p>And as far as our profit track record is concerned, we had a consistent development except for the crisis, which has cost us two or three quarters, where we showed a miserable performance. That is true.  I don't think it was initiated internally, but perhaps we could have shown less impact from what was happening externally.</p>
          <p>But other than these three quarters, I think we are clearly delivering on what we said at beginning we wanted to go for 10%. We now said we will be there latest by the second half of 2012. Second quarter this year, we are obviously very close to this level, and I have no doubt whatsoever that, with this brand, with this product line-up, with this operational system, we are the best in class, and we will consistently deliver on these levels, as long as the environment is somewhat allowing such kind of a performance and not in major crisis mode.</p>

          <p>And if I may just add an additional question here.  In China, you indicated that next year, profitability, just from the margin perspective, Mercedes might experience a slight dip or a stable margin at the level we've seen this year.  Would that still be your assessment, where you stand right now?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.  We said that next year, we have a number of significant product renewals which will have some impact. Of course, our objective is consistency and continuity in our profit development.  And so of course, we have now a new yardstick to measure 2011, which is 2010.  And that's where we will try to develop from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I do think there was a second question, I do think, to the currency exposure in 2010 and '11 hedge position.  We have an exposure of &#x2013; in the U.S. dollar of 13 billion roughly now in 2010. Of course as we have more sales volume in the U.S., more sales volume in China which we are adding up, you know this, others might not do it, but we are doing it because with respect to the U.S. dollar, of course the exposure is growing, but on the other hand we are doing good profit in these two countries.</p>
          <p>We are, from a hedging point of view, it was 90% in 2010, which is roughly hedged, so to say. Of course with the first year &#x2013; first half year's 100%. We are in 2011 with 60% in the U.S. dollars so we use the opportunity when the dollar was at 1.22, 1.23, 1.21, to do some further hedging. Which we, as we said always, we do a combination of forwards, collars, and options, which was a good decision in 2009, because we got an impact on the lower &#x2013; no, on the 1.22 and 1.23 area from the U.S. dollar, in 2011, we are roughly with 60%.  And for the pound we are at more or less the same ratios.  So it's also 90 and 60% roughly.</p>

          <p>So the next question we take from John Buckland [MAN Securities].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Thank you. When you talk about China and your dependent, you say you're not putting all your eggs in one basket.  But I think there is a big question mark in people's minds about what is the level of profitability.  I mean, how close to &#x20AC;1 billion have you made there, this &#x2013; or expect to make there this year?</p>
          <p>On the cash flow, I think that this cash flow includes the changes in other operating assets and liabilities which seems to have a big change in the second quarter. It was minus 10 in this first quarter, plus 901 in the second quarter industrial business.  I mean, I just wonder what's going on there, and whether that's included in your guidance, and whether there's going to be a big positive effect on these, what could be non &#x2013; considered non-operating cash flow benefits?</p>
          <p>And then, on the &#x2013; when you talk &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; it's easy to understand, when you, looking about sustainability of margin from 2012 onwards.  I mean what &#x2013; how far down, between now and the end of 2012, would the Mercedes margin go? I mean, is &#x2013; are we, Arndt asked, and said you were in that corridor of 8 to 10%. I mean is that &#x2013; will it stay within that corridor, or could it be going down below 8% in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with your last question, certainly you have seasonality between the quarters, where, for instance, the last quarter typically is affected by some one-time spendings, and you have these kind of effects.  As I said before, of course our objective is to have as much continuity on the return on sales side as possible.  We have committed ourselves to the 10% starting end of 2012.  The earlier we can get there and the more stable we can come close to that point, of course that's a direction we try to accomplish.</p>
          <p>We have so many external parameters. Take, for instance, exchange rates. That is very difficult to say now, or it's impossible that we would be anytime below 8%.  Certainly, our running rate performance at this point of time is 8-plus, there &#x2013; and under normal conditions, I would not expect fluctuations beyond that low end of the corridor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, to your question on the cash flow, of course these are related to development of provisions, provisions that, as we have of course in some areas like warranty and goodwill for example, but also provisions related to, for example, overtime, for example is in here and fluctuates through the quarter.  Therefore, of course, it has an EBIT impact at the end of the day, and when you move over from the EBIT to the cash flow, you're eliminating of course the impact on non-cash provisioning, and this non-cash provisioning you come to the cash flow. So, within the cash flow, there you could say, there is no impact of course from the provisioning at the end of the day.  It's pure, let's say, effects of cash development.</p>
          <p>The cash flow is such, from my point of view, was a very strong one in the second quarter, due to the fact that we had of course a strong EBIT on the one hand, and eliminating these impacts here from the provisions is even a little bit stronger than the EBIT development, then we're adding CapEx and other stuff. And working capital in the second quarter was better than we expected, due to better inventory development. And that comes up then, with a, I would say, very strong cash flow in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you &#x2013; just to come that point, then are you saying that that 900 million of positive in the industrial business cash flow, is an &#x2013; somewhere in the P&amp;L, there's an extra 900 million of costs which weren't there in the second &#x2013; in the first quarter? Because the figure was minus 10 in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not all of that.  Some &#x2013; as I said before, are just accruing for some quarterly developments, as I said before, for example, overtime, much more overtime what we have, where we have to accrue for this kind of cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Right. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from this point of view also, it's &#x2013; let's say the pure number is &#x2013;  the performance, let's say, is somewhat better than the number, in the cash flow area for example, compared to EBIT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And will you tell us something about China? And also, I wondered when you talk about one competitor in China taking action to reduce price, is that a company that's been there a long time and perhaps hasn't got the same real premium status in that market that perhaps it has in other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly, I do not want to comment on competitors in the first place, and be much more specific, but directionally, no, to your assumption.</p>
          <p>China, we don't give regional results, and we don't want to start that.  But in the past, obviously with lower volumes, we had already very strong profitability in China, better than many competitors with much higher volume numbers in this market.  But of course, we have a very strong volume development, and our profits go not necessarily proportionally, but very much along with these volumes.  So, it is an important market, but it's not a market where, as I said before, all of our eggs would be in one basket.  We certainly could deal with reduction of the growth pace in China as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, when you talk about balance, you feel as though you're balanced from a profit standpoint as well as a sales standpoint, do you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so. Even though we have huge growth rates in China, by today, the absolute volume still is considerably smaller than North America or Europe.  Obviously this might change over time.  But that is the current situation, and therefore, we are definitely very balanced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We take the next question from Daniel Schwarz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank.  Thank you. Regarding the &#x2013; again, the net cash position. Bodo Uebber mentioned that the free cash flow development is also much better than expected, while your internal expectations. Do you feel that you're &#x2013; or do you think your balance sheet is already now significantly underleveraged, and what measures are you going to take in that regard?</p>
          <p>And the second question, the E-Class obviously still contributed significantly to the turnaround of the Mercedes margin.  Do you feel that competition increases here with the launch of the new 5 Series, or remain incentives on very low level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, first of all, I don't want to discuss now the leverage of the company.  I do think it's far too earlier.  We have a lot of volatilities in the markets, yes, we have our basic scenario where we de-lever.  But on the other hand, we have to keep in mind that we are living in a huge volatility, and therefore I do think right now it does not make sense to discuss about distributing anything, in terms of liquidity to somebody.  I do think right now we feel comfortable with our risk management and with our positions, where anything else, we will address in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The improvement of profits at Mercedes, as I said before, are driven by many elements, and as far as the product portfolio is concerned, yes, by the E-Class, but as much by the S-Class, and the SUVs are major contributors, and the other vehicles are developing the right direction as well.</p>
          <p>The S-Class, we have seen the launch of 7 Series one and a half years ago. There &#x2013; or one year. The S-Class is in its fifth year.  Last quarter, we were reporting about now, we have sold more S-Classes than BMW has sold 7 Series.  We have a positive development on the pricing side with the S-Class, and we are almost at levels of the launch of this generation five years ago.</p>
          <p>Yes, there's now the new 5 Series available, and that's of course another strong competitor for now for the E-Class.  And as much as with the7 Series, we certainly take that competitor seriously.  At the same time, we continue to see very strong sales in the E-Class.  We continue to see an improvement of our pricing in that segment, and we have no reason to expect that this will change significantly in the months to come.</p>
          <p>In this case, there difference in the renewal between the BMW and our line is only less than two years.  So our &#x2013; just from the newness point of view, our relative position is even better than what the S-Class versus the 7-Series.  So we take them serious, but we are not concerned that we could not continue the strong performance of the E-Class.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon.  Horst Schneider here from HSBC.  I got three questions, if I may.  The first one is, in general, the remark in your guidance. You say it's all provided that automotive markets remain stable also in H2 2010.  So my question is, in which markets you might see here the biggest risks in H2?  Is that Europe, U.S., or China? And with regard to China, I would be interested, what is the order intake situation? Because I think the Chinese market will cool down somewhat in H2. Do you see already some signals in the order intakes that it is also happening in the premium car segment?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is, with regard to your guidance, when I remember to the Chinese &#x2013; the China Capital Markets Day, you have shown here &#x2013; you have shown a chart which shows that the margin goes up in 2010 at Mercedes-Benz Cars, then it goes slightly down in '011, or certainly it remains stable.  And then you go up from '012 to '013, and now we have got a situation that you already in Q2, at your target margin in 2013.  So, my question is, is now the long-term guidance that you provided for 2013, would you consider that as cautious, or still as a fair realistic guidance?</p>
          <p>And the third question, just a simple one, maybe I have not got that in your comments that you made to Arndt.  Are you now expecting also in H2 a positive currency effect, or was this just a one-off situation in Q2?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk about China first.  We see a continuation of the strong demand for our product in China.  We have, independent of the total market development, a situation that we are right now are in the launch mode of the new E-Class being produced in China with an extended wheelbase.  And that of course is a major incremental boost to our competitiveness in this market, because that's the core of our business, and something where we were, if you want, lagging behind the two direct competitors.  Now we have the newest and best product in that segment as well.  And therefore, we expect the second half to develop as strong as the first half, even if the markets would reduce its growth pattern a little bit.  And we do not expect a major change in the overall climate in China going forward, even though any purchase index might change by a digits one month or the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that means H2 sales in China will be higher than in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said, I do not expect a reduction of our pace there.  It might be that they're close.  Dynamic is coming down a little bit, but on the other hand, as I said, our product offering is becoming stronger, and both elements should be balanced.</p>
          <p>The guidance, we have given you our indications few weeks ago.  We were talking about a three-year perspective. I don't think it makes sense to discuss that on a monthly basis.  And therefore, I would like to leave it with what we said in China at that point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst, to your question of the U.S. dollar, no, I don't want to now to comment on third quarter last year to now expected third quarter 2010 in terms of the exchange rate.  Main message is, right now, if we stay at the current levels, of course we would not see, let's say, not a deterioration, but also not a favorable development in Q3 &#x2013; Q4 compared to second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, again, my first question.  In which market do you see now the biggest risk with regard to H2? Or is there no risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean, there is no risk in business in general.  The third quarter seems to be pretty much safeguarded by now, and especially given the situation of the plants during the summer break, in some of our plants, the defining factor now is availability of product and not the market for the third quarter.  And from today's perspective, very much the same applies to the fourth quarter.  Now once again, I don't know if the sky will come down in September, but there are no indications whatsoever.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, everybody.  Just two questions from my side.  First one is, again on currency. I'm sorry to come back to this. But Mr. Uebber, you said the net dollar long is $13 billion at the present time.  We've obviously seen something like a 15% currency move since the end of last year.  So, simplistically, there should be something like a $2 billion operating profit impact at some point if this exchange rate lasts as your hedges roll off. Could you just help us understand, because you said in response I think to Horst's question that there would not be either really a positive or a negative currency impact in Q3, I think Q4 as well.  When do we see the positive currency effects?  If this exchange rate holds, will we see very significant currency effects in 2011?  That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly turning to Trucks, I don't know if Mr. Renschler could help us with this. The 1 billion profit guidance for 2011, could you just give us a feel of what's happening by region?  Are the U.S. operations going to be in profit this year?  Is Asia still in loss?  What's the big moving part for this year in Truck, please?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps, just as the base, clarify that. At the end of 2009, we have not seen the impact of the very weak dollar to its full extent because we have been hedged, and therefore of course the benefit, if you want ,of a better currency doesn't come through to the full extent either. That is the nature of hedging.  And therefore, I think statements Bodo made before were clearly founded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the confirmation.  Again, we were in a good position that we were, let's say, that we based our total hedging policy on collars adoptions partially.  So, therefore of course  we could benefit now from the development of the U.S. dollar, so to say, and locked in this positive development. In a different dollar rate of course, it would have been a different method of course. But there of course we use this opportunity.</p>
          <p>The same holds true then for 2011, we have partially collars and options and somewhat hedged in a rate, so at the end of day, the most important question is, where does the dollar get to in 2011? We have a 40% open exposure, That would be, if you would see 1.20, would be perfect. Would be, if you would see 1.50, let's say, a challenge, on top of a 50 today.  So the most important question is, where will be the dollar in the 2011 and '12? And that honestly most you cannot answer today, many, many questions to that.</p>
          <p>We do expect, as we have always said, let's say a balanced dollar/euro more towards purchasing power of parity rates.  But at the end, we have to keep in mind that a dollar in 2011 could be on a different level, positive and negatively said. And therefore of course, I can answer your question next year when we see the spot rates where they are developing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you could say that, for about 60% of our exposure next year, we can expect somewhat similar effective rates for our business as we are seeing this year, based on our actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Due to the fact that we have collars and options which are moving with us.  So therefore, the statement's also true, it would be more or less on the same level.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

Beyond the consolidation effect you could hedge, don't you believe that the current pricing level in the U.S. and in China, it helps by the current strong dollars and might become a bit weaker if the dollar is moving &#x2013; or confirming its current weakness?</p>

We have established a very rigid organization in order to watch and drive these common projects.  This is working.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jose Asumendi, RBS.  Couple of questions please. On autos, there was a sharp increase on wholesale in the second quarter. Could you maybe please just elaborate, specifically in Germany, the main drivers behind that, and if you could please comment on the fleet sales momentum?</p>
          <p>And on Trucks, could you please just confirm that the European &#x2013; in Europe, you've managed to break even at the moment, and &#x2013; in the second quarter. And in relation to the &#x2013; your North American trucks and pricing, we've seen some competitors having difficulties to introduce the new engines and the new technology, and especially passing on the higher prices onto the market.  Are you currently &#x2013; have you started already to introduce this new technology? And are you having some difficulties to pass on these higher prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I understood your question, you were concerned about the wholesale development in Germany.  First of all, wholesale and retail in Germany is for us identical, based on the structure we're having there.  Secondly, the total market development was pretty negative for the industry, with I think in the range of 30% decline.  We had a decline of about 7%, which obviously gave us significant market share gains.  So we are running at, from month-to-month different, slightly above or slightly below 10% market share, which is pretty significant for a premium brand.  We're ahead of our direct peers in our sales in Germany.  So, we do believe we have, in a more difficult market, Germany, a very good performance. That is of course partially due to the scrapping fee and the impact which this had on the volume side and not so much on our side.  Therefore we didn't see so much rise last year, and therefore not so much decline.  So that is part of the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose, to your two questions.  The first one, if we are positive in Europe? Very simple, yes.  The second part of your question was more or less pricing in United States.  Indeed, we introduced EPA '010 variants of our trucks based on SCR technology beginning of this year.  So far, we received in excess of $23,000 for our EPA '010 powered units.  The market is &#x2013; the feedback of the market is from &#x2013; for the engine very good. We have achieved a very good fuel consumption efficiency, up to 5 to 7% advantage.  So, so far, we were able to put our price up just so it's &#x2013; goes up to $9,000 to the market and we try to make no compromise there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Christopher Rauwald from Dow Jones in Frankfurt.  One quick question on the prospect of smart, please, following up on yesterday's announcement about the organizational changes. Which concrete steps are you planning in coming months to stabilize sales ahead of the launch of joint models with Renault in 2013 onwards?</p>
          <p>Will smart be profitable this year and next, and if not, in what magnitude roughly would the losses be until the cooperation with Renault starts?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question.  To the first half of your question, you mentioned one decision and action we took with our introduction of product area smart.  The objective is to put more emphasis and focus on the brand of smart and this business system again.  There &#x2013; on the other hand, this is not a business unit, and therefore, we have no reporting on the specific results of Mercedes. Smart is contributing to the overall profitability of Mercedes, but we have no split accounting for smart.</p>
          <p>The second element, which we have taken and which is the cause of normal business, if you want, is the facelift, which we are just presenting right now with a pretty good reaction so far. So we are kind of midcycle in this current generation of smart.  And we do believe that smart will become much more attractive again in the market to the customers with this facelift.</p>
          <p>We have one effect which we cannot mitigate, which is the U.S. market development altogether.  On the one hand, we had a lot of hype around smart with the early introduction in the U.S.  On the other hand, the segment altogether of subcompact cars or mini cars in the U.S. shows declines of 70, 80%, which of course affects us very much as well as all competitors.  So, we have to assume that, for the time being the volume increment from the U.S. will be relatively limited compared to one or two years ago, and that is the main reason why our numbers compare unfavorably to last year on the smart side.</p>

          <p>So, next in line is Christian Breitsprecher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon.  It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie.  I have a question, coming back to the sustainability of your cost savings. And when we look at the quarter, a year-over-year walkdown, in the first quarter, when you had a cost savings of about 700 million helping you, and in the second quarter, other cost changes were actually negative 17 million.  Now we've short time work gone and your temporary wage cuts gone, do we have to expect more negative year-over-year numbers in terms of other cost changes, or what do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, of course, a good observation, first of all, for the development.  Currently, I would say we are pretty happy with what happens in the company in terms of cost discipline, investment discipline.  So that works &#x2013; it works quite fine in the first two quarters.  We have some cost increases of course, but this is naturally the case. When you have increasing revenues and sales, you come back with more logistic costs, which is okay because there are covered by sales, so to say, and also customs for example.</p>
          <p>We have also some &#x2013; we will see of course some increase in our cost base due to the wage cut we had, which is not anymore the case since end of May, more or less, for the employees. For the board of course, one month later.  And that will lead to some cost increases, as we have always commented in the second half. In the second half of the year we said roughly, should be roughly for the half year 300 million, so per quarter, maybe 150 million which we have to work on.  And therefore, of course that what we said that we need to offset this kind of development with further measures on our excellence programs which we have across all business units.  Therefore also, the cost development in the second quarter is in line with our statement that we like to make this, what we have worked on last year, sustainable for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just add that we deliberately decided to increase some marketing spending on the cost side on purpose.  On the other hand, for instance the area where all those activities are part of, the whole G&amp;A headquarter area in a very wide sense, we maintain the 20% reduced cost level of last year exactly so far throughout 2010, which I think is a major accomplishment.  So, as Bodo said, we're very, very happy that the efficiency indicators all show that we continue where we left it last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Next is Philippe Barrier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.  I have three question. First one, just regarding the market share of Mercedes in Europe, looking at <mark type="inaudible" /> end of the June, actually the market share is slightly down, and the volume are in line with the market.  So just a question regarding these market share, due to geographic mix, or due to allocation of product between continents? But just, we're a bit surprised by the decline in the market share of Mercedes in Europe in the first six months.</p>
          <p>Second question is, regarding the guidance you make under your reconciliation. It's the only item which has not been modified in 2010, and will you still expect &#x20AC;200 million negative factor on that topic?  And just, can you explain why this item is not changed, as we got &#x20AC;81 million profit in the first half?</p>
          <p>And the last question is regarding to the impact of raw materials. Do you think that you should bear some increase in raw materials cost in second half, due to some new contract signed on steel and other product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your observation of market share is correct.  In the first of this half of this year, we have basically all the time sold at max available capacity. That of course does not exclude that we could have decided half a year earlier to add shifts or stuff like that, which of course we had no base to do, so on that timing.  But based on the basic structure of our production, we used all capacity available throughout the first six months.  There are constraints we had, where specifically affecting Europe.  And therefore, your observation is right.  At the same time, of course as well, if we are short on product, we look at contributions as well.  And there were some nice opportunities which we tried to leverage from.  So I have no concern whatsoever about our competitiveness in Europe going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, coming up to Philippe, with your two other questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, the 200 million of course is our best estimate what we have for the reconciliation item for the total year.  Of course it is &#x2013; we have of course the elimination there between the units, and that is something of course which could occur in the second half.  In that amount, that we come roughly to the minus 200, of course it could at the end lead to minus 180.  But that directionally is the case. We have also the impact on some participations here like EADS and other which we are handling in the other area. So the best estimation we can give you here in that area is the 200 million.</p>
          <p>Raw material-wise, I do think in 2010 the impact will be a minor one, or one we can handle.  So even that we have to renew some contract in the second half, but we always said, the impact in 2010 is something we &#x2013; might can offset with the, let's say, with our efforts we are doing on the material area &#x2013; on the technical side on the one hand, but on the commercial side also on the other hand.  So there is roughly &#x2013; not no impact, but it's not too huge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But does it seem that there will be some impact to expect in year 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, in 2011, you have to see on what contract as we are closing these kind of projects, but currently, I do think the last four to six weeks gave us a little bit of a &#x2013; let's say, a little bit of a reduction in this area, whatever will be then on the &#x2013; when we discuss the contracts.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Stephanie Renegar from JPMorgan.  I guess you guys didn't want to comment that much on dividends or share repurchases.  But just looking at your credit rating, I guess you are on &#x2013; still on negative outlook at both agencies, which was put in place quite awhile ago.  Just wondering, first of all, have you had any recent meetings with the agencies to discuss your going-forward outlook, and whether or not it should be taken off or even raised, given your free cash flow generation?</p>
          <p>And also, if this is one of the factors that you're taking into account when you're thinking about returning values to shareholders?  And that's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stephanie, of course, yes, we had discussed with the rating agencies regular ones, so no extraordinary ones, regular ones, which we do during one week, and you have seen the impact of course on Fitch.  Fitch has already changed from negative outlook to positive.  So therefore, of course, this development is good.</p>
          <p>I don't want to comment now on what I expect for the other rating agencies, when and what they will act.  I do think the performance of the company is, regarding the indicators, we &#x2013; which are important for the ratings, are clearly heading into the right directions from our point of view, from the company point of view. You can already see the impact on the spread side, where we are developing further in the right direction, I would say.  And therefore, we have to wait and see until we get final results from the rating agencies.  That's it. The &#x2013; your last question, I don't think you referred to anything of cash and liquidity and share buyback stuff. I said, okay, it's not the time to talk about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Couple of questions, first on your cost base. Can you quantify the expected increase in cost base that you expect, particularly the Mercedes divisions second half versus first half? I think you've already quantified part of this. You said the wage reduction going away will add about 300 million at the group level, but could you also help quantify, I think other headwinds that you talked about earlier, which are CO2-related costs, R&amp;D.  That's one question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Trucks. Am I to understand that your Truck EBIT guidance of one billion, that's based on your revised outlook for the end markets, of North America 10 to 15%, Europe 5 to 10%? The North American outlook in particular looks relatively light versus &#x2013; at least the orders that you have at the end of the second quarter, I would have thought you could be up as much as 25%. But I just want to understand, if your guidance for one billion, is that based on North America up 10 to 15% range? That's &#x2013; those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, sorry to say this, but we don't quantify now in detail CO2 costs, R&amp;D, and the other stuff. We have made some comment on our wage cuts. I do think that's it.  And due to competitive reasons, we don't want to give this further details, yeah?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And on Trucks -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so about the market development in the U.S., indeed we see there a chance to be 10 to 15%.  And the forecast we have &#x2013; or the guidance like you call it, we gave now, is based on this forecast. Of course there is a chance, but we don't see the chance now. Maybe getting in the first quarter to a little bit more and then in 2011.  But basically, to answer your question again, yes, it's based on this forecast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon.  Thanks for taking the question.  It's is one left.  This concerns &#x2013;  this is on Daimler and BMW, where we had this one article on Monday that there might be a new quality in your talks after some kind of, I don't know how you name it, stagnation or so for some time.  It sounded like there were now second stage of deeper talks.  And if this is not true, and maybe this is just due to vacation writing of some reporters, but also there were figures mentioned in the &#x2013; even if it remains on the stage of single projects, the numbers given, some 50 projects, where an example was given where you could save more than 100 million versus one single project.  This could add up to enormous amounts of savings of clearly above one billion or so.  Would you confirm that more or less that the sense of this &#x2013; that this article was principally right, and the quality is getting, in any case is getting better, or at least remains on a relatively good level?</p>

          <p>I would say, the only thing which is changing and is volatile is the media reports on our corporation.  It was never as bad as it was described, as phases, and it was never breaking all expectations on the other hand.  But as we said consistently, we are in operations in a continuous discussion and execution of opportunities we have together.  And there we had one component, a module, to the other.  And this is very beneficial to both sides.  Has been, is, and will be.  And there are single projects which you can single out and name them or not, but it's certainly, when you talk about, I don't know if this number is correct, 50 areas altogether, I don't think it's that many, but anyway.  And then you take one single project and attach a number to this one, you could not multiply the two numbers with each other.  That was &#x2013; would certainly be exaggerated, and the fact that BMW has named one of these project's B and Cs,  I guess they have not picked the least important one by talking about it.</p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm satisfied with the progress in this regard.  I was, I am, and I will be, and the only thing again which is changing is the reporting on that subject.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have one more name on my list. It's Adam Hull [WestLB].</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Three, but brief, questions.  So firstly, just China.  Could you just tell us what the Q2 euro revenue is? Obviously you got export cars, and you got some parts and license payments in the JV.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the FX, just 76 million benefit in EBIT in Q2? Now I would have thought that the Chinese benefit from the stronger renminbi should have been significantly more than that. Now is that because your hedging linked to renminbi in dollar in some form? Or is it because you're having to give some of that in local pricing?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just on the CapEx, 1.3 billion is what you did in H1, 3% of revenues. Just update us exactly, you've given some numbers, but could you give us what you're thinking now about the full year, and should we be thinking towards 4 billion as a full-year number for 2011?  Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, of course the first question, of course we don't disclose these kind of details, sorry for that.</p>
          <p>For the FX question, we have already commented that we had a pound impact.  And the pound impact was a effect which we had in 2009, because we had an over-hedged position, and we sold that in that market with good rates and had a &#x2013; had, so to say, a good guy in 2009.  Excluding this pound effect of course, the number which we have disclosed as 67 would have been of course substantially higher.</p>
          <p>The CapEx question, already answered in one of the first questions.  As we said before, we would like to be &#x2013; we said in the early beginning in February what we expect for the two years period, 2011 and '12, we also addressed the subject that we &#x2013; with high discipline, that we can lower down this number.  The second last half might be higher than the first half in 2010, due to the fact that we have to do some regional investments, especially in Trucks, with regard for example with Foton our joint venture.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just follow up? On the FX exposure, I mean the 13 billion you've given us.  I mean, maybe you could give us just some idea as to what proportion that is Chinese or renminbian, just confirm that you are?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have sometimes said, of course I've said that it's roughly, I do think 35%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said this in May, on the Divisional Day.  It's roughly 50% from the U.S., and 35% from China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on the CapEx, I mean it is, it does sound like it's still 3.5 towards 4 billion for '11 and '12, I mean that was the averaging out, that's still broadly in place?</p>
