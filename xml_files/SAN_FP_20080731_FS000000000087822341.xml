        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Sanjay. Good morning everybody. Thank you for dialing in so early. We will try to explain the results of the second quarter and the first half of 2008 which evidently have been marked by the dollar development against the euro but nevertheless are our rich in terms of results concerning performance, research and development, first achievements in external growth and finally also adaptation of our workforce to the new conditions as summarized on page 4 of our slide presentation.</p>
          <p>If you continue on page number 5, you see then first of all that total sales at a comparable basis has been growing the second quarter by 5.2% and for the first half by 2.9%, and if you compare with the other trends as pointed out on this page, you see that there is everywhere an acceleration of growth; if this is for the base business, for the pharmaceutical sales, or also for the vaccines.</p>
          <p>In Europe we continue to see minimal growth but nevertheless is little bit of a positive trend as well, and in the United States we are back to a good growth of 6.6%, which is of course largely due to the fact that in the second quarter 2008, the negative effect the out-of-patent situation of Ambien IR now has been finally leveraged and yes at the end of page you see that rest of the world which is being defined as everything outside of Europe, the United States and Australia, New Zealand and Japan has further accelerate its growth from 10.6 for the first half to 12.0% for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So overall we feel that on a comparable basis our sales performance in the second quarter has very much improved partially as anticipated because of course we have been aware of the Ambien effect. But overall the state with growth of 5.2% the business is growing nicely inline with the overall market growth of the pharmaceutical market, which currently is somewhere between 5 and 5.5%.</p>
          <p>Now onto page 6, the following page, you see where this growth comes from, as has minimal contribution from Europe which is not a surprise. We continue as we have the strongest and increasing contribution from the rest of the world part which is growing by 12% totaling nearly 180 million of our total growth, and now largely outperforming the United States as a contributor to growth but nevertheless and as mentioned before, the 6.6% from the United States we consider as a good result after four quarters of negative growth.</p>
          <p>On page 7 you see the four major elements to our performance in terms of sales. Yes, the leading five products continue to show a very strong performance, Lovenox plus 13%, Plavix plus 13%, Lantus nearly plus 29%, Taxotere nearly 14, and Aprovel close to 15%. Vaccines continue to do good; again two digit growth of more than 10%, driven mainly by two elements but not only. Menactra growing nearly 22% and the H5N1 product contract with the US government contributed 124 million to the sale free side of the first half.</p>
          <p>Our base business representing more than 4 billion of sales is behaving well on a worldwide basis. It is a business which is stable. Of course if you look more into the regional distribution of sales you see then that is group of products, which is growing nearly 6% in the rest of world, 6% in the US. And it is decreasing for reasons you are well aware of by 4% in Europe. Then on the lower right side of the part once again the contribution from the emerging markets was 11.1%, nearly 3.2 billion of sales.</p>
          <p>What are our positions in those emerging markets, more details the on page 08, as outlined before we are in the good position of being the number one pharmaceutical company in those high growth markets. Those markets contribute in 2008, 45% to the global pharmaceutical market which means a growing share but less than this part of the world contributes to the growth of our company as pointed out before which is currently at 54%.</p>
          <p>Our sales in this part of the world are to date totaling 23% of our worldwide group sales and yes they are reciting from a very well balanced portfolio of our products, the so-called base business which is representing about 46% and the top 15 products representing 54% of the total sales in the emerging markets and as many times outlined before we have allocated adequate resource to leverage those growth opportunities in the best way possible.</p>
          <p>So second quarter also had been headlined by various opportunities and taking advantages of those opportunities of external growth. On page 9, you see as summary of our strategy behind our offer for Zentiva. Evidently we are attracted by the market from a geographical point of view containing 456 million people. This is a market were we already have a strong market position with nearly 1 billion of sales growing today 11.8%.</p>
          <p>We have a perfect overlap with Zentiva in those parts of the world. You see that we have already today on the right side of the chart relatively strong positions between 4.1% and 6.7% and in combination with Zentiva those traditions would be &#x2013; will be much stronger going up to nearly 15% and perhaps most important in quantitative terms, Turkey with 70 million population with an eventual market share of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>We further see in Zentiva a good opportunity to continue to execute our strategy of a volume and a value strategy which means a volume strategy based on the affordable medicine, on affordable prices and a value strategy of course based on innovation driven by research. Of course we are ready to give you more comments on the Zentiva offer during the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The second opportunity for pharmaceuticals during the second quarter has been the acquisition of the Symbion Consumer business in Australia. This is a business which represented in 2007 as outlined on page 10, sales of &#x20AC;115 million. The company is a market leader in its segment and its segment is OTC product and nutraceuticals. We feel that we have a good opportunity first of all to further enforce our position as an OTC company in Australia. We further see synergies in the growing pharmacy business also for the prescription business and last but not least we see very, very good opportunities to expand this business coming form Australia going to the other major Asian markets such as of course China and the others in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>We have discussed many times the opportunities in Japan. You look please then to page number 11. We have tried to realize also in Japan a strategy of external growth. We have to realize that there is at least currently no attractive opportunity which made us then concentrate on our own opportunities in terms of internal growth. And we are rather content, what has been achieved so far. You see that our Japanese sales in the first quarter have been growing by nearly 22% &#x20AC;673 million and kindly remind you that this first half has been also marked by a price cut which was in average about 4% for the Pharmaceutical industry which brings our 22% even further.</p>
          <p>We are today the fastest growing company in Japan with 14% according to IMS against the market of about 3.4%. All our products are doing well. of course headlined by Plavix, and I will come back to Plavix in a couple of minutes when commenting more in detail on this product. We feel that we have also mid-term good perspectives during the first half. We have launched two new products, Clexane during April 2008, and we have made a re-launch of Lantus driven by SoloSTAR and we see very, very encouraging first resales from this.</p>
          <p>Now focusing a little bit more on the major product let me start then on page 12 please with Lantus. Lantus I said before was growing in the first half by 27% and you see that this is very strong growth on all parts of the world, Europe with 21% and the rest of the world with even 52%. In the United States, Lantus became the leading injectable inside the diabetes market. You see also that the more recent introductions of Byetta and Levemir have a more modest performance than our product, which continues to be on a linear growth curve.</p>
          <p>So this slide, as this outlined on page 13 to our ambition to make Lantus from its today position which is the number one worldwide insulin to become the number one anti-diabetic product; we believe that we are on a good way. As you see we have improved our rank in this larger market of anti-diabetic product in the United States between 2007 and 2008 within six months from the number three product to the number two product, whilst in Europe we are already number one. So, what has to be achieved is to further improve our position in the United States in order to become the number one product which we believe will be obtainable within the next let's say 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>Why, because we have good progress with SoloSTAR also in the United States as you see then on page number 14. You see that there has been an immediate effect from the introduction of SoloSTAR also on the sales of United States. We have introduced the product in the third quarter 2007 and I believe that the figures speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>Worth to be noted that we had a positive achievement yesterday in obtaining another victory in a legal battle against Novo Nordisk; you may remember that Novo Nordisk had made an appeal towards Novo's &#x2013; towards SoloSTAR from a patent point of view. This appeal has been rejected by an American court yesterday. So we feel that also from this point of view the position of SoloSTAR is more and more confirmed.</p>
          <p>Besides SoloSTAR, the second most important growth driver for the excellent development of Lantus is our achievement from newly insulinized patients as you see then on the right side of the slide. While those patients had contributed to the product before 42%, they are now contributing 52% of sales, which of course, gives also a good mid and long-term outlook for the further growth of this product.</p>
          <p>On page 15, Lovenox. The Lovenox has in this quarter and the second quarter, and the first half needs some additional explanation, as you maybe a little bit disappointed when looking to the growth for the second quarter, which is only 4.6%, but we have to be very clear. We have a strong technical effect in the lowering of sales figures coming from the heparin crisis which developed during the first half of 2008 in the United States, but also outside which led to anticipated sales in the first quarter. So the overall growth for the first half 12.9% we feel is the adequate growth because very much in line with, for example, the US prescription rate which is around 7, 8%.</p>
          <p>And if we are take the anticipated sales out for the first quarter this year, total linear growth of this product in the United States, but also outside. And I see that this is nicely outlined on the right side of the page where you see the growth of medical patients in United States. And you see that there is a linear growth pattern even with the certain acceleration during the first quarter as the chart outlines.</p>
          <p>I am sure that during the Q&amp;A, we will discuss what maybe upcoming competition for Lovenox and we are ready to do so of course. There is in the environment an important event from our point of view which is the fact that the EMEA will issue guidelines by the end of 2008 around the question of biologicals and the need for clinical trials for low molecular weight heparin applications, which we feel will give a certain additional guideline also for the further attitude of the FDA in this respect.</p>
          <p>Plavix, the second leading product of the Group. Very nicely growing with 21% in the first half as described on page number 16. There we have the reverse effect because in the sales, in the basis of the sales of Plavix we still have 2007, with the known appearance of the generic from Apotex.  If we make the same exercise as done before for Lovenox, and we take those effects out, we have again a linear growth for the two quarters between 12 and 13%, which once again is being confirmed by our ex-factory sales in the United States and outside.</p>
          <p>Worth mentioning that we have a rather unreliable situation coming from IMS; the IMS paper in the United State is giving the wrong signals. You see in IMS close to zero growth. IMS has confirmed that those figures are evidently wrong because there is a data issue for IMS mainly coming from the mail business, which has been underrepresented so we don't look too much today to the IMS figures but more to our ex-factory sales which are absolutely stable. And in the United States as you have probably heard in the report of Bristol-Myers Squibb our partner growing nicely above 12%.</p>
          <p>So growth of the product is supported by the launch of the 300 milligram tablet form, which has started in Europe, in the UK and in Germany and we will expand this launch which is an important launch especially in the environment of stenting and acute coronary syndrome, we will expand this launch to more than 20 countries by the end of the year. I have the opportunity once again to make a reference to Japan, on this page as you see, we have obtained nearly &#x20AC;75 million sales in the first half with Plavix in Japan which means that the product really is on an excellent way.</p>
          <p>We hope there is more good news to come from two major studies which &#x2013; within lifecycle management, ACTIVE-A and CURRENT. CURRENT the study of course, important also in the context of project A but I am sure we will come back to this during the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we try to give you some information on the potential of Multaq. Multaq, dronedarone as a generic name has been filed with EMEA and with the FDA in June 2008. We are targeting here a market of approximately 6 million patients and this market can be roughly segmented into those patients who have their first episode and those patient represent about 68% of those 6 million, and other patients, so-called permanent patients which means where the anti-arrhythmic situation of the heart continues despite intervention and those patients represent about a third of the 6 million.</p>
          <p>Then within both groups we have patients where the aim of the treatment is to change the rate and other patients where the aim is to change the rhythm and the rate. And as you see simply from the chart as the first group represents about 56 and the second one represents about 44. Well our strategy will aim to first attack the group of first episode patients and only in the second attempt will then target on the permanent patients. We are optimistic that we have an excellent product for doing so. We believe that this is the first real breakthrough in this indication since more than 25 years to be precise, since amiodarone.</p>
          <p>We are the first product having really delivered hearts data -- heart endpoint data in terms of cardiovascular hospitalization and that which has been reduced as you know of course by 24% and we have a product which is extremely safe compared with the other products in this market. And we go into a market segment which has a heavy burden of disease. The burden of disease cost in the United States we estimate at $16,000 per patient per year. So we are in intensive preparations of pre-marketing for this product and we estimate that the both agencies will come to a decision during 2009 and in consequence of these estimates, we prepare for launch.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, what we continue to do was in the first half of 2008 to adapt our structures to the new market conditions. We work intensively of reviewing our business models. We do this in line with our overall strategy as outlined before to polarize this market and adapt our organization into a value and into a volume segment. And we differentiate from a geographical point of view, we invest there where we see opportunity and we have reduce our investment where we see no opportunity or less opportunity and this has been outlined on the right side of the page. We do this with quite some effect. You see then that the overall head count of pharmaceutical operation in North America and Western Europe over the period January 2006 until April 2008 has been significantly reduced by approximately 4000 people and in the same period of time we have increased the head count by approximately 2000 people in the segment which is defined rest of the world.</p>
          <p>To finish, of course we have also adapted our collaboration between Marketing and Research in redefining what our future products will present in terms of the value proposition. Of course this is a mid and a long-term exercise but also firmly believed to be on a good way and Marc Cluzel will report on this to you later.</p>
          <p>So, so far on pharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical operation side, pass on to Wayne Pisano to report to you on the performance of vaccines during the first half. Wayne?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Hanspeter and good morning everyone. Q2 and the first half was an eventful quarter and half for the Vaccine division. We go to slide 20, the work done in the first half of the year has resulted in an offer to acquire Acambis, which is a biotech firm based in Cambridge, UK, with most of their operations in the East Coast of the US. This is the organization we had fruitful partnership with over the last decade and it's a logical next step in our relationship is to bring Acambis inside the Vaccine division of Sanofi Pasteur.</p>
          <p>There are multiple drivers on the value of this, foremost is the pipeline of Acambis is complementary to the pipeline of Sanofi Pasteur. They have two early stage projects, one, Clostridium difficile, is a nosocomial infection. It is the number one nosocomial infection and it affects about 500,000 &#x2013; there is 500,000 cases annually in Europe and North America. There is relatively high morbidity associated with this.</p>
          <p>The other project is an M2E which is known as a universal influenza A vaccine and this would be complementary to our seasonal trivalent vaccines and would be foremost targeted to the elderly population who need better protection. From an industrial affairs perspective, we were able to bring our expertise to the two facilities in the US to optimize them, which affects the launch of both the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine and the West Nile Virus vaccine.</p>
          <p>From an R&amp;D perspective this will add a fourth research center to the Sanofi Pasteur Research Group, clearly the Acambis group is known for their innovation and so by coupling their innovation with the development expertise of Sanofi Pasteur, we believe we can accelerate the development of products in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>We also basically will be bringing their ACAM2000, which is a smallpox vaccine, coupling that with our H5N1 business with the US government will basically strengthen our overall position in terms US government relations as well as biodefense. And finally there was a significant reduction in royalties associated with the partnership on West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis and to a lesser degree on Dengue.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 21, here we're reporting the sales for the first half of the year. And as expected the second quarter was a very strong quarter for the Vaccine division. Sales were up 17%, so overall for the first half of the year we were up 10%.</p>
          <p>Main drivers, Influenza, we had a good Southern Hemisphere season in the first half and the main growth driver was the H5N1 contract, the delivery of the vaccine in the second quarter to the US government.</p>
          <p>Menactra as Hanspeter referenced was up over 20% and our joint venture, which is not consolidated on sales, this is Sanofi Pasteur MSD, sales were up 60%, the main driver being the continued uptake of Gardasil across Western Europe.</p>
          <p>If you look at our Polio/Pertussis/Hib business, it looks rather modest, up only $4 million. However, we expect a very strong second half for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 22, the main driver of the growth of the second half will be the introduction of Pentacel in the US. Pentacel was licensed on June 20th by the FDA. It's the first five-in-one pediatric combination that combines not only diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, IPV and now hib. This is the only hib pediatric combination in the US. This has been the standard of care in Canada for the last 10 years, has a very strong track record in terms of efficacy and safety. And there is clear benefits for the patients in terms of shot reduction and from a physician's perspective it's an ideal fit to the US immunization schedule.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, this is the current US immunization schedule for pediatrics and you can see that in the primary series, which is the two, four, six months schedule with boosters given between 12 to 18 months of age. DTaP, Hib and IPV are basically the standard vaccines that are administered. So Pentacel is the ideal combination and this will allow the physicians to have the flexibility to administer Hepatitis B in the hospital at birth, which is preferred way of administering Hepatitis B in US.</p>
          <p>Going to slide 24, the product was launched actually a week and a half ago in the US. Post licensure, the Vaccines for Children program, which is the public sector program in the US that basically accounts to 60% of the volume in the US, approved the product and put it into the program. Early indications that there is strong preference for this pentavalent vaccine. In terms of the target market, this is the four dose product that basically targets 4 million birth cohorts annually. And clearly Pentacel will strengthen our leadership position in the US marketplace.</p>
          <p>Going to slide 25, this is addressing the influenza campaign for 2008, as I already mentioned we had a solid Southern Hemisphere campaign in the first half of the year. This is an unprecedented year for the industry, because the FDA and WHO have changed all three strains. That has never happened before, so it creates some variables in the manufacturing that is basically challenging everyone in the business.</p>
          <p>I'm glad to report that our production schedule is on track and on target. We expect to deliver 150 million doses or more for the Northern Hemisphere campaign. We do expect strong performance in the US. We had a very strong pre-booking season where physicians and healthcare care providers basically put a reservation in for the delivery of the vaccine.</p>
          <p>We received the license for Fluzone two weeks ago in the US. It is the first product that's been licensed this year for the Northern Hemisphere campaign and our first two lots were released by the FDA last week and we shipped product yesterday to a healthcare provider. So this is the first delivery of vaccine in the US for the industry.</p>
          <p>Going to slide to 26, I know there has been a lot of discussion and concern about potential oversupply of vaccine in the marketplace in the future. We believe that there is still significant growth opportunity in the influenza marketplace. Several things have occurred in the US to basically to take advantage of the increased capacity. First of all, the ACIP is now recommending vaccine for all 5 to 18 year olds. And so the target population in the US is in excess of 200 million people. The CDC and ACIP intend to move toward a universal recommendation where they would recommended everybody in the US to be immunized in the future.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have a number of projects in our pipeline which are innovative improvements for the influenza vaccine. We have a product that has improved in formulation which is a high-dose product, which is targeted at the elderly. The elderly do not get as good as protection as healthy adults, because their immune system basically is compromised due to age. And this product basically has shown an increased immune response compared to the standard IM products that are available. We will be filing for this product in the next several months and expect to launch it in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have an intradermal vaccine that basically has been filed in the EU and will be filed next year in the US. This is a product that will increase immune response, as well as provide convenience and reduced discomfort for patients receiving the product.</p>
          <p>Going to slide 27, we are addressing here Menactra. We had a very strong first half of the year, up almost US$15 million or over 20%. By the end of 2008 we would expect that over 50% of the 11 to 18 year olds in the US will have been immunized. Today, the recommendation is for all 11 year olds and college bound students to be immunized with Menactra. And then the age groups between 11 and 18 are called the catch-up marketplace and we have basically achieved immunizing over half of those patients by the end of this year, which means that future growth drivers for Menactra will come from other indications beside adolescents.</p>
          <p>Menactra is indicated to the 2 to10 year old, and we will be basically completing our -- actually we have competed our enrollment for a new indication for toddler. And if we can go to slide 8 (sic) [28] you'll see the opportunity for an infant toddler product. This is a two-dose product that would be administered at 9 and 12 months of age and will provide full protection by the child's first birthday. It requires fewer injections than the typical primary series vaccine, which would be three doses plus a booster. Therefore, there is significant pharmacoeconomic benefit associated with this. We've completed our Phase III enrollment and expect to file for this product in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>So on slide 29, in summary, we had a strong sales performance in the first half of the year in the Vaccine division. We have licensed Pentacel and have launched it two weeks ago. Flu production is on track and we expect a strong year in the Northern Hemisphere campaign. We will be filing in next several months for the improved formulation of Fluzone in the US and we expect another strong year for Menactra.</p>
          <p>So, thank you. And I turn it over to Marc Cluzel for an R&amp;D update.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. So since it is page 31, since it is little bit more than mid-year, I think, it's interesting to make an evaluation of our potential submissions for 2008. So as you have seen from the communiqu&#xE9;, we have already one project down which is S-1 and the press release in early July because of the failure of the flexus and it was inducing a kind of difficulty released as a product in the US for the authentication.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have also decided to stop Amibegron, in fact it was despite a strongly positive study in maintenance, but as we have already said we had a safety hepatic signal. We were not able to clear with this study this hepatic signal and we decided that in the year-on-year demand it would be very difficult to market this drug.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have two products which are ongoing to be submitted this year, so in fact it is already done, as said by Hanspeter.  And for Eplivanserin, it will happen during the fourth trimester of 2008. We have two products which are I would say delayed. One is VGF, there is another slide on VGF, so I will explain our strategy on ovarian ascites and at the same time on the other program. And for Saredutant in fact the maintenance study was not fully positive so we have to wait now for the result of adult therapy and as you will see these results will come at the termining of the year.</p>
          <p>So going back to MULTAQ, I think Hanspeter gave a lot of explanation of about that, so just three additional points. We met by biography of course and in terms in fact of clinical trial at ATHENA is within the five top clinical trials in terms of both absolute and relative reduction in mortality, so I think it's interesting to be noted. At the same we continue, we submit of course in US and Europe. But we continue to expand the registration so there is eight additional countries to be done before the end of this year. And at the same time we have a lot of very interesting data about morbid-mortality because by example hospitalization is interesting but the duration of hospitalization is also very interesting. Effect on stroke and so we have an extensive program of communication in order to better understand the product at the European Society of Cardiology but also at the H8</p>
          <p>So going for Idrabiotaparinux, you know that with Idrabiotaparinux we are the bridging strategy with idraparinux. So, one part of this bridging strategy was to compare the Idrabiotaparinux to idraparinux in the DVT study. Just for your information to remind it to you, idraparinux in DVT was better in terms of efficacy than <mark type="inaudible" /> vitamin K and also better safety profile than <mark type="inaudible" /> vitamin K.</p>
          <p>So the first slide, slide 33 is showing that in terms of efficacy and safety we are comparing on the better side versus idraparinux since it was not the primary end point we will take it with some cautious &#x2013; we will be a little bit cautious and we will look confirmation of this good result with  CASSIOPEA, which is the next study in pulmonary embolism.</p>
          <p>When you are going page 34 so it was really the true primary end point as you can see we have fully on the left side, we are fully bioequipotent with in terms of Factor Xa activities with idraparinux. And at the same -- and it was in fact at the origin the main purpose of the campaign. When you administer Avidin even after six months, you have neutralization of the Xa activity.</p>
          <p>So as I told you the Phase III program is ongoing. We have a little bit more than 50% patient enrolled for CASSIOPEA. It is a difficult study to be performed but we continue the recruitment. On atrial fibrillation, the study is already starting and it is a major study in terms of recruitment, so the study is going very well &#x2013; the recruitment at least. For &#x2013; and its submission is scheduled for the first semester of 2011.</p>
          <p>For Aflibercept, so VEGF drug. You have seen that we missed slightly the primary end point for registration based on the response rate in the sub line of high outcomes there, but at least &#x2013; but at the same time we are very consistent result in terms of CA-125 between the population taking 2 and 4 dose.  So we continue to discuss at the FDA also I would like to remind you that we have a 70 &#x2013; more than 70% disappearance of ascites, and you know that we have also doing study in ascites. So, it's difficult at the present time to say exactly what will be the outcome of this discussion with the FDA on both sub line of iron and ascites, but we are continuing to push our case.</p>
          <p>What is interesting too is a lot discussion, a lot of discussion at the ASCO following the respective safety profile of VEGF and Avastin, at least what we can say that we're with VEGF at the dose tested the same profile in terms of adverse events as the class which is hypertension and proteinuria. In terms of gastric GI perforation which is one of the problems of the class, we have less GI perforation than Avastin. I would say at this stage, I would agree with some of &#x2013; with some of you think that at this stage since there is no direct comparison between Avastin &#x2013; to a comparison between Avastin and VEGF, the safety and efficacy profile at the present time it can be considered as comparable. Of course, it might change when we're going head-to-head versus Avastin.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've a very large program in oncology. So, page 37, excuse me, you have the four main studies and program listed. At the present time I think its interesting to know we have more than 1000 patient registered in these different studies and also what is interesting, we've so far no safety signal and the different data Safety Monitoring Board are in the different study continuing saying that we have to continue the study without to adapt the regimen which in oncology is good sign.</p>
          <p>And at the same time going back to a head-to-head comparison versus Avastin, we're starting a pilot study in first line in order to see what is in the specific setting the respective advantage of Avastin versus VEGF.</p>
          <p>So, for Saredutant, as I told you we missed shortly the maintenance efficacy in a trailing MDD. So, we're now waiting for the combination program with a result of the first study, at the turning of the year and the result of the second study, first semester of 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 39, where we'll not comment the recent vote by the Advisory Committee about the need to perform a cardiovascular study in diabetes patients, even without any kind of cardiovascular signal because it's a little bit difficult to predict as a presume time what will be the true outcome. But I think it's interesting to know that for Lantus we've already ongoing cardio morbidity trial with cardiovascular end point, and which will be finished in next year. And the same of course for diminutive Rimonabant you know that we are have the question to study with the result of study in 2011.</p>
          <p>As the same time you have seen that we &#x2013; there is a lot of little bit of change within the portfolio so the number of product into development was partly reduced. It's to take into account the new environment but at the same time in terms of late stage product, we have made some good progress and here is highlighted page 40, the six programs which are already started, which are started or in fact in case of Teriflunomide the recruitment is finished for the first, for the first pivotal study. So AVE5026 we have started the recruitment for the seven Phase III studies. For AVE0010 we also started the program. I will not comment the program because it was done in the previous, I think it was shown in February.</p>
          <p>For cholesterol absorption inhibitor we have also started the study. We are already in sarcoma with our vascular disrupting agent and we have also started the recruitment for our gene therapy in peripheral arterial disease and as I told you before, Teriflunomide, the first pivotal Phase III studies, the recruitment is finished. So it my pleasure to introduce Jean-Claude Leroy.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Marc and good morning everybody. Let's move now to the financial and I will dedicate a part of my time to comment on the Q2 figures and a part to illustrate the profitability of some key assets that have been presented to you by Wayne and Hanspeter and in Vaccine based business and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So first Q2 achievements, we are on page 42 starting from minus 3.6% at the sales level we come down to plus 3.1% at the operating income current level, meaning a good leverage during this second quarter.</p>
          <p>Another way, probably a better way to show this is to compare sales growth from the comparable basis which is little bit over 5, plus 5%, to operating income current excluding selected &#x2013; sorry excluding exchange rate as you can see this is plus 14%. Excluding the negative selected items in H1 of 2007 we're still comparing 5% in sales to 11% growth at the operating income current level.</p>
          <p>Next on page 43; as you can see a strong effect of the exchange rates during this period importantly Q2 &#x2013; during Q2 the US dollar is responsible for 75% of the 6.5% negative effect when during H1 US dollar is responsible for 80%. This means clearly, that during Q2 currencies other than US dollar dropped rather sharply against euro. As regards changes in the Group structure this is the first quarter we do not consolidate any more sales of Copaxone in North America.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 44, a few words on the top part of the P&amp;L; as explained earlier the end of the commercialization of Copaxone in North America has a favorable impact on the cost of sales. R&amp;D is increasing by 3.4% excluding exchange rate effect, a little less than during Q1.</p>
          <p>Coming down to SG&amp;A, once again it decreases. The ratio to sales is down by more than a percent over the first half of the year and we are once again among the very best performers in our industry. As a consequence we gained 2 percentage points over last year at 35.9% at the operating income current ratio to sales.</p>
          <p>Page 45. Net financial expenses excluding the Millennium gain &#x2013; the shares we had in Millennium after the offer of Takeda. We are showing heavier net financial expense during the Q2. This is mainly driven by the decreased remuneration of our positive treasury position in US dollar in the United States. Income tax as anticipated our tax burden decreased this year below 30%.</p>
          <p>Coming to the share of profit from associates, it increases in real terms as Plavix and Merial are growing, but the translation into euro offset almost all of these improvements. All in all adjusted net income at &#x20AC;1.6 billion is down 4.4% and corresponding EPS down by 0.8% at &#x20AC;1.23 burdened by selected items this quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving page 46, on the selected items, as you can see we booked in Q2 close to &#x20AC;150 million of charges net of taxes, first on the restructuring in France and other countries in Europe, such as Italy and Spain. We also booked impairment on intangible such as the Trovax and S1 projects.</p>
          <p>From the first half perspective, now the difference is rather important since we are talking about a charge of 168 million in '08 when we had a net profit of 146 million in '07 mainly driven by resolution of tax audits.</p>
          <p>So, now we can come to the adjusted net income excluding selected items, EPS is at 1.34 up 3.9% over Q2 of '07 and equally importantly up 20.7% in dollars. At the first half level, EPS is &#x20AC;2.77 up 2.6 and 18.1% in US dollar. This performance expressed in US dollars compared very favorably with our peers.</p>
          <p>A few words now on the cash flow statement, page 48. As you can see with &#x20AC;2.5 billion this first half delivers a free cash flow before dividend and share buyback, which is comparable to the one of the first one of '07.</p>
          <p>After having spent &#x20AC;1.2 billion to end the &#x20AC;3 billion share repurchase program in May and paid for the dividend obviously, the first half show a negative position of 1.4 billion leaving the net debt position at &#x20AC;5.6 billion euro, a level which is equivalent to the one we had at the end of the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>After this first half result, we decided to increase our full year guidance by one percentage point from the around 7 to around 7. Obviously, we are still talking at constant 2007 euro/dollar parity. I remind you it was 1.371. And I can give the following information coming from Plavix Europe situation. The impact of the Plavix event, which occur recently in Germany have obviously been taken into consideration when revising this guidance.</p>
          <p>I said at the beginning, I would be giving some information to better illustrate our strategy. I will begin with vaccines. And in this slide, the slide page 40 (sic) [50], you've got two kinds of indication.</p>
          <p>The first one which is the structure in itself of the P&amp;L of the Vaccines business and as you can see, when you compare to the global P&amp;L of the company and express as a percentage to sales, you will see a lower gross margin, an equivalent R&amp;D level and lower SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The second information obviously is the profitability, which reaches over 19% on sales in the first half, and I have to remind you that the second half of the year is traditionally more important in sales, partly because of the seasonal flow. And therefore the profitability ratio will also be higher bring on a full year basis a profitability which is highly comparable to the total group's we are delivering.</p>
          <p>Moving now to page 51, and also referring to 52, I am going talk are base business and emerging market. These two slides are dedicated to show the weight and the profitability of these two main components of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Base business first; around &#x20AC;4 billion as Hanspeter mentioned, 30% of the sales in H1 '08 showing only a small decrease, but more importantly as showing a good profitability ratio, 40 to 45% of net sales when the total group is around 55%. Now with this level of profitability, I'm referring to the 55 for the group or 45 for our base business correspond to operating income current before global R&amp;D and central G&amp;A, but including associates and minority interests. I am sure you can better appreciate with this kind of figures why we are so eager to keep our base business.</p>
          <p>Moving to emerging markets, now on slide 52. We've been insisting a lot on this area where we're investing that represents &#x20AC;3.2 billion in sales in the first half, 25% of the global sales. And Hanspeter showed that the portfolio of this market was roughly divided by two between top 15 and base business. What we show here is the profitability of these emerging markets and as you can see it's around 45%, once again, when the total group following the same definition is around 55 not only are these markets dynamic, but they are also profitable.</p>
          <p>So as a conclusion, on this second quarter we can say that it was a good illustration of the way we pursue our strategy. Despite further deteriorating currency environment, the Group delivered another quarter of solid growth in adjusted EPS excluding selected items and was supported by the performance of key assets and based on selective resource allocation.</p>
          <p>At the same time, R&amp;D moved forward with Multaq to FDA and EMEA and Pentacel received its license. And we've taken external growth initiatives to express or reinforce our position. So I guess it's a good illustration once again of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And we can now move and give you the floor for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question today from Charles <mark type="inaudible" /> from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Actually it's Paul Mann here from Morgan Stanley. One quick question, I'm looking at slide 28 on Menactra and you are highlighting the opportunity in immunization at 9 and 12 months.  Now 2010 some of your competition are going to be trying to get vaccines approved for the two, four and six months immunization schedule. And clearly that's when meningococcal infection is most prevalent. So help me understand why someone would use vaccine at nine and 12 months? And also perhaps you can also explain how you can intend to counter detail against the data presented in Hawaii comparing Novartis Menveo to Menactra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, I guess it is &#x2013; a of number of questions there. First of all, I don't want to comment in detail on Menveo, other than I would encourage you to go back and look at their filing plans because like Menactra they will be filing for multiple indications over multiple years. It is our understanding that their first file was for the 11 to 18 year old eight segment, as oppose to the full file that you are referencing of primary series. But that you can talk you to Novartis about.</p>
          <p>In terms of the first year of life, there are two serotypes that are most prevalent and that's serotype B which today there is not a vaccine for, and neither Menactra nor Menveo address the serotype B. And the other is serotype C and so that &#x2013; those are the serotypes in the first year of life. Any vaccine that's given in the primary series defined as two, four and six month does not provide full protection until at least six months of age which is why at the two, four, six months plus a booster given at 12 to 18. So when you look at the &#x2013; both the level of protection as well as the cost associated with a four dose schedule versus a two dose schedule, the policy makers basically are going to have to basically look at their options and we think that they will be basically allow healthcare providers to basically choose which product they want to use to provide the level of protection for first year life. Given at nine and 12 months, you'll have full protection by 12 months of age and with at least half the cost and half the shots.</p>
          <p>In the US the serotypes W135 and Y become more prevalent after the first year of life and that's where the quadrivalent basically where they're given in a primary series 9 and 12, 11 years of age basically meets the needs for those serotypes.</p>
          <p>In reference to the comment about the data presented by Novartis on Menveo in comparison to Menactra, first of all, we've not seen their full database, so it's difficult to make an accurate comment on the database. The one thing we can tell you is that in our clinical studies, which were over 10,000 patients, Menactra has provided 98 to 100% seroconversion and protection against bacterial meningitis. So seeing a higher immune response with another products, or in other study, the question is what level of additional protection we get compared to something that's providing 98 to 100% efficacy. So it's &#x2013; immune response doesn't necessarily translate into better efficacy, I think that's data we've yet to see from the Novartis product. And again with Menactra providing 98 to 100% protection, there is not a whole lot of room for improvement there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And also perhaps you could just talk whether or not you see any issues in terms of filling your flu vaccine yet, maybe you've actually started filling your vaccine for the upcoming flue season. And also perhaps you can talk about the capacity expansion you expect, in your EU plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's flu. Okay, in terms of flu; Fluzone which is produced in our Pennsylvania facility has received its license. The first two lots have already been released by the FDA, and we actually shipped those lots yesterday. So we've begun the not only the filling of the product, we've actually begun the distribution of product in the US, and it's like a pump. When you prime the pump, it starts to flow, and the product will now flow and we expect to deliver virtually all of the product in the US by early October.</p>
          <p>As it relates to our manufacturing facility in France, which is Val de Reuil, which delivers for Europe and most of Asia, there is different licensing requirements for the EMEA, so there are clinical studies required for licensure of any vaccine that's distributed in Europe and so it's a longer timeline to licensure. We're on track with our production in Val de Reuil, and it would expect to begin having the product shipped as early as late August. And we think that's comparable to what the other manufacturers have.</p>
          <p>So at this point the prognosis is very encouraging for the Northern Hemisphere campaign. It's with the flu business until the product is produced, filled, distributed, there is multiple steps to moving 150 million doses in a 12-week period. So it's a little premature to basically conclude how the season will end, other than all signals are very positive right now, in terms of what's going on in the US where we're licensed and shipping, and in Europe we're basically &#x2013; yields basically have been good.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the question on Menactra for Europe, we're in discussions with our joint venture Sanofi Pasteur MSD, in terms of the registration strategy for Europe. This will be &#x2013; the registration will be coupled with the licensure of the new facility in Pennsylvania. And that facility is expected to be licensed by the end of 2009 allowing us then to roll out the licensure of the product around the world.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question today from Kevin Scotcher from HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions. My questions are &#x2013; firstly, on Germany two questions. One is, can you go through what is happening to the tail of products there with increasing commoditization of generics? And secondly, has there actually been a launch of generic Plavix yet in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the more general part of your questions, I believe unfortunately that there is very little light on the -- positive light on the German market. All the negative trends continue as you heard us in terms of access increase. If you look to the latest development on e-Quick and the comments from the Health Minister on the way e-Quick works; if you look to the continued increase of the importance of contracts between the sequence and the manufacturers which of course has, again a negative re-price effect on the overall prices. So I'm sorry to say, but I see no positive signal for the German market as of today.</p>
          <p>Now on the more specific question concerning Plavix and its competitors. It depends how you define is a competitor on the market. From a legal and regulatory point of view, the answer clearly is yes. The Court of Cologne has confirmed the market authorization for two products, one of CT which is a subsidiary of Ratiopharm and the other one for Sandoz. So legally those products are on the market. If they are physically on the market, I cannot confirm because there is a need to register those products in a public list in terms of price and pack sizes and so on and so forth. This list will only appear 15th of August and we will see our &#x2013; if then those products will be made available. What we hear today is that there is pre-selling by both companies, by Sandoz and by Ratiopharm CT in the market in anticipation of such a public reaction as of August 15th.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will take our next question today from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A few questions. Just more on Plavix in Europe, can you give us an idea of what we should expect in 2009 for European sales of Plavix? It's an important franchise and I don't think there is much visibility, beyond what may happen in Germany. So what other counties might fall next for example? And then two questions on your pipeline. One question on your cholesterol absorption inhibitor, you talk about four Phase III trials, are any of those active comparator trials, so head-to-head trials versus another cholesterol reducer? And then on Multaq, launching that product, that require you to hire a significant number of new sales reps; if not where will you pull those reps from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I may start with the Multaq and sales reps because it's the most easy one. No, there will be no need for additional sales reps. First of all, we believe that the Multaq approach will be a rather selective approach, at least, at the beginning which means we will largely of course target on internists and specialists in cardiovascular medicine. Second we have a lot of synergies with our existing portfolio, if you think about Plavix or, of course, the other products like Aprovel, where we see those target groups anyway. And yes, of course, thirdly the product will be a relief for those products which have lost their patent protection during 2007 and during 2008. So, once again, there will be no increase in terms of head count.</p>
          <p>Now the future of Plavix in Europe, you see it's really not possible to give an outlook for 2009 here today in the mid of 2008. But nevertheless I think it's worth to recall what are the most important elements. The first element and that's the one we are still fighting for its effects that we believe that the registrations given by the German BfArM are profoundly illegal. And we will continue to fight for that and in this light we have made an appeal and we have activated the European commission and we have activated other means because we feel that the BfArM had no right to work on this file during the period of data protection which just ended a couple of days ago, 15 of July.</p>
          <p>Now, that's the first issue and this is of course is time-wise now over because evidently we are at the end of month and the end of the data protection. But of course there continues to be protection from a patent. Now the second aspect of the German situation is that those companies have made registered a product which is a different salt using a registration process which is not a typical generic process. So there are numerous consequences from this, despite the fact once again I will repeat that we believe and continue to believe that this is illegal. One of the consequences is that those products have a different scope of indications, because the product approved in Germany cover only the indications as given by since the first landmark trail for Plavix which was CAPRI or negatively formulated those products have no indication today in the major indications of Plavix today, which is, for example, stent and acute coronary syndrome where we realized a large part of our sales.</p>
          <p>Second, there are very different attitudes towards the question, is a salt equivalent to another salt within the European Community. We have of course carefully investigated this with the various authorities inside the European markets. We have a total nihilism in the newer member states like Poland, where we have today already generics of clopidogrel on the market coming from former Eastern European companies like Clicka. There you see German attitude which you are aware of which is more or less the same let's say from Portugal and they are more or less strong reservations towards this equivalent of different salts, coming from major countries like France, the United Kingdom which is clearly refusing it, and also Spain. But also the United States where the FDA has a very clear stance in saying that there is no possibility to make a transfer from one salt to another. And of course this is a battle which will continue.</p>
          <p>All of this to tell you that for us today it is impossible to give a precise outlook for Europe, but I'm cautiously optimistic that there will be no overall acceptance of the German situation in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that was the question for Multaq sales force, and so now for 55% reduction during our Phase IIb, that in terms of efficacy, it would be difficult to beat the competitor in the market. We should be comparable. We've maintained an advantage in terms of safety because the product is less absorbed than the competitor's. And at the same time, we think that in terms of differentiation we have to wait, we have to look for is cardiovascular &#x2013; outcome of cardiovascular redundance, so we're planning some study. We do not believe that the initial study with plans in terms of cardiovascular outcome are truly reflecting the potential of lowering SGL. So it's one point where we want to make the difference.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, gentlemen. A question on the guidance, you are implying given that you published plus 2.6% growth in EPS in H1. Your guidance if we have the current rate to the end of the year would imply a decline of 2%. Obviously, this is not only Plavix in Germany, I guess. Is there anything that would explain your cautiousness for your guidance for the second half of the year? And regarding Plavix in Germany, what will you do with the sales reps that are pushing the product. I mean what is your marketing strategy there? And lastly, when one -- two quick product questions, one on Multaq when will we get the diagnosis data and on AVE5530, could you tell us which statin you have chosen for the fixed dose combination? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first one on the guidance. I remind you that the guidance is on a full year basis. So, it's a little bit quick to compare directly the H1 result to what we're saying for the full year. In addition to that that I'm sorry, but it's once again a currency issue. The first half the US dollar-euro parity was as you know 1.53. And when you're telling that we might end up the year at minus &#x2013; or implying that the euro-dollar operating for the full year might be 1.57. And I am not saying it's wrong or right, because we don't know, reason for which we tried to keep it out of the dollar parity.</p>
          <p>In fact now, I said that we've included our best estimate of the evolution of the situation of the Plavix in Germany as mentioned by earlier by Hanspeter. And no, I'm not implying that we're going to have week second half per se. Once again I could rely on what Wayne Pisano was just saying about the flu season, and what I told you about the vaccine business in general, meaning the second half being more important, that second half. So, we are in a normal course of a year. But as you've noticed each quarter is not equal to the precedent to the next one. So there is consistency between the achievement at the end of the first half and our upward revisioning in guidance for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I might give you a little bit of additional information from a figure point of view on clopidogrel in Germany. The -- first of all the clopidogrel sales in Germany are about &#x20AC;350 million on an annual basis and they are flat in 2005 due to the various interventions from the German authorities. What is important to note is that nearly 40% of those 350 million annual sales are imported sales coming from other countries of the European community with lower prices. So I think if you have a made model it's important for you to know that, of course, on those products we have only a minor effect because as said before 40% of the German sales are imported from other markets. So any price adjustment in Germany, I would have to take this effect into account, which of course is unfavorable.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A few questions please. Hanspeter, I think, you said that Plavix generic wasn't accepted in the UK in a different salt, does that mean that you believe that its been filed and rejected. You've given us some insight into buying consumer products in Australia, can you just give us some idea of broadly speaking of how big your consumer or semi-ethical business is as we stand today. On Lovenox in the US, is it fair to say that really one of the biggest issues that would preclude any generic there is still the Citizens' Petition? Can you give us any update on what is happening there? And a final question just in terms of the finance you've got three acquisitions either in anticipation or concluded. I'm assuming that your guidance excludes any financial impact of those and if you were to able to get Symbion, Acambis and Zentiva all together, broadly speaking, what would the impact on your numbers be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo. So, starting on Plavix, I don't want to make a comment if Plavix generic has been filed in the UK. But we have very carefully investigated with the authorities in the UK, their overall position towards salts, and the position is negative as I have said before.</p>
          <p>Now on the OTC presence in Australia, first of all the to-be-acquired business is the approximately 110, 120 million and we have additional approximately 50 to 60 million existing sales of OTC products like, for example, Maalox and others.</p>
          <p>Now in the Australian market there is a growing influence of the pharmacies in terms of substitution. So this is part of then our objectives to get closer to the pharmacies while our OTC products in using this as a kind of engine to also benefit from the substitution power of the pharmacies.</p>
          <p>Now on a more worldwide basis, yes it is true and I read some comments from analysts during the week that our overall position in OTC is our position are little bit overlooked. Definitions in these fields are not easy as you know, but we have OTC sales of approximately 0.5 billion existing sales and we have three, four brands which are close to be global brands and Maalox is one of it, Aspegic would be another one of it, and Lactasit a third one of it.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we believe that we have a good basis to further expand our presence in OTC and this in most markets as in Australia in combination with the growing importance of the pharmacies also for the other business, especially of course the so-called base business.</p>
          <p>Now Lovenox Citizen Petition and overall situation in the US shows there is absolutely nothing we could signal. There is no development at all. We have no reaction to the Citizen Petitions, which we believe to continue to be as strong argument in the existing situation. Of course, we have read as you the communication coming, from Momenta and Sandoz where we read a more and more cautious trend. But besides this tea reading there is absolutely nothing material I could report.</p>
          <p>And now Jean-Claude on the three acquisitions in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Obviously, the impact on 2008 of these three potential acquisition is very small. I'll give you a few comments. Beginning by Zentiva, as you all know -- on this operation there &#x2013; we have to get the clearance and anti-trust authorities not only in the European Union, but also in other countries. So it will take some time. So we do not anticipate if everything goes well to be able to close such an operation before I would say the fourth quarter of this year. So any contribution on Zentiva would be immaterial to the level of the result of the group.</p>
          <p>Coming to Acambis and again, once again assuming that we would be successful in this operation as Wayne described they are conducting six R&amp;D programs right now so its rather R&amp;D spend, which is translating into a loss and I would say a small loss. So we may encounter if we were to close this operation sometime in next coming months, we would a small loss.</p>
          <p>When, the other way around coming to the Australian situation and assuming that we would close this operation by the end of the summer, we would get some positive contribution for the remaining part of the year at the bottom line. So all-in-all we are talking very immaterial amount when it comes to 2008 and obviously, this is included in our full year '08 guidance.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. We now take our next question today from Marietta Miemitz from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Marietta Miemitz from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Just a couple questions on Plavix, please. One is the European sales in this quarter looked relatively light and I was just wondering if that was entirely driven by the parallel import situation in Germany or whether there were any other weaknesses or contributory factors in other European countries? And then just to clarify on your guidance, if generic Plavix were launched tomorrow, what sort of a one-off charge do you think you would have to take and would you then exclude that one-off charge from the EPS number before selected items that you're guiding for? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first one on Plavix, there is no overall impact from parallel importation.  It is a matter of fact that what you see in terms of growth for Plavix in Europe is what the market does, please keep in mind that there is literally no country where we could increase prices for Plavix in Germany, contrary to the US, that in countries there are number of markets where we have to decrease our prices in Europe. There's a technical effect also in the figures which has to do with the sale of our raw material to Bristol-Myers Squibb which has been relatively low in the first half for purely technical reasons but overall we have to estimate that the prescription growth of Plavix in Europe is somewhere between 5 and no more than 9% depending on the market, with the exception of some Eastern European markets because the product yes is at &#x2013; at towards the end of its lifecycle in Europe, has maturity position in many European markets being number one for example, in France and in Germany and yes we have continued pressure on the price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the one-off charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to say that coming from once again to Plavix you may remember we do not have any intangible concerning Plavix in the balance sheet. So were we to lose Plavix here or there, we would not to have any special charge, one-off or not to the P&amp;L. So I guess the answer is, no. We wouldn't be hurting from these perspective on the any bad news coming on the Plavix front, simply because it is product which is originated from our R&amp;D so, going to the I said the good accounting principle this has not been put in the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But wouldn't you have an inventory charge from having to scrap batches or from having to take product back from wholesalers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Product back, no, we generally do not take product back from wholesalers and for the rest when you have our raw material or inventory we've seen that in other instances where they has been generic and you can see that in other companies. It takes longer to sell your inventory but that doesn't say that you destroy your inventory and therefore taking one-off charges. So I don't feel that this would be a relevant situation coming to one-off -- concluding in a one-off charge to the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, That's great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We're now going to our next question from Amit Roy from Citi. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, just a couple of questions on Multaq and Plavix. Firstly on Plavix, you said that the package being based on the monotherapy indication of Plavix based on the CAPRI study, two questions around it. Firstly why do you think they didn't get the combination or did they not apply? And secondly, how is it possible to enforce the generic Plavix to be only used in monotherapy? Will it actually just end up being used in combination as well? That's the question on Plavix. And then secondly on Multaq, on the diagnosis head-to-head with amildron. My understanding was that the European regulator was looking for a comparison to amildron. You've mentioned that, you're going to be &#x2013; to have slightly different indication from original. Can you just please expand on how that's going to be more different to the original application? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for Multaq, in fact the date is of our solution now is the result of that in ATHENA study. Looking at the ATHENA study and as a result at least at the primary end point it was not too much a question of maintain of reason &#x2013; of normal reason means much more in terms of prevention of morbi-mortality and so we are trying to make us a labeling to parallel the result of primary end point of the ATHENA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on Plavix combination, I am not sure but I assume when you say combination you mean in combined use with other products, so to avoid any kind of confusion there has been a decision from the e-Quick in Germany against the combine use of this product which we deplored because we believe it is wrong but it has nothing to do with the appearance of generics.</p>
          <p>Now the question why the generics have only limited indication, I can only speculate, but if I speculate I would say simply because they had only access to this part of our file which was the first part which we have deposited about 11 years ago with the European authorities, and that we have solid proof that this has been copied by the applicant. Everything else would be speculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is there any way that that can be enforced actually in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. I believe very much because somebody who would &#x2013; is prescribed or dispensed this type of generic in a non-approved indication, I believe would not only act unethical but also un-legal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on Lovenox in Europe, and just thoughts on how you might defend your franchise from the upcoming launches relative to your orthopedic indications. And also any concerns over potential off-label usage in medical patients. So, can you just run through any pricing strategies that you might be following there? And secondly on Symbion, does this mark a real strategic change in direction? Your previous strategic priorities have been biologics in Japan but based on recent history should we expecting more consumer and generic acquisitions instead? And then finally on clopidogrel besylate, could you highlight whether you will actually wait for the outcome of the appealed court enforcement order before you file infringement proceedings, or have you filed infringement proceedings immediately? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. I kindly ask you to understand that we don't want and that we do not describe our legal strategy in this respect, not only but also because of course we have to coordinate with our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb. And everything until today is very tactical and technical also.</p>
          <p>Second, on Symbion, yes, we believe that there is a growing opportunity in OTC in combination this see &#x2013; let's call it prescription business. And yes, if there is opportunity, we would acquire, but I think it's fair to say that there is limited opportunity in OTC simply because there is limited offer, but very strong interest. But whenever we see an opportunity and this is opportunistic to our existing business, we will go for it.</p>
          <p>Now, for Lovenox and the upcoming competition in Europe; I think first of all, it's important to point out that the European market in this field is much more price sensitivity than the other markets. And said we are today already in a kind of generic situation because Lovenox has a number of competitors which are technically no generics, but are directly competing with it. And most of them compete through price. So the conclusion of this is that we believe that any competitor in Europe, of course, has to benchmark with the existing base of treatment in terms of pharmacoeconomic outcome. Second, what we see today as upcoming competitors and here I refer of course to the orals,  are competitors which are targeting two indications, which are important indications from a clinical point of view, but nevertheless they represent no more than 10% of our existing sales. And it will take if at all, take years and years those competitors to show superiority to Lovenox. And I insist on superiority and I go back to the specific economic environment in Europe. It will take some years of clinical research to show superiority and meanwhile, our lifecycle management for Lovenox will continue and will go on.</p>
          <p>And as you have remarked, yes, we are also working in new directions. These are the favorable profiles and we'll have to see that but the time being &#x2013; and the time being, for me, clearly in 2008, 2009 and probably also a good part of 2010, we may see competitors which are aiming for no more than 10% of our sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just also follow-up that gentleman, generic Plavix. And you indicated certain countries, so you have got a very clear negative response on the different salts. I think you cited France, UK and Spain. Can you actually just clarify what proportion of your European Plavix sales comes from those countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me estimate this. As I said before, Germany is about 350 million, which is about roughly 15% of the overall &#x2013; 15 to 20% of the overall European sales of clopidogrel from Bristol-Myers, and from us. So to make it very simple, the French sales are about 50 million superior to the German sales alone, then the other markets like Spain, UK and Italy are about half of France. So if you take all three markets together they are approximately twice the size of Germany.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Just really it's a pipeline question. We've seen perhaps more overt movement, and regrettably in an outward direction for some of the products in your pipeline. I just wondered is this perhaps a reflection of any new initiative to concentrate the pipeline or to focus on more on product where there is more opportunity. And could you perhaps tell us about any projects in the pipeline, where they have actually met or should I say exceeded your expectations? I guess, quite a bit of the press release is talking about drugs that perhaps have not met your expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a good question. I think, it is clear for everybody that the environment in the pharmaceutical world is changing both in terms of safety requirements or as put the health authority as a decrease of <mark type="inaudible" /> and at the same time that we have pressure from the payers.  So I think as with everybody within the pharmaceutical industry we look to our portfolio with these two angles and we try to focus of course on the product with best safety profile based on the disease of course. And also we have the payers &#x2013; where we have some arguments in fact for the payers.</p>
          <p>I think result better than expected, Multaq clearly was better than expected. I think it's trumpeted for a submission. Also the result so far with Idrabiotaparinux, also a little bit better than expected. Again, I would like to remind you, that the study with idraparinux in DVT versus anti-vitamin-K was superior in terms of efficacy and better safety profile. And when you are looking for atrial fibrillation with idraparinux in fact we have also I think a 20%, a little bit more than 20% risk, relative risk reduction in terms of effect versus anti-vitamin-K. We have the same mortality event than as anti-vitamin-K. We just have an increase of intracranial bleeding within the total mortality for idraparinux. So if you consider that in the EQUINOX study, we have in fact the statistical significant difference versus idraparinux, so we have dramatically less intracranial bleeding, it is very promising.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we would like to be cautious because it is only one study, so we need that to confirm it with EQUINOX. But if this result is confirmed with EQUINOX, on top of the five that we have the potentiality to neutralize &#x2013; sorry, if we have the same result in CASSIOPEA, on top of that we have the possibility to the neutralize in fact an important reading with Avidin. I think in atrial fibrillation we will have a very important campaign. And the big market, if you don't feel that sometimes -- there is two big market, one is medical prophylaxy for product a little bit like Lovenox and the other big market is atrial fibrillation for product like anti-vitamin-K.</p>

And second Jean-Claude, you made the comment with regard to buyback. Can you give us any guide on buyback for the second half of the year, because it was very strong in Q1, not so much in Q2. Is it related in any way to the acquisitions? And then finally in terms of Eplivanserin fourth quarter filing, are you awaiting any data for that or is it just finalization of the package? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well. To take Zentiva first of all, we are very confident that this deal will go through in all sense. You have probably seen that our competitor PPS has withdrawn its offer. So at least as of today, I don't see any competing offers so we are of course not only confident, but also dedicated to get this deal through. If not it would not change our overall ambition to further accelerate our presence and our approach in those parts of the world. Which means we would &#x2013; we would probably invest more into what we have and we would continue to look to other opportunities, which exist in this part of the world, because there is still a local or national industry which may become available for association or acquisition.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Buyback, share buyback the 1.2 billion spent during the first half of the year, was one again the end of this &#x20AC;3 billion program which was launched during last summer in '07, and as said at that time which has to be completed before the general assembly which took place in May. Now what are we going to do during the remaining part of the year? As you know first the Board decided to authorize a program of up to 3 billion up to the mid next year. It is obvious that at the same time, we are trying to be active in the business development area and simply had to take the three operation or potential operation, on which we are working. We are talking about something which is close to &#x20AC;2 billion investment at the company level.</p>
          <p>So my answer would be that, yes we may &#x2013; we may do some share buyback during half &#x2013; the second part of the year. But obviously priority is to be given to business development. So for the time being, say that there is no big anticipation of what we might do. No big volume anticipated. Once again this can change depending also on other factors like the market situation, but the priority once again, to business development.</p>

          <p>That's very clear. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for Eplivanserin, I confirm that there is no additional study to be heard from. It's just a question of wrap up of the dossier, since on some extra requirement of the FDA in terms of cutting some other things out, but there is nothing &#x2013; so the dossier will be submitted in fourth semester of 2008.</p>

          <p>Jo, I think we have time for one last question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. We will take our final question today from Ben Yeoh from Dresdner. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Just got a couple on R&amp;D and a couple of others. Just on Multaq, I was wondering, did you have a meeting with the FDA post your data but before filing? I was just wondering whether you now know whether the latest filing package meets their previous concerns. And then secondly, just on Saredutant, I realize this sort of decision for filing will now be in the first half of 2009 depending on the combination trials, but what type of result is going to be needed in those trials do you think for you to be able to file? And then just on the financials looking forward into second half of the year, just on restructuring charges, there is some restructuring charges in Q2, which we are seeing from the restructuring in Europe. Should we be expecting further restructuring charges in H2 and is there any visibility on that? And then just finally just coming back to Plavix in Germany, I know this is been covered by you already, but just to confirm in your view, Plavix is not substitutable in many indications in Germany. And therefore, what would you say is the percentage of Plavix sales at risk from the potential generic and the indication that it has? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I start with Plavix, again. So I repeat what I said before approximately 350 million annual sales in Germany, out of which about 130 are imported from outside Germany.</p>
          <p>Second, yes, I confirm that is our strong conviction that a product which has limited indications, can not substitute a product, which has larger indications. If this would be not the case, any kind of life cycle management would be obsolete. We had made fair calculations for answer your questions what is the part of indications of Plavix in Germany, which may be attacked by generics and we come to an estimate between 40 and 45% of our sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for Multaq, it's always difficult to &#x2013; we do not discuss much of discussion with the FDA, but of course we have discussions with FDA. And I can tell you we are confident with the product.</p>
          <p>For Saredutant, is a good question. I think we will look at two parameters, one is of course the Hamilton Depression Scale that I see much more important on top of existing therapy. It will be as a number of patients to cure at least going down 12 -- less than 12 or less than 8 on Hamilton's Scale. Because the biggest problem at the present time is that only 50% of the patients are cured of their first events by SSRI or SNRI. And it is -- and there is clear link between relapse, or not good treatment, of the first event and increasing of depression. So I think the main parameter will be in fact the number of patients who are <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And coming to the restructuring perspective, charges perspective. As you've seen and as Hanspeter has explained we are taking a certain number of initiatives in this area in the major markets. This has been true last year; this has been true in each of the first quarter of this year, yes, you may see additional charges to come during the rest of the year. All things are under discussion as you know with the various camp works council. We are not going to give details, since it's not our policy. But thanks to the fact that from a financial perspective, we classify the charges as selected items, this has no influence on the guidance we've been providing to you.</p>
