        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our Q1 Conference Call. We are happy to have with us our CFO, Bodo Uebber. In order to give you maximum time for your questions, Bodo Uebber will begin with a short introduction directly followed by Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to hand over to Bodo Uebber.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our first quarter results underline that we are on track to grow our business, to sustain our results and to achieve our medium term profitability goals. Our Q1 2011 numbers also show that the company has trimmed its operational structures and we can turn solid market demand into good results. Nevertheless, we will remain watchful in the future so that we can react quickly and flexible to global challenges.</p>
          <p>Let me first give you just a few group highlights about the first quarter. The upward trend is confirmed by another Daimler Group revenue increase of 17% in the first quarter 2011 compared to last year. Daimler achieved a strong EBIT of &#x20AC;2 billion in the first quarter, which is 71% higher compared to the first quarter last year, and the net profit almost doubled year-over-year and reached nearly &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>The industrial free cash flow in Q1 2011 was minus &#x20AC;500 million. The cash flow reflects the increase in working capital in consequence of higher inventories for the spring selling season and the growth of our business. Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Cars continued strong overseas sales momentum results in a higher number of vehicles in transit.</p>
          <p>During Q1 2011 we also paid our bonuses to our employees, increased the equity of the Daimler Benz Foundation. The industrial net liquidity was again increased to &#x20AC;12.5 billion, benefiting from the annual dividend from Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Let me also give you a brief update on the financial and operational impact of the event in Japan during Q1. At Daimler Trucks and Financial Services we booked charges of &#x20AC;49 million and &#x20AC;29 million respectively. In the aftermath of the earthquake on March 11, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation had stopped the production in Japan. Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation resumed production of parts and components on March 29 and of vehicles on April 20th.</p>
          <p>With regard to the impact on operations outside Japan, we have so far not seen any noteworthy impact on our production. If our supply chain should be affected, we, of course, have prepared countermeasures to limit potential impacts to a minimum. Let me also tell you that the charges in Mitsubishi Fuso, the &#x20AC;49 million, should be covered by an insurance policy where we have to clarify what amount we can get back from insurance companies.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with a closer look at the divisions. Mercedes had a very good quarter and boosted unit sales by 12% and revenues over-proportionally by 20% compared to last year, which resulted into an EBIT of &#x20AC;1.3 billion and a return on sales of 9.3%.</p>
          <p>All regions contributed to this achievement and the dynamic growth in China is unbroken with a sales increase of 68% to 44,000 units. With this volume, Mercedes-Benz remains the fastest growing premium automaker in China. But in the underdeveloping countries, we could also see strongly increase in unit sales, Russia up 86%, Brazil 42%, and India 37%. Overall the share of sales outside Western Europe and the U.S. increased year-over-year from 32% to 36%, demonstrating that our regional sales mix is getting even more balanced.</p>
          <p>We have every reason to be optimistic from today's perspective. We assume that global automotive markets will continue to expand by 5% to 7% in 2011. The second quarter sales will additionally benefit from the new generation of the high volume C-Class and the all new SLK. The customer response to both new vehicles has been outstanding during the cars' launch in Europe.</p>
          <p>We are confident to achieve a new sales record for Mercedes-Benz Cars in 2011. From today's perspective, we anticipate unit sales of more than 1.2 million automobiles solely of Mercedes-Benz brand. Including smart, unit sales should exceed 1.3 million.</p>
          <p>The first three months proved that Daimler Trucks is as well positioned to benefit from the recovery of the normalizing truck demand. In the first quarter, we sold around 90,000 trucks, 27% more than last year. The EBIT increased to &#x20AC;464 million excluding the charges in connection with the tragedy in Japan. The return on sales adjusted for the burdens in connection with Japan increased from 3% to 7.4%, clearly showing that we did our homework and that the restructuring measures bears fruit.</p>
          <p>Due to the very good customer reception of our new heavy-duty engine, we also <mark type="ph" /> conquered 3.3 percentage points (07:17) of market share in NAFTA Class 8 during Q1 2011. However, one also needs to take a closer look at the order intake and the book-to-bill.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, the order intake surged by 65%, and at the same time, the book-to-bill ratio of Daimler Trucks increased to 133% from 102% last year and, for example, NAFTA even to 173%.</p>
          <p>In light of the good demand and the strong indicators from our dealer network, we increased our market outlook for NAFTA to 35%. In Europe, the order intake is also better than our initial expectations, therefore, we have raised our market outlook to 20%, 25% compared to last year. And even for Brazil where the market already reached record levels in 2010, we expect moderate increase in market volume and to exceed 2010's record level.</p>
          <p>For Trucks Asia, we had anticipated slightly rising sales, however at the current stage, it is currently still too early to assess the impact of the disaster on the global sales of Fuso. For Daimler Trucks in total, that means unit sales could increase considerably</p>
          <p>With an increase of 16% to 54,000 units, Mercedes-Benz Vans also achieved strong sales growth in the first quarter. The EBIT of &#x20AC;173 million equals an excellent return on sales of 8.8%. And at Daimler Buses, <mark type="ph" /> there was (08:47) seasonal weaker sales development of minus 8% in the first quarter, was mainly driven by a weak city bus market in Europe and North America. And as a result, the EBIT was negative. For the full year 2011, we expect to sell more than 40,000 units, thus once again surpassing the figures for the prior year.</p>
          <p>At Financial Services, new business in Q1 2011 grew by more than 10% compared to last year. However, the worldwide contract volume decreased compared with the end of 2010 by 3% to &#x20AC;61.7 billion. Adjusted for exchange-rate effect, contract volume was almost unchanged.</p>
          <p>The continuing positive EBIT development of &#x20AC;321 million is mainly driven by a further improved risk situation and a continuing good interest margin. The EBIT is also including a provision of &#x20AC;29 million for expected higher credit risks resulting from the tragedy in Japan. Please note that Q1 2011 EBIT cannot be annualized.</p>
          <p>Let's come to the outlook. The excellent results of the first quarter show that Daimler is growing profitably and is progressing well ahead of our planning. This is confirmed by our positive outlook for earnings in 2011 to significantly surpass the figures achieved in 2010.</p>
          <p>The developments in the first quarter also demonstrate that we continue to make good progress toward the targeted rates of return and that we intend to achieve on a sustained basis as of the year 2013. With this statement, I want to end my introduction and look forward to answer your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Now the good part. I will identify the questioner here by name, but also please introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization before asking your question. Two practical points; firstly, please avoid using mobile phones and, secondly, please ask your question in English. Now let's start, I will take the first question from Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. I have one question regarding trucks. You indicated earlier today that the Trucks NAFTA forecast may be too low, given the strong order intake. Would capacity be a limiting factor here and would you need to raise your initial CapEx planning? And in that context, do you confirm the free cash flow guidance you gave that free cash flow at least is higher than the dividend payment in 2011? And besides that, regarding Financial Services, besides your credit default rate, what's behind the jump in profitability versus fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel, to your questions. Of course, what I indicated this morning is that the order intake is extraordinary good and even higher than, of course, our 32% to 35% of NAFTA market outlook. From today's perspective, it might be more in the 35% region than in the 30% region. That is what we can say today. And if the development is further as good as in this first quarter, there might be even some upwards potential. But on the other hand, also you have seen the <mark type="ph" /> Becker (12:15) announced, I do think, even 40% to 50% what I heard about the market assumption, but at the same time, they said, okay there might be limiting factors from the production side -- or from the supplier side, sorry, not from the production side.</p>
          <p>Of course, we will manage our capacities, I do think not with increasing investments, that's not necessary, because why should we. Because in production, we can produce a lot. But as I said, the question from the suppliers. Currently with our outlook in the market, I don't see any problem to produce the 30%, 35% on the one side. On the other hand, we will see market share increases in Freightliner, as we've seen it in Q1.</p>
          <p>And the mood in the U.S., I would say is, as I said before, even somewhat in the 35% direction, it's positive. The free cash flow is, I'll stay with the statement I did also in February, the free cash flow will significantly exceed our dividend payment this year. And when I talked about that in February, I stated that we had last year, I do think, &#x20AC;5.4 billion in free cash flow and we will invest in R&amp;D and investment in CapEx &#x20AC;2 billion more, somewhat more tax payments, of course, as we are very profitable. And therefore, also our role in the -- for the different stakeholders, we do have, so but that is the same message as I said before, we will significantly exceed the &#x20AC;2 billion dividend payment from last year and this year.</p>
          <p>So that holds true again. Maybe also more information to that, in the first quarter, we have invested, so to say, in inventory. A huge part of that is, for example, the building up inventory for the C-Class and what I said before, in the transition for the Atlantics, for U.S. and for China. The EBIT in transit and some growing inventory is clearly by growing the business in trucks and in vans.</p>
          <p>We are even somewhat kind of better with our ratios by building up the inventories and therefore, of course, I regard the free cash flow in the first quarter as a very good and stable one. All in all also the bonus payments are in, so net of working capital, we are more in a direction of &#x20AC;1 billion. So that is, from my point of view, a very solid development.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services, of course, an extraordinary good quarter. We had -- we have a very good loss situation of course, so the trend is going further in all regions especially in the U.S., but also the levels in Western Europe, we see in China, for example -- so the trend is very okay. Within that number, of course, we had the charges for Financial Services in Japan. We had also some releases of provisions in that number, so that is also what I said, this number might not be sustainable, but run rate is about &#x20AC;250 million, which I do think if you calculate this into the whole year, I would say, a very solid development also first quarter and seems to be also in the next quarters to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question we take from Horst Schneider, HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. A couple of questions, specifically regarding trucks, it strikes me that you talk about very good business in North America and that is also something we can in the order intake, but when I look to your market share, for example, in Europe and specifically in Germany, I see that, for example, in Germany the market share has declined by 6% or 7% from Q4 to Q1?</p>
          <p>I could imagine that's it related to some extent to the relaunch or the new launch of the Actros which will come later this year. So maybe you can explain a bit more what is behind the market share loss in Western Europe? And then especially with regard to the Actros launch, maybe you can clarify again how you will book the launch cost -- if you book them evenly across all quarters or if you book them rather more in one specific quarter when the truck is in &#x2013; when the truck launch is finally starting?</p>
          <p>And then also another question with regard to trucks again. I mean, I heard you saying that there were some supply problems on the supply side and therefore the production run rate in Q1 was rather low. When I look at my full year forecast, I see that you need to catch up a lot. So, coming back to that what you said regarding your ability to produce more in the U.S., is it also true for the global situation? Can you really produce much more in Q2? Or are you now somewhat more limited? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst, thank you for your questions. Further on the market share subject is somewhat different. I commented this this morning also in the press call, that in the first quarter, of course, we have a &#x2013; we are not surprised about the development because we saw the order intakes months before. So what happened here is we had some, of course, aggressive pricing in the market which we have not done all the time. Some fleet business, which we are not went in through pricing. I do think that is good news, that we stay disciplined.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in some segments, of course, where we are under-proportionally in, the market growth was higher and, therefore, you see also a kind of under-proportional market share, you might say. So, the situation will normalize over the next few quarters. So we will get back to our normal levels, if you might say. So that gives a little bit of a, of course, potential also for the next quarters to come. So nothing to be worried about.</p>
          <p>It's not depending on the -- what you said, the new Actros, because that is coming up in the third &#x2013; in the fourth quarter this year and therefore, of course, that's not part of the first quarter or the second quarter. Your question was regarding production in total, of course. What I commented, of course, is the impact on the &#x2013; from the Japanese situation. All-in-all, of course, our production was very strong.</p>
          <p>In the passenger car side, when you see the production numbers, they are pretty up. They are up, of course, because we have produced also inventories, but for an investment into sales in Q2 and further in Q3. Therefore, our production is doing well. That holds true also for Freightliner in the U.S. Of course, <mark type="ph" /> the fact sheet, (18:55) of course, which we do have, but I commented on this is within Japan, of course. There we commented on the situation on Fuso, the same holds true for our capacities here in Europe for the European trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. So we should expect then especially coming here back to trucks, we should expect from Q1 to Q2, then especially in Q2, then much higher revenues and that will go hand in hand also with a higher operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let's come up to your first question, of course, the answer is, yes. We will see upcoming increase in sales numbers, of course. The order intake numbers are showing this development and we're able to produce the stuff. That holds true for Europe; the same holds true for Freightliner in the U.S. There even again with a good market share development and Europe with a normalizing market share, as I said before. In Brazil, of course, you know that we've invested in capacity and that rose in over the quarter, so that we can also participate further in the growth of the market. For Japan, as I said before, it's a estimation of the development, very difficult in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the booking of the cost for the Actros? The launch cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The booking of the cost of the Actros will be with the launch of the Actros. So that means, of course, you know in the accounting system, you know that we have to capitalize a lot of the R&amp;D costs, and of course the CapEx stuff is something which you capitalize too. And then of course, you get a pro rata on the one, a pro rata burden, so to say, with the launch of the Actros and the launch cost, so to say. So that will happen in third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next in line is Thierry Huon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. So first of all, could you give us an update about the raw material situation? I think that this morning you said that it's a bit higher than what you thought. Could you give us some color on that? Then about the Chattanooga plant after the tornado, where is the status now of this operation, when do you believe that you will be able to resume production? And given the weakness of the dollar we've seen recently, when do you think this could hit the hedging or even the profitability of the car divisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry, thank you for your questions. First, to the raw material situation, we have commented on in February. I mentioned a number of &#x20AC;700 million in the beginning of the year as a headwind in this year where we have to work with. Of course, we have certain measures, of course, against this like modular strategies, efficiencies and other stuff and then commercial negotiation and so on and so forth, where we do our best to reduce the impact. And for the time being, we do well in this regard.</p>
          <p>So, of course, the situation is somewhat higher than the &#x20AC;700 million right now. But as I said before, we have some challenges as others too. We have some opportunities and there we have to cope with that situation, but it's not too much away from that number we had also in the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>In Tuscaloosa, the situation is as follows. You can imagine, first of all, we look to our employees for the time being, as far as I know, are no employees injured. We have assessed minor damages at the plant which do not affect our production capacities. Of course, the safety of our employees was the highest priority, you can imagine. So, the Wednesday/Thursday night shift was canceled as a measure of precaution, due to unclear weather conditions with regard to our employees way to back from work.</p>
          <p>And with regard to the situation, the region helping those affected by the disaster is now the priority. The plant management decided to cancel this week remaining shifts, thus supporting all our employees who are now fully needed by their families and friends and in their communities, as you understand. And we are intensively monitoring further development and especially ongoing efforts to restore the power supply networks. And we are preparing to resume production on Monday and are in close contact with all relevant partners. So, that is the current situation in Tuscaloosa. I don't know whether you had a third question -- was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedging and do you fear that you might be hit by the current weakness of the dollar at some point in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think the dollar right now is pretty much volatile. So, this volatility I would not say that it always goes up. So this volatility could also at one point of time come down again somewhat, but of course, we should not dare speculate. It is right now at $1.48. We are 80% hedged in 2011, so the effect here in 2011, I would say, can be managed.</p>
          <p>Yes, there is at the end, a part of a burden there. But 80% gives us a good understanding for 2011. We have some collars and forward in our hedge book, a good structure. So, we would even also benefit if it goes down again a bit, that's good in 2012. We are roughly at 40% with a &#x20AC;15 billion net exposure which also means -- &#x20AC;15 billion net exposure is also a good number because that means that our U.S. and Chinese business and Middle East business, for example, is growing. So, therefore 40% is, so to say, hedged and now you can even make your equation, 60% not times whatever dollar you would assume.</p>
          <p>For us, it's difficult to estimate what the dollar is, seeing the volatility right now, so that is something, of course, we have to watch closely. You know that we have -- do our best in reducing the exposure. On the one hand, is it the local content in China, on the one hand; on the other hand, it is our decision what we have already made with the C-Class within the U.S. covering the demand in the U.S. So, of course, all what we can do there is look to enhance the local content in the long run.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I've got just three quick questions. One is very easy. Just trying to figure out what the R&amp;D headwind was? So, wondering if you could give us the de-amortization charge for Q1 this year and Q1 last year? Also if we could talk a little bit about inventories at Mercedes-Benz. I understand that you obviously build inventories in Q1 ahead of the selling season in Q2, but when I look at this year versus last year, last year you underproduced in Q4 whereas in Q4 2010 it looks like you overproduced by about 25,000 units?</p>
          <p>So it feels like you already had a decent amount of inventory. I'm just wondering whether or not there is something I'm missing here and perhaps Q2 is going to be particularly strong, and you're building up for that? And then the final point, and I think you've touched on it already, just in relation to trucks in Europe. If I'm not wrong, registrations for heavy-duty trucks were up 65% in the first quarter and your sales were up 22%. Just wondering if you can help me reconcile those two numbers and what perhaps is driving registrations to be so markedly different from your sales numbers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mike, you were very difficult to understand, first of all, but I do my best to answer your questions. R&amp;D is roughly on the Daimler side &#x20AC;200 million Q1 to Q1 and if I see it through right, it is -- EBIT is splitted by half between cars and trucks, roughly. Your second quarter was about the inventory stuff. First of all, I just think everything is in line here even, as I said before, the ratios which we have in inventories are even better when you see our revenues forecast and sales forecast. In Q4, you should remember our comment. We have built up here some inventory also for the A and B Class end of the year. So, for our launches &#x2013; for our change into the new MFA models. So in Q1 it's purely -- it's mainly related to the C-Class but also the other effects I mentioned.</p>
          <p>So, there is nothing by overproduction or anything else. I would even say it's the other way round. I do think we are more optimized -- better optimized than ever in managing inventories and the value chain between sales and production. And of course, we have to -- if you would like to benefit in the sales development in China and in the U.S., you need to put some <mark type="ph" /> wheels (28:55) on transit. So and therefore this will go all into higher revenues in the second quarter and, of course, that goes on then also for the third and fourth quarter. So, that is all in line; there is no overproduction. Your third question was about?</p>

          <p>Market shares, the first quarter in Europe -- of course, first of all, there is some maybe kind of -- I commented one aspect, the other aspect is there is some seasonality. Some only because we have some customers liking their trucks almost in December due to some reasons, but part of that, that means, of course, we have always when we look into a bit of a slower start. The other one, what I commented before, we have not done every deal in the market last year due to pricing and I do think that is good news. We stay disciplined here, at this regard, being margin oriented. And on the other hand, we do -- there is one aspect that we have not done every fleet deal within European trucks. We expect normalizing of market shares in the upcoming quarters and that is also good news. Of course, we will see growth here and we'll get -- we will stay with our number one position in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I've two questions, one on buses where we've seen a significant decline in profitability in the first quarter. I think you highlighted that this has to do with a decline in the city bus business. Well, how is that going to continue, I mean should we see any recovery in that part of the business? So what's really the perspective for the buses' profitability in the next quarters and what would be the driver for the improvement? And secondly, on the tax rate, you had a rather high tax rate in the first quarter, what would be the tax rate that we should calculate with for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as to your question of the bus business, of course the first quarter is negative due to the market development in the city bus business in Europe. That is the impact we do have there. You can -- for the total year, we will be positive, of course, with the bus business. So, the quarter here, I don't want to give now quarterly guidance here where the numbers are, just talking about the bus business which is the smallest but also important within Daimler. But we expect, of course, getting back to positive levels over the quarter, no doubt, and we'll have a solid earnings development also in the total year. We will achieve also 40,000 units as we have said, which Dieter has commented in his press conference, I do think four weeks ago, that target. And I do think that we'll get to that target.</p>
          <p>The tax rate is -- for the total year, it's roughly -- totally to be really assessed at 35%. Normally over the -- over many, many years to be seen, it should be more directionally 33%. That is the, I would say, the normal level and which you can take. So, first information is 35% for this year and that should then be normalized over the years after 2011.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next in line, we have Arndt Ellinghorst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, many thanks. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. On the currency again. If I take your numbers &#x20AC;15 billion, &#x20AC;16 billion of net exposure dollar and renminbi 40% hedged, I assume at around $1.36. We could easily get a headwind of &#x20AC;1.5 billion next year. Now what is your strategy there, would you rather hedge, to let's say 70%, 80% right now, would you rather wait or when is it &#x2013; when would you think it's time for you to really close the open exposure for next year? And I'm asking that especially given that BMW has already hedged 65% to 70% at $1.30 roughly for next year. So there's quite a bit of a difference between the two of you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, and the difference is 20%, therefore, I would not say that it is insofar huge. As I said before, if we do see growth in the business, of course, we will get also nice sales contribution. Of course, the question then is, are we profitable or not? So we are clearly profitable, also with that number, so that you have also to take into account from a pure business perspective.</p>
          <p>At current numbers, I would answer &#x2013; the easy answer would be, of course, I wait unit the dollar comes down again and then I would hedge a little bit more but, of course, that could be a question once in a while. So every prognosis, what we do have right now from banks are not directionally going to $1.48. I regard this number right now not as a very good number to do more hedges but, of course, ask me in two months again, because it's certainly depending on the development of the dollar. We will get every -- we will take every chance as we do see in this volatility to increase our hedge book. But as I said before, right now the $1.48, I don't regard as a very good number to hedge something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. And let me also try another one, I don't know if you can say too much on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given that Dieter Zetsche talked quite a bit about Euro 6 costs when we last met in London, could you give us at least some more color on the costs that the truck business might be facing this year and next year because of Euro 6?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, it's true. Of course, I answered one question, of course, before that we have this year Euro 6 and the new product, so to say, within the European &#x2013; not only within the European market, sorry, but we have also the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:08) in the U.S. and also in Japan. So that will get into -- that will have an impact in third and fourth quarter from a cost point of view, from a launch point of view and at the end, finally capitalizing all and everything. So that could be in the vicinity of &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million which we have incorporated in our forecast. That is roughly, as a matter of easier principle, 1% of Daimler trucks kind of revenue margin. I do think we can -- of course, the underlying business, of course, which goes against that I do think, as I commented before, the sales increase which we see over the next quarters should be very positive. The market share development, I said, will normalize also here in Europe.</p>
          <p>So there are also other effects I would count as positive developments and, therefore, when I see the first quarter development as a indication and, of course, we saw your analysis and your expectations and we have our own plan. We are very positive going into that year and, of course, doing everything that we can lower down the impact on the launch. And that gives us right now, I do think, a good starting point again with the first quarter to work on this development.</p>
          <p>Again, we will also have a very good, I do think, Freightliner North American business, which is really doing very well and going up and, therefore, I do think the objective of the management should be and will be here to manage it in the right direction, means over our overall target of 2013 to achieve the 8%, we have not changed the year. But I do think seeing the development we are right now in the market development on top of strengths on the product, there might be even a probability to talk internally about having these targets maybe a bit earlier, if I might say so.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we have seen the numbers of the competitors. I do think you expect us to do this and, of course, we are doing that closely. We are not finalized with everything what we can seen in their disclosure. But of course, that is something I cannot say, I will not -- we will not accept, but of course, we have clearly our targets to be the number one position in the regions, as we told you. And if somebody is better there, we have to look whether that is sustainable in their basis. If that is sustainable, we have to raise our bar on the one hand or to talk about measures how to pick up. So, no doubts and we have to speed up, so to say, and to talk about further measures.</p>

          <p>Next in line is Ranjit Unnithan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. It's Ranjit Unnithan at JPMorgan. Two questions, one is on cars, the revenue per unit for the car division was about &#x20AC;45,000, which is one of the highest that at least I can see, going back, at least I have to go back to '07 to see similar level.</p>
          <p>So is this a sustainable level of revenue per unit in your view going forward? And looking through the numbers, it's not obvious that there's been a big shift in either country or even product mix, so is this largely driven by pricing? And, I guess the corollary to that question is, if that's true, is there anything that would prevent margins at least chugging along at this level at Mercedes through the rest of the year? So that's a question on Mercedes.</p>
          <p>My second question is on vans. Your target in this division is 9%. You pretty much reached it in the first quarter though the volumes are well below the prior peak. So does this mean that you have to sort of reset the expectation or what you think is the appropriate target for vans, or said differently, is anything is going to happen in the subsequent quarters that should bring the overall margin for vans down?</p>
          <p>And a related question on vans, the Chinese volumes in the van division, last year was I think the first year where you really started having some volumes there. Can you give us some color about the volumes in the van business in China, is it should we assume it is, A, well above sort of the van margins, i.e. above the 9% margin you saw in Q1? And do you have any sales expectations for China? So, it's about 12,000 last year, is it reasonable that that perhaps doubles this year, any color there would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ranjit, for your questions. First your revenue per unit question. So the, I would say, the difference to the first quarter last year &#x2013; although the development is good, of course, no doubt. We have roughly two-thirds of structure and mix effects when you compare Q1 -- sorry, it's one-third is Q1 to Q1 mix and structure effect and two-thirds is, for example, also spare parts business, used car business and so on and so forth. So when we look at this development. But anyway the structure is a very positive one no doubt. When we look very far into the future, of course, we have our MFA business which we are over the next three years moving into Mercedes-Benz. Of course, it will have a volume effect. On the hand, we have also strong S-Class business and E-Class business. So there might be some reduced revenues per unit, but I don't see that as a major impact. We are high, we will stay high and, as I said, with the smaller vehicles, A and B Class successes, there might be a little bit reduced but even higher than, I would say, some of our competitors in this regard. So I don't worry about this.</p>
          <p>Your second question -- and structurally we commented on this, we see a very pretty much balanced regional development of our sales. We have shown that &#x2013; you've seen that now in 2010, you've seen that now in the first quarter. When you compare ourself to 2004 and 2005, our structure is pretty balanced and we see further growth, of course, in China with the 300,000 units in 2015. We see growth in the U.S. So from this point of view, we should see a lot of growth in Brazil, Russia, India and all the other emerging markets, in South Korea. So from that point of view, the balance of the regional structure should be even better in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Vans, an extraordinary, excellent quarter with 8.8%. I would say even at the, yeah, at the benchmark level of 9%, which we picked for the van business. I don't think that this is now a reason right now to adjust our profitability targets. I do think we should do that in the case when we have a sustainable profitability in our business, and we could confirm it. Right now I'm happy about the excellent development there.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have a very good mix in van. We have a lot of options taken by customers which enriches the revenue side so to say per unit. We have, on the other hand, in the first quarter naturally less fleet business, so that will come in on in the next quarters but it's a very good development compared to 2010 and will show us a very good van year in 2011, but nothing to revise right now the targets which we have there.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter in 2011 we had 2000 sales in China. We will launch the Sprinter in the third quarter, I do think in China, so we add another product that, of course, produces also some opportunities again. I do think right now, of course, we are producing there. It's one of the management tasks we have, is to increase the dealer network in China to even grow the business more. So currently, that is one of the main tasks we have, so I do expect to, over the quarters to come, again a good Chinese business for the van business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I can just add some follow-ups. So, for Mercedes, the margin in Q1, anything to suggest that that cannot be maintained going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think -- 9.3%, I don't want to make now a discussion about quarterly development. I do think it confirms -- the 9.3% confirms two subjects. First, that that is a better margin than we had in 2010. That I do think is, first of all, good news because when we see the quarter from a pure revenue point of view, from a pure sales point of view and from the introduction of the C-Class and product portfolio, and so on and so forth, I regard the quality as a very good one. So, it tentatively goes in the direction of our long term target of 10%. And therefore, of course, I'm pretty happy with the development in the first quarter. And of course, you know that we have a year of many product changeovers and, therefore, to conclude on that, very good start and it shows really in the direction of the 10% as we -- as is our target in 2013. Everything is okay.</p>

I do think in with our Indian trucks, we have launched the new brand, BharatBenz, you know it, in February. So, everything is in line to see a product launch in 2012.

          <p>Wunderbar, it's Herr Pieper.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. I had one -- one question was asked more or less, but maybe it's a bit, question in a bit different way, could you &#x2013; the order backlog at Mercedes, could you quantify or at least characterize it maybe in as the average delivery time or something similar? And also from the mix perspective, is it still the case that your order book looks very much like the past few quarters have looked in terms of very high and very rich product mix? And secondly, a small detail, your administrative costs went up quite heavily by 20% in the first quarter, is there any special reason for that or is it just more or less by accident or might it be the point that you hired a couple of engineers here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for your question, Mr. Pieper. I'll start with second one, if you do like me. The first quarter, so far not so bad, when you look at the fourth quarter, the numbers were higher and you remember that we had the Arbeitszeitverk&#xFC;rzung -- means the cut in the personal cost last year in the first quarter and the pay cut. And of course, there you have a natural increase in this regard, but when you look at the overall development of the fourth quarter and the first quarter, it's pretty much okay. The ratios are okay and, of course, we have now incorporated also we had a very good year last year. Some of the bonus payments are also in here, of course, which you don't see, so to say, over the quarters. So development is very okay; I'm very fine with that. Also in the benchmark comparison to others, it's clear, it's okay.</p>
          <p>The difference is always when you compare then two others, what kind of parameter somebody puts into G&amp;A or SG&amp;A, that is always the case. But I'm fine with that development. Your first question was related to trucks or to cars?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To Mercedes cars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mercedes cars, of course, you know that every -- that order intakes and order backlog is a -- it's not a difficult but it's a regional totally different stuff. Of course you have, on the one hand, in the U.S., for example, a totally different system than you have it in Europe, for example. So, I can't answer your question, so to say, on the global, basis. I only can tell you that our new products are absolutely -- when you read all the newspapers, when you read the comparisons to other cars, I do think the SLK, the new C-Class, the CLS, we have a very good feedback from customers and, of course, everybody is keen to the get car in this regard. And you see that our production numbers are very high, so I would say it's &#x2013; let me phrase it this way, it's not so easy to get something because we are producing on a high level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now we have additionally John Lawson from Citi.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. John Lawson from Citi. Good afternoon. Legal issues have cropped up a couple of times in your reconciliation line, causing quite a negative swing. I'm not sure whether you'll be prepared to identify the issue or issues here, but could you at least say whether we should expect a continuation of costs running through further quarters in the balance of the year?</p>
          <p>And, second if you would, the -- I note the very positive swing in cost of risk, in the past the truck businesses created a rather higher structural cost of risk than at some of your peers. I wondered just whether you could say whether what your current experience on truck risk is and whether that's a big part of the swing that you saw in the first quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, to your first question, of course, we have mentioned that in the Interim Report that we have in the reconciliation line item includes corporate expenses, so to say, and possibly related to legal proceedings. As we cannot, we will not and we cannot do any further information on ongoing legal cases and ask for your understanding that we cannot do it and we will not do it.</p>
          <p>For your second question, related to that whether we should forecast anything there, I forecast it every time we get these kind of impacts. But on the other hand, I can also not completely exclude it, so that's to this first question. The second was regarding credit risk on passenger -- or trucks, on trucks. It's structurally worse, of course, that is naturally when you look at passenger car business and truck business, therefore also the financial services profitability has two sides, on the one side is passenger car business and truck business. If you compare to BMW, for example, or to Scania financial services or Volvo financial services. Of course, you have to do this differentiation. We have the mix of it.</p>
          <p>From a trend point of view right now, of course the trend is more or less, I would say, the same. It's positive in the U.S. of course by this upcoming demand. You have every time once in a while a customer which is in trouble, that is naturally. But overall the trend is positively -- what we have included, of course, I mentioned that is in Japan the effect there. But other than this, we have more releases, of course, and the new write-offs, as you have seen. That's it to your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess it would be fair to assume that your truck return on equity and financial services is still quite a bit below your target rate?</p>
