          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Monsanto Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 8, 2008.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Scarlett Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /> and good morning to everyone on the line. I apologize for what would seem to be a little bit of a technical glitch this morning and a later start. And we'll let the call run over a few minutes to accommodate for that.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'd like to welcome you to our 2008 fiscal year-end conference call. And I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; and by Terry Crews, our CFO. And also joining me this morning are Bryan Hurley and Laura Meyer, my colleagues in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we're webcasting this call. And you can access it on our website at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. For those of you who are on the website, the slides for this call are posted on the Investor Information page. And we'll refer to the page numbers, which are on the bottom right hand side of each slide.</p>
          <p>Additionally, on the website, you'll see that we've published the final biotech acreage report, which has been updated from the preliminary forecast we shared in June.</p>
          <p>We're providing you with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases, when we refer to non-GAAP financial measures we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures on the last slide and in the earning press release.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the Company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language, contained in our most recent 10-Q and today's press release.</p>
          <p>Just a week ago, as we were preparing for this call, we were ready to go through a very detailed review of 2008 along with our forecast for 2009 and a revised outlook for our 2012 commitments. It would be an understatement to say that much has changed in just seven short days. We're justifiably proud of our 2008 results but we felt that it would be disingenuous today if we did not address the concerns we're hearing from you.</p>
          <p>Our brand and the premium on our brand is our obsession with innovation and the execution of that innovation in the marketplace. Today, we want to reassure you that our focus on delivering innovation to farmers and the growth that stems from that has not wavered. That said, we want to tackle head-on questions about our pricing flexibility, farmers' financial health and global demand for grain and ultimately about our ability to grow in this less than stable environment.</p>
          <p>To that end, I'm going to do a high-level review of 2008. Terry will tackle 2009 and place our growth in the context of some of the issues we're managing. Hugh will look out to a revised set of commitments to 2012 and how a company like Monsanto can be so bold as to raise projections that are for years out in a world that has become very day-to-day.</p>
          <p>If you would turn to slide four, we provide you with a snapshot of our results for the fourth quarter and the year. At the highest level, net sales rose 35% for the fourth quarter and 36% for the year, predominantly because of the value associated with expanded seed market share, accelerated trait penetration and a rejuvenated Roundup business. This is reflected in gross profit, which increased by more than 45% for both the quarter and the year.</p>
          <p>As you know, gross profit is the most meaningful measure of our business. And we break that metric down for you further on slide five. A couple of highlights are worth noting for the quarter and the full year. One, corn gross profit was down for the quarter, but that would have been as we would have expected, because of the earlier timing of U.S. sales.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we also saw a great start to the Latin American season. And today, we can tell you that we are sold out of our double-stacked trait in Argentina. And we are sold out of our YieldGard Corn Borer trait in Brazil.</p>
          <p>For the full year, corn gross profit crossed the $2 billion mark for the first time, reaching nearly 2.2 billion. This absolute gross profit even outstripped the resurgence in the Roundup business, and it speaks to the success of our yield driven strategy.</p>
          <p>Two; vegetable gross profit nearly touched $400 million for the first time and has grown 33% from the first full year of Seminis' earnings in 2006.</p>
          <p>Three, in total, gross profit for season traits grew 28%, our fifth consecutive year of 20% plus gross profit growth for this segment.</p>
          <p>For branded Roundup, price was the largest contributor to gross profit growth in 2008, with some of our most significant price increases coming in Latin America and Europe. We ended the year with branded prices roughly 10% above the high end of our projected 16 to $18 per gallon band. The average U.S. price in 2008 landed squarely in the middle of that band.</p>
          <p>For the full year, gross margin reached 54%, two years ahead of our earlier projections. The margin acceleration in 2008 was a function of the margin expansion in Roundup. Margins for the Seeds and Traits segment in total were flat at 61%, as we had forecast they would be in our third quarter call.</p>
          <p>The gross profit growth dropped to the bottom line with some modest spending leverage. SG&amp;A, as a percent of sales, declined to 20% and R&amp;D, as a percent of sales, was nearly 9%.</p>
          <p>As we have committed and as you should expect, we once again converted earnings into operating cash. As you see on slide six, free cash flow reached $772 million on the strength of growth in net income. This level of free cash was generated even as we reinvested over $1 billion in acquisitions and technology investments to support our Seeds business.</p>
          <p>We also reinvested an additional 918 million in capital expenditures, over 60% of which went toward new or expanding seed facilities. Another $419 million of cash was returned to shareowners through dividends and just over 360 million through share repurchases, more than 200 million of which were bought during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the best single measure of our success in 2008 was reflected in return on capital, reaching 24%, up from 15% in 2007. This improvement reflects the magnitude of the returns realized against prior investments made in enriching our seed and trait portfolio, upgrading our seed production facilities and processes, and ensuring our world class, lowest cost position for manufacturing Roundup.</p>
          <p>So with that snapshot for 2008 I'd like to turn the call first to Terry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scarlett and good morning to everyone on the line. Even in the best of times, a CFO has to balance three things: earnings, cash flow and the balance sheet. And the key is to do all these things simultaneously and never sacrifice the future for the present.</p>
          <p>As a company driven by technology, we have to be innovative and creative in order to bring groundbreaking products we are known for to farmers. But on the flip side, we can't be clever about execution. We have to be superb at the basic blocking and tackling that delivers the financial results and operational excellence, you and our customers have come to expect and that we demand of ourselves.</p>
          <p>As Scarlett summarized, 2008 was a compelling year on a number of fronts. Growth of this magnitude is impressive. I'm personally proud that our people were able to grow the business at record breaking gross profit levels, while maintaining the financial discipline that allowed gross profit to flow through to earnings, and ultimately be reflected in free cash generation. We neither sacrifice nor shortchanged this year's business for tomorrow's expansion.</p>
          <p>We remain unique as a technology oriented company in the Ag industry in our ability to grow today and to create greater growth for tomorrow, while at the same time having the flexibility to return value to our shareowners across multiple mechanisms, all derived from the value that we return to farmers' worldwide.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide seven, our performance in 2008 is a pillar for our outlook for 2009 and ultimately to our outlook for 2012, which Hugh will address shortly. As we step from 2008 to 2009, we see a path to deliver ongoing EPS of $4.20 to $4.40 for fiscal year 2009. This represents a growth of some 15 to 20% from fiscal year's 2008 ongoing EPS of $3.64. Once again, we'll more than convert the earnings into operating cash and would expect to generate in the neighborhood of 1.8 billion in free cash.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with the income statement for 2009 and take you through the factors that are going to contribute to this earnings growth. One of the key questions about our ability to grow earnings is our ability to price the value and I'll address that as well.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with gross profit. On a gross profit level, growth will be driven by our Seeds and Traits business. We expect this segment to deliver gross profit of approximately 4.5 to $4.6 billion, a growth of 15 to 18%.</p>
          <p>Within this segment, we expect corn gross profit to grow about 25 to 30%, approaching $2.8 billion of gross profit. Our vegetable gross profits similar to corn should see growth of a 25% level, with gross profit of approximately $500 million; for the first time through both our organic growth and the addition of our full year sales from De Ruiter.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in both our soybean and cotton businesses are expected to be relatively flat, compared with fiscal year 2008. Planted soybean acres are expected to be down slightly in the U.S., somewhat offset by the pre-commercial launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and the previously announced price increases.</p>
          <p>Cotton continues to upgrade to second-generation traits, mitigated by continued challenges in the total number of acres that are planted in the U.S. and our continued efforts to upgrade the Deltapine's seed business through our breeding focus.</p>
          <p>The other major component of gross profit in 2009 is Roundup. As we announced last week, we expect our Roundup business to deliver gross profit of 2.3 to $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2009. Pricing, volume and cost of goods sold will all play a role in this growth.</p>
          <p>Our branded Roundup net selling price is expected to remain above our stated range of 16 to $18 per gallon, with volume growth in the low single-digit range. The combination of expansion of margins in corn and vegetables in 2009 should allow us to see roughly a two point lift in our overall gross margins over the 54% we achieved in 2008. We expect that we'll continue to leverage SG&amp;A with a target of 19% of sales.</p>
          <p>And we're entering a critical period in our R&amp;D spend because of the number of projects entering the final phases of large-scale field trials and regulatory reviews. As a result, we have budgeted R&amp;D in the 9.5 to 10% of sales range.</p>
          <p>Finally, we would expect a tax rate in the range of 30 to 31% for the coming year. All of this would roll up to a 200 basis point improvement in ROC. From the seasonality perspective, as we show in slide eight, we would anticipate a pattern similar to what we've experienced in 2008.</p>
          <p>The second and third quarter should be our strongest, with the second expected to be the most significant quarter for the U.S. corn, seeds and traits business. And given these goals, our ability to price to value is a valid concern for our investors. We're hearing that question on two fronts: one for the Seeds and Traits business, given the recent volatility in crop prices; and, secondly for Roundup, given the repricing fluctuations from generic competition.</p>
          <p>So, let me address the Seeds and Traits question first. While commodity prices for the three big crops are off their intra-year highs, they are roughly double what farmers would have experienced just over two years ago. Yet even within this positive farming environment, the question for any agricultural company is this; is your product pricing follow the cyclicality of commodity prices or do you move independently? And the answer, of course, is going to be different by company.</p>
          <p>For Monsanto, our explicit assumption is that we will not price to the peaks and commodity prices, nor will we reduce prices during the valleys. And that's how we built our models. There are two aspects of trait pricing model that are relevant. First, as we show in slide nine, there are three components of our pricing model; substitution value, the value associated with in-seed convenience; and the increased yield.</p>
          <p>The commodity price environment is a factor in only one of those three, the increased yield. And even when we look at yield, we take a three-year look at commodity prices. So in the past two years, our ultimate price list have used commodity prices that have significantly lagged the peak spot prices that we saw in the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, because we price to value, we share that value with farmers. As we create incremental value, a good portion of that value rightfully lands with the farmer. Historically, our share of the total value proposition has been in the range of one-third to one-half. As commodity prices move, this value-sharing concept reflects a bit of a sliding scale. In higher commodity prices, we're sharing less of the value. And at lower commodity prices, our share is greater.</p>
          <p>However, at any price level the farmer's getting a significant amount of value. So, to put it simply, no matter what the commodity price is, our pricing is designed to ensure there is value and motivation for a farmer to use our seed.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 10, you can see how this sharing orientation proves beneficial in any commodity environment. This tracks the U.S. corn market over the last 25 years. If you look at that period from 1996 to today, average corn yields have increased at a pace of about 2.6 bushels per year, creating about 32 bushels of new yield per acre for farmers.</p>
          <p>Using a commodity price in the range of $2 to $4, that's approximately 60 to $125 per acre in new value created. Even though seed costs more than it did 15 years ago, a farmer's getting an average return of $1.50 to $3 with every dollar he is spending on seed because of the value of this technology.</p>
          <p>For more than a year, the conversations we've had with farmers have been around how we create and share in the value and that's the perfect foundation for continuing to explain our value in a dynamic commodity price environment, going into 2009. Given our model and our approach, I feel comfortable about the price levels for our seeds and traits products for this coming season.</p>
          <p>Pricing flexibility is also at the heart of the recent concerns we're hearing about our Roundup business. And we'll provide you with some overall Roundup metrics on slide 11. To that point we believe the global supply and demand dynamics for glyphosate in 2009 will be far more critical than the price of any single raw material, including phosphorus.</p>
          <p>Demand is expected to remain strong for this product and our projections always assumed additional supply from both China and us. Even though recent spot prices on Chinese glyphosate have been fluctuating, they are still at historically high levels; in fact, 30 to 40% higher than their historical lows.</p>
          <p>As we've examined this competitive climate and thus our ability to increase our gross profit, we've looked at four factors. First, we estimate that raw materials comprise 75% of the cost to produce generic glyphosate. By our estimates, all of these raw material costs are currently 25 to 70% above historical lows.</p>
          <p>Secondly, until June 2007, all glyphosate exported from China was done so free of any export tax. That back credit has been cut by more than half and we see no indication that the government has any plans to change that policy.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, cost to institute environmental controls in China are on the rise. Current estimates indicate that new manufacturing facilities are incurring 15% higher costs to incorporate environmental controls.</p>
          <p>And finally, profit margins remain higher than historical levels as Chinese producers funded by private capital, are now focused on earning a return on their investment rather than just selling glyphosate to generate hard currency.</p>
          <p>The price of Roundup is contingent upon many factors though and not just the price in China. As we tried to explain further last week, not solely or even predominantly on the price of phosphorus.</p>
          <p>In short, we are fully aware and have always anticipated that the Chinese manufacturers will bring more supply into the marketplace at a lower price. That lower price, however, is based on the cost position, it is roughly one-third higher and we believe it is a new standard for generic production.</p>
          <p>We expect a tough competitive environment in Roundup but we're confident that we can maintain and will likely extend our cost advantage as well as drive our leadership position for the branded high quality Roundup.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'd like to turn to the cash flow statement and by inference the balance sheet. Not only do I want to address our significant free cash generation, but also want to address the question of farmer liquidity, and how we're managing credit in this current environment.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned previously, earnings should always translate to operating cash. And we would expect our operating cash in 2009 to top $3 billion. Offsetting that will be a continued high level in investment in capital spending as we complete our seed manufacturing expansions and our de-bottlenecking project for Roundup at our Luling facility. As a result, capital spending will run in the $1 billion range next year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'd expect to spend some 200 million in technology investments as we extend our collaborations and partnerships. And anticipate that our partners will deliver on milestones over the next year that further our pipeline.</p>
          <p>Taken as a whole, we would expect to generate 1.8 billion in free cash absent any potential acquisitions. This level of cash generation and the health of our balance sheet give us the flexibility to invest for growth, while still returning value to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>As Scarlett's mentioned already, we've now repurchased more than 670 million in shares and should complete our first $800 million authorization ahead of schedule. And as we've announced previously, once we complete this program, a new $800 million three year plan will automatically go into place.</p>
          <p>We are fortunate in that we have the flexibility to use both share repurchases and dividends to return value to shareowners. And we will continue to do so. Our guidelines for dividends are driven by the philosophy that we should consistently pay out dividends that reflect our earnings growth. And like everything else we do, dividends and share repurchases are our commitments to you.</p>
          <p>We've maintained a high level of financial discipline around the world has been reflected -- it is reflected in our balance sheet. And we plan to continue to do so in 2009. We were at a low level of net debt at the end of 2008 fiscal year. And will likely cross to zero net debt some time in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And given the prudent nature of our credit programs, a low level of fixed-rate debt and the overall health of our balance sheet, we are comfortable that we have the right policies in place to protect and grow our business even through this current credit climate.</p>
          <p>If the health of the farmer globally and his access to credit is a growing concern, given the credit risk that are making headline news today.</p>
          <p>Structurally, as we've shown on slide 12, roughly one-third of U.S. farmers get their financing from the Farm Credit System, a government backed lending earmarked specifically for agriculture. This portion of the credit network for farmers provide the solid anchor that we don't anticipate changing as a result of the current crisis.</p>
          <p>Some 40% of farmers tap into regional and community banks for their funding. In comments last week by an economist with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank noted that small community banks in rural areas in the U.S. generally continue to hold interest rates steady and lines of credit open and are offering new loans. Additionally, the USDA Economic Research Service has indicated that the debt asset ratio for farmers is at a very low 10 to 12%.</p>
          <p>But, in addition to those comments, we've also just completed a round of conversations with some of the largest lenders in the agricultural space. And there continues to be confidence in the availability of credit for farmers going into the 2009 season. These lenders are telling us that as a normal course of business; they're already renewing and increasing credit lines for their customers, so that the purchases for this season can begin. Fundamentally, a farmer on solid financial footing should be able to access any credit they need to run their normal operations.</p>
          <p>Outside of the U.S., the next area we watch is Latin America, particularly Brazil and Argentina. We're well into the buying season in both places and seed is beginning to go into the ground. In that environment, we've not seen any issue with farmers accessing credit for inputs.</p>
          <p>Brazil does have a second summer season for corn, so while financing looks strong for the first crop; we will continue to monitor the situation for the <mark type="inaudible" /> season. But more generally speaking, the governments in Brazil and Argentina have historically being quick to act to provide liquidity in the agricultural sector so that precedent also contributes to some optimism for the coming season.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are obviously watching farmer liquidity closely, but we're comfortable that our strong balance sheet will serve us well through any softness. That said we intend to maintain our conservative credit policies globally. In the U.S., we'll mitigate a great deal of risk in our seed business by collecting a significant level of prepayments, which was roughly 70% of our net sales for the business last year. And to the extent that we don't receive prepayments we'll offer terms to strong creditworthy farmers.</p>
          <p>On the chemical side of the business, we've moved to essentially a cash terms model. In Brazil, some 55% of our sales are for cash or grain, or for terms that were securitized with grain and land. And, in Argentina, nearly 75% of our sales are for cash or collateralized with grain contracts.</p>
          <p>The credit policy that we've put in place over the last six years, have led to some of our lowest DSOs in the Company occurring in Brazil and Argentina in 2008. Much like Roundup, you have to separate the noise that you hear about credit for other agriculture inputs from our business. We are in the business of providing innovation and innovation is valued and thus paid for differently by the farmer than his other purchases that doesn't make us immune to the situation, but it does make us different.</p>
          <p>In summary, we completed the 2008 fiscal year ahead of plan, both operationally and financially. And that's brought us to our 2009 commitments with confidence that we can deliver another year of exceptional growth, based on the value and innovation we deliver to growers around the world.</p>
          <p>This value will be reflected across our key financial metrics of gross profit, earnings per share and free cash flow and it will be done so with prudent management of our balance sheet while aggressively returning value to shareowners through our investments in dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>We're a unique company in the agricultural space and because our success is a direct derivative of our investment in research and our conversion of technology into practical products that drive yield on the farm. Because we invest for and are driven by innovation, we will marry short-term execution with long-term returns. And our ability to balance both as Hugh will explain shortly speaks to our performance in 2008 as the platform support the promise and the potential for the next four years.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Hugh to discuss our outlook through 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Terry. Thank you, Scarlett and thanks to everybody on the line this morning. We recognize that this is a difficult period in which to devote an hour of your day to one company. So, thank you.</p>
          <p>Terry has walked you through our outlook for the coming fiscal year and he's addressed two of the most pressing macro conditions that will affect our ability to meet our 2009 earnings and our free cash objectives.</p>
          <p>My job today is to reach out to 2012, it's a task that's somewhat like shouting into a hurricane. But, I want to do so because just 11 short months ago, we laid out a five-year path to growth. So, while we can't control weather, planted acreage or commodity prices, we do control the factors that truly feed our business, wrapped in a climate of long-term global grain demand. Our ability to do so will be a direct function of our ability to execute, to grow market share, to expand trait penetration and to convert our portfolio to new game changing platforms.</p>
          <p>When we first unveiled our 2012 commitments, I thought they were bold. Nearly, one year and one economic crisis later, I still think they're bold but I remain confident that we can deliver on our commitments and then some. So, I'd like to walk you through the updates to our 2012 commitments, and address the biggest macroeconomic condition that will affect our ability to meet these goals. Simply put as the question of the trends and global demand for grains.</p>
          <p>Even all the recent attention on Roundup, as we look to 2012, growth is a function of seeds and traits. Last November, we projected that we deliver 6.5 to $7 billion in gross profit in 2012 over the 2007 base of $3 billion. But our original projection assumed no acquisitions and since that time as you know we've added De Ruiter vegetable seeds and Cristiani cottonseeds for our portfolio. And we're now developing a new seed treatment platform as well.</p>
          <p>So, if you please turn to slide 13, the combination of accelerated organic growth and these acquisitions and expansions, now leads us to believe that we can deliver gross profit in the range of 7.3 to $7.5 billion for seeds and traits in 2012. This equates to a compound annual growth rate of 18 to 20%. We expect corn and vegetables in this timeframe to each grow at more than 2.5 times, as 2007 gross profit. And our soybean and cotton platforms should nearly double their gross profit contributions from the 2007 base to 2012.</p>
          <p>Our plans assume that Roundup fluctuates around $1.9 billion over the next four years to 2012, without trying to project the peaks and the valleys, simply stated the growth from the acquisitions of De Ruiter and Cristiani from 2008 to 2012, will offset a significant portion of that decline. And the remainder will be more than covered by the acceleration of our seeds and traits.</p>
          <p>With the sale of our dairy business, the remainder of our Ag productivity segment should contribute a steady $300 million in gross profit through this plan. If you took all of this together, we're now committing to lifting gross profit for the entire company to 9.5 to $9.75 billion through 2012, or roughly 2.25 times our original 2007 base.</p>
          <p>Over the next four years, we anticipate that margins will continue to expand, particularly given the Seed and Trait contribution. We've now established the target of margins of approximately 65% for Seeds and Traits, and a goal of total company margins of 58 to 60%.</p>
          <p>If you look out four years for our business, you have to ask, if the macro trend of greater grain demand holds true. Today, we believe that the simple answer is yes. While it's impossible to predict if the trajectory has a five degree slope or a 10 degree slope, all the evidence says that the combination of historically low, even dangerously low ending stocks with continued increase protein consumption will drive the need for more grain and thus more yield.</p>
          <p>The best source that I could refer you to is the USDA's Agricultural Projections to 2016 report. The link of which is now posted on our website. Here, the authors concludes that world consumption of grain, oilseed and meat commodities have exceeded world production in the past several years, reducing global stocks.</p>
          <p>These tight market conditions are expected to persisted for most of the coming decade, specifically the global corn trade is expected to grow about 15% from 92 million metric tons in 2008 to a 105 million metric tons in roughly 2017, as you can see in slide 14.</p>
          <p>Imports grow more substantially in Mexico and in China. Global soybean trade in the same timeframe grows by some 40%, with China consuming 80% of this import growth. Through this same timeframe, the USDA forecasts U.S. corn and soybean acres at roughly 90 and 70 million acres respectively, which is similar to our underlying assumptions for 2009 specifically and our assumptions through 2012 generally.</p>
          <p>So, for those of you who worry about ethanol, and I have to confess that I'm not one of you. We believe that a change in the ethanol mandate would not have a material effect on planted corn acreage. Most people forget that an acre of corn that goes into ethanol production gives off two value streams: one of ethanol, and one of distiller's dry grain for animal feed.</p>
          <p>So, if the United States never produced another gallon of ethanol, we'd still need to feed cattle and those acres that today produce both ethanol and feed would largely revert to being used for animal feed. Thus, the total planted acres of corn shouldn't be adversely affected.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to growers in the countries around the world that use our technologies is that we'll double their yields in corn, soy and cotton by 2030. The facts are clear and compelling, given the demand for food, feed and fuel regardless of the trajectory of the curve, we are going to need more yield in every acre. Of all the tools that a farmer has at his disposal, the innovation unlocked from breeding and biotechnology has consistently delivered on the promise of more yields for a $1 invested.</p>
          <p>So, as we show in slide 15, simply stated my case to you today is that in a world of increasing uncertainty, we at Monsanto believe that there is substantial growth still to come. We're poised to launch multiple game changing platforms that will rewrite productivity per acre, extend our competitive position and create a compelling business opportunity for us well into the next decade.</p>
          <p>As the financial markets sort themselves out, our basic premise will be the same; greater grain demand drives the need for more yield. More yield drives the need for more productivity per acre. And more productively requires innovation. And that's us. So when a Monsanto sales rep walks up to the farm gate, he's focused on selling value and innovation.</p>
          <p>He's having the one conversation about the one agricultural input that matters most to the farmers for all time, and that's the seed. Inside that simple seed is a powerhouse of technology, the likes of which farmers have never had accessed to before. And that's that innovation that will carry the day.</p>
          <p>So, we will be there when the farmer plants. We'll be there when he harvests. And we'll be there when he succeeds. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Scarlett, in anticipation of your questions. Scarlett?</p>

          <p>It is. My name is not George yet, but anything is possible. I just wanted to ask about soybeans. Previously, you talked about at least 5% gross profit growth in soybeans and now you've got a $700 million number up there on the slide versus 725 last year. I'm just wondering if the reconciliation there had something to do with the cost of soybeans?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question Vincent. This is Terry. I think that the &#x2013; there's a couple of factors that went into that. One of those is soybeans ended up higher in this year than what we were anticipating when we talked about a 5% growth, because we had some late licensee reporting and that was the reason for the positive fourth quarter soybeans. So, actually it became not a reduction of our expectation for next year, but just a comparator versus a higher number in 2008. So, I feel <mark type="inaudible" /> confident of our soybean business going in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's been a while since we've had a strong dollar. I was just wondering if you could help us or refresh our memories in terms of how we should be thinking about currency impacts related to perhaps Brazil or Argentina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's -- it's a good question given the current market for foreign currency. I begin with a blanket statement that coming into 2009 we anticipated that the dollar would strengthen versus the major currencies where we do business. But those currencies do continue to weaken as we move into 2009. And, last year, we probably had in effect somewhere in the range of $0.15 from the weaker dollar. Our assumption, some of that would come back into 2009.</p>
          <p>I think the good thing for us is the nature of the way we're doing business in Brazil and Argentina. We're keeping a much lower risk profile there. And that's the key as we continue to move into the season, so good start for the first season there. Second season we need to stay focused on our credit policy, so that we don't suffer disproportionately as it relates to that currency change.</p>
          <p>But, let me begin by emphasizing again that we did assume a strengthening dollar in our 2009 guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, I recall -- I think about three years ago you were talking about 2010 and saying that you could pretty much see it from there, which is a couple of years ago and lo and behold it's -- you could really see it from here at the fourth quarter of '08. And I wanted to follow-up on the soybean question, obviously, Terry addressed the outlook for soybeans in 2009 and I was curious Hugh, as to what your take is today on your outlook for soybean profitability in 2010, fiscal 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We see -- so Frank thanks for the question. We see opportunities in 2010. You're right. We, in '07, I said you could touch '10 and now we're planning for '10. So the seed that we're producing this year will be the start for Roundup Ready 2 Yield which will be the springboard into '10. So, we're looking at 5 to 6 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the 2010 year, which is a gigantic start, for a launch of new technologies.</p>
          <p>So, I'm optimistic, 7, 11% increase in yield, brand new product. We've announced price and there's pricing upside and we'll share that value with the farmer, but I think that Roundup Ready 2 Yield in '10 is a game changer. And in the same way that we've seen stacking in corn, Roundup Ready 2 Yield provides the opportunity to start that stacking strategy again in beans so nice upside. I think just last point in this -- as we look at '09, we're looking through '09 into '10 and Roundup Ready 2 Yield is to beans what our SmartStax launch is to corn and both of those have a trajectory that'll really start counting in '10 and '11. Terry, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is just probably the best way to illustrate our confidence in beans is that we would expect by 2012 to roughly double the gross profit from beans that we've generated in 2007. So --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2009 looks a bit down too because we've assumed lower acreage in beans in the U.S. So, the combination of those things, but we feel very good about soybeans and our ability to move Roundup Ready 2 Yield to the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'10 is a big year Frank. It's a transition to triples on the SmartStax and it's when Roundup Ready 2 Yield really cuts free. So, it's, we were talking about it from '07, but '10 is on top of us now.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Thanks. You indicated that you expect to be crossing the line into positive territory on your balance sheet with cash sometime early in '09. I'm wondering, where does that balance sheet go, if indeed you hit your earnings targets through 2012? Are you intending to become a bank or are you considering, maybe adding some leverage and buying shares? And during this period of time between now and 2012, where does your return on capital go also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> thanks for the questions. And I'll take the first swing at it and I'll let Terry follow up. So, generating enormous amounts of cash in the environment we're in today is a wonderful dilemma. Our use of cash &#x2013; we'll continue -- I think there's two or three of these and I'll let Terry expand on them.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue to look for opportunities that strengthen or expand our seed franchises. And my guess is as you look through 2012, they'll be increasingly international. So, those opportunities continue to exist and you need to be ready for those and I think cash on hand gives you the opportunity to act quickly.</p>
          <p>Second one is again -- talks to the same area and that's how we strengthen our technologies, either bolster technologies that we have or expand our technology franchises through investments as well. And then the other two is we've always talked about is continuing to bolster our dividends and continuing to be aggressive in share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Now, the nice thing about the cash levels we're generating is these aren't either/ors. I think it allows you to do all three at the same time, but I'll Terry address your question on whether we are considering becoming a bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer to that is we're not considering becoming a bank. I am -- I do feel very good though in this environment to be able to say that we've got enough of a cash position to finance our working capital through the season. And we're not relying on other means of credit. So, believe that that's a good position to be in. But fundamentally, it's not the right place as a company be holding cash on our balance sheets and we need to continue to look to ways Hugh has referred to reinvest cash, either into our business or returning it to shareholders to let them make their choices with their own cash.</p>
          <p>We've indicated already that we're going to be more aggressive in our share buyback program. That was indicated in our 200 million that we did in the fourth quarter. And we continue to buy into the first part of the first quarter as well. And I'm very confident we'll be into our second tranche of share buybacks before we get to the end of the -- pre-determined end of the first share buyback program. So, we'll continue to look at that.</p>
          <p>Return on capital, obviously, we haven't put a metric out, but obviously it's going to continue to improve. We had an incredible lift in return on capital this past year. We're talking about another 200 basis points this coming year. And not to talk about old times, but I can remember a time when it was difficult to even discuss return on capital because of the look of our balance sheet. I'm really pleased with where we're at now and that's a number that we'll continue to rise as well. But we do need to make sure that we've got this cash that's going to be coming our way in the next three years, appropriately reinvest it or return back to shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think in your last press release you guys talked about undertaking a study of the glyphosate markets globally, so just had a couple of questions on some conclusions out of that.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I'm wondering are you the only DEA route to Roundup or glyphosate so that the rest of the world's using glycine and is that over time a competitive advantage or a disadvantage? And then secondly, the growth rate that you show in gallons for '08 doesn't look all that exciting. Can you give us some sense of what you expect sort of in '09 and '10? And then lastly, we've been hearing from some large sources of generic salt selling at a lower price and I'm just curious is that just a flush out of inventory after this season or do you think there's something else going on there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Bob thanks for your threefer or your fourfer. So, let me just ...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I did it all at once, Hugh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And without breathing, which is great. So, we have concluded, I mean the product's 35 years old, we're always &#x2013; it's part of the culture here is continuing to kick the tires on Roundup. But we did a real deep dive in the last six months. So, before we dive down into alternate recipes and so on, if you take the high level view on Roundup, let me just give you a couple of snapshots. So by 2012, we lifted our targets and said that we'll crank out about $1.9 billion of gross profit. And then in order to land $1.9 billion of gross profit, Roundup's going to run in our corridor of about 16 to $18 a gallon.</p>
          <p>Last year, we were trading above that. As we look into this year, I mean super early days this year but based on what Terry's reporting on Brazil and Argentina. Again, this year we're seeing that elevated pricing there. And that's a function of supply and demand and it's a function of elevated cost in China. So, that's the headlines in four or five chapters.</p>
          <p>On DEA versus glycine, these are two different routes, the glycine route's a lot more expensive. China is now using DEA and they've been using that for quite some considerable time. So, I wouldn't lose too much sleep on that, Bob.</p>
          <p>Our leverage versus China as Terry went through is four or five points on energy, on environment or treatment of waste, of the VAT tariffs have been applied. It gets down to more than a single process of a single raw material. On your last one on &#x2013; anemic or less than exciting growth, we've always assumed single-digit volume growth and I think when you look at the rate of expansion of Roundup Ready, single-digit volume growth is -- I think that's realistic. So let me not excite but we're going to bring back 2.3 to $2.4 billion of gross profit on a 35-year old product. And I think the key for us is giving you the headlines that you can count on as you're building these models. Terry, I don't know if you can add to Bob's three four questions?</p>

          <p>I think Hugh covered most of your questions, Bob. Just to make one comment about pricing. At this time of the year there's always some flushing out of inventory that goes through in the processing of glyphosate so we're not startled by what we're hearing right now. But having said that, the supply demand situation, we believe, will be solved. And that's why we think that longer term, it looks like a $1.9 billion GP instead of the 2.3 to 2.4 we'll generate this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Terry, on slide 12, you've outlined in a very helpful way the structure or sources of credit available to you as growers. I was wondering if you could comment on the structure of the Ag credit markets in Brazil and Argentina, what you think the implications are for availability of credit there? And then with regard to the <mark type="inaudible" /> season, markets remain dislocated into that, what is your relative exposure there compared to the first growing season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll begin with the last question -- response to the last question, first. We would be less in the summer season -- the <mark type="inaudible" /> season than we are in the current season. So one of the things that we're always pleased to get through is the first season in Brazil. So it's less of an impact in the second season for us. In Brazil, though, the credit structure, it's a little bit similar to the U.S. structure, there's government financing that comes from the official bank, the Bank of Brazil and then there's subsidized government financing, something we call <mark type="inaudible" /> credit which we try to avail ourselves to as well.</p>
          <p>But then when you go beyond that, it's export lines or companies providing. Obviously, we're selling a lot of our business in cash as we've already indicated by our higher prepay number being this year associated with Brazil. So, for the first season, it seems like that financing is available. For the second season, the choices we'll make is whether we'll finance the customer through that summer season, and our policy in the past and I think we'll still adhere to that policy, there's going be a tight credit policy because the exposure may be greater than the opportunity.</p>
          <p>But Kevin, I think it's something we have to assess when we get to that season. I don't think the current environment is the time to be assessing where we'll get to there. But I think in general, I would say credit available right now, and it looks fine for us in this coming season.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we do most of our business there by cash or grain but actually Argentina appears a bit stronger right now than Brazil, the banking system does. So we're not seeing the kind of concerns coming into our Argentina business as we might see in the second season in Brazil. And again, Argentina just cyclically, most of it we get seasonality, most of Argentina we get through in our first quarter, and, then the next time we really visit Argentina, is in the fourth quarter when we begin selling corn seeds. So, there'll be a lot of water to go under the bridge between now and then.</p>
          <p>But right now both countries look fine for this part of the year and then we'll re-assess the summer season once we get through this season in Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Hugh, this question is for you. If you take a look at the Roundup, if you've enjoyed a great windfall with gross profits quadrupling over maybe a three-year period to the $2.4 billion, how should we think about how you intend to use that windfall? In terms of R&amp;D, perhaps in seeds and traits, more crops, more countries. The windfall is great but using it wisely of course is also important as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no Mark, I agree, there's no monopoly on wisdom. I think what we've done in the last few years is we've demonstrated that. So for me, it's not theory, it's practice, and the practice says that if you look at our vegetable acquisitions both Seminis and particularly De Ruiter, you look at Deltapine Land, look at Cristiani these are all investment that the house of Roundup has largely paid for.</p>
          <p>And if you think about a trajectory through 2012, as we continue to migrate this business to that seeds and traits platform, I think the wisdom in this business on a year-on-year, on a season- season basis is how do you take cash generated from a 35-year old business, reinvest it on new and existing seed platforms that command an ever better margins and use that to drive your business forward? So, if past actions are any indication of future performance, that's the path that we're on.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Brazil, some companies are expecting acreage to be down, especially in northern parts like <mark type="inaudible" />. What's your expectation for planted acres in Brazil this year when you combine summer and <mark type="inaudible" /> season? And if you do believe that acres are down, then what do you think will happen to soft commodity prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not hearing that right now. We'd say -- our guess would be probably flat -- or flat to marginally up. But we haven't heard down. Argentina is a different story because they have had very, very dry conditions there. So, it's not an economic trend. And as Terry said, quite the contrary at the moment, lousy planting conditions as the run-up for the season, P.J. So Terry, I don't know what you're hearing. But that's -- so far we haven't heard that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I would add is, the only conversations that we've had is probably what maybe other than what Hugh mentioned on corn in Argentina is where corn and Brazil might go and there, there could be a little bit of softness of corn in Brazil. So I'm really pleased to know that we've already sold out of new YieldGard trait there, so feel good about that. And the rest of that market probably isn't so much to us whether it's up or down a million acres or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you believe the marginal acres in northern area, if commodity prices come down, will continue to plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean I can't really project where those acres would go. But even if you're talking about $9 soybeans compared to where it was a few years ago and they were still planting about those many acres. So it's still at least $3 above where they were when they planted this kind of acreage in the past. So I don't know. We don't project commodity prices or acres but just conventional wisdom would say there's still a lot of value there for them to plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first determinant is did you get rainfall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are the conditions good for planting? Rainfall is about as easy to predict as commodity prices. Once you go over that first hurdle, I think Terry's right given -- particularly, given where bean prices are versus historical levels, my guess is they'll go ahead and put seeds in the ground.</p>

          <p>Our final question for today comes from the line of Don Carson of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Hugh, in addition to grain prices coming down in general, we've seen quite a shift in corn versus soy and the advantage for the U.S. grower of planting corn has pretty much evaporated. Now, historically, you've been somewhat indifferent between whether a farmer here plants corn or soy, how does that unfold over the next few years as you launch Roundup Ready 2 Yield this year and SmartStax in 2010. Are you still relatively indifferent or do you become more focused on corn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still relatively indifferent, probably a slight edge on corn, but I think your assumption that -- so your assumption that the golden days of corn are over for American farmers. I'm not sure I would agree with that. So to the very first line of questions that we started this call were, here is how I would look at it, as you look at '09 through '10, and you think of the continued uptick in yield and then the extra bump that we get with SmartStax for the change in refuge and better bug control. I think the key in this rather than getting hooked into the arbitrage between corn and beans, I think the investment hypothesis going forward is whoever drives yields wins.</p>
          <p>And as the farmer looks to trade-off between corn and beans on fixed acres, the real pinch point that says, how do you drive yields on fixed acres Don. So I'm less worried about the corn, soy tradeoff -- I think it's a big deal for fertilizer companies, less for us. I think the real driver for us is global demand and as people -- I don't think that -- that's going to go backwards. And I think despite all this, people are going to continue to eat and that's what will drive the corn not as much acreage as the demand for yield Don, in acre going forward. That's where we'll win or lose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question Don and thank you to all of you for staying with us this morning, and I'm sorry for the technical hitch in getting started. I appreciate you hanging with us at the backend of the call. And for those of you that own our stock, I'd like to thank you for your investment and your continued confidence in us. It's not easy to take an hour out of your day in a time of such uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you how we're thinking about it here and how I think of it personally, my -- and it kind of goes to Don's last question. My touchstone in all of this and I hope that it's yours as the farmer, I'll leave it to the government agencies to track these things, often retrospectively to worry about whether soybeans are 70 million acres or 69 or where corn is going to end up. And I'll leave it to much smarter people than me to speculate on whether corn is $4 or $4.50. What I'm obsessed about and what our team obsesses about here is the farmer.</p>
          <p>And how we deliver value to him year-in and year-out because it's value that's rewarded, that's when he chooses to seed every spring. My job and the job of my team here is to turn that share &#x2013; is in turn to share that value with you. So I think of your touchstone to farmer that at times like this, it kind of helps from time-to-time to pull on a pair of boots and go and ride in a combine. And that's what I did last weekend. And I saw not too far from here, I saw 170 bushel DEKALB triple-stacked corn being harvested with yields that in fields have never delivered over 150 bushels before.</p>
          <p>And I think if we can do that year-after-year, farm-after-farm, country-after-country around the world, we'll meet our commitments to more than double gross profit in 2012. And we'll meet our commitments to double yields by 2030.</p>
          <p>So, thanks very much again to all of you for joining us today, and we hope only the best for you and your families in this time of great uncertainty. Thanks for your support.</p>
