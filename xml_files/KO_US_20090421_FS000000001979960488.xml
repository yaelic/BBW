        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Before we get into an overview of our performance, let me just start by saying how humbled and honored I am to take on the additional role and responsibility of Chairman of the Board for our company and honored to succeed my good friend, Neville Isdell, in this capacity.  Future histories written about Coca-Cola will show that Neville helped lead our company out of some very tough times.  His statesmanship and passion for improving the environmental, social and economic well being of our planet has been invaluable for everyone touched by our company, our system and our brands.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to report another solid quarter of growth for the Coca-Cola Company, despite severe global economic headwinds.  We again exceeded our long-term profit targets, delivered volume growth in line with our expectations and executed on productivity initiatives ahead of schedule.  Importantly, we delivered consistent and balanced top and bottom-line performance results.</p>
          <p>Globally, our unit case volume increased 2% successfully cycling 6% growth in the first quarter of last year.  Our international operations increased volume 3% cycling 8%.  These sound results reflect a company-wide disciplined focus on balancing the volume value equation to deliver consistent, quality revenue and operating income growth.  We delivered quarterly revenue growth of 7% and operating profit growth of 17% on an ongoing currency neutral basis.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide team continued to drive productivity initiatives and cost savings throughout the business routinely adjusting and tweaking our actions to changing market conditions.  We remain well on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings from these productivity initiatives by year end 2011.  The continued acceleration of these efforts is enabling our cash to be redeployed to drive investments for growth.</p>
          <p>As expected, global currency fluctuations negatively impacted results this quarter.  We continue to monitor this volatility and actively manage this risk where appropriate.  As a reminder, we manage our global businesses in local currencies in order to make more effective decisions that deliver long-term sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Our international markets remain significant contributors to our solid performance results.  Our systems' reach provides expanding opportunities to touch more and more customers every day and in turn, create new revenue streams for our sparkling as well as still brands.</p>
          <p>The company achieved unit case volume growth across a diverse geographic footprint.  Many key markets delivered at or above expectations this quarter with Mexico up 6% and Brazil growing 4%, both cycling 11% growth from prior year.  Northwest Europe was up 3% on strong performance in Great Britain.  Also Korea increased 5% as our new bottling partner continued to improve execution in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We continue to gain strength in many emerging markets.  In our 120 countries with per caps less than 150, our volume growth was 4% for the quarter cycling 10% in the prior year.  India was up 31% and China up 10%, both cycling double-digit growth.  In Southeast Asia, Thailand was up 7% and Vietnam 8%, while Nigeria was up 6% and Southern Eurasia up 7.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our highly experienced operating team continued to navigate current challenges by making well-focused, disciplined decisions geared toward further building our brands.  The real strength of our franchise model is demonstrated in difficult times and we are working harder than ever to continue to bring value to our consumers and customers.</p>
          <p>All these efforts and opportunities are supported by a very strong balance sheet.  This provides us the flexibility to leverage opportunities this environment may offer and to continue rewarding our share owners with consistent dividend growth.  Unlike many companies that decided to cut dividends during this difficult period, we announced an 8% increase in dividends per share, the 47th consecutive annual increase.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that our system is more aligned than ever before.  The franchise model in its broadest sense is still the best way to win in the marketplace. It gives us the focus we need, the global breadth and scale and the local leadership.  Nothing is more important than exceeding our customers' expectations and selling our brand portfolio every single day in every single outlet.  We continue to work closely with our bottling partners to improve our capabilities, further strengthen our brands and leverage our significant marketing and distribution investments.</p>
          <p>With established market presence far beyond our nearest competitor, we are in a uniquely strong position to drive continued solid growth and with a system that generates up to $50 million in cash every day, we will continue to invest in our system and make it stronger.  Together with our bottling partners and customers, we remain committed to executing real equity building brand propositions to ensure we emerge from these difficult times even stronger.</p>
          <p>Simply said, as the world's leading beverage company, we strive to create brand value through world-class integrated marketing innovation and segmented execution with our customers.  While our competitors may choose a different path through heavy price discounting or promotion, we do not believe this builds the enduring brand equity that sustains our business.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, brand health and share gains will be key success metrics over the coming year.  In fact, once again this quarter, we gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of globally winning share in both.  Despite tough market conditions, we continue to outperform the industry across most key categories and are aggressively looking for opportunities to profitably gain share from competitors.</p>
          <p>Our brands' health scores, which measure consumers' favorite brands, continued to improve as we invest in our consumer marketing and activate at the point of sale, always striving to create the perfect shopper experience, outlet by outlet and market by market.  We firmly believe our business will continue to experience growth across all categories and all geographies.  Current population and personal expenditure trends indicate that consumers will increasingly have the opportunity to pause for the simple moments of pleasure that we already provide nearly 1.6 billion times a day for cents at a time.</p>
          <p>The global economic crisis, while big in scale and scope, has certainly been less daunting for businesses like ours that provide affordable, high velocity products that are a staple in consumers' daily lives.  For billions of consumers around the world, Coca-Cola and our other 500 brands remain an affordable luxury.  This is a wonderful space to be in today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>In my recent travels around the world, I've been encouraged by discussions I've had with leaders from various business and government sectors who all seem to be focused on cooperative multilateral approaches to solving the global economic crisis.  The recent G20 Summit was certainly reflective of this mood and we believe a harbinger of more positive actions to come.</p>
          <p>For these and other reasons, we feel good about not only weathering this crisis but preparing ourselves to come out of it stronger and more nimble than ever.  I am confident that our strong brands and solid business fundamentals will enable our management team to meet our long-term targets this year.  Given the environment, however, there may be bumps along the way and we may experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility.  We credit our continued solid results to a consistent set of strategic priorities and these priorities are the foundation of our sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, we are focused on driving growth in sparkling and still beverages.  Unit case volume for sparkling beverages which are the oxygen of our business was led by broad-based international growth of 1%.  Some highlights for sparkling beverage growth from around the world include: Japan up 12%, India up 31%, Brazil up 3%, China 4%, Great Britain 9% and South Africa 2%.</p>
          <p>Coca-Cola, the world's most valuable and loved brand, increased brand health scores in most of our key countries including the U.S., and we gained sparkling beverage share across most of our key global markets.  Coke Zero continued its success increasing 14%.  Sprite, now our third 2 billion unit case trademark, was driven by international growth of 5% led by China, India, and Egypt.</p>
          <p>On the marketing front, our new "Open Happiness" campaign was launched.  The campaign is successfully connecting the brand with key target audiences: teens and moms, driving recruitment and retention. As part of our fully integrated campaign, we released the Open Happiness single on iTunes.  This spirited and positive single has already reached over 400,000 plays on MySpace Music and made it into the top 40 on the iTunes pop chart.</p>
          <p>Our still beverage unit case volume increased 9% as we focused on organic growth of our mega brands and leveraged our recent strategic acquisitions.  Internationally, still beverages were up 13%.  We gained still beverage volume and value share globally driven by vitaminwater and our global juice, tea, sports drinks and energy brands.</p>
          <p>We remain the world's number one juice and juice drinks company and are gaining share with our key brands Minute Maid Pulpy, Minute Maid Enhanced, Simply Orange and Jugos del Valle.</p>
          <p>Also, we recently announced an investment in Innocent which has quickly become one of Britain's top brands by marketing its healthy ingredients and social commitments.</p>
          <p>While we are disappointed that we did not receive approval for the proposed Huiyuan acquisition, we remain firmly committed to our long-term growth model in China.  We have made significant incremental investments in the past several years and remain focused on driving organic growth across our still brands portfolio.</p>
          <p>Glac&#xE9;au, led by vitaminwater and smartwater, continued to gain volume and value share as we introduced vitaminwater10, the first ingredient innovation behind this dynamic brand.  We will expand vitaminwater's footprint aggressively including launches in ten more international markets this year, bringing the total to 15.</p>
          <p>Accelerating innovation is our second priority.  We are applying new thinking to quickly rapidly leverage our R&amp;D investments across our global operations.  For example, our breakthrough fountain dispensing technology, which we highlighted at CAGNY, allows consumers to select from over 100 branded beverages.  This product has entered into commercial testing in both Atlanta and Southern California.  Our digital vending machine, which marries sight, sound and refreshment at the point of sale and was first used at the Beijing Olympic Games can now be found in selected malls across the United States.</p>
          <p>Our third priority is leveraging our geographic footprint. During the quarter, we continued to perform well in Latin America with our strong franchise model, delivering balanced growth as well as sparkling and still share gains.  Coca-Cola increased 2% and still beverages increased 33% as we continued to integrate and expand the Jugos del Valle business.  We remain optimistic about Latin America for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Japan held volume outperforming the non-alcoholic beverage industry resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of share gains.  Our success in growing sparkling continues with trademark Coca-Cola 14 and Fanta up 16%.  We expect to deliver consistent performance in this challenging climate and will continue to focus on our key mega brands in Japan including further strengthening Georgia Coffee and returning Sokenbicha and Aquarius to consistent growth.  The acquisition of a 50% stake in the Tone bottler will further improve our capabilities in the critical Kant&#x14D; region.</p>
          <p>Europe gained share in both sparkling and still categories and across key countries as the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry slowed, especially in away from home channels and consumer confidence has been at historically low levels throughout the continent of Europe.  That said, we remain focused on winning in the marketplace behind our key brands and executing programs to leverage the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>Strong performance in Great Britain was offset by Central and Eastern Europe where economies were impacted by severe currency devaluations.  We continue to proactively navigate this environment using a number of pan-European initiatives.  For example, we are communicating value propositions by integrating advertising, in-store and on-pack messaging for both immediate and future consumption packages.  This approach is working well in Italy and is now being carried to France and Spain.</p>
          <p>We're also intensifying our promotional activity and in-store activation with new "Coke and meals" programs.  The aim here is to drive traffic and educate our customers on the Coke value proposition while maintaining margins. In particular, we're using these tactics in Eastern Europe to address rapidly shifting consumer shopping behavior.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're accelerating new product launches in many markets including new packaging for our successful energy drinks and increasing multipack formats more broadly across Europe.  We expect the retail environment in Europe to remain challenging throughout 2009.  Our European leadership team continues to proactively identify opportunities to capture share and maintain a strict focus on strengthening brand health in order to emerge in an even stronger position from this crisis.</p>
          <p>In North America, we again outperformed the industry gaining volume share for the fifth consecutive quarter and value share for the second consecutive quarter.  Our determination to become the undisputed beverage leader drove gains in sparkling and still beverages led by our focus on juice, sports drinks and active lifestyle beverages as well as tea.  We have a clear and aligned system strategy for delivering sustainable growth and we are leading the industry in building value-creating brands.</p>
          <p>Effective marketing campaigns have led to across-the-board increases in brand health driven by the new "Open Happiness" consumer campaign for consumer brand Coke, NCAA Coke Zero March Madness activation and the Diet Coke Hard Truth integrated marketing program.  In addition, our still brands continued to lead the industry in overall growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by a robust pipeline of innovation.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong performance from POWERADE, Gold Peak tea and Minute Maid Enhanced as well as Simply chilled juices which are fueling leadership growth in the category.  Glac&#xE9;au brands continued to gain share and we expect growth from this business for the remainder of 2009 as we leverage our new innovation and execute strong marketing programs.</p>
          <p>Our alignment with our North America bottling partners continues to strengthen and we have already progressed the strategy that we put into place almost two years ago. Importantly, a number of strategic priorities that are designed to reshape the system's future are delivering tangible results.</p>
          <p>The $0.99 entry package, now available in over 60% of the U.S., is driving significantly more transactions and retailer dollar sales while gaining share.  We are also driving positive mix benefits in future consumption packages for our bottlers and customers.  Also our all-important test for contoured 2-liter packaging is being expanded across the Southeast and initial reads are very positive.</p>
          <p>The Coca-Cola Supply Company is up and running, focusing initially on freight and logistics efficiencies and we expect to exceed year one targets.  We are excited about our strategy for North America and we are confident that we will return the business to growth while driving long-term profitability for our customers and for our system.</p>
          <p>Our picture of success this year remains clear: number one, maintain focus on a consistent set of strategies with measurable deliverables; second, increase the speed and efficiency of execution to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risks; and third, remain constructively discontent in all that we do in order to deliver against our long-term growth targets and enhance our long-term brand and system health.  I am pleased with the results we have delivered in the first quarter.  We are performing with great result in this time of uncertainty and believe that we will come out of this period a much better company and system than when we entered it.  We remain relentlessly focused on effectively operating for the long-term in the best consumer business in the world.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Muhtar.  Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>As Muhtar indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong.  We continue to gain share and enhance brand health.  We're sustaining and improving our operational and financial discipline while building on our firm foundation using consistent, strategic priorities.  Our volume growth results were in line with our expectations and there was growth across a diverse geographic footprint.  We delivered ahead of our long-term currency neutral profit target, increasing operating income 17%, cycling 8% last year.  Reported operating income declined 1% primarily related to the 17% currency headwind.</p>
          <p>We again delivered significant operating expense leverage in the quarter.  This was driven by our continued focus on productivity, disciplined cost management and the benefit of revenue generated by the five additional selling days without significant corresponding operating expenses all of which more than offset higher pension expense that we noted last quarter.  Looking at SG&amp;A, we continued to invest solidly behind our brands, principally reinvesting savings to increase our share voice and build brands across integrated marketing initiatives.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our release, we reported earnings per share of $0.58 on a diluted basis for the first quarter. As expected, this included charges relating to our restructuring of the German bottling operations and ongoing productivity initiatives at both the company and our equity investee bottlers.  In total, we had a net charge of 7% per share in the quarter.  Therefore, our adjusted EPS was $0.65 a share, a decrease of 3% after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year and again, significantly impacted by currency.</p>
          <p>Our results were impacted by the five additional selling days that we had this quarter versus the prior year.  This will reverse in the fourth quarter with which will have six fewer selling days as compared to last year.  We estimate that even without the five extra selling days, we would have delivered currency neutral operating profit essentially at the high end of our long-term growth targets.</p>
          <p>Net revenue in the quarter decreased 3% which included a negative 10% impact from currency and a 2% drag from structural changes primarily related to our divestment of certain bottlers.  At the same time, net revenues were positively impacted by a 7% increase in concentrate sales partially reflecting the five extra selling days in the quarter and a 2% increase from price and mix.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to currency.  As I mentioned earlier, we saw a significant impact from currency in the first quarter.  In fact, the 17% headwind was higher than what we had anticipated at our last earnings call in February.  Despite some recent improvement, the dollar actually continued to strengthen significantly against many of the emerging market currencies following our call, increasing our unfavorable translation exposure.</p>
          <p>Specifically as we look to the second quarter, we will begin to cycle the height of the euro's strength from last summer, which is more favorable than our current hedged rates.  Therefore, based on current expectations including the rates we're cycling and hedges in place for our key hard currencies, we anticipate a 14 to 16% currency headwind for the second quarter.  However, we're all observing the continued evolution of the market's risk perspectives, which may move to mute the attractiveness of the dollar as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>There are many different scenarios that could play out, and I can assure you we are carefully managing our risks and the corresponding opportunities.  As Muhtar mentioned, we manage our business in local currency to ensure our operating management always makes the right investment decisions for the long-term health of the business.</p>
          <p>Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the remainder of this year and specifically the second quarter.  Our picture of success for 2009 remains to meet our long-term currency neutral profit growth targets.  For the first half of 2009, we would expect to deliver in line with those targets.  Based on our strong first quarter results, this implies the second quarter will be below our profit targets due to the timing of concentrate sales, higher pension costs and cycling lower incentive compensation costs in North America.</p>
          <p>Finally, we do not expect to drive additional leverage below operating income due to the full impact of higher interest costs related to the 2.25 billion in term debt that we placed in March and the continued impact of currency on equity income from our bottler investees.  Let me reiterate, though, that we are confident in meeting our long-term targets for the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to have discussions with our board about uses of cash.  We're taking into consideration a number of factors including the implications of the current global economic environment, and ensuring that we maintain our financial flexibility.  We're considering options that will enable us to continue to pursue opportunities, such as Innocent that may arise and/or reinstitute our share re-purchase program.  We'll keep you updated as we continue through the year.</p>
          <p>Before I move to taxes, let me remind you of one last modeling point.  As in the first quarter, our revenues will continue to be impacted due to structural changes primarily related to the disposal of bottlers.  We would expect a similar drag as we cycle the sale of the Remil bottler in Brazil at the end of Q2, and the Pakistan bottler investment at the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>Finally on taxes, we ended the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.5%, and we estimate our underlying effective rate will remain in the range of 23.5% for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>I know the current U.S. budget proposal to substantially increase the taxation of income earned outside of the U.S. is top of mind for many of you.  However, it is too early to estimate any potential impacts as the budget details have yet to be released.  We are working alongside other multinational companies to inform the administration and Congress as to the negative impact of any such change on the competitiveness of U.S. multinational companies and the impact on U.S. jobs.</p>
          <p>So we're off to a good start in 2009.  We recognize there may be some ups and downs over the course of the year given the macroeconomic environment.  However, we see real opportunity to leverage this environment and drive our business for the long term and build on our track record of success.  Our seasoned management team remains committed to delivering profit targets while driving share gains and further enhancing the health of our brands.  We have a clear picture of success and believe that we have a skilled leadership team with the right plan and the right capabilities to achieve our goals.</p>
          <p>Operator, that's what I have.  Ready for any questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we couldn't hear the beginning of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just a follow-up on PepsiCo's announcement yesterday about purchasing PAS and PBG.  Obviously, you've had this hospital ward policy for the past four, five years.  You know, can you talk about sort of any thoughts you have about what PepsiCo is trying to do, how it affects you competitively, realizing that it's fairly short notice here, and then, you know, looking out, do you feel like you need to make any changes to the hospital ward policy in terms of, you know, maybe holding onto some of these bottlers longer or even consolidating the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.  I will not comment on anyone other than what we are trying to do.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to say here is that I believe the question that you're really asking is: do we believe we have the right system structure particularly in North America?  And as I said earlier, fundamentally, we believe the franchise model is the best way to win in the marketplace.  We're pleased with the positive forward momentum we're generating here in North America, and the spirit of collaboration with our bottlers, not just here in North America, but across the whole world, has never been better.</p>
          <p>We're aligned with all our bottling partners to take costs out of the system, reshape our brand price pack channel architecture here in North America.  That is beginning to yield results, and this is not something that we've just been doing in the last few months.  You know, we've been at this for the last two years working very hard with CCE's leadership and in fact, some of the things that have-- that were announced yesterday, we're taking cost savings already, significant cost savings out of our key initiatives with our principal bottling partners here in America.</p>
          <p>The supply chain company is up and running.  I think you've heard before in calls that that is going to generate over $150 million of synergies for our system, and that now basically bottlers representing almost 90% of our business in the U.S., are participating in this initiative.</p>
          <p>The incidence model, again, almost 90% of our bottlers are participating.  85 plus percent, is yielding very good results eliminating duplication.  The fountain harmony and outlet service solution initiative that we have embarked upon with, again, Coca-Cola Enterprises' leadership are yielding results.  They will generate an additional 50 to $75 million of synergies that again, you have heard about before.</p>
          <p>I think what I'd like just to reiterate is that correcting a systemic issue does not happen overnight.  It starts with a sound, long-term, strategic focus, aligning with bottlers on the picture of success, and as I said, we've been working on this for the last two years.  Our new initiatives are yielding good results in the marketplace.  We feel that all our bottlers are executing with much more precision, much more passion and we're just beginning now to see the results and we feel confident that the localized approach of bottling, coupled with our global reach and our harmonious marketing programs are yielding very good results for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask one quick follow-up on that then.  You talked about the new incidence-based pricing model in the U.S. working.  Should we expect to see that extended over the next couple of years?</p>

          <p>Thanks, good morning everyone. Muhtar, I wanted to follow up just on North America.  You made it clear that you have your strategy and your game plan on how to win in the market, but if PepsiCo is able to be more flexible in route to market, let's say take Gatorade pricing down which could have implications for vitaminwater and have a large savings pool to reinvest, are there things you can do in terms of accelerating that 150 million supply chain and other actions you can take with your strategy to make sure that you remain competitive while they go through and have this big savings pool to reinvest back in? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Hello, Muhtar and Gary.  I want to follow up on North America, specifically we saw very good foodservice trends, up 3% in foodservice and fountain.  I'm wondering if you can clarify really where that traffic came from.  Is that QSR related?</p>
          <p>And then on the same line, the retail volume still being down, what's your outlook for pricing as we go into the summer months, just broad picture along with some packaging innovation that you put into the marketplace and comment on how Monster has potentially contributed in your first quarter both here and abroad?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Foodservice, starting with foodservice, Christine, all I can tell you is that we've got great programs working with our foodservice customers to extending our portfolio.  Category extension, smoothies, teas, teas are really working very well for us, and also our new cup programs are generating very good traffic results for us as well as incidence increases in QSR, so it's primarily driven by QSR and of course, most of our-most of our customer base is actually doing good &#x2013; well in this environment and we are &#x2013; I  think, you know, we hope we are contributing to those results for our customers and we're getting the benefit also with the extension of categories and our marketing programs working effectively, and I do believe that perhaps they are &#x2013; the QSR is getting some benefit, although still to be &#x2013; to be verified from the lower gas prices.  So that's on foodservice.</p>
          <p>Next in terms of the pricing as we go into the quarter, I think that, you know, don't think of pricing as, you know, a certain price of a certain pack.  I think you need to think of it as basically mix management, and we're seeing some great results from our new packaging initiatives, excuse me, particularly on immediate consumption and I think that also, you know we are driving principally value share up in our business and I think that you will see us continue to drive value shares throughout the summer with effective mix management both in the future consumption channels as well as immediate consumption channels.</p>
          <p>And then I think the last question you had was on Monster.  I think it's early days to talk about Monster.  We just launched &#x2013; it's just come into our system but initial reads on Monster are positive both here in North America as well as what's happening in Northwest Europe.</p>

          <p>Muhtar, could you revisit for us your view of beer and soft drink integration, whether it's evolving as ABI encroaches on more of your bottling owners that happen to have beer? And the reason I'm asking the question, in part, is some of your bottler brewers have been increasing their discourse on the need for integration of beer and soft drinks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My view of soft drinks integration has not changed since the days that I was managing a brewer and a bottling business, and that is that strategically, strategic functions need to be separated and you can absolutely &#x2013; if there are synergies in nonstrategic areas like freight, like warehousing, like back office, I think that in this day and age, you cannot leave those on the table.  You've got to take advantage of those, but at the front end, which is &#x2013; you know, you are talking about a different consumer, a different consumption habit, I think it is absolutely important to keep the strategic functions dedicated to each side.  That's basically my view on that, and I think you've heard me say that before, Carlos.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning, everyone.  Gary, I was hoping to get a little more granularity on your currency view for '09.  I presume you're still 100% covered on the euro and the yen.  Can you give us some more detail on coverage for other hard currencies, including the pound?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark.  We are essentially covered on euro, yen.  We also do have coverage on Sterling, and we would also have some coverage on Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, but what you're seeing is a combination of several different factors.  Number one, going into the second quarter, obviously, our coverage which we normally put on at the end of a year is significantly lower than what we're cycling which was the height of the strength of the Euro last year when it got up to 1.55, 1.57, something like that to the dollar.  So that's a big piece of what we're going to see in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The other piece is the emerging markets, where it's really too expensive to put much hedge coverage on.  And in those emerging markets, we saw them tank overall in the first quarter.  We've seen some of them come back.  If you look at the peso, it went from, what, probably 10.5.  Last year, it got over 15, like 15.2.  Early this year, it came back down to about 13 and now it's about 13.5 in the last couple of days. So a lot of those emerging market currencies, while they really devalued significantly, they are starting to come back some but now we're having to cycle the strength of the euro.  They're coming back some but nowhere near where they were a year ago.</p>
          <p>With that said, we know or we believe over time and the question is when, the dollar will have to reverse course with the kind of deficits the U.S. government's running, the dollar has to reverse.  The question is when and a lot of that is the risk aversion in the markets obviously, and you saw some of that happen yesterday as the dollar strengthened again and gold went up again.</p>
          <p>Let me assure you, we're watching it closely.  The first quarter was obviously worse than we thought it was going to be in the 10 to 12 and what I would tell you is that in the first quarter, in fact, if you took the top ten currencies, everything else, the ones you never even think about, everything else was probably a third of what we saw happen, and that's where some of that negative surprise came from, but we're watching it.  We're watching it closely and I think we've got a pretty good handle on it.  Although none of us like it, that's kind of where it is today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And one technical thing on the pound and the Canadian dollar, were you saying that you are fully covered for those for the balance of the year, or were you saying partially covered?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I was hoping you could talk a bit about your efforts to stabilize your markets, particularly Central and Eastern Europe.  Curious to get your thoughts, Muhtar, on these markets, particularly Russia. Have you seen any signs of improvement or at least stabilization? And once again if you could just talk about efforts there to kind of rebuild the momentum you previously had, that would be helpful.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think certainly Russia, Ukraine, very hard hit by the current crisis, not too dissimilar to the consumer sentiment that we saw in August, 1998 and that crisis.  Of course, now a much bigger scale because the &#x2013; in 1998, there was maybe 1 million people qualified to be middle class consumers in Russia.  Today, there's more than 20 million and therefore, it is impacting it in a much bigger way.</p>
          <p>But certainly, new price points, shifting to affordable packages and also focusing very much, again, on the customer in terms of our marketing strategies and we're fully aligned again with Coca-Cola Hellenic in terms of how to come out of this crisis, and I think that '09 certainly &#x2013; the first half of '09 certainly will be the worst part of the crisis as far as we can tell, and we're gaining share, I think.  That's important in both &#x2013; all categories and particularly in the still beverage categories in Russia</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if I could just ask a quick question to Gary.  Just curious why at this point you're not reinstating your share repurchase program.  I know it was suspended as a result of the acquisition in China.  Now that's off the table, why aren't you reinstating it at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lauren, it's something that we'll actually be discussing with our board.  We've got our board meeting later this week.  But at the same time, I think it's a combination of things and don't worry.  It is not lost on us that the after-tax cost of borrowing would be cheaper than the dividend.  So I get it on share repurchase, but I also recognize that in these kinds of times, these macroeconomic conditions, you want to continue to have a very strong balance sheet, you want to have financial flexibility.  We're seeing some, albeit small, but we are seeing opportunities like the Innocent deal where if I take Innocent as an example, 18 months ago, we knew it was a great brand.  18 months ago, we called on them and they wouldn't even talk to us and today, we are a strategic investor alongside Innocent management.</p>
          <p>So there are going to be some opportunities.  Our goal of this is to come out much stronger.  We are going to reinvest in the business and then we've always viewed share repurchase as a residual if there are not reinvestment opportunities to drive the long-term value for our shareholders through the business results then we would look at share repurchase.  It is on the table.  It is something we're looking at, and it is something we'll keep you apprised of as we go through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just let me add one sentence to that.  You know, I think our principle, principle focus is to grow our top line effectively in every environment, hard or good.  I think you see us focused on that.  You are not hearing us say we won't do it.  We are just not committing to it and as Gary said, we'll be talking about it with our board actively and then you'll hear back from us.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good morning.  Just as a bit of an update, you gave us a little bit of one on the North American business a few minutes ago.  I think you talked about the incidence roll-out, 85% plus, I guess.  First part of the question: is that intended to go toward 100% or are you pretty comfortable with where it is now?</p>
          <p>And then I have &#x2013; on the fountain business also, if you can give us an update. I think last quarter you talked about 20% dual customer calling with CCE and that you are moving to a single model.  Can you update us on how that's progressing?  It sounds like you are pleased with the progress but maybe a number would be helpful, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that today our incidence based concentrate pricing model covers almost 85 plus percent of our bottling business in the United States, and I think that it is working well. It is eliminating basically unnecessary energy that goes into the discussions and focuses all our energy jointly on the marketplace and on the customer, it's working well.  I think that that is already a very good percent of our bottling network that is engaged in this effort of incidence based concentrate pricing.  So, I think we will just evolve it along the way.  But certainly, the early signs of it for &#x2013; in implementation is very positive with all our bottling partners that are participating in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is 100% the target?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that certainly, you know, what we see is that we've got very good coverage, very quickly and basically, the rest of the bottling partners in the United States are on old contracts so I think you would assume that 90% is a very good &#x2013; where we are today is a very good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on fountain, it is clearly one of the important initiatives.  Fountain harmony and we have dual customer calling as you have said in 20% of CCE territory and we have begun to move to a single call model in one market to improve value to our customer system.  It's still in the early stages.  You can call it an active commercial test and as we progress it we will take it and expand it to other territories.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said that both from outlet service solutions and fountain harmony, the objective is for our system between CCE and us to generate between 50 to $75 million of synergies and we will be on target to ensure that we create that between now and 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  Muhtar, can you just talk about China in the quarter? 10% volume growth is still pretty healthy but saw sequential slowdown from the fourth quarter that was up 29% or so.  So if you can just talk about what you are seeing in that market.  Pepsi talked about yesterday some of the regional differences.  If you can give us a little bit more color there, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly with what's happening in China, we are happy and content with double-digit growth, cycling 20% from prior year.  The slower growth is due to &#x2013; both Chinese New Year timing and certainly there is some slowing in the economy.  We've continued to gain sparkling and still beverage volume and value share in the quarter and we continue to invest for the long-term in the marketplace.  As I said, we announced a 2 billion investment program over the next three years.  That's on target, and we're getting balanced growth across the portfolio.  Still beverages were up 28%, a very healthy 28% and our sparkling beverages were in mid-single digits.</p>

          <p>Gary in North America in the first quarter, huge margin expansion that you saw.  Can you just maybe help us understand what drove that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Judy, it's really a combination of two things.  One is the five extra days, remember that proportionately North America is heavier in finished products than most of our other operating groups and with those five days, you would see a lot more margin flowing through from that.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would point out is there is timing in some SG&amp;A items that will reverse in the second quarter and so that's part of what I was talking about on the second quarter as well.  So it's an anomaly in the quarter.  They had very good results particularly compared to the way the U.S. market performed gaining share, but I would say you should look at North America probably over the first half as we get through the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gary, just to follow up on currency, can you give us the full-year impact at this point? The 14 to 16 points sounds like it's just more of a second quarter. If you can give us...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Judy, the 14 to 16 is definitely a second quarter and let me be the first to say, you know, I said 10 to 12.  It ended up 17, and that was a week later.  It moved that much on me from our second quarter call and a week later, I realized it had jumped significantly.  I don't think anyone can tell you what currency is going to be for the full year.  I mean, the rates moved significantly yesterday.  We saw the euro which had been really weak, you know, over the last month or so really start strengthening, getting up to 1.32, 1.34 and now it's back to 1.29 yesterday.  So it's anybody's guess.  I don't think &#x2013; I wouldn't take anybody's forecast today to tell you the truth.  I think a quarter is about as far as you can go in this volatility.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gary, just to clarify, it's all translational, there's nothing in terms of your cost structure that in some of these emerging markets where your local costs are &#x2013; so your costs are more in U.S. dollars versus your local revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is primarily all translational.  There is some transactional, but very small amounts.  It would be &#x2013; you know, where we've got expatriate employees that are paid in dollars, but that's minor.  Some of the ingredients costs are in dollar, dollar based.  So there's some of it but not that much.  It's primarily all just from translation.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  Good morning.  Just a quick question following up on China.  Are you seeing currently or are you anticipating any issues with new manufacturing capacity coming on-line, meaning getting permits, etcetera, in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Damian, no.  We don't see any issues around there.  In fact, this year, very soon, I will be in China again opening two brand new bottling plants coming on stream.  So I don't see any issues and I think that our bottlers' appetite for continuing to invest ahead of the curve and ensuring that we can have the capacity for both our still beverage footprint that is growing very rapidly and ensuring that we have the right infrastructure for producing all our beverages, the bottlers' appetite is there to continue staying ahead of the curve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just on Eastern Europe, going back to your comment that you made earlier, you said there's a rapidly shifting change in consumer behavior, and I'm wondering if it's &#x2013; are you talking about channel shift, they're shopping in different places or is it they're just not shopping, they're shopping less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're shopping less and they're shopping differently, both.  Shopping less, the traffic in whether it's kiosks, markets or malls are less, and then people are spending much more time at home, which is not really too different a phenomena across Western markets either, but certainly, I think it's deeper in Eastern Europe right now whether it is &#x2013; you are talking about Hungary or Czech Republic or whether you're talking about Russia or Romania, and so what we have are lots of value creating promotions, transactional promotions at the point of sale offering more value to consumers linking up with more entertainment at home and to home deliveries, etcetera so we're doing a lot of programs, shifting a lot of programs to ensure that we can keep up with and be ahead of consumer's changing behaviors in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Again, it's taking a while for to us see those results but we feel pretty confident that the steepness of the curve is going to even out as we move into the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala, UBS.  Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Two regions that really look like they stand out in terms of your performance versus the category are Latin America and Northwestern Europe so can you provide some insights on if there's anything specific going on there? Particularly as it relates to Western Europe, how sustainable the current growth rates are?</p>
          <p>And then last thing, just to be clear on the buyback, Gary, I understand your reservations, but is the bottom line that you just have not yet met with the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I take that one, Kaumil, first, on share repurchase?  The board meeting specifically is on Thursday of this week.  We will be talking with them about our plans.  But again, we are maintaining flexibility and keeping our options open.  So we could reenter share repurchase.  If we do, we will notify you and let you know probably on the next quarter call, but again, keeping financial flexibility because there are a lot of opportunities in this environment as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  And the other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on Europe, Kaumil, you know, it's, again, not a uniform picture, Eastern Europe, we just talked about as far as Western Europe is concerned, we see, again, good momentum in Northwest Europe and in South Europe, it's, again, the crisis came earlier and we're certainly seeing the affect of that and also Germany in terms of price deflation and the consumer sentiment is negative, but I would say that basically we are number one, gaining share, very importantly.</p>
          <p>We're focused on our execution of our strategies, expanding our still beverage footprint.  We're gaining still beverage volume and value share in the quarter in Europe.  Still beverages were up 4% for the quarter, juices, teas, sports drinks, water, in terms of our still beverage portfolio and we're seeing a stronger-- a strong discounted presence and we're expanding presence, our presence in hard discounters across Europe.  That's our strategy and we believe that certainly I think that we'll come out much stronger with both our brand health as well as our share in Europe.  In Latin America, we've got tremendous bottler alignment, and as I said in my remarks, we feel confident that we will continue our momentum in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I'd like to just say now is that our focus in this challenging and dynamic environment is to proactively and successfully drive our strategic agenda, our robust business model is built to withstand tough times and we remain confident that we have the right strategies, have the right plans and leadership team to do just that.  So in 2009, we will continue to do what we have done for the past 123 years, remain resolute in creating sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  Thanks for joining us this morning and we wish you all a great day.</p>
