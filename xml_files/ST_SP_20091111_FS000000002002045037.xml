          <p>Hi, good morning, a warm welcome to all investors and analysts. I'm Yang Fong. You are listening to SingTel's earnings conference call for the quarter and half-year 30th September, 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me introduce members on the call, Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Lim Chuan Poh; CEO International; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO Optus; Mr. Murray King, CFO Optus, Mr. Kwakum Yung , CFO Singapore. They may also be assisted by other members of the management team.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results. Sock Koong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for SingTel's results for the quarter and the half-year ended 30th September, 2009. During the quarter, SingTel delivered double-digit earnings growth and we benefited from strong operational momentum in both Singapore and Australia and also a rebound in the associate contribution.</p>
          <p>Underlying net profit for the Group rose 19% and if you look at the performance in Singapore, top line growth was 8% that's driven by continued growth in Mobile and in the large IT and Engineering business.</p>
          <p>With the margin improvements that we were able to achieve in the quarter, that actually helped to lift EBITDA by about 11% to SGD556 million for the Singapore business.</p>
          <p>In Australia, Optus revenues were up 7% and that is also driven by very strong growth in the Mobile business and the customer acquisitions that were made during the quarter. EBITDA was up 6% in Australia to $509 million.</p>
          <p>The Group and its associates also registered very strong subscriber growth numbers. We now have 273 million mobile customers in the region.</p>
          <p>Earnings from the regional mobile associates were up 32% and that's driven by higher contributions from Telkomsel. Telkomsel increased its market share to 51.4% and that's the strongest since 2008.</p>
          <p>You may have also read that we increased our effective interest in Bharti Airtel from 30.43% to 31.95% in October this year.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that the board has approved an interim dividend of 6.2 cents per share that is 11% increase from last year and represents a 52% payout ratio based on our underlying net profit.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to Yang Fong for the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First question is from Mr. Sameer Chopra, Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions for Paul and Murray about the Australian business. First question is the ULL has largely been completed, I was wondering are you expecting margins will be stable at about 15% going forward, or is there anything that might cause a change at margin levels? And just on that, would you now focus on customer growth in the consumer business now that the ULL upgrade is complete? The second question was on the ICT business. Growth slowed in the last quarter to about a half of what you did in the previous quarter. Is this business cycle related or are you seeing a level of market maturity and pricing tension? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I might start off on that, and then I have both Michael Smith and Murray King with me if they want to add anything. On the consumer fixed business, what you have seen over the last couple of years is that we've lifted margins from around about seven to 8% EBITDA margin to now about 15 by focusing our sales efforts in both migrating off-net customers on-net and also winning new customers on-net. And we've been pulling away from retailing Telstra and exiting that business. That's allowed us to lift the margins as they are. If we look forward, at this stage, there is no specific guidance that we have given on consumer margins per se. I can talk a little bit about what we would expect to be some of the factors in that market.</p>
          <p>There is some uncertainty about underlying pricing. As you know, the ACCC in Australia have recently flagged a change in the way in which they calculate ULL pricing. And also a potential increase in cost, which will be borne by those such as ourselves. We've got a large number of our customers located in the band 2 areas. And that's actually still subject to a lot of uncertainty in Australia, because as late as yesterday there were media reports that that draft view was likely to be withdrawn and that the ACCC might hold on to its existing pricing.</p>
          <p>The other trend that we would expect to see in that market is, that it's quite competitive and there being quite a lot of players who have jumped into that space over the last couple of years. And so we'd expect it to remain a space in which players like iiNet, AAPT, ourselves and others remain competitive. So I can maybe give you those factors and those drivers around performance in the area, but we haven't given specific margin guidance for the business itself.</p>
          <p>If I look at your question on the ICT area, there's a couple of different businesses really flowing through there. What you've got is a mixture of annuity revenues that we drive in ICT in managed services for existing customers managing WAN, LAN and managing routers, managing requirements that they have when they're also a carriage customer. And then separately there's a lot of project work which usually arises when we've won a new customer and we're maybe doing an installation of a new network or managing a new network start-up for them. And that's the reason why you're seeing it being fairly lumpy, and why it moved up and down.</p>
          <p>In the last couple of quarters, some of what's been driving those numbers is our very strong sales results; an example of that would be the ANZ tender which we won jointly with SingTel which is for the regional business of ANZ. And that requires a fair amount of activity in installation particularly in local branch network here in Australia for ANZ. And likewise, we're currently undertaking some work for the ATO, which also is a driver of some of that activity. So you will see that number move up and down depending on the nature of those projects. Probably what's key is that it doesn't tend to have a big impact on the EBITDA line because a lot of that project work is mainly equipment pass-through and, as a result, you won't see it has a material impact on what we report at EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just ask a follow-up on that one, probably one for Sock Koong. As SingTel as a Group expands into this ICT business, are you expecting that volatility in underlying earnings will increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, I mean if you look at how much corporates, both in Singapore and Australia, are buying services, increasingly we are seeing a higher percentage of our customers wanting to buy telco and managed services package together, so &#x2013; which is why both in Singapore and Australia in the region, we have devoted significant resources to build our capabilities in this area, including the acquisition of SCS that was completed last year.</p>
          <p>And the objective of moving to an ICT business model, rather than just standing pure carriage, is actually to increase stickiness, so I would actually expect a lower volatility in the top line as a result of us providing more ICT business than just selling connectivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, do you have anything else to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what Sock Koong says is correct and I also think that for the ICT business across both Singapore and Australia, while there will be quarterly and geographic revenue fluctuations, if you look at it on an annual basis, it will tend to even out. So I don't think the volatility is something that cannot be compensated for on an annual basis.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time this morning. I have three questions for you. Firstly, on mio TV, the 25,000 net adds in the quarter which is a great result, I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk about, Allen, where that could possibly get to post EPL rights.</p>
          <p>Secondly, a question for your Paul on the Australian mobiles market; both of your competitors here, Vodafone 3 and Telstra have been really talking up their efforts in recent weeks. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any change in competitive intensity and your results would suggest that things are still traveling pretty well for Optus. And thirdly, a question on the associates; firstly on Telkomsel, just wondering how sustainable that improvement in Indonesian market conditions is and therefore, Telkomsel's improved performance. And also on India, obviously things there are pretty tough, just wondering if you could maybe comment on how long you expect that to remain the case. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Allen to do the mio TV question. What's the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Optus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Optus mobile sorry, and then Paul can take care of that and then Chuan Poh can talk through the Telkomsel and competition in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the first question is, we expect in subsequent quarters to get a significantly higher run rate than 25. I can't disclose to you our own internal targets, but we've already started to pre-market the availability of BPL and the sports channels that we have secured exclusively, and basically, 25 represents the basic run rate without those channels. So we just started the marketing of &#x2013; the pre-marketing in November, so we would expect a significantly higher number in Q3 and then Q4 as well. So that's about as much as I can talk about at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Allen, I might jump in on question two for Christian, which is around the mobile market. Christian, rather than get into maybe a critique of the short-term tactic, I might just talk a little bit about what we see are the dynamics in the mobile market in Australia. And many of the people on the call will know that we've seen a merger between Hutch and Vodafone. We did get a little bit of color overnight in terms of the Vodafone global release, which would indicate to us that overall the Vodafone, Hutch alliance in Australia looks like it delivered about 118,000 net adds in the quarter, which clearly is below our 200 plus number that we've lodged. However, I think we all need to take a step back and put it into overall focus.</p>
          <p>There's been a clear goal set by the Hutch, Voda CEO of getting to number two within two years and therefore we can absolutely expect them to be quite competitive and aggressive in the marketplace and certainly we do see that and have seen that over the last quarter. I think we should also balance out though by looking at the underlying performance of those businesses. When we saw Vodafone's results put into ASIC here in Australia for the year ended to March, what we saw was an EBITDA margin in that business of about 15%. And our understanding of the Hutch business, prior to merger, was that it had an EBITDA margin circa 11%.</p>
          <p>So our expectation is that both those players, now that they're combined and shareholders in the joint venture, will be wanting to drive some form of EBITDA margin improvement. That doesn't mitigate the fact that they'll still be aggressive in pursuing their state of market position goal, but I think it does provide some balance in what may be preoccupying management.</p>
          <p>On the Telstra side, we also &#x2013; Telstra recently in its briefing indicated that it intended to get more aggressive in the market as its billing transformation is completed. But again, I'll point to the fact that there are some balancing factors for them; not least the fact that their wireless broadband pricing was really created in a world where there was no competition and where they now have a challenge really as a lot of those customers come up for re-contracting. But nonetheless, it's a powerful company and we would expect that they would indeed be quite a force in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So overall, although we've got a strong performance, we're very vigilant and very mindful of the fact that our competitors are all very well managed and competent players and so our focus is on making sure that we continue to gain revenue market share in the quarter ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just to recap, you asked two questions, I think they are quite related in some ways. The first part is on the sustainability of the Telkomsel's improvement in their performance, and second part is about the outlook on the Indian competitive position.</p>
          <p>Firstly on Telkomsel in Indonesia, I think we all know that the competition, the price action, came in when there was an operator who decided, having invested in a network of certain capacity, they wanted to bring in more customer base. And therefore they went in on a very aggressive price cut which has, in a sense, resulted in the overall market in Indonesia being changed from one that was previously higher tariff, lower MOU to one that has become lower tariff and higher MOU. Now initially when the competition started late in 2007, Telkomsel's response was more of a carte blanche approach to it; matching prices, trying to provide as much freebies as the competitors were doing and that has, in fact, adversely impacted us.</p>
          <p>Since then, we have gone deeper into our own analysis of our customers' profile and user base and we have done a few things. Number one is that we have &#x2013; do more segmentation in our pricing approach, which has resulted in us recovering some of the lost values on some of our customer base.</p>
          <p>Second part was &#x2013; in fact to create differential pricing also on a regional basis to take advantage of the fact that the different strengths and weaknesses of ourselves against our competitors are quite stark across different regions in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>And what has happened as a result of price war is that generally the network capacity of all the three major operators have suffered quite badly in terms of quality. And that has also, in a sense, created an end to some of the more aggressive pricing that the competitors can do because they have run out of capacity as well.</p>
          <p>So what we're now focusing on as well is to actually be more prepared. Other than the pricing segmentation, we'll also be more prepared in terms of creating a more robust capacity for our network. And if anything else &#x2013; should there be any pricing action again which we don't foresee in the near future, first of all, we are more ready for it in terms of both network quality as well as in terms of our pricing approach. The competitors on the other hand will have to invest substantially if they want to carry out another price action, which we don't see happening as yet.</p>
          <p>Now the similarity in the Indian market is more towards the fact that there are, in fact, also new operators coming into the market and on the basis that they have a new network rolled out with lots of capacity, they decided that they wanted to bring in more customers. Again, on the similarity itself, there will be an end when eventually the network capacity comes to a certain load factor. And if they want to carry on their current price action, they are just going to balloon their losses even more than what they are doing today.</p>
          <p>Now Bharti has not gone out there to try to be the cheapest. They have, in fact, just introduced plans, which are more differentiated than the competitors, both in terms of where they do in certain part of the circles as well as in terms of the pricing on the on-net, off-net basis. We have seen competition like this in and out of different markets as and when new operators come to play, but there are upsides in some of the things that are happening in India today in so far as Bharti is concerned. The price action means that it is going to be more difficult for the other new players, who are yet to launch their network, to even become more difficult if they want to take on the same approach because there is just not enough pricing margin there for many of them to do anything more aggressive than what is happening today as a result of what Docomo Tata has done.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think it also allows the fact that unlike the other operators, Bharti's revenue mix is not entirely based on mobile services. So if you look at the top three mobile operators today, you'll find that the impact of what is going on in India actually affected the other mobile operators much more severely like Reliance and Voda a lot more than it does on Bharti in terms of their EBITDA and everything else. So I guess this is some of those things that the existing players will have to sit out and wait for the time for them to re-brand their &#x2013; to refine their pricing approach and I see the similar situation happening as what we're seeing in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>So we are working very hard with Bharti to try to carry forward some of the learnings that we have had in Indonesia, to see how that can be best applied to India as well.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks very much for your time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next, Sachin Gupta, Nomura. Over to you, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. I've got three questions as well. Firstly Allen, just back on the BPL, I understand you to say it's quite a high profile win for you guys and I understand you can't talk very &#x2013; any hard numbers, but any comments or thoughts you may have on the cost of the margin impact might be useful. I guess the reason I'm asking is obviously StarHub has made a number of comments that this is a loss leading, product and especially if you guys have paid a decent amount for this thing and are not looking to raise prices, I just want to understand what's the likely impact or what are the economics of the whole thing? And secondly Paul, just on the Australian Mobile business, obviously it's been pretty good performance for the last 12 months. I'm not sure how much of that is a function of Telstra slowing down or versus others picking up the intensity. Just wondering, any initiatives you can highlight to &#x2013; you can talk about to highlight that you will be maintaining the intensity over the coming 12 months as well.</p>
          <p>And lastly for Sock Koong, Sock Koong, obviously the company obviously has a fair bit of cash and acquisition seems likely to be a focus, and given the Bharti MTN deal has been terminated now so I guess the direct question is that asset appealing to you guys? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, Allen here, basically when we look at our mio TV product and in particularly the acquisition of BPL, we look at the value accretion that we get, not just for the cable TV product line or the Pay TV product line, but more for the overall consumer spend and, basically, the impact that it has on our overall consumer business, especially in the light, or what we see coming, with NBN, starting from next year. So while I can't give you the details of the cost and margin impact, we will see that when we execute our customer acquisition plans. And the reason why we priced at the level that we did also allows us to open the market to a group of non-Pay TV users and there'll be some upside there as well.</p>
          <p>But overall, the reason why we see this as value accretive for us is because of the impact of this quantitatively and qualitatively on our entire consumer business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, I'll take up this question there on Australian Mobile. Naturally, I'm not going to telegraph punches on the call. But maybe I can just give you a couple of answers which might be helpful. The first one would be to talk about the fact that we built a lot of our momentum not by just discounting price, that's not the way Optus operates, but actually by focusing very much on value. And that's a theme right across our performance. Whether it is the way that we approach the iPhone sales, the launch of the family value packs which we've just done recently, which are very innovative in allowing customers to link their mobiles to their home phone plans and get benefits in a very unique way in the marketplace through free calls; or indeed the Timeless plans which we launched, which offer unlimited national calls if you're prepared to step up your commitment to a slightly higher ARPU than the average. So our overall thrust has been to focus on acquiring good ARPU customers in a profitable way and at the same time, to be innovative and to lead on value.</p>
          <p>The second thing I'd say is that although a smaller competitor behind us has set a goal of being two and two, our results today show that actually we have strengthened our challenger position relative to Telstra and gained revenue market share. And we're very focused, as a management team, on making sure that we continue to strengthen our challenger position. I don't think I can go much more beyond that without getting into company strategy and direction. All I can tell you is that it's, mobile's our biggest business and we're very committed to making it a continued source of strength and gain for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, you know that we never allow cash to burn a hole in our pocket. So just because we don't support Bharti in the MTN transaction, because it's not happening, doesn't mean that we'll go out and do something reckless or silly straightaway. Maybe I'll get Lim Chuan Poh to talk a bit more about acquisition strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, we have stayed firm on what we have always said we will do. Essentially, the strategy falls in two parts. One is we continue to try to maximize what we can do with our existing investments, because there's still a lot of new businesses that can be leveraged on the current set of investments that we have over the network that we've invested in, including the customer base that we've already acquired. And secondly is to continue to look at emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region, either directly or if the synergy is stronger through our associate, we will do so with them as well collectively. In so far as Africa is concerned, when this deal was on the table, we thought it would be a good synergy for India and Africa in terms of the kind of value that can be created over two very large markets. Unfortunately, the deal didn't come through but that doesn't mean, therefore, we will not go out there and rush to buy something else in Africa recklessly.</p>
          <p>We continue to look at other opportunity and if it makes sense, we will continue to give support to our partners in India. Elsewhere in Asia, we continue to look at those markets that have yet to be opened up and that means places like Vietnam. And again, it depends on when the opportunities do arise, we will still look at it from a very prudent basis on whether or not there is any value-add that we can extract from our investment in those countries.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, I think on a different dimension, we are also looking at the fact that the telco business will have to go through certain transformation in terms of the value we can create from the existing investments. And that means going into other areas of &#x2013; growth areas that will essentially still focus on leveraging on our core assets, which is essentially the network and the customer base.</p>
          <p>So those are the kind of broad strategies that we're adopting for our investment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, a couple of questions for Paul O'Sullivan. Just looking at the margin trend, or the EBITDA trend, you're really targeting the EBITDA level of growth there, aren't you, rather than the margin? And that's &#x2013; the two swing backs is Mobile and Consumer. Mobile, the subscriber acquisition cost down quite sharply, 10%. Paul, is that sustainable? Is it going to go further? And if that's down so sharply, what else has happened to costs there to cause the Mobile margin still to contract further in that quarter?</p>
          <p>And secondly on broadband, we had a bit of a chat about that earlier, talking about the level of price competition and so on. In fact, broadband average revenue is up quite comfortably. And I just wonder, there must be obviously several drivers in different directions there if you're getting this degree of price competition, potentially a price war between TPG and we see a few other carriers responding there. I was just wondering how you see that playing out then? And are we going to continue to see that broadband average revenue grow despite that price competition? And you mentioned one of the factors here being the proposal from the ACCC, I don't know whether it's confirmed yet, to stick to the existing access prices around the year. Are you actually better off with those previous access prices or the ones they proposed in August for the year ahead?</p>
          <p>And when you're able to move to NBN, you've talked about the set of prices being maybe 40 to 70 dollars. I just wondered how you're possibly better off with access prices going to that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, thanks for that, there's a few questions there. I might get Murray to talk about the Mobile margin trends and SACs that you talked about. And what insights he has on how they're tracked. And then on broadband he can talk a bit about the ARPU and then I will come back on the NBN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Paul. To respond to your questions in respect of the margin and the EBITDA, you've seen our EBITDA grow 6% across Optus for the quarter and in respect to Mobile up 7% year-on-year. So you can see the growth that we've generated in prior quarters now starting to pull through in respect of EBITDA growth. Your comment in relation to the SACs being down quarter-on-quarter is predominantly a consequence of mix between our postpaid, prepaid and wireless broadband customer acquisition activities between the June quarter and the September quarter. And the consequences, you rightly point out, as to why we didn't see the margin come up and stay essentially stable quarter-on-quarter at around 25% is because the volumes we had in relation to acquisition activity in the September quarter were higher than the June quarter. And that's evidenced by our postpaid customer growth being up quarter-on-quarter. Referencing your question in respect to broadband ARPUs and the growth in broadband ARPUs, yes we are seeing a trend in the marketplace for customers willing to commit more to monthly broadband plans for greater data allowances. So there's more and more consumers willing or wanting to utilize more data services and willing to pay for it. And as a consequence, the mix of our rate plans is moving up.</p>
          <p>It does remain a competitive marketplace but the trend is the customers are using more data allowances and as a consequence, the ARPUs are coming up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the NBN, Ian. it's a little hard to talk conclusively about it because we haven't yet seen details of the pricing or, indeed, of how the business model will work. But probably two factors that we would certainly take into account would be that we'd expect to be seeing some different call structures in the NBN, where significant elements of the network and the network management and costs being borne by the NBN co, whereas we'll be a wholesale access seeker in that world. And secondly, on the fact that we'll have a much larger market open to us in two respects, one is a much larger footprint than we are able to access today. But second of all, a much broader range of services that we believe we can participate in.</p>
          <p>So I'll have to reserve giving you any more detailed comment on margin until we've actually seen some detail on the wholesale pricing and on how the business model will work. But we certainly think it's an opportunity for Optus. Until now we've really been quite constrained in competing even in areas where we have ULL into things like apartment blocks because the lack of specific regulation has incented Telstra to really block us some sales to apartment owners and users. And that's part of the frustration that has headed the ACCC and indeed we believe the government, down the path of wanting to drive separation. So we do think there is upside for the company once that market is thrown open. But I'll come back with a lot more detail on that when we see the actual detailed pricing and business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the question of whether there's much difference between the access prices the ACCC proposed in August or if they stick to the existing prices through to December next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we're better off on the existing prices, without a doubt. And part of our frustration is that we've made investments on the understanding that we're on a fairly predictable path in which to make those investments, even with the uncertainty of NBN over it. And to propose now to change the pricing paradigm and to create a new way of approaching it, we think would be quite wrong. And not only would it create problems for existing investment, but we think it would create a dangerous precedent for those choosing to make a future investment in this sector. So we certainly welcome the soundings or the reports we've seen in the last 48 hours that the ACCC may rollback and may stick to the existing ULL pricing.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Next, Helen Zhu from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have a couple of questions. The first question is, I think in terms of the dividend policy etc., we kind of touched upon earlier the fact that without the Bharti MTN deal, you'll have more flexibility with your cash flow stream etc. We saw last night that StarHub has increased their dividend commitment again. I was wondering what your thoughts are on potential increase to regular dividend payout policy for SingTel going forward.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding iPhone. We recently heard that M1 and StarHub are going to launch iPhone in the fourth quarter of this calendar year as well. How is that going to affect your pricing strategy? And do you see it more as a defensive approach or will you be getting more aggressive with the iPhone pricing etc.? And then the third question is regarding the Singapore business EBITDA guidance. The guidance for the year is low single digit growth versus we saw in the first couple of quarters it was about 12%. Is that gap mainly because of increased competitive intensity and other rising expenses? Or is it, to some extent, because of the revenue mix from the pass-through OpenNet stuff? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Helen, I will take &#x2013; this is Jeann. I'll take your first question on the dividend. We have actually increased our dividend. We've increased it by 11%, interim dividend, versus last year. The payout ratio continues to be in the range of 45 to 60%. This is the policy that we review in March '08. And we are keeping to that dividend policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay it's Allen here, in response to your two questions about Singapore. Number one, in terms of the iPhone, basically we've got a head start and that head start has allowed us to get early adopters. There still is a reasonably large number of customers who aspire to get the iPhone and like our colleagues in Optus, we will make sure that even in the environment with three operators, we will be &#x2013; we'll take the largest share of people who want to come towards iPhone. We will respond to what our competitors do, not just based on price but more importantly, we do have some non-price differentiators that we are building into our iPhone, which I can't discuss now because we are weeks away from our competitors launching the product. So we will strike a balance in terms of maintaining the lead in terms of iPhone share in a competitive environment, focus on two major directions.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question regarding the EBITDA growth, can you just clarify it to me one more time? What are you looking for there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we notice that you've increased the full-year's Singapore EBITDA growth guidance to low single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But we saw that in the first half of the year, the total EBITDA growth year-on-year is actually more than 10%. So there seems to be a pretty big gap between what you've achieved so far in the first half versus the guidance for the full-year, even though the guidance for the full-year is slightly increased.</p>
          <p>So I was just wondering what exactly are the drivers that you expect to see in the second half to substantially reduce the rate of EBITDA growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think there are a couple of factors that are coming in the second half. Number one is basically in the second half there will be an increase in content costs, primarily the Champions' League, which we started broadcasting this year only in around August.</p>
          <p>The second big one is primarily in the business segment, where we continue to see some delays in corporates making decisions of increasing bandwidths and making decisions in terms of going ahead with some of their IT investments.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the Voice business, we're seeing a little bit of softness, primarily in the international voice market. That's why we have forecast a little bit of a decline and taken a more conservative &#x2013; I think a more realistic look perhaps at where we see the second half performing at the EBITDA level compared to the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen can I just follow up and ask, on the business segment you mentioned there's delays in corporates making decisions. Would that be because of macro issues or do you think it's because of the NBN related considerations?</p>
          <p>I assume that the Voice softness is really because of macro factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The business delays are primarily in macro. There probably is a small group that's waiting for NBN to come in, which they expect to come in really in Q4, late Q4, more than anything else.</p>
          <p>So, I'd say that your assessment that macro indicators are the main reason for business segment is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and could I also just follow up with one more question on the Singapore business? We also saw from StarHub's numbers that their broadband has actually declined year-on-year. And they were mentioning that there is significant ARPU and pricing pressure and they would expect that their ARPUs are going to go from SGD50 to maybe mid SGD40s and to continue to decline until maybe the second half of the calendar year 2010.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering what is your approach and outlook on your Broadband business and ARPU. And do you think that it would be necessary to pre-empt subscriber churn by making more aggressive pricing adjustments ahead of the NBN? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think number one, our Q2 performance compared to them is better. Our revenue declined only about 0.3%, whereas theirs went back by about 6% in that particular product.</p>
          <p>They have actually got the higher ARPU broadband customers because they're offering the highest speeds.</p>
          <p>I think going ahead, there is going to be some price pressure on the fixed broadband product that is copper based, primarily because of fiber coming in. And with the release of the pricing from OpenNet, which is the NetCo and from Nucleus Connect, which is the OpCo, people are already placing a likely value on what 100 Mbit is going to be available at.</p>
          <p>So, I think that there's going to be some adjustment going on prior to the middle of next year to take care of that. But more importantly, there is also some pricing compression that's happening because of mobile wireless broadband and the fact that in the mobile wireless broadband environment, there's not just two of us, there's effectively M1 in there as well. And what levels they set for the lower bandwidths will impact what we do at fixed.</p>
          <p>The way SingTel looks at it is that rather than just competing piecemeal on our fixed broadband product, we have already bundled our broadband together with our fixed voice and together with our MIO TV products, so that we deliver to the customers, rather than just raw broadband Internet access, a much higher value product. And that will help us stem the decline in ARPU of the broadband product itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and then just one last follow-up if I may. When will SingTel make the decision regarding the OpCo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When the Nucleus Connect have completed all the conditions, decisions, to getting the license and mix announcement, then we'll make a decision and we'll announce to the public shortly after.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Nick Harvey from JPMorgan. Mr. Harvey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, I just had two questions please, a sort of strength centric question for Paul.</p>
          <p>The first one is business voice revenue went down 8% in the quarter. Now there's been a trend for the last few quarters so nothing too new there. But I was just wondering, you mentioned that corporate customers are rationalizing their spend. I just want to ask, are they actually spending less altogether? Or is it the case of them spending differently and maybe spending on IT solutions, IT VTNs? A product that obviously would have a cannibalization impact on existing revenue. That's question number one.</p>
          <p>The second question is on iPhone. Optus dominates the Australian market quite clearly. At some point can you derive from that a competitive advantage in the terms that you've got with Apple in terms of this subscriber acquisition cost? If you could talk around that, that would be most helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Harvey. Actually what I'll do is I'll probably ask Mike Smith to talk a bit about the iPhone.</p>
          <p>But if I get back to the business, it's probably worth, if you've got the MD&amp;A handy, some of those on the call might want to look at it. I think the big call-out is that what we've seen is a significant reduction in voice minutes year-on-year.</p>
          <p>If you look at page 45 of our MD&amp;A, the bottom box on key drivers, it shows you voice minutes. And they're down year-on-year for the half by 12%. What I think's hopeful is that last quarter, our quarter-on quarter growth also showed a decline, whereas this quarter we started to see a little bit of a bounce back.</p>
          <p>Our read of that is that there are two drivers. One is the migration to IP-based networks, something that we proactively encourage because it's a win, win. It's a lower cost structure for us and also a lower cost structure for our customers. It typically also is an area where we have a strong position technically with the CIOs.</p>
          <p>But the second driver is that in our existing accounts, what we're seeing is that corporates are rationalizing staff and also, because of their own businesses, there's less activity and traffic. And therefore the reduction we've seen year-on-year is a greater reduction in minutes than we would expect to see as a result of IP migration.</p>
          <p>Now there's an interesting twist to this. We haven't actually been losing any more business than usual and, if anything, we've had a very strong sales pipeline. So, we do believe a lot of this reflects business cycle activity.</p>
          <p>One of the things that we'll be keen to watch, just as I've heard the larger corporates in our sector in the US and the UK say in the last couple of weeks, is that as the economy comes back will we see a recovery of some of the activity rates underlying? That's a question we don't know. But it was interesting that the major US carriers and UK carriers have observed a very similar trend and have asked the same question.</p>
          <p>I'll pass over to Mike to talk about what are the advantages you get in dealing with Apple in terms of being the market leader in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Harvey. We did have a very good relationship with our friends in Cupertino, Apple, as we do with all of our suppliers, actually. And really important that we continue to work that over the course of the last few months as that particular device has run into stock issues globally. Our strong relationship with them does give us a preference as we move in allocation of device.</p>
          <p>I think in working forward, which we continue to have a discussion with all our suppliers we do, how do we work outcomes that give us accretive outcomes but at an ARPU level. And we continue to have those discussions and a good relationship's a good starting point for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just to blow your trumpet a little bit, you might want to also mention Apple's own survey of customer experience across iPhone globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is a supply question and I think, Laurent, what you're pointing to is the cost of device, but it's also about how we serve our customers in a customer-experience sense. And in the most recent Apple survey, albeit that it's one, we're now in the top five of the service levels of Apple globally. That continues to accrete to the relationship, as you pointed out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also reflects the focus we've had in Optus on driving improvements in customer experience over the last two years. I think it's certainly very pleasing to be ranked in the top five by Apple of global carriers providing support to the iPhone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, are you saying that as you reach ARPU threshold, your average unit cost might go down? Or are there volume thresholds as well that would allow your average acquisition cost on iPhone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Laurent, on the point that Mike's making is that as we get more customers in the base who are higher ARPU because they're iPhone users that increasingly offsets the cost of acquisition associated with more smartphones being in our mix up front. We've talked about that, I think, previously.</p>
          <p>But I think the other thing that's important to point out is that the Apple is really at the vanguard of the life cycle of the development of smartphone devices. And the other trend we're seeing in the market right now is a growing proliferation of smartphones from other suppliers. And that also I think will have its own market dynamic and we'll see how that plays out over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>But typically what we've seen in the device market is that as the life cycle of a product increases and you move past the vanguard stage, what you'll find is competitive pressure also helps bring some of the phone pricing down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Paul, just a follow up on iPhones, so it sounds like you forced a competitive response from Telstra specifically on that and they priced the product around SGD85 per month. I can't imagine that they would have picked that number just purely by chance. So, is that where the iPhone ARPU currently is in your post-pay plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'll let Telstra work that one out on their own. So, I think Telstra have got to make their own decisions about what they do. I think we should certainly congratulate them on their agility because I think it's less than 12 months ago that they were telling the public that this was a bad device and not something that they would support. So, clearly they have a remarkable ability to change direction over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just quickly on that, our devices sell in volume across from SGD59 plan through to SGD99 plan. So, in a way with average mix on the portfolio, you'd come out with a similar number.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. Got a question on Optus Singapore and also on Telkomsel.</p>
          <p>Firstly on Optus, just curious Paul, how much growth is left from this wireless broadband take-up? And what are you doing around that whole capacity? That's the first part of the Optus question.</p>
          <p>The second part is just more of an update on information. What is the Mobile EBITDA margin ex iPhone for the quarter? And what would have been the ARPU or growth of the ARPU ex wireless broadband?</p>
          <p>And finally, just as a follow-up on the impact of the iPhone growth on margins, just want to understand how far are we from seeing the effects of higher iPhone ARPU beginning to take over the pressure on acquisition costs? Some color on that would be great.</p>
          <p>And one question on Singapore. What is driving Mobile post-pay ARPU growth q-on-q?</p>
          <p>And finally, just a question on Telkomsel. Just curious, that company is very free cash flow positive. I'm just wondering what I think I'd be doing as a significant shareholder to try to get more dividends upstream back home. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I might take the first question on wireless broadband. I'll let Murray talk about the questions on ARPU and on iPhone.</p>
          <p>Just on wireless broadband to give you some sort of metrics, using the June '09 numbers that we saw disclosed by carriers, our estimate is that Australia has around about 11% penetration number. And when we look at overseas markets, such as Northern Europe, we've seen penetration travel certainly up around the 20% level so far.</p>
          <p>So, our sense would be that there is still some growth left in the market and, indeed, who knows, we may watch Europe go past the 20% level fairly comfortably too. So, we need to keep looking at it.</p>
          <p>Another interesting metric would be that it looks like there's about 300,000 wireless broadband devices being sold per quarter in the Australian marketplace, based on the trajectories that we've seen.</p>
          <p>So, those sort of metrics tell us that there's still growth there. There's an important dynamic in the market, of course, because it's a classic example of why in Australia there's a need for competitive structures and competitive forces. Prior to a couple of years ago, we really only had one carrier supplying the wireless broadband devices, penetration was fairly low and pricing was quite high.</p>
          <p>What you've seen is that since the competitors jumped into the marketplace at lower price points, approximately 18 months, two years ago, you've seen that penetration really accelerate. And, in fact, it's gone from June '08 at about 5% to June '09 about 11%, which is pretty remarkable growth in penetration rates.</p>
          <p>Obviously the key for us moving forward is that we will want to continue to provide quality to our customers. We've had a fairly significant investment in back call capacity over the last 12 months, which has meant that where we have what we call an on-net site, which is typically our metro and urban sites, sites in the major cities and towns, those sites we're provisioning with significant extra capacity and it typically will move to something like six E1s on those sites.</p>
          <p>And that program is well advanced and certainly is showing up in terms of the surveys we see from people like IDC, who've noticed a significant step-up in the quality that we're providing to customers over the last six to nine months.</p>
          <p>I think the fact therefore that we're winning, we estimate, around about 30% share of the net adds per quarter, which is a significant step-up on where we were, demonstrates that the advantage of that quality is coming through.</p>
          <p>I'll pass over to Murray to talk about the other issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect to the question on ARPU, as detailed in the MD&amp;A, you can see our blended ARPU's up 4%.</p>
          <p>In relation to the quarter, our post-paid ARPU's up actually 2%. But if you exclude wireless broadband, our non-wireless broadband post-paid ARPU's up 7%, again demonstrating the acquisition of high value customers through plans such as the iPhone Plan, Timeless Plan, the family value type plan.</p>
          <p>In relation to your question in relation to the Mobile margin, obviously we don't provide guidance in respect of specifically on margins or any of our particular business divisions.</p>
          <p>But what I'd indicate is we previously advised in prior quarters the iPhone's impacted our Mobile margins by up to 5 percentage points. Then that decline is starting to moderate as a consequence of growth in new iPhone customers which are delivering higher ARPU as demonstrated by the ARPU growth, and they're obviously providing increased contribution to EBITDA. That is offsetting, in part, the increased unit SAC costs you see in our numbers.</p>
          <p>However, our acquisition and re-contracting volumes continue at very high levels, as evidenced by our net customer growth over the last two quarters, where you've seen in excess of 200,000 customers acquired of which, in the September quarter, 145,000 are post-pay.</p>
          <p>Margin recovery will be somewhat dependent upon the timing of the volume of new customer connections and re-contract volumes in subsequent quarters, and the growth in our iPhone customer base in the subsequent quarters as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up question. Thanks for the info. Just you were saying that in the past you indicated 5 percentage point pressure from iPhone effect on the margins and you mentioned now that this is beginning to decline. Could you give us an indication where &#x2013; instead of 5 percentage points now is it like 4 percentage points or 3 percentage points? Just a ballpark number would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't provide that specific information. But as I said, there are a number of components here. It's not just a question of the new iPhone customers looking to offset that 5 percentage points. The volume of connections we have in any one quarter of new customers and re-contract customers also impact our margins. So, we don't, as I said, provide specific details on the impact of iPhone in respect of the Mobile margin for September quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 7% expansion in operational EBITDA this quarter reflects the quality of the higher ARPU customers feeding through and certainly there is a good indicator of the strategy paying off. As we've always said, we would expect over time to see the value of those customers more visible in our base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the Singapore question, what's driving our Mobile revenue right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Postpaid ARPU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Postpaid ARPU is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sequential quarter. Okay. The key thing that's driving it is basically the voice ARPU because we're getting higher value customers. And the second one is our existing customers upgrading onto higher plans. And then the third one is more people signing up to our data plans, our bundled data plans.</p>
          <p>So, these are the three things that is driving up the Mobile post-pay ARPU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the final question you were commenting that Telkomsel generally has a fair degree free cash flow. Yes, that's correct. They are already paying out on average 80% to 85% of their net profit as dividends.</p>
          <p>We also need to be aware of the fact that Indonesia is still, has a lot of growth prospects. Even last year when the Company was suffering from the impact of price war, we did not come back on a CapEx because we still believe that there's still a lot of room to expand Indonesia.</p>
          <p>If you look at the broadband, or what the mobile broadband growth, the number is quite staggering. And we continue to have to provide for adequate quality and coverage in order to maximize this growth potential.</p>
          <p>And in certain geographies in Indonesia we're still seeing a lot of pick-up in terms of usage. Places like Papua, Sulawesi which previously were not much of a focus, are now beginning to come in terms of usage.</p>
          <p>So, if you go to southern Sulawesi for example where <mark type="inaudible" /> work to increase not just coverage but capacity. The block rate there is four times. So, you can see the kind of growth prospect in those outlying areas that previously was not too much a concern.</p>
          <p>So, going forward Telkomsel continues to want to invest in growth for the rest of the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chuan Poh, just to follow-up. So, what you're saying is there's still growth in Indonesia but at the same time you'd be happy to see Telkomsel pay out at around 80% to 90%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is what they have been paying out on average, 80% to 85%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so that's what you would expect going forward from here so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I have three questions. Firstly on the domestic IT and Engineering business, could you please provide some guidance on what this would actually look like if we strip out the acquisitions? Just wanted to get a feel on normalized basis what the growth is actually trending.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was wondering what the investment criteria is for SingTel. I've seen that you've been raising your stakes in the likes of Bharti and Globe. But I also see in the press that you're considering floating some assets like Optus. I was just wondering where the trigger points are for you to buy or sell assets.</p>
          <p>And the third question I had is with regard to Pay TV. I'm wondering if you have any idea what percent of your MIO TV subs actually have dual subscriptions at this stage. And do you think there's a realistic proposition that consumers should actually take up dual set-top boxes going forward, or will there be an eventual bias towards a single mode of delivery of content which will actually spur content wars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeann here. On the SCS impact, I think we disclosed that, on the pro forma basis, the overall revenue growth would have been 1.3%. And if you were to look at IT and Engineering it will include SCS in the quarter last year, it would have been stable.</p>
          <p>The other question on what triggers &#x2013; what would be the trigger points to consider SingTel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Other acquisitions, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've always looked at value creation for shareholders so as we look at investments whether it's in the associate or in further cap expansion, cap expenditure for the existing business, we've always looked at it in the perspective of value creation. So, we've always had very disciplined business models looking at NPVs, cash flows and we actually assess investment and CapEx positions in the same way.</p>
          <p>And I think our investments are long-term investments and we've always looked at creating value with our partners and our associates, creating value for our shareholders in all the businesses that we're involved in.</p>
          <p>So, I'm not sure when you talk about trigger points what you're looking for. I suppose if our ability to bring in a partner in a part of business allows us to grow that business faster, better than without the partner we may consider that.</p>
          <p>So, it's all about value creation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that there's no history yet with regards to major investments, but is that something you would be willing to do as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of some of the investments that we have made in the past, where what has happened to all of that strategic investments, become financial investments. We would then evaluate them as we would any financial investments.</p>
          <p>So, for example, our SingPost, it used to be a wholly-owned business. We see that the level of synergies between the post and the telecom business probably doesn't justify us continuing to own it as a subsidiary. We did an IPO some time back. We have refused it, which we have clearly indicated that it's non-strategic, it's financial, so we would consider divestments the same way as any financial investor would in evaluating a buy sell decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your question on the set-top boxes, today we're have 136,000 MIO TV customers. I can't give you an exact number but I'd say it's not a significant number of them have dual set-top boxes.</p>
          <p>There is an initiative going ahead by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, which is basically the regulatory body, to look at whether in the NBN environment, in the fiber-optic environment to every home, it makes sense to have a single set-top box for all paid content coming on to the TV sets. But that will be still a couple of years to implement.</p>
          <p>In the meantime to meet the needs of customers, SingTel is actually upgrading the skills of our installers to make sure that they are audio-visual specialists and they are able to put in the additional set-top box in the customers home without too much of an inconvenience to them.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day basically our new set-top box is actually quite slim and quite aesthetic looking so we don't see a problem in that fitting into the homes, primarily because the customers see the value of the content that we're delivering to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it may also be good to add that our set-top boxes are upgradeable when the fiber network was &#x2013; set-top box would not be. And you would need to replace it in any case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what Sock Koong is mentioning is basically the technology that we use to facilitate the provision of Pay TV to all the homes and businesses in Singapore is very easily adaptable for the NBN environment, you just connect the fiber to the back of the set-top box. There is no additional payment or requirement necessary.</p>
          <p>So, we're obviously discussing with IDA the possibility of that being the standard set-top box for the whole country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity, just two questions. One when SingTel looks at Bharti, does it think that there is an opportunity for Bharti to increase the dividend payout from here on or do they think that &#x2013; does SingTel think that Bharti should be investing more of it into its own business at this point of time?</p>
          <p>And the second question is what would be the two or three key points which have been passed on from Telkomsel to Bharti, given that the Indonesian market also went through a similar price war earlier? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeann here. I think it was a significant move last year when Bharti pay a &#x2013; made a dividend &#x2013; sorry this year, in respect of the last year's earnings. And you know clearly Bharti would be generating a significant cash flow. And we will review the dividend policy at the Bharti Board level &#x2013; the Bharti Board level would review the dividend policy as they did this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I won't share all the details for you, because they will be telling too much. But essentially it's three broad areas, one is different show segment pricing, two is different show regional pricing, three is ensuring network quality continues to be the best.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for this call. On the Singapore business, looking at the quarter-on-quarter EBITDA margin trend, we're seeing a decline here from 41.8% to 38.6%. Could you comment when you see a bottoming out of this decline in EBITDA margins?</p>
          <p>And then also on that if I look at the EBITDA versus the free cash flow, free cash flow was down like 33% quarter-on-quarter. When would you expect some sort of stabilization on free cash flow trend for the Singapore business?</p>
          <p>And I guess related to that is, Allen, you commented earlier that you expect significant growth in the MIO TV subscriber take-up, once it starts increasing EPL, how should I think about when you might reach &#x2013; what is critical mass for you in the subscriber numbers and do you think you can get there just with EPL or are there &#x2013; do you think there would still be a few critical components in the sub-content that you need to bid for to get there?</p>
          <p>And then final question for Chuan Poh, the guidance for the subsidiaries lower dividend, maybe you can give some color and we have seen the pre-tax earnings increase but you're expecting lower dividends. Maybe some color on why you expect that.</p>
          <p>And earlier you comment on Telkomsel, you think there's still quite a lot of growth there, therefore quite a lot of investment. Any comments that you can provide on the efficacy or how satisfactory the return on CapEx has been to date. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll start with the free cash flows question. Not sure how you've read the tables but the free cash flow for Singapore operations, if you look at the half-year is actually up about 14%, Singapore free cash flow, half-year on half-year and the free cash flow for the Group of course if you &#x2013; has come off slightly. If you look at Singapore and the associates, and that's driven by the associate dividend.</p>
          <p>If you look at it -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I look at it quarter-on-quarter 229 in the June quarter and then 221 in the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay you're probably one of the &#x2013; you're probably &#x2013; I think on quarter-on-quarter that facing, okay in terms of capital CapEx and all that, but I'll let Yang Fong come back with the details on the quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>But let me just take you through it, when we look at &#x2013; when we guide for free cash flows clearly we guided for the whole year because cash flow can be quite &#x2013; depending on when you do your incentive payments etc., your bonus payments hit a certain quarter, your tax payments hit a certain quarter, so you would look at that in the sense of the &#x2013; you know then it accounts for the seasonality in the quarterly cycle.</p>
          <p>In terms of our guidance for cash flows, we have at the beginning of the year guided that the free cash flow for the Singapore operations would decline slightly and we have explained that some part of it is due to the capital expenditure &#x2013; capital expenditure we have guided it to be below SGD800 million.</p>
          <p>And I think when we &#x2013; when we're clarifying that guidance earlier in our earlier calls, we have indicated that we've got the higher capital expenditure as a result of the acquisition of SCS where there were certain contracts which involved equipment purchase and then turned into operating leases with our customers.</p>
          <p>And then of course we've got the satellite deal in Singapore as well. So, I think we've given some guidance in some level of detail in the earlier meetings and calls.</p>
          <p>For the Group dividend, in terms of dividend from associates, again there is a lag effect, the associates will be clearly distributing dividends in respect of a year lag in terms of the financial performance.</p>
          <p>So, I think if you look at the associates' performance for '09 versus '08, there's some decline because of the competitive situation that they've been in. And you know the guidance for the associates' dividends follows accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, your last question is on the return on CapEx in Telkomsel. Sock Koong mentioned earlier that we exercise a lot of prudency in terms of the way we look at investment and CapEx spending decision. It's no different from the way that we look at it in Telkomsel.</p>
          <p>But having said that we also need to recognize that CapEx spend are for two large groups of areas, one is for existing services, which means that we continue to rollout to areas where we grow out more capacity, more coverage.</p>
          <p>Then we continue to look at a very low cost structure against account tariffs that we're now looking at and this has in fact been effected because we've also introduced new vendors into the market that has resulted in substantial cost reduction in our CapEx per user.</p>
          <p>The other side of it is that CapEx was only to be spent on what we perceive as new growth areas like the mobile broadband. That one you need to look at it from the perspective of a first mover and therefore there's a certain degree of land grabbing that is needed. But in either cases we look at it from a return, either from the immediate as well as from the long-term perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard to the two other questions you had on Singapore business. One, we've got to the EBITDA margin decline in Q2 versus Q1. A lot of that is because of the iPhone 3GS; we launched iPhone 3GS in the second quarter after &#x2013; yes second quarter. We had a huge uptake of customers, high ARPU customers and that led to a decline in the EBITDA margin. Also a little bit of decline on margins because of the revenue mix as a result of the lower margin ICT revenue growing a lot faster than the telco revenue between Q2 and Q1.</p>
          <p>The second question on Singapore is about critical mass for MIO TV. Critical mass depends on customer numbers, the ARPU from those customers, and the cost, so we will continue to look at those three. I can't give you the exact number, we have this as an internal metric, but we don't disclose it.</p>
          <p>Certainly EPL will take us there significantly in terms of customer numbers and ARPU. And we will continue to look at other areas and other things that we have to do in this business to get it to the critical mass.</p>
          <p>But there are a few other things we'll be doing as well. I can't share the details with you, at the right time we will disclose them.</p>
