          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the News Corp. fourth quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time we'll turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations with News Corporation, Mr. Reed Nolte. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank very much operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call. On the call today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. Dave will give a detailed presentation of the quarter's results, followed by Chase who will give his own perspective and color on the year, then Rupert, Chase and Dave will be happy to take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy, actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 identifies risks and opportunities that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this call will contain certain non-GAAP financial measurements; the definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filings.</p>
          <p>Finally, not that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted EPS and adjusted net income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income is included in our earnings release and the EPS and net income reconciliation is posted on our website at the News Corp. investor relations earnings release page.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>Let me start with some highlights of our full-year results. Excluding the $500 million pre-tax litigation charge taken in this year's second quarter, segment operating income was $4.5 billion as compared to 3.6 billion reported a year ago.</p>
          <p>Factoring out last year's $121 million contribution from NDS which is no longer consolidated, segment operating income increased 30%. This growth is slightly better than the expectations we provided you three months ago.</p>
          <p>This strong financial performance was driven by 8% overall revenue growth, led by sizable operating profit growth at our Cable, and Film segments, offset in part by lower results in SKY Italia and MySpace.</p>
          <p>Bottom line the company reported net income of $2.5 billion for this fiscal year and earnings per share of $0.97. This compares to a net loss of 3.4 billion, or $1.29 per share reported a year ago, which included significant impairment charges. For the year we also generated strong free cash flow, $2.9 billion, this is 150% more than we reported last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the quarter, for the quarter operating segment income $932 million, which was down slightly from the fourth quarter a year ago, as double-digit growth in our cable, newspaper and television segments was mostly offset by declines in other segments, particularly Film, and SKY Italia. Bottom line, the company reported net income for the quarter of $875 million, as compared to a loss of 203 million reported for the fourth quarter a year ago, which primarily relates to impairment charges.</p>
          <p>This year's fourth quarter result includes pre-tax gains of $212 million in other, primarily from the sale of our Bulgarian TV stations, impairment and restructuring charges of $217 million, and $125 million in our share of a favorable litigation settlement at BSkyB. The fourth quarter a year ago included $680 million in pre-tax impairment and other charges.</p>
          <p>Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.30 this quarter, as compared to a similarly adjusted $0.19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition this quarter's net income includes approximately $312 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the recognition of certain prior-years' tax credits which contributed $0.12 to our earnings per share in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide some comments on a few of our businesses. I would like to start with the Cable Networks.</p>
          <p>Growth in our Cable Network segment continues to drive overall company results with fourth quarter operating income contributions up 31% on 15% higher revenues, reflecting the strength of FOX News, the RSNs, and our international cable businesses. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases in the quarter were from the FOX News channel and the RSNs where their strong market positions led to ad revenue increasing by over 20% versus the fourth quarter a year ago and affiliate fees continued their strong growth.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that at this point, we have renegotiated all of the original FOX News carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors, scheduled renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>The FOX International Channels also reported strong growth, 28% on strong advertising and affiliate growth particularly in Latin America and in Asia, and our STAR businesses, particularly in India, continued to show renewed strength with 42% advertising increases in the quarter led by our national and regional Indian channels.</p>
          <p>Our Cable Networks delivered $2.3 billion in operating income for the year. They now represent over half of the total company's segment-operating income. We expect this business to continue to lead our overall growth for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>The Filmed Entertainment segment reported fourth quarter operating income of $137 million, down as expected from 203 million reported a year ago, and as we mentioned on the last quarter earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects very strong home entertainment sales of the Avatar DVD this year, being more than offset by comparatively lower revenues related to the timing of pay and free TV availabilities and lower theatrical revenues from the mix of films as compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>At our television segment, the generated operating income in the quarter of $113 million, 13% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television station, partially offset by increased losses at the broadcast network from higher programming costs.</p>
          <p>Station revenues were up 29% in the quarter as compared to a year ago. This reflects improved local advertising trends particularly in the automotive, retail and telecommunications categories. Additionally, we benefited from higher political spending related to primary races in Los Angeles, Florida, and Philadelphia. This revenue growth at the stations fully converted to increased earnings.</p>
          <p>Turning to our pay television platform, SKY Italia, SKY generated segment operating income of $97 million, as compared to 155 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and this primarily reflects the rights costs related to the full coverage of the World Cup.</p>
          <p>While we experienced a challenging business and economic environment in Italy during fiscal 2010. Early indications in fiscal 2011 are encouraging. Total revenues increased 4% in local currency terms as compared to the prior-year's quarter, driven by upgrade tickets sold for the World Cup broadcast where more than half of the matches were exclusive to SKY Italia.</p>
          <p>New subscribers and lower churn netted SKY 45,000 additional subscribers in the quarter and this compares to no net new additions in the fourth a year ago. SKY closed out the fiscal year with 4.7 million subscribers. The fourth quarter overall churn rate was well below that of a year ago, which helped to produce an annual churn rate of approximately 13%, and this is considerably better than the trend we witnessed a few quarters ago.</p>
          <p>Overall costs were higher in the quarter, reflecting World Cup rights, scheduled increases in series A rights and costs related to the rollout of set top boxes with advanced HD and PVR capabilities.</p>
          <p>On July 1, SKY Italia's consumer offering was reorganized, more than doubling the number of programming package alternatives, including a &#x20AC;29 per month price point for the soccer package. We believe this increased choice for the Italian consumer will stimulate subscriber growth, the early response to this new package has been quite encouraging.</p>
          <p>At our newspaper and information service segment, we reported a solid quarter with segment operating income of $115 million, and this is up over 20% from the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase largely reflects strong advertising improvements at all major titles, led by a 22% increase at The Sun, 14% growth at the Wall Street Journal, and 10% growth at our Australian newspapers. And partially offsetting this growth is the absence of contributions from the Dow Jones index business that was disposed of in March of this year.</p>
          <p>And in our Other segment, we reported a fourth quarter segment operating loss of $174 million compared to a loss of 136 million a year ago, this higher loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace.</p>
          <p>And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, I would like to address our guidance for fiscal 2011. As we measure our guidance, we are starting with the fiscal 2010 segment operating income of $4 billion we just reported, exclude from this the 500 million litigation charge, resulting in a base for 2010 of 4.46 billion for comparative purposes.</p>
          <p>As we look at fiscal 2011, we are anticipating a stable economic outlook with modest growth in the major economies in which we operate, and we expect that advertising markets will remain healthy. As a result, we expect many of our businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, and these include continued robust growth at our Cable Networks, led by further expansion of our international channels, as well as sustained revenue increases at FOX News, the RSNs and STAR. As I mentioned earlier, cable is now our largest segment, it accounts for over 50% of our operating income, and is also our fastest-growing segment. Higher television segment earnings from continuation of strong local and national advertising markets, additional political spending at the local level related to the mid-term elections, and lower entertainment and program costs at the broadcast network will allow this segment to continue to grow. We also expect continued improvement at our newspaper segment as we expect advertising trends to continue to improve.</p>
          <p>But we are also facing difficult comparisons from certain items that positively impacted fiscal 2010, that we are not expecting to repeat in 2011. These items include an extraordinary successful year in Film that presents difficult film comps. While we are excited about our upcoming release slate, and about the strength of our film business overall, we are not however forecasting films to perform at the success level that Avatar achieved this past year. As a result we expect our Film earnings in 2011 to be below 2010 in the mid-$300 million range.</p>
          <p>Although current foreign exchange rates approximate the average we experienced for fiscal 2010, we are anticipating less favorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2011, and as a result, the lower exchange rates will reduce our 2011 operating income by about 2 percentage points. Taking all of these items into account, and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the 4.46 billion fiscal 2010 segment operating income base level.</p>
          <p>Obviously the decline in the film result I just referred to will affect comparisons in various quarters with the most challenging comparisons in the first and third quarters, owing to the timing comparisons of Avatar, and Ice Age 3.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year and I'd like to add that with 30% profit growth we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant stride we made to position us stronger today than we were a year ago.</p>
          <p>Yes, the economy was not as dire as we feared as we benefited from a recovering advertising market, an advertising market that continues to be very strong across the board today and we look to continue to take more than our fair share of that advertising. Our local stations currently look to be pacing at close to a 30% growth rate for this quarter, and the network scatter market continues to generate double-digit premiums to upfront pricing. Our cable network scatter is even higher than that.</p>
          <p>This strength is across the board with almost every major ad category showing growth. However, what really drove our results this past year was the quality of our execution and our leadership position across the vast majority of our businesses. I'm not going to speak about each of our businesses, but do want to spend a couple of minutes on a few key areas.</p>
          <p>Our success starts with our core content and distribution businesses. At our film division, our record-breaking results were driven by Avatar, which ushered in a whole new era in 3-D production. Our television studio matched it step by step with the two biggest hits of the season, Glee and Modern Family, which have both been sold into syndication in their first year.</p>
          <p>These content businesses are highlighted by long-term management teams that have proven track records that are second to none. Clearly success in this business is driven by creative executives making tough decisions, however, we have been equally adept at navigating the emerging digital technology and improving ourselves to be ahead of the curve and carving out leadership positions on issues like low-priced DVD rentals, and subscription streaming. We also continue to add exciting new extensions to these businesses like our overseas film units that released the number one film in India, My Name is Khan, or our television units that have produced original cable hits like Burn Notice and White Collar, a uniquely &#x2013; on uniquely attractive economic terms.</p>
          <p>The year-on-year comparison for this segment for 2011 may be tough due to the success of Avatar, as Dave said, but we feel great about our position as leaders in this business and our ability to take advantage of consolidating industry, and emerging exciting new distribution opportunities like mobile platforms.</p>
          <p>While our content business is frequently the headline-maker for us, no business is more important to us than our cable group, which has really become the foundation for News Corp.'s profit and cash flow. As Dave noted, it currently represents over half our profits, and that percent will continue to increase among our existing businesses. This is a big, broad group, with channels covering most genres and geographies. It is a group that has nearly tripled its profits over the last five years, yet we believe the most exciting growth is ahead of us.</p>
          <p>The majority of our core channels are still in a significant growth phase, and we continue to add key new channels that leverage existing franchises like the National Geographic Wild channel, the Big Ten channel or multiple channels around the world. We expect profits from our international channels to more than double over the next five years.</p>
          <p>FOX News is a true juggernaut, and we're heading into carriage renewal discussions. FX, which has led the industry in successful original programs, can grow by multiples before it reaches USA's profitability.</p>
          <p>Likewise, the National Geographic group is still only a small fraction of Discovery. This group not only has exciting growth potential, but great stability due to the long-range nature of our contracts. It is a fabulous business, and I do not believe that its strength, value and importance are properly understood in evaluating News Corp.</p>
          <p>In many ways our broadcast business has been as successful as our content and cable businesses. I actually think it should be thought of as part of our channels group; arguably, the driving force of our channels business. The FOX Network finished its sixth year as number one, and many of our stations had record market share. The problem is it simply has a lousy business model. Broadcast needs the dual revenue stream of its cable channel brethren. We have begun this fight and we will prevail. We have right on our side. We have the most valuable programming, and deserve to be fairly compensated.</p>
          <p>The third business that goes hand in hand with our content and channels is our satellite platforms. This business is at a much earlier growth stage than the others. In Italy, the last year has been a challenging one, with a combination of regulatory, competitive and economic headwinds. However, this is a market that is still in the early stages of its growth. We will look to HD and DVR as key forces to drive our businesses and put in place some exciting new packages and offers to complement our content leadership. While the summer is a difficult time to judge, we're optimistic about renewed momentum in coming quarters.</p>
          <p>SKY Deutschland is at an even earlier stage than Italy, and clearly a work in progress. Nonetheless, the size and wealth of this market makes the potential rewards clear. We know from the experiences of building platforms in the U.K., Italy and the U.S., that these are tough jobs that rarely follow a straight line.</p>
          <p>Our announced move to stand behind a &#x20AC;340 million capital call designed to give the business the flexibility to invest to build its offering. Our actions clearly speak to our belief in this business. The new management team has done a great job putting together a plan to focus on making SKY a leader in unique quality content, married to a position of HD leadership, while being able to invest in the operations to both maximize efficiencies and deliver a great customer experience.</p>
          <p>Our one platform that is not at in an early stage is BSkyB, which many consider the world's premier distribution platform. As you know, we have recently announced a proposal to acquire the rest of this business for cash. This is a business we know well and have a strong belief in its long-term potential. The transaction will be earnings accretive, while at the same time, achieving our strategic objectives of further increasing our profits generated from more stable subscription businesses and improving geographic diversification.</p>
          <p>In addition, fully consolidated, BSkyB allows us to streamline our corporate structure, which would enhance our valuation by the investment community. We presented a full and fair offer that values SKY at a significant premium. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to this transaction. We've been willing to sit with our current investments for many years, and have other options for our cash.</p>
          <p>While we expect our content, channel and platform businesses to drive the profitability and value of our company, we equally believe that our print businesses have exciting opportunities to grow as historical competitors struggle, and digital technologies open new arenas for expansion.</p>
          <p>We've led the industry in focusing on dual-revenue stream business models, and believe mobile platforms will transform the print business. We've clearly established ourselves as leaders in every market where we compete, and are determined to pursue ways to maximize the profitability of these businesses while intelligently navigating risk.</p>
          <p>Our goal with these businesses I just discussed, and more importantly with News Corp. as a whole, is to build long-term value for our shareholders. We believe we're in a growth business, and that there are unique opportunities out there to expand our franchises and add value, be it in international markets that are still growing, or digital arenas that are just emerging.</p>
          <p>We prefer to build not buy, in taking advantage of these opportunities. We will take risks, but they will be intelligent risks, and we're prepared to walk away if the risks get too high. Equally, we're not just focused on growth. We have made it a priority to reduce costs and maximize efficiencies in businesses from our TV stations to our newspapers to content production. We've also divested businesses like our Bulgarian TV unit and the Dow Jones indexes when we've determined they were not strategic to us.</p>
          <p>We recognize that the cash accumulated on our balance sheet created a highly inefficient capital structure, but we did it for a reason, and we're now addressing it. We're proud of what we built, and we are committed to continuing to build not only an even greater business, but one that rewards our shareholders as well.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and with that I'll turn it back to Reed.</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Your first question in queue comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. And your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just take that to mean one question for each of the speakers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for Rupert of course. So Chase, there's something in the press, I think today that said you were going to take a salary cut. I was wondering if you could comment, is that true? And if it is true, what led to that decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm actually doing is reducing my salary, but it is essentially changing it into longer-term performance-based compensation. I think that's the preferred thing for senior management in the company. I think it aligns senior management, it aligns my interest more with the shareholders and I think &#x2013; and I believe in the business. I believe in our future, and I think it's the right thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then I'll just put my next two questions before I get cut off. So, Dave, in your guidance, can you address what your advertising assumptions are in that?</p>
          <p>And Rupert, I was just hoping you could give us general comments of your view of the world economy at this point. On the last call, you were really concerned about Europe before the world focused on Greece, and I was wondering if you could update us on how pessimistic or optimistic you are today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jessica, we're not going to give you all of the advertisement, but if you look at the two in the United States, whether it's our &#x2013; take our cable, or our television stations, they would be for the year-around the mid-teens level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you want me to talk about the world economy, I'd just say that I can't help but believe it stays very fragile, certainly the Western world. On the other hand, we have almost inexplicably good advertising and great confidence there, so we'll just have to see how it turns out. But certainly, I'm very, very confident of the next six months. But I think there is sufficient fragility for us not to be overconfident about the long term, or the medium-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, the next question in queue will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Chase one for you and maybe one more after the follow-up. But I wanted to go back to the FOX News re-pricing. I know you can't talk about specific deals, but I think you started re-pricing &#x2013; renegotiating that network back in late '07 and I think you just finished with the last distributor earlier this year. I think that's roughly right. So it looks like it was sort of a two year, two and a half year process. Is that roughly similar to how the next round is going to go just from a timing perspective or do they pace out further out in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is probably a little longer than that in timeframe, and it's a multi-year process that &#x2013; I'm not sure quite a specific year timeframe it to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'd be more like 3.5 than 2.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more than two, certainly less than five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask about the two sort of earlier-stage European distribution businesses: SKY Italia and SKY Deutschland, you clearly are believers in both. What is the consideration around potentially consolidating SKY Deutschland at some point? Is that even in your thought process as you think about helping them finance and build that business in Germany?</p>
          <p>And then in Italy, Rupert, we've seen that market become sort of more and more difficult from a competitive environment, the regulatory environment, a lot of the political overtones that has impacted SKY Italia. As you look at it over the next two years, do you think that gets better from here or is it going to remain a big challenge for that business?</p>

          <p>On SKY Deutschland, our focus really is on building the business. We recognize today it is obviously is in a loss position, and we're obviously driving it forward to, you know, maximize the opportunity there.</p>
          <p>We believe &#x2013; we believe it really can be a great platform for us. You look at the size and the scale of that German market, there are some unique aspects to it we have to figure out. Customers there do have more choice going in, so we have to ensure our quality really stands out &#x2013; our content stands out, our quality and drive, the quality in terms of HD and DVR to make sure we focus on the right content to drive the experience. But that is really our focus, is maximizing the business. While we know it is in a loss position in the short-term, I think our focus will remain on maximizing the performance of the business.</p>

          <p>I guess on SKY front, I'm not sure I can provide a lot of clarity beyond what we've said before. We're still in the early stages of the regulatory process we have a regulatory review. I think as we've said, it could take sort of six months, but it could take longer, and we have to see how that process goes along. At this point it seems to be going largely as we expected. Past that regulatory review, I think we have got a commitment for a couple of months, three months to not pursue a proposal without a board recommendation, and I think those are the parameters, so it'll...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think right now it's the regulatory review. That's really what I think we recognize from both sides it benefited us to get to a place where we had the regulatory review behind us, and so that is really &#x2013; the focus today is to get regulatory approval for the transaction.</p>

          <p>I guess I will just add, there are only two stages in Europe. We'll be filing very shortly in Brussels, and that takes about a month to go through the first stage. They can call and normally do, but not always, for a second stage, which could take two or three months. It would then come back to the British regulators, so that's why Chase said it could be six months or 12 months, but certainly not more than 12.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, just wondered if you could comment to the extent you care to on potential M&amp;A opportunities and some which may have come up in the press recently, I believe one relating to acquisition of a sports team, baseball, but also just generally what you might consider doing with some of the businesses in the Other segment, such as Jamba and MySpace and what your timing is on any decisions you might make there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I would just begin by saying, we will not be buying any sporting teams. We are in the business of buying sports rights for our sporting channels, not buying teams.</p>
          <p>And as for other M&amp;A possibilities, I don't think it'd be appropriate for us to discuss at this stage, but the &#x2013; as far as MySpace goes, it is getting &#x2013; we have got a new management team. We've got great confidence in them. They are doing a major overhaul that will look very, very different in a few months to what it's looked for the last few years, and we're going to see it out for some time yet.</p>

I just wondered if you could talk about the <mark type="inaudible" /> strategy being pursued at the U.K. newspaper business and the potential to roll it out more broadly, and as part of that discussion, how meaningful could iPad revenue become for the newspaper businesses globally?</p>

          <p>As for the iPad, of course there will be other imitators. There will be other people in the market very soon, but I believe that that is a game changer altogether. We'll have young people reading newspapers. We'll have different-looking news &#x2013; types of newspapers. We have already got a number of new sites from independent people at the moment.

          <p>Thanks so much. Chase, I wanted to ask you about executing at the TV division. Obviously there was a lot of commentary on retrans and it was necessary and now of course you're getting it. On the past call &#x2013; or the prior call, I think there was a view that TV can get back to the $1 billion EBIT run rate that it had been averaging pre-recession. So, you're at 220 million now, I know you get clinical this year, but how do you get from 220 million of EBIT back to a billion, or is that not the goal anymore? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously retransmission, we're in the very early stages of, you know, that process. We have done a couple, we have got a couple more coming up this fall. As we said, it takes a few years, the affiliate side of it, we're just moving into, so, you know, realistically we're just at the very beginning of that dynamic. And our stations realistically are still &#x2013; you know, still sort of recovering or growing, I mean, you look at this quarter, the year on year comps are not &#x2013; they're going to get a lot tougher the second half of the year, but you look at the year on year comps for the first half of this year, the station has, you know, great comps, and, you know, even on the network we had Glee last year, but we probably got to a place where we were a little too reliant on older expensive programming. We had 24, and I think we did a good job reenergizing with Glee.</p>
          <p>I think we have an opportunity to really sort of reinvent American Idol this fall. Obviously there'll be some cost savings in that, but I think more importantly, it's really an opportunity to really reenergize and get of a &#x2013; you know, a fresh &#x2013; an existing franchise refreshment. Marry it to X-Factor in fall of 2011, that I think really gives us the potential for a great double header in that business, and continue to really, you know, create programming that stands out. You look at already &#x2013; not that editorials or I guess reviews are always the best barometer of success, but I think the shows we have got going on in the network this fall, people feel good about, I think we've got a great mix of a couple of hours and a couple of half-hours that have great potential and I think that's the point, make sure we have got &#x2013; you know, fresh, new, exciting programming coming. And the network I think has growth in it.</p>
          <p>I think the stations are still in a place of recovering. We are actually not through the cost cutting at the stations. We have taken a fair amount of overhead and head count out, but through this calendar year, we're continuing to take some of that out, and the &#x2013; you know, I think there &#x2013; you know, there are an array of initiatives from the retrans so the stations can enter potential and the network, you know, finding, you know, continue to reenergize, you know, with fresh programming like it's got coming this fall or Glee last year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just point out that we &#x2013; we're the number one network this year by a bigger margin, I think, than certainly we have ever been in the five years we have been in that position. And I am extremely confident that &#x2013; on what we're doing with Idol, but it's the year after when we're going to have Idol and X-Factor, and other programs which should really make us stand right out as the number one. You get mass audiences, you get plenty of advertising whatever the economic conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within our growth for the year, projected growth for next year, we are projecting pretty significant growth for the television segment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just trying to get a sense of how much of it was revenue, and retrans versus advertisers versus costs, but I think...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is some of all. I would not say costs are the driving force, but they're certainly a contributor to it, you know? But, you know, it is &#x2013; both program costs and efficiencies, but certainly they are all significant, they are not &#x2013; retrans is probably the singular long term -but, look if USA is going to make $1 billion, we have ratings that are multiples &#x2013; and I'm not picking on them, but we have ratings that are multiples of theirs for the type of event programming we have &#x2013; you know, we'd better be making &#x2013; driving to make this business so that it makes more than they do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So retransmit is full contribution which would be very great, that will take two or three years by the time we get through all of our contracts for all the different MSOs, it's probably like what has happened with FOX News, but it will be there and it will be very important.</p>
          <p>Just on the stations, whereas, you know, for the company generally, we are moving more and more to subscription models, and dependent on the regular subscription revenues and rising ones, but the stations which depend on advertising, they will be getting part of the retrans, but they get bookings are extraordinary at the moment in every category, I think, except maybe beverages.</p>
          <p>In July alone, we were up 44% in automotive, and our pacing for the next two months, which may be a little deceptive, because people are now making their bookings earlier, but we're talking an 80 to 90% increase in automotive. So it's really very, very strong, and we are increasing our share of market in those local stations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me now? Oh, sorry. So a question on SKY Deutschland, just when you look at the differences between what you have seen in Italy, and Italy has obviously become, even though it is struggling at the moment versus last year, it has been an overwhelming success. When you look at the challenges facing Germany as it starts off in your investments there, what are the big differences that you see between Italy and Germany? What have you learned so far? You changed management. Maybe give us a sense of why the change in management, what is being done differently now that gives you confidence in where it's going over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess I think probably the first difference you look to between the two is &#x2013; I touched on it a minute ago, in Germany, the consumers do have a fair amount of choice &#x2013; the majority have a fair amount of choice, where they start off with a &#x2013; you know, with a fairly decent channel package they get through cable or satellite, which wasn't the case, you know, in Italy. What that really means is &#x2013; what you focus on is sort of quality.</p>
          <p>So in Germany it's more a quality experience. You have got to create &#x2013; whether it's content &#x2013; whether that quality is in content or in technology, be it HD, DVRs, user interfaces or the like. So you want to create content that stands out.</p>
          <p>Again, the other difference, I guess I'd say is you have a cable business there in Germany that probably covers half of the market that you largely distribute through, so that &#x2013; you know, I mean you don't really have a cable, you know, industry in Italy. It means that the competition is different. I mean in Germany you have got the telco and the cable and they're much more focused on broadband and telephony, and so we're there with the video offering, and I think the key is really to offer a quality video offering. We've got a pretty wide open place to do it. They are making some noise, but I do think their focus is elsewhere, and create a quality video offering, quality technology, and marry it to quality service. And in Italy, toe to toe, someday become the media sat platform.</p>
          <p>It is competing on price. I think we've got quality and I think we have found our footing and our mojo back in Italy, and I feel like we're on a good track there, but you know &#x2013; different competitive dynamics. You have got some real economic benefits because of it. Germany is a bigger market, yet we pay significantly less for key sports rights in Germany. Because of the infrastructure that exists in Germany sat is a fraction of what it would be in many markets, because you can take advantage of the fact that people have &#x2013; a lot of people have dishes on their home, a good percentage get satellite, have dishes and in a lot of place they have set-top boxes. They have wiring into the homes. So there's some real efficiencies you can take advantage of.</p>
          <p>In Germany you've got to make sure you're smart about programming, you're betting on stuff that makes a difference, be efficient with what you run, drive the places you can make a difference like HD and DVRs. Create a great experience for customers, take advantage of the efficiencies and the opportunities that exist in terms of cost savings and the like, make sure you're buying programming that makes a difference, you're not just buying bulk. And take advantage perhaps of the competitive environment where the competitors are really focused value first and foremost on other products. And I think those are a lot of dynamics that are different if you look at Italy.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, guys. I was just looking at the international channels. They're becoming a material driver of growth within cable networks. I wonder if you can break out the operating income for FY '10, and then talk about their growth expectations on a three-year view, and what countries or regions are really driving that growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're in probably most of the world. There probably is some regions &#x2013; Latin America has been a very successful region for us, Europe is a great successful region for us, but we really &#x2013; it is a, you know, big wide broad growth and some of these markets follows &#x2013; one of the great things about international is &#x2013; you know, a lot of the markets are still just developing, and obviously we need a developed distribution market to create channels for it and so we have &#x2013; you know, we are, you know, riding on the back of that but it is, you know, it is most continents, most regions. Again, those would be the couple that are bigger. And I think the neighborhood this year is sort of around 400 million and again as I said, it's looking within five years the business we expect to be a $1 billion business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question is for Rupert; you are clearly trying to get paid for your print content online, so I was wondering if you could update us on your current thoughts about how you plan on monetizing your TV programs and networks online in the context of the TV Everywhere initiative as well as your ownership in Hulu, and then just very quick for Dave, should we expect any material changes in CapEx in fiscal '11, versus the 914 million you reported in fiscal 2010? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll do the CapEx. It will be a bit higher in fiscal 2011, probably going to be in the 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion range.</p>

          <p>I would say on the &#x2013; we'll be pushing very hard on VOD. If you talk about Hulu, and Netflix, and various things, these new businesses are under constant review. Some are a challenge to us, and I wouldn't say any more than that at the moment, other than that Chase and I and the whole of the film company are giving a great deal of thought to future moves in this area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the general theme as you get into these digital arenas that are &#x2013; you know, that you want &#x2013; I think you &#x2013; you want to move towards, you know, dual revenue stream businesses &#x2013; it doesn't mean there aren't some places you have free, but I think probably subscription is the most, but I think we need to look at an array of sort of dual revenue stream businesses and I think we need to manage windows, and I think the Times business has gotten they sort of acted first and thought second, and I think we need to, you know, make sure we have great product we need product and manage the pricing and the windows and the like, and we need to be part of this digital world, and I think there are great opportunities. I do think mobility &#x2013; and I agree with Rupert's observations on the iPad, and I don't believe there are a lot of iPads, not just there are a lot of tablets, and a lot of devices. I think really that's an opportunity to create a whole new platform that we can develop and develop in a constructive way. And do things like authentication. It has the promise of really developing, you know, the business, you know, business models that are healthy for us that open up, you know, new avenues, find new exciting opportunities for our customers but find them, you know, in ways that enable us to you know &#x2013; to, you know, to continue to add value to our businesses and carefully manage the uniqueness of our product and not just let it get commoditized by being thrown out there too widely, you know, and too freely.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I wonder if you can talk generally about how you are thinking about tablet computers and in mobile whether you see those devices as an opportunity to kind of replicate existing content or whether you are thinking to develop entirely new business ideas for those devices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel &#x2013; I mean, I guess &#x2013; I mean, I'll speak, you know, from my perspective. I do think those devices have transformed people's expectations, and the opportunities around, you know, mobile. For a number of years we talked about, you know, the value of content, you know, in our mobile platforms, and I think you may get, I don't know, maybe a 20 year old to watch a smartphone, but I think this device really &#x2013; and as others have those devices out there, you know, really gives you both a much richer experience, really is obviously very conducive to video, but even if you take the Wall Street Journal on an iPad is a very different experience than it is on a PC.</p>
          <p>And I think you can use it for some of these things and using it tells you how it is different and I think it is also a device that for the first time, you know, really starts to deliver on the promise of multimedia, where you can see how you could jump between &#x2013; you can sort of go between what traditionally would be video content, printed content, advertising that really is interactive, and if you could penetrate through and, you know, and engage with, so I think a lot of the buzz words that have existed you know for a few years, people talk about interactive TV and mobile platforms and all of that stuff, you know, for a few years I think all of a sudden it becomes something you can envision and a real that's happened. I think for us it's incumbent enough to try to figure out what are the opportunities again, intelligently, you know, recognizing our product has tremendous value and how do we exploit it?</p>
          <p>You know, how do we develop the right consumer experiences, you know, on those devices, and what are the types of digital opportunities that we can develop? We're actively engaged in trying to develop an array of ways to display &#x2013; and I think &#x2013; you know, this is emerging platform, which we think will be an enormous platform, and we think it's a real opportunity for us.</p>

          <p>I'd just add &#x2013; I'd just say &#x2013; I'll add this. I mentioned the word 'game changer' before, I believe that. I think we're going to see around the world hundreds and hundreds and millions of these devices and there will be all sorts of things we can do with them and &#x2013; as they develop technologically, we have got to develop our methods of presentation of news.</p>

The music will certainly be better, and we'll &#x2013; we've got great expectations for it. As for CKX, no, we don't really have any say on who the owner is, or will be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Mr. Murdoch, I was just wondering if you could &#x2013; if whether the rights or the anti-siphoning list here in Australia sort of could create some uncertainty in terms of bidding for sport rights that your pay TV operations here in Australia might be interested in? If you could talk a bit about that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the position of FOXTEL versus the free-to-air?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just in terms of bidding for sports rights that are coming up between the lack of a new updated anti-siphoning list from the government whether that creates some uncertainty about &#x2013; about, you know, the prospect of your pay TV operations here bidding for some of those rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we only have 25% of FOXTEL, and I think personally that the anti-siphoning, I understand how it happened, which I won't go into, but, you know, it does hurt the sports associations, in that there's no open bidding between pay and free-to-air, and also it hurts the viewers in that a lot of sports, which are not top sports, were on the anti-siphoning list and get put on by the free-to-air at 2:00 in the morning or something. So, you know, will it be impacted by the election? I really don't know.</p>
