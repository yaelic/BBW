      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining us. To those of you who are here, welcome to our new premises. I've got Piyush and Sok Hui with me and Sebastian in Hong Kong and the rest of the team. So, we'll start off with opening remarks of Piyush and then we'll take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks for being here. I'm not sure how many of you got our media webcast, but I'll just recap what I said then. The fourth quarter actually, I think, is the first quarter last year where we missed the average of analysts' forecast or estimates we have had. So, but if you look at the underlying drivers and momentum of the business, actually, the headline number is not that worrying.</p>
          <p>We really had two or three headwinds in the quarter. One was on loans. My estimation was based on our pipelines in the microloan in China, that we'll start seeing a pickup in business volume from September, October. Actually, this got delayed by a couple of months. So we did start seeing the pick-up come in, but the pickup started coming through only in December, as opposed to the early part of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our loans we added, SGD 8 billion. Most of that came in the last few weeks. And you can see that up on our LDR. Loan deposit ratio in September is SGD 84 and change, end of the year, it's SGD 86 and change, it's up by 2.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. So, if you look at the average, the third quarter LDR is SGD 86-something, and the fourth quarter LDR is SGD 84-something.</p>
          <p>So what that means is we didn't get the benefit of the interest income through the quarter. On the other hand, we kept the GPs, the general provisions, because the assets were on our books at the end of the quarter. So, and we clearly had some problems on account of that.</p>
          <p>The second thing which is more distinct, OpEx two, three basis points in the quarter. So the tight business climate is a little bit more than we expected. A couple of distinct, NIM reduction from China has trickled out into this quarter, as we're thinking we're pretty much done with it, but we got a little more restricted out in the early part of this quarter, so as the trade repricing.</p>
          <p>Then, the second I told you last time, we were reducing the tenure of our securities book together with the long-tenured securities. That obviously has impact on yield. You can see that in our performance summary. It's quite clear that our security and asset yield is down from 2.45% to 2.25% for the quarter, so that has a material impact on overall NIM.</p>
          <p>And the third was, we saw some pricing pressure outside of China. In fact remember last quarter, I said we only had a NIM problem with China, nowhere else. And in the fourth quarter, we still didn't have a problem at Hong Kong. We continue to price up in Hong Kong or in the north. But in the south, southeast, including some in Singapore, but in India as well, we saw some NIM pressure around the region.</p>
          <p>The third issue which happened, obviously, is that the markets pretty much slowed down, capital markets, for most of the fourth quarter and that is based on the fiscal cliff issues. So single bond in the third quarter, about SGD 12 billion were raised and we obviously drew a share of that. We have some 25%, 30% market share.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, only SGD 3.8 billion was raised, so the markets weren't there to raise. We had actually active pipeline versus capacity to raise the limited. We even pulled the couple of deeds on the equity side. So the capital markets momentum that we saw in the third quarter, we didn't have the window to do that in the fourth quarter. So all of that contributed to our top line, which is a tad lighter than I had anticipated going into the quarter.</p>
          <p>The good news, like I said, is that momentum came back in December, so we talked about the loan volume. But across the board, things started looking a lot better and frankly after the fiscal cliff issues went off the table, you could see that this country, that the overall momentum on the back of that. And that momentum spilled over into the first month of this year. It's been quite strong across the ranges, not only in the loan book, but also capital market.</p>
          <p>As you know, we were active on some very large capital market transactions as well, including the PCC trade and SC Global's privatization and so on. So the capital markets, the flow business was strong, the loan book has been strong. So I'd say generally quite encouraged that we hit the year with a lot of positive momentum. And therefore, the softness in the top line numbers for the fourth quarter is a little bit of an aberration.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expense, the expense numbers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:43) for the fourth quarter is, again, the worst we've seen in a long time. But again, this really isn't coming back more than &#x2013; and interest expense went up, but it's seasonal. So we took some expense which is moving into this again. So that's the prominent thing in updates, it's not huge.</p>
          <p>We took expenses related to systems. So a lot of systems came out clean and then the recognition for both the operating expense and depreciation, but a lot of systems are also running off in the next quarter. So year-on-year, my technology costs are not going to go up on an annual basis. So that's a fourth quarter aberration.</p>
          <p>If you look at our cost expense growth for the year, it's been on a downward trend. Full year is up 9%, but the first quarter was up 16%, second quarter was up 9% and then, the third and fourth quarter will be up 6% and 7%. So my cost second half of the year has been growing at about 6%, 7% rate, which is what I expect going forward. So budgets are for flat to positive jaws this year, which means that we shouldn't see any deterioration on our cost to income ratio from here. So I'm not overly concerned about the expense situation as a consequence.</p>
          <p>And NPLs, the quarterly NPL is a little bit up. It went up 15 basis points. But it's really more of what I told you in the third quarter, it's sporadic, and it's isolated SME-related credit. So there's trend. There's no large listing of SME either by sector, industry or country. They are isolated SME-related credits which we recognize, but it's not a big deal.</p>
          <p>So if you look at on a full-year basis, I think we took 9 or 10 basis points in SPs for the year. And as we project out this year, even though we put something more in our budget in Tier 2 environment terms go south, we're not seeing it so far. Not seeing a deterioration in the environment either.</p>
          <p>So put all of that together, I'm actually quite optimistic about how 2013 is looking and how it's starting off. I think we will see some pressure on NIM. And across this thing, but it's up and down. As you know, in Singapore, we were able to price up for housing loans through the third and fourth quarter, right, so we got some relief there. We were able to price up Hong Kong, we got some relief there.</p>
          <p>But on the whole, the liquidity available in the region is putting some pricing pressure. So I expect to see a couple of basis points to previous point impact from pricing around the region. We are not seeing pressure on cost of funds, on funding cost. If you look at overall, we're certainly not having to price up under the policy, same thing.</p>
          <p>In fact, the LTR changes with the number, I think that should see some relief on the deposit front, because a lot of poor countries have people who are bidding up for retail deposits. Now that you only have to get 60%, then this changes the definition. I think that's based on the edge of the consumer retail deposit pricing as well. So I really don't anticipate too much pressure from funding, but I do expect some pressure from low pricing.</p>
          <p>So, let me stop there and then, take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take questions from the room first, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You speak about sort of being reasonably optimistic for 2013. But I'm just trying to understand what your &#x2013; what optimistic is for you, because if I look at your loan growth of 10% so I'm assuming deposit growth is not going to be very different. So your balance sheet growth is about 10%. You've got margin compression, probably about 8%, 7% just year-on-year, because your starting margin is lower than your average margin for last year, so very difficult to get net interest income growth. Assuming you get some non-interest, your cost-to-income is flat and it would be difficult to match your loan charge from last year. So are you expecting growth in 2013? Or do you think it will be -</p>
          <p>and if so, how do you get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think if you look on an operating basis, we can get mid-single-digit growth on an operating basis from even 2013, okay? So if you look at our projections from &#x2013; just on an ex-credit business, assuming if &#x2013; I'm assuming my budgeted credit costs. That's what drives this thing. If credit turns out to be more benign than I'm forecasting, credit turns out to be anything like it was last year, we will get same double-digit growth, okay?</p>
          <p>So the range of mid-single-digit to double-digit will be a function of how credit turns out. And if credit turns out to be benign, we'll get double-digit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean, that will come through the non-interest income line for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Across the range on non-interest income, if you look at this year, when non-interest income are &#x2013; all of that annuity sealed and non-interest income are very strong, okay. So the wealth is up 50%. Cash is up 50%. Trade finance is up 50% year-on-year and that momentum is sustaining. So if you look at why the overall fee income is not very strong for the year, it's because equity's brokerage was down SGD 40 million, SGD 45 million from last year. Investment banking was down SGD 40 million, SGD 45 million versus from last year. Last year, investment banking had the big elephant trade we did for Hutch. So that was, like I explained, the bulk of this thing.</p>
          <p>So always assume that the investment banking and brokerage can't get worse from where it is. If anything, you presume it doesn't pick up. We'll get that lift in the rest of that exchange. That's ongoing to that extent. The first thing which was part of this year is trading income. Trading income was down 5% this year relative to last year on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>If you look at by total trading income, the trading income has been sliding for the customer part of that. It had been growing quite nicely. In fact, over three years, the customer component of net income has gone from SGD 400 million to SGD 800 million, right. The trading income was about SGD 1.1 billion. So my total is about SGD 1.9 billion from the whole trading range of activities.</p>
          <p>So again, my assumption about this thing is that I don't wind up tanking saving, but we don't take too much risk. The reason our trading doesn't work is that we use world portfolio. And so, plus 5% is what we have. We have a normal trading year that should keep us the same, SGD 1.1 billion, SGD 1.2 billion. And then we contributed the growth on the customer side of offshore income. So we look at our non-interest income, we actually came around 34% there.</p>
          <p>As the ratio for revenues, we were up at 37%, 38% last year and this gap between 37%, 38%, and 34% was really the stockbroking and investment banking decline and some trading decline. So there is a real reason and focus for us to believe that we should be able to get back to 37%, 38% and even more. So I think that's strong level of growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to follow up on that. I mean, I struggle with the same math Nick has got, but I have some pretty heroic assumptions in the noninterest income and trading line to get back that operating profit up this year. Can you give a bit more color around the costs? I mean, you're talking about a flat to slightly down cost-to-income ratio. But for me in my house, that implies sub-5% cost growth in this sort of environment, which seems very, very tough to achieve. Is that essentially what you're baking in? Is it you've got single digit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the other thing, if you look at the last second half of the year, we had 6%, 7% cost growth rate. And we've got two big distincts. First of all, we've got the strategic cost management initiative targeted to take up 5% over three years. We got half of it in one year. And so, the things we have on back of the stage, we think we can actually achieve this 5% in two years. So we have one avenue around that.</p>
          <p>The second is the bulk of our head count related cost growth are behind us. If you look at this thing, we grew head count by a couple of thousand for two years. This year, we grew 750 on people, head count. The staff cost first half of the year was still high, because that full-year impact from last year was still direct.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the second part of this year, we got almost no staff cost increase, because &#x2013; so we don't have to grow staff costs from where we are. We have the strategic cost management still continuing to kick in from activities that we're doing.</p>
          <p>And then, final touch, we have &#x2013; variable comp is always a question that we can figure out how much variable cost we want to put into the target. So we are very comfortable that we should be able to handle our costs in the mid-single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just ask a question, test your confidence on the two basis points to three basis points on NIM, because it seems the asset you'll keep surprising on the down side as the asset quality stays at 9. How are you seeing that trending through Q4 into Q1? Is there a still pretty intense pressure on the asset yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the uncertainty is that don't know, because I call it off from the third to fourth quarter, because on all this thing, we wound up having a little bit more pressure than I anticipated. But I call it on the basis of exactly what I see, what is the momentum and what is the new business we're getting in?</p>
          <p>And at this point in time, there is some, but China, actually, I'm getting an update, because China, all this variable re-pricing is behind us. So at this stage, we're actually beginning to see some uptick in NIMs in China.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, we've been able to price up through the year. I don't think we can do that any more. In fact, the business we're booking now is actually beginning to be a little more competitive, but marginal adjusting. Indonesia I'm not seeing this thing in margins.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, we saw the impact of &#x2013; we booked fixed rate loans two, three years ago. The fixed rate loans has been loaned off and we took them off. So, we some impact of the fixed rate loan conversion into floating rate in Singapore. But that's some &#x2013; and the day-to-day pricing on the housing loans, as you know, the pricing in Sing dollar loans has gone up. It's up 10 basis points in the last three, four months. It's not going down, apart from getting it off this thing.</p>
          <p>Business loans are down, so business loan pricing has been under pressure in Singapore. And in India, pricing has been down, right? So it's been a mixed bag across. But the new business that we're adding on at this point in time is not looking like it's significantly down from what we've been booking over the last three, four months. But it gives me some fresh confidence that maybe a couple of basis points putting together, looking at.</p>
          <p>A little bit of that has been impacted by the nature of our loan book, right? So if you look at what we've been doing in the last few months is, we've been getting the trade goal, just a shorter tenure compared to the existing goal. So we give up some deals when we move tenure down, which is the same thing on the securities book.</p>
          <p>Securities book, we already re-jigged our securities portfolio. So we're not actually bringing down duration any more, so we won't have the pressure of margin on the securities side. And on the loan book, if you look at the loan pipelines, the loans that have been coming through at this point in time, actually, a lot of it is not triggered. It is regular loans. So I'm hoping that that should allow me to get some new pick-up. So it's not a science, it's an art. When you put all of that together, it looks like a couple of basis points, two, three basis points impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, are there any questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First on the line, I have Mr. Matthew Phan. Over to you, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Matthew here from CreditSights. Could I just ask about some color on the industry? We are seeing loan growth in Singapore of about 17% for 2012, but I think the Sing banks are all growing at high single-digit rates. So I'm just wondering, who is growing the loans and we're seeing, for example, manufacturing loans up at like something like 40%. And so, who is growing this and where are the loans going to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, that's a good question. I'm not sure I have a straight response to that. Where is the balance of that 17%? It's quite diversified, right? When I look in the market, there's no new competition relative to the competition we had before. The Japanese have been taking some share in the last year or so. So, but that's an anecdotal observation, right? So the Japanese will be picking up some of the loan business. And another bank, ANZ has been picking up some loan business around the region.</p>
          <p>Now, was there market share growth other than Singapore? Interestingly, our market share in Singapore, they've actually been growing, right? So not just tied to Sing. But it's not just the Sing dollar, it's the overall, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:16) book, our market share in India has been growing based on EMEA's data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Thanks for that. Could I also ask then, do you see EU banks, European banks coming back to the market, given that their funding situation and liquidity has improved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have been since the beginning of last year. I've been saying that they've entered the market for six months at the end of 2011. But for whole of 2012, the bank have been back &#x2013; as soon as the NTR operations happened basically, the liquidity bogie got lifted. So since they were only left with this capital issue, they were like the U.S. banks, right? They are obviously hopeful about the capital, but they've been back in the market when the only distinctions have been blame the high-end business. So the banking, the top-tier clients, they've just not been doing the SME and mass market business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Great. And could I ask another question actually with respect to the mortgage book? I think on the media call, you talked about a steepening of the yield curve and possibly a rise in interest rates I'm just wondering with respect to your mortgage book, in your internal stress test, what sort of assumptions do you make with respect to how high interest rates could go and what sort of impact do you see on the credit quality? Could you also give some indication of what the loan to values are and what the debt service ratio is on your books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the loan-to-value ratio of our mortgage book in Singapore is about 55% average. The loan-to-value ratio of the book in Hong Kong is actually now in the high low 40%s or high 30%s even, that's been coming down more and more. So and also, if you wanted the standard deviation, 98% of our book is under 80% LTV, and in Hong Kong, I think 97% of our book is under 60% LTV. So it's not just average, just our LTV, our books are quite low. In terms of cash flows, the debt burden ratio, we built in an assumption of 3.5% in terms of interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we take the cash flow and just think, that's what we build off, right, which is obviously much, much higher than any interest rates that we have right now and unlikely to get to that level. But that's what we build into our assumptions when we do a debt burden ratio and debt servicing, on the basis of which we do our cash flow credit underwriting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And so under those assumptions, I guess you don't see any significant credit quality risk, then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Under those assumptions, this still our portfolio at up to 50% decline in mortgage and residential properties pricing, and we have really no material impact on our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Great. Final question. Could I just ask about the progress in terms of reshaping the Hong Kong operations? I understand that you've been running down the mortgage book. I think you said about SGD 1 billion worth. So I'm just wondering where the income is coming from, then, with respect to Hong Kong, if you're running the loan book down? I know &#x2013; so I think with the shift to the high net worth segment, could you just maybe give some color on how that is coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, remember the Hong Kong, we've got three parts to the business, like everywhere all testing. For the corporate business, where our strategy of focusing on China is spinning off quite nicely. So, the China-related business has continue to grow very strongly, both in terms of the number of clients we have, in terms of the penetration of those clients and the range of business we're doing with the China biz, so that's been strong.</p>
          <p>The second is our SME business. The SME business we held off both in Hong Kong and China for the last year, purely because of macroeconomic considerations. So we weren't very bullish about growing SME, given the uncertainty in the environment.</p>
          <p>But in Hong Kong, what we did do &#x2013; in China, we just handed it off entirely. In Hong Kong, we have two segments of the SME. One is the, we call the more Ns than S. So it's slightly larger companies who are <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:32) we basically approve on those. But at the lower end, the domestic companies, the regular domestic shape, we grew that business quite nicely. In fact, it was up 40% or something for the year, the lower segment of the SME segment. This year, we are beginning to start putting our foot on the pedal in terms of SME going up in both Hong Kong and China. So we anticipate we should be able to get some growth out of that.</p>
          <p>Now, finally in the consumer space, we basically decided to exit the market which is based in Hong Kong, and we've restructured our branches. We have closed down some, sold some, renovated, restructured branches and started focusing on the very affluent segment and that's doing very extremely well. We are beginning to get a lot of traction in terms of AuM growth as well as revenue growth. So, the usual sale of investment products, sale of interest products.</p>
          <p>And then, Sebastian is on the line. Sebastian, do you want to comment a bit on how the affluent business in Hong Kong is doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You're right, Piyush. I would only add, for example, with the restructure of the consumer business in Hong Kong, we were able to reduce the cost to income ratio, for example, from 97% to 80% today. So that has been a dramatic push for improvement.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, you are right. We have the investment products as well as the insurance-related products on the bancassurance business. We've grown more than 40% to 50% last year. So I think that the affluent segment investments are paying off substantially, both on the revenue side as well as on the expenses side.</p>
          <p>Finally, the repositioning of the mortgage book was because we're moving away from the very low-priced mortgage book to a reasonably priced mortgage book. So that also has released a substantial amount of liquidity to place in trade assets at much higher spreads, with much lower RWA.</p>
          <p>And you mentioned the other tracks, which is the China connectivity and the SMA connectivity. All &#x2013; I would only add to the last point, which is on the funding franchise, which we are beginning to get some important traction and reducing the cost of our funding by improving our core and structural funding as well. So that has, beginning to have an important impact in our NIM, so I would close with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take questions. George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Piyush, I thought I'd turn your attention to the capital slide, which states that under the Basel III, the risk-weighted assets would &#x2013; this is slide, just with the risk-weighted assets under Basel III, which is 3.5%, so which means the risk-weighted asset or asset ratio goes to 64. Now last quarter or the quarter before, you alluded to the fact that you could probably, under the old risk-weighted assets, you could bring it down from 60% to about 55%. So my question is, are you still aiming for a 55% level? That's one.</p>
          <p>And two is, how are you going to achieve that? Is it simply private CAGR collateral or are there other ways, for example, getting out of some of this OTC your financial institution needs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (25:06). We were at 64%, we came down to 61% through the collateralizing and keeping up this thing. Actually this quarter, we're down to 60%. But look, we had a growth in loans, but arguably still came down, positive. That is a function of two things. One is the sale of BPI, that's 50% of BPI. So that released some weight.</p>
          <p>And the second was we got to do some more tightening up in terms of the collateral and trends of orders and so on. The two principal things, in terms of driving it further, I mean, from here on, a large part of it is the models, the modeling this thing. If you remember, our issue compared to the rest of the world is that we are still on standardized model and foundation models, (25:55) okay.</p>
          <p>To the point I made earlier, the Swiss are at sub 20%, the Europeans and Americans are in the mid-30%s. The Asian banks in general are in the high 50s. We are at 60%. So a large part of it is the models that we have and sometimes this is even compared to our local competitors, who are not using the best and most efficient models to be able to get this thing.</p>
          <p>So, the thing with models though, is it's not low-hanging fruit. You've got to work with the regulators and the regulators have got to get comfortable that their models are correctly capturing this, right. So we're actually ramping up many of the models that we've been working on for the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the regulators right now, they're evaluating the models, they're going to look at that. But it does look as though they're probably going to ask us to do a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:36), so you make sure that nothing's changed. But so, over the next year or so, the models will start having some impact and kicking in, which will allow us to drive this thing down. The other as I said is things like CCPs and so on, but Sok Hui might want to elaborate a bit on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So when you talk about RWA to total assets, so assuming you're only asking whether they will come down, I think we have actually got a team really working on better linkages of collateral or disclosure, as we become sort of more selective across the region, the collaterals in China and Singapore and say we actually don't have a way of pegging it entirely correctly and that's why we have consolidated them in the way that we did the computation today.</p>
          <p>So that process or step process improvement is ongoing. The models where we have between sort of &#x2013; you know the end use is very conservative, so we've actually launched a new model. We try and sort of keep it to the previous capital levels and through that process. So as we get comfortable with the new models, that offer, we would expect to go down.</p>
          <p>So the other thing is this year, ABC and CDA charges kicked in. Actually, very few banks actually on this, not many banks on Basel III. But with those that have seen impact, and we see that actually increase in RWA. So again, the regulators have been fantastic. But I think we continue to talk to them about tagging sort of a lot of our trade loans to ABC charges, because that's actually not really the best way to handle it and how we look at sort of the lower risk rate on the actually expense, that hopefully will complete.</p>
          <p>So while the rules are there, I think there's ongoing dialogue on this front. The CDA charge, which is driven by credit valuations, the CDA charge is really about moving a lot more of the OTC derivatives to central clearing counterparties. Again, the regulations have kicked in ahead of time, because the central clearing sort of globally isn't quite in place itself. So again, regulators are sympathetic to, for example, nonbank customers when they want to actually hedge a transaction, we can't really sort of be able to hold margins.</p>
          <p>So all these things are being looked at and I think there is a lot of discussion. But what you can see is that given the rules where we are today, we're actually in a very comfortable position. So the impact of just applying the new rules is actually a 50-basis-point impact, especially the ABC and CDA charges and 13.5% is actually a very healthy number for core and as the room for deductions kick in for goodwill, by 2019, right, it's going to be 11.8% and that's still well for us. The 9% has described as above the 7% above the macro environment, so our capitalization would be helped.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The other thing, when we &#x2013; while there is some drag on our revenue because of ABC, there's actually also the Basel III also creates an opportunity. One of the things it does, for example, is today, when you look at parental support, there's a limit &#x2013; you can't look at parental support for obligors who are lower than a particular threshold of credit rating. Under the Basel III rules that kick in, I can now accept parental support from people who are under that area, basically. So there are a lot of companies, for exposure, that have exposure to a subsidiary, which today is counted as high-risk. Tomorrow, starting Jan 1, if the &#x2013; I have a guarantee letter coming from the parent who is co-rated at BBB+, I can reduce the risk weighting of that exposure. So it's actually a double concentrate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. One is on capital again. I think it says in the disclosures that the group's existing preferred shares and subordinated debts will be ineligible as capital under Basel III. I just wondered how you're looking at the capital structure going forward? You still have a fair amount, I believe, of such instruments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have no instruments are due for refinancing this year. We have some accounts that are of next year. What we mean by that is for new instruments, we actually have to embed the new language of Basel III into your instruments. So the ones that we have today will start amortizing, because they don't have this language. They amortize at the rate of 10% a year, so it will take time for those ones to sort of disinfect, to completely sort of evolve the Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.</p>
          <p>So in terms of capital, I think you see in the marketplace that not many banks are introduced sort of upon these type of instruments, so we continue to monitor. We see that, actually, the initial concern or rather, the price pressures for this kind of instruments is actually coming down. So I think we will let the market evolve and at some point in time, we'll be issuing new instruments that actually have those characteristics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the first issuance, which the fourth quarter issuance which was done in Europe, right? The premium for new language was all over the place, including a 4.5% people were paying and more for new language.</p>
          <p>The premiums come off and today, the best expectation is the premium for new language issuance is about 30 basis points. So it's actually already come in a lot as people or investors started getting more comfortable with the implication in the new issues. So we're going to watch. We have nothing for another 18 months.</p>
          <p>Until then, we have enough capital so if amortizes 10% next year, it's not going to change my capital adequacy materially. And hopefully, if the premium for new language comes off, then we can start refacing it with new language.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have a couple of housekeeping questions. Can you just update where you are in terms of regional connectivity? How IT perhaps was rolled out and how you're linked across the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, sorry &#x2013; I think our regional connectors are very different from IT, but let me talk about the IT thing, right? So the IT platform, we have now substantially done most of our IT infrastructure by 1%, which I'll come back to. So we've got a common cash management platform and we've got a common trade management platform and we've got a common wealth management platform. We've got a common core banking platform across this thing. So we just got a whole range of consistent common platform that we get residency 100% standby backup orders. This is on a robust shop across the system. The biggest thing that we're still working on is the core banking replacement in Hong Kong and Singapore. So that's a big ticket thing.</p>
          <p>Last year, we took one big bite of this and look what happened. So we moved the majority, so 60%, 70% of the Singapore asset book, we moved into the new core banking network. This year, we've moved the rest of the Singapore asset book onto the core banking platform. And then, that will leave us the liability side of the balance sheet to address and move into the core banking platform.</p>
          <p>But as indicated earlier, we're going to do the Singapore in places. It's too big and too risky to do in one big, big bank. But the fact that I got two-thirds of the asset side done last year is a huge thing. So that's therefore &#x2013; we're starting Hong Kong this year as well. So we will do Phase 1 of the Hong Kong implementation this year, which should be around the customer listing and some of our cash management and liability applications. So a different slice, but same thing, Hong Kong over the next couple of years. We will move Hong Kong into this same as Singapore. So that is basically cover and complete our whole technology component of this thing.</p>
          <p>We rolled out an important application this year on the Internet and mobile side. So, it is key for cash management. We rolled that out small amounts. In fact, we already have onboard 65,000 customers on that IDC application around the region, including most of us.</p>
          <p>So, we're now bringing together a lot more traction on the cash management side, because that cash management is back to controlled. And also on the consumer side, actually our e-banking and mobile banking, we started rolling out of &#x2013; outside Singapore. So Singapore, as you know, we now have 1.9 million customers on Internet banking. We have about 600,000 on mobile banking.</p>
          <p>But we have to get that launched in Hong Kong and that's part of this Hong Kong year, so they're doing that. We also launched the consumer Internet banking in all the other countries. Mobile banking, we haven't launched yet in the market outside. But we'll get to that in this year, in 2013.</p>
          <p>But for me, the connectivity question, there's a little bit more than just a technology connection. It is really this whole thing of do we manage additional relationships and customers across this thing. We actually made huge progress around that, so being able to manage both the global banks in terms of the long-term or global relationship with regional relationships and counting the same, introduce a metric internally we measure core products for franchise value.</p>
          <p>And today, the franchise growth, for example, of our China business is just exponential year-on-year. It's re-outstripping the growth of our China customers in China i.e. what we'll be able to do for them outside that's logical, right? We can do a lot more for the Chinese companies in Singapore and Hong Kong and Indonesia. So we're tracking and measuring that four-quarter franchise thing and the growth of that is just very, very strong, very interesting. So this connectivity from that regard, which is what I really focus on more, is getting on really nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Final housekeeping from me, just because I apologize, I missed it on the media call. But you were giving some degree of how the property measures have affected resale versus new sale? Can you just go &#x2013; apologies, I missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and this is not early data. We're just commenting on the basis of three weeks' data, or four weeks' data. But the bookings in January, we book about $1 billion a month. The bookings in January were about $1 billion, so they didn't fall off. But a large part of that was because they were houses that were contracted option to purchase those pre-Jan 2012. So that's pipeline is considered full. In fact, a lot of people hurried up their actual bookings because they didn't want to get caught.</p>
          <p>But if you exclude that and you look at the ongoing thing, our bookings are still tracking. The nature of bookings has changed substantially in the last three, four weeks that the resale has come off by about 25%, 30%. But the building under construction has gone up by 25%, 30%. And therefore, my total is the same and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:18) has come off. So, but my total is about the same, it maybe 5%, 7% down for this period, but it's not material.</p>
          <p>However, in terms of what shows up on my books, it will be different, because resales shows up in my books right away, because I fund the wholly-owned. The building and the construction, you fund only over two or three years, right? So the reversement actually happens over a longer period of time. So even though the bookings have been flat, I think the actual divestment will be lower. So I anticipate that the total growth in the mortgage book will be down by a couple of billion if this trend continues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Michael. A couple of questions, Piyush. What's the round up on the asset side. Is it only on the asset side you are going on the short end or are you going on the long end on the liability side as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of us understand too much liabilities, people waiting for CASA, so you don't get this thing and at least we don't compete in it, what we said, right. And therefore, Hong Kong the customer bids because it's cheaper account. Singapore is almost complete in their piece. So we really don't have a lot of tenure in our customer deposit side. It's really CASA-based money. On the wholesale funding, as I said, we have about SGD 5-odd billion in the commercial paper program, which is max nine months, so it tends to be short-term. We have a medium-term program that goes out five years. We have some that goes out five years. So there is some tenure built into our wholesale funding, but we haven't changed that over the last couple of quarters. It's been pretty good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Even better, we're just conservative. I don't want to be caught with these big tails or whatever. And then for me, I have an natural gapping, right. I say short-tenure liabilities, that's the nature of DBS. You get SGD 100 billion of short-tenure liabilities and then you can pay the U-CO. That's what gives us the leverage as a bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what is the max duration now for the bank?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (39:22) in the last two years and there. Depends if you are betting on the rates steepening. It could be a couple of quarters early, but that's the best.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>So it could have reduced, right, our duration. Remember, when we earlier have reached out duration because of taking on long-tenure assets, so that we could play this thing. Now, that I expect the steepener, the duration in the bond book has definitely come down. So my net average duration would have come off. I don't know the number off the top. I can probably get Philip, is he on? Sok Hui, can you get &#x2013; do you have the duration?</p>

          <p>It went up by about three percentage points over this, so the total SDR 200 million increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should consider whether we can start disclosing that so people can look at this thing and let's talk about it. Maybe we can actually start giving something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolute final question. The product competition, you are not worried about things that are going, you'd be happy to let it to go. But I can assume that you stomp your local competitors, having way more than what we see this time of the year on deposit competition. Is that something which is trade which could become a trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you think about this, right, why would people be competing for deposits in a flush liquid market with loan pricing coming down? It's not logical. So the only thing I find is Basel III. So the only reason people will pay up high cost deposit and the thing where loan pricing is tight, where liquidity is flush with a lot of money flowing into the system, it's because people are trying to manage their balance sheets to achieve Basel III LTR requirement. That's the only explanation. I don't have a problem, so I don't need to compete, right. My liquidity's okay, but that's the only thing that explains why people would start paying up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could it be a market share issue as well, as an LTR of Chinese banks and Samsung getting locally incorporated. They can significantly compete for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're talking about local competitors...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not only local, but in the market, now you have like three guys who could grab you, but not as significant</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But really, look at the share of the deposits in Singapore, for example. It's not cost effective right. So all of these guys, you can make whatever, what do they have, right. So they can accept SGD 200 million <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:16). So to me the big picture of the thing, it can only get explained. Why would you pay 3% for deposit if you're giving the loan out at 2.5%, unless you have those liquidity ratios to achieve, right. So which is why I said, my belief, we'll see what happens, is that the Basel III switch of the LTR, if my reasoning is right, that should take the edge off people's needs, because everybody can meet the 60% ratio, right, so you don't have to wind up paying high-cost deposits when you don't need the money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on capital ratio as such. The Basel III implementation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:56).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (45:02) So all this stuff about lowering the risk-weighted ratio, I thought, well, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:23) Could we see anything in the next two, three years or is it a very medium-term thing and something that should not be expected over the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason that we have some more capital support in respect of Basel, our Asian regulators have much higher hurdles than anywhere in the world. So, there's no accident over capital laying around, right. So we have some.</p>
          <p>December, from our standpoint, I'm still putting capital into the three countries that we're trying to grow. It was just China, India and Indonesia. And therefore in the short term, I'm really seeing the  opportunities for us to grow in these countries despite this thing. And therefore we still expect to have to put capital into these markets before they start delivering and returning capital.</p>
          <p>And particularly if the transaction goes through, I anticipate we are going to have to continue to support it with some capital over the next, first couple of years. So the capital cushion we have is only in the context of organic growth, that if you need to do it, I don't want to constrain our ability to grow in these markets on the back of that. But as we see, if we feel that we get later efficiency and we don't need this thing, then over the couple of year period, we can start getting more capital.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:50) targets on an ongoing strategic basis, not assuming acquisitions or you're not adding growth. What are the sort of capital levels needed things like beyond that? Is that total sufficient?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the ABS requirement for core Tier 1 is 9%. The requirement in general, if we talk to this thing around the word from an investor community, I think nobody's happy with a Core Tier 1 of anything less than 10%. So in that 10%, 10.5% range is an acceptable core Tier 1 requirement model.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just have two follow-on questions. Just first to your point of detail. I couldn't &#x2013; GTS revenues in Q4, were they &#x2013; I couldn't find them in the pack. Did you disclose them at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long ago, they were done. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We normally disclose GTS revenue, did we do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This quarter, we consolidated into the annual, so you can back it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's in the annual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, GTS revenues were down for the fourth quarter. And they were down basically for the same period. GTS in the third and fourth quarter down because of trade finance and the same margins. Volumes are up, all other things are up. Actually, the biggest margin impact we've had is the trade finance book in China, Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a second question is just trying to unpick what's going on in the rest of Greater China division, because that net interest income has come down an awful lot in 12 months, and particularly almost the whole book classified as trade finance have given as halved that net interest income. Can you just give us a bit more color as to exactly what is going on in that sort of Greater China ex-Hong Kong market, what we can expect going forward in terms of net interest income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it goes back to &#x2013; I actually explained this a couple of times. We view this as a big opportunity, the PROC tightening in the second half of 2010. What that resulted in is it left only one avenue for Chinese companies to borrow. And that was to use trade finance and borrow through the trade finance route out of Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
          <p>And that created a huge opportunity for us to use the trade finance window to get into Chinese companies that it would normally take us a long time to get into. So we actually added more than 200 customers, 250 customers, principally based on being able to do trade finance with them out of Hong Kong and China and Singapore. That's really the other thing, which is why we put on a whole growth in trade finance of SGD 40 billion, SGD 50 billion came from growing largely that proportion of business and that book.</p>
          <p>That was that, obviously, this whole transaction and the short-term benefit, this was very good margin business. It was good margin business, because the cost of funds in China was so high, that companies were willing to pay 2%, 3% in Hong Kong and Singapore to borrow. As the USA loosens monetary policy and pushed more liquidity into the system, a lot of these companies can go back and borrow onshore. So they don't need to continue borrowing offshore.</p>
          <p>So our big challenge and this is the point where you are taking is that as companies start going back to business as usual, they will stay sticky with us and we will continue to be able to do business with them, not only trade finance business, but a variety of businesses. That's actually been the case. So as companies have gone back and done onshore, et cetera, the companies who bank with us will retain their market share and our position with these companies.</p>
          <p>So by and large, we've been able to hold our trade for this share, which to me, is quite dramatic. Remember, we grew, say, 40%, 50% in 2011. In 2012, our trade has pretty much held up and on a full year basis, we actually grew the trade book. That means we were able to replace all of these rolling-up loans, but continue to retain the relationship with the companies as the loans go lost.</p>
          <p>But the prices come off, because the price has gone back to onshore kind of pricing. So they're still charging &#x2013; I was charging basically 1% to 3%, because cash back at 1%, even 2%, so they're basically getting a loss of 2%, 2.5% spread than those financing it offshore. As it moves back into the onshore thing, I have to start pricing at what the normal trade finance will get there. So the whole incremental growth in China whole trade finance has all priced downwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just follow up on that, on the Chinese business, it's profitable, but is the current trading profitable. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:13) I guess my perception was that 2011 was a good year. It was a good year for growth, but for the profitability, that's probably the benchmark that a lot of you have. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:22). So, the growth has been in China, but is the profitability growth sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But here is the thing. You think about it differently. For me, the way I thought about this is that 2011 was an opportunistic profitable year, because you don't get to make 3% on it. The volatile ones we view as strategically opportunistic. It's opportunistic, we can go in and make a lot of money with trade finance. It's strategic, because we're not doing it with every Tom, Dick and Harry. So we're using it as a way to get into the companies that we want to build a long-term relationship with.</p>
          <p>But recognizing that the margin we're making with that is not going to last, it's an opportunistic thing to make that margin. So the profitability thing in China, which we had last year, was unusually because we had the extra margins in this. The normal profitability will be much lower than the existing. But our China business returns at this point will be mixed into this year's return.</p>
          <p>But that said, so you've got to invest in China. This goes back to your question on capital. So we have a view on China, on India and Indonesia with sales orders you get to keep and you get it done. But it took us a couple of years to, on an ongoing basis, get that done, which allow us to be capital accretive.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Assume cost-to-income ratio. So, remember, we've been investing in this branch footprint and as you put the branches in, the branches take two years, three years to pay back. So if I don't put in branches, I can get the returns. If I put in the branches, so what I pace, so I've been pacing my branches at seven, eight branches a year, not hell of a lot more. In fact, this year, we're not going to grow branches, because we already want to drive performance up in the current regions. So we decided we would take stock at about 30 branches and drive performance out of the 30 branches and stop investing more for a year and then we'll start again. So it's really just a branching issue. If you put branches, payback is 2.5 years. You cannot get this thing. If you stop putting branches, your returns start moving up.</p>
