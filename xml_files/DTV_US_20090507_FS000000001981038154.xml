          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tom and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator and thanks, to everyone for joining us for our first quarter 2009 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Chase Carey, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel. In a moment I'll hand the call over to Chase and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements of within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV Group's and DIRECTV US's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures. These are available on our website and attached to our earnings release and posted at www.DIRECTV.com. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Chase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John and good morning, everybody. The highlights from the first quarter are clearly the multiyear highs in gross and net subscriber growth and the low in churn. These results were largely driven by the competitive strength of DIRECTV. There were also a few factors that enhanced the results, You could say first our AT&amp;T arrangement got off to a solid start in February. Second the digital transition had a bit more of a positive impact than we expected. It is tough to estimate the actual incremental subs, but we believe it was a plus. And finally, the sub and churn results were helped by reasonably aggressive offers in place both to attract new customers and retain existing ones. Importantly we achieved this growth while we continue to strengthen credit controls and terms to protect us from higher risk customers.</p>
          <p>In addition, it's worth noting that the first quarter was the first one where the percent of new customers taking advanced products, HD or DVR, ticked above 60%.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was also one in which we did a good job managing our largest costs. SAC, upgrade spending and programming costs all came in at or below our targets. Our expansion of HD locals added expected costs to our broadcast operations, while G&amp;A would have been on target but for some timing issues and a couple of modest one-time legal expenses. Overall we feel good about all these costs.</p>
          <p>The one cost that is not where it should be Is service, which although we made improvements, is still a work in progress. We've made quality the first priority ahead of costs in the service area. Quality has improved and we expect cost improvement to follow later in the year.</p>
          <p>One metric where we've struggled in the first quarter was ARPU. There were four issues that caused the ARPU shortfall. First, our use of offers for new customers and credits to existing ones was significantly greater than a year ago. In hindsight, we overestimated the impact of the economy a bit and were more aggressive than we needed to be. These offers did directly contribute to our 460,000 sub adds, so this investment clearly generated a solid return; however, our goal is to pursue a better balance between top and bottom line growth. I'll also remind you as we noted on the last call that Q1 would be our most difficult quarter for year on year; ARPU comparisons and the impact will be much more modest going forward.</p>
          <p>Second factor impacting ARPU was a drop in penetration of premium channels like HBO, Showtime and Starz. Clearly, the broader economic woes led some customers to cut back on these services but we also did not do a good enough job to mitigate this pressure. We made some changes in mid-management of this area and established new initiatives to improve execution here. It is also important to note, that while we look to maximize the value of these services, they are also some of our lowest margin channels, so a drop in ARPU may be matched with a disproportionally large drop in ACPU or cost per unit. At the end of the day, we're ultimately focused on bottom line profit per unit, not top-line results that do not drop to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Pay-per-view was the third area to decline. This was partially due to the timing of events, partially due to the economy, and somewhat attributable to competition from other mediums in areas like adult.</p>
          <p>Fourth and finally, the final area to contribute materially to the drop in ARPU was ad sales and this drop really was truly due to the economy. The other key areas of ARPU like our base packages, advanced products and others were all in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Our bottom line operating profit and cash flow were significantly impacted by our subscriber growth first and foremost. The year-on-year comparisons were exacerbated by trends in SAC and upgrade costs being expensed instead of capitalized. Quite simply, if our sub growth had been more in line with expectations, then we would have been up year on year in both profits and cash. Instead, we invested in our business and ended up taking advantage of an opportunity to add a unique number of valuable subscribers.</p>
          <p>We generated 460,000 subs and those subscribers are a great investment for DIRECTV and will add to our long-term value, even if they come at a short-term cost. While we will pursue a bit more balanced approach going forward, growth is still a short-term priority, and given our financial strength we can think of no better place to invest our capital than in new subscribers.</p>
          <p>Turning quickly to Latin America, the first quarter was a really solid one on almost every level, if you exclude currency issues. Almost all our metrics from sub growth to SAC to ARPU were at or above expectations if you exclude currency impact. Churn was higher than expected, but again, the largest reason was the growth of our prepaid business, where churn is really not a viable measure of success. Equally, our top and bottom line results beat expectations if you exclude currency factors.</p>
          <p>Currency issues were the problem in Q1, and it hit us in two ways. First, currency devaluation adversely affected most of our results. Second, we incurred a $72 million charge to G&amp;A and currency related charges when we repatriated a large cash balance that had accumulated in Venezuela. We remain bullish about the competitive position of our Latin business, and its prospects going forward.</p>
          <p>Overall, our goal in managing DIRECTV is to build value for our shareholders. We try to provide an appropriate level of visibility to our plans and expectations, but our competitive environment is one of change and opportunity. In making decisions, our priority has been and will continue to be maximizing the value of those opportunities.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Pat.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chase. I'd like to start with a clear highlight in the quarter. Net additions were up 67% to a four-year high of 460,000 subscribers, driven by a 22% increase in gross adds and a 10-year low monthly churn rate. Looking first at gross subscribers, the nearly 1.2 million additions represented the largest number since Q3 of 2004. Several factors contributed to these strong results. First, our brand identity remains extremely strong, and we continued to promote a very competitive offer in the first quarter. As a result, every sales channels had higher gross adds than a year ago with particularly strong results from our direct sales and telco channels.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from the launch of our partnership with AT&amp;T at the beginning of February. Although we do not disclose specific telco numbers, about 20% of our total gross additions came through the telco channels. This is roughly comparable to the level from a year ago, but the percentage dropped to the low teens after losing BellSouth in Q2.</p>
          <p>Our Latino service, DIRECTV M&#xE1;s, is also gaining momentum and contributing to our top-line growth. And similar to our competitors' comments, we benefited from the digital transition process, although as Chase said, it's very difficult to quantify the actual number. Importantly, the overall credit quality of the new subscribers remained about the same high levels seen in recent quarters, as did the advanced product take rate of about 60%.</p>
          <p>Turning to churn, the 1.33% in the quarter was 3 basis points lower than the prior year. And we've talked about in recent quarters our high quality subscriber base combined with increased penetration of HD and DVR services continues to drive down churn. Specifically, tighter credit screening policies, longer commitment periods, and an improved fraud management have all had favorable impacts on both involuntarily and first year churn. We've also seen significant improvements in our DIRECTV M&#xE1;s and telco churn.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, ARPU growth of 0.8% fell short of our expectations in the quarter. And this was primarily due to more credits given to existing customers, lower premium, pay-per-view and advertising revenues, as well as the overachievement in gross adds. Although we've talked about all these trends on recent calls, I would like to add a bit more color for each.</p>
          <p>Regarding offers for existing customers, most of the year-over-year increases related to hardware credits to customers upgrading to HD or DVR services. You may recall that we implemented a loyalty program in the third quarter of last year to reward our best customers, those who have been with us for more than three years, with the best offers. And despite the slowing economy, more customers upgraded in Q1 than we had anticipated. Upgrading our customers is important from both a financial and churn management perspective. However, we will manage these costs more stringently going forward, particularly in light of our ARPU shortfall.</p>
          <p>The other revenue misses were in areas more related to the economy or timing. Premium and ad sales have been weak for the past few quarters, but we saw greater declines than expected in Q1. Pay-per-view was also lower than expected, due to weakness in adult movies and events.</p>
          <p>Additional pressure on ARPU came from the overachievement in gross additions, because we were adding more subscribers at the lower promotional price points. Needless to say, ARPU is an area that we are extremely focused on. On the bright side, we believe that Q1 ARPU growth represents the low mark of the year, and we expect that full year 2009 will be the trough year in terms of ARPU growth. Chase will have a few comments later on the ARPU outlook.</p>
          <p>Looking now at our profitability, overall I thought we did a pretty good job managing costs in the quarter, particularly in the areas of programming, cash SAC and upgrade and retention.</p>
          <p>However, OPBDA margin was about 23% down &#x2013; of 23% was about 3 percentage points down from last year. About two thirds of this decline was related to the higher acquisition costs resulting mostly from the increase in gross additions.</p>
          <p>We were pleased that our cash SAC of $708 was lower than both the prior year and prior quarter. Equipment costs in SAC were relatively flat even though we had a record number of new subs taking advanced services in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We were also seeing a richer mix toward the more expensive and higher revenue generating advanced boxes. For example, the percentage of new subs taking the HD DVR box more than doubled from a year ago. In addition, we're gaining efficiencies in our sales and marketing efforts as both our average and incremental marketing costs to acquire subscribers were lower than last year and last quarter.</p>
          <p>The remaining decline in margin came mostly out of G&amp;A and subscriber services. G&amp;A costs were higher than a year ago mainly due to timing and a few one-time items. We are still targeting for our G&amp;A cost in 2009 to increase at a slower rate than our revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Subscriber services were a bit higher than the prior year mostly because our average call handle times are running a little longer than planned. As you have heard us say in recent quarters, improving service levels is one of our top priorities. As such we're spending a little more than planned to ensure that we provide our customers with the level of service they deserve. We view this as a short-term trend, because we still believe that over the long-term, a higher quality experience drives lower cost.</p>
          <p>To maintain or improve our pre-SAC margin we must continue to find cost savings to offset the slower revenue growth. One good example of this came in programming, where we saw a significantly lower increase in programming costs. Some of this improvement was associated with the lower revenue growth in areas, such as premiums and pay-per-view, but we also captured cost savings by negotiating better terms on many of our contracts. Our goal is to continue managing our programming costs so that we can hold our programming margin relatively flat in 2009, compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow before interest and taxes of 558 million filed the OPBDA trends and was down mostly down due to SAC associated with a 22% increase in gross additions. Excluding the acquisition costs for the higher gross adds, cash flow was up about 15% over last year. To state the obvious, we believe that in aggregate, these new subscribers are highly accretive and will significantly increase cash flow over the long-term.</p>
          <p>I would like to now spend a few minutes providing some additional color on DIRECTV Latin America. Starting with subscribers, DLA had a very soldier quarter with higher gross adds than a year ago despite some economic and competitive challenges. The higher gross additions and churn came mostly out of Brazil, where we recently lost a very popular prepaid service. As a reminder, the financial returns and payback for a prepaid subscriber are significantly better than for post-paid subscribers because the higher churn is more than offset by a net SAC of less than $100, plus other cost savings in bad debt, billing and customer service.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenue, as you saw in the press release, DLA's revenues were up about 10% despite the fact that Sky Brazil's ARPU was down 16%, compared to last year. In local currency, Sky Brazil's ARPU was actually up roughly 13%, but we saw about a 26% decline in the real, compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>At the consolidated DLA level, the weak Brazilian currency was more than offset by a 30% increase in revenues at PanAmericana, due to strong subscriber and ARPU growth. The higher revenues combined with strong cost management drove significant OPBDA and cash flow growth in the quarter when excluding a 72 million charge in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>This charge is related to our ongoing effort to repatriate cash from Venezuela, where we are exchanging bolivares for US dollars at a parallel exchange rate that has recently traded between 4 and 6 bolivares to the dollar, compared to the country's official exchange rate of only 2.15 bolivares to the dollar. Excluding these fees, DLA's OPBDA and free cash flow increased 38% and 66%, respectively in the quarter, compared to last year.</p>
          <p>For the balance of the year, we intend to continue repatriating excess cash from Venezuela at the parallel rates. Assuming there's enough liquidity in the parallel market every quarter to accomplish that, we would report quarterly losses of about $20 million per quarter.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I thought we had a solid quarter, further demonstrating the strength of DIRECTV's brand and competitive advantages. Due to the timing of our ARPU growth and expenses, our 2009 plan always anticipated greater OPBDA and cash flows in the second half of the year, and our Q1 results are consistent with this outlook. There's no question that we've room for improvement in areas of ARPU and cost management. However, I believe it is much easier to address these when dealing from a position of strength. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. Looking forward, we feel very good about the momentum of our business. Our brand and content leadership is stronger than ever. With SUNDAY TICKET renewed through 2014, we've solidified our long-term position as the leader in sports. Events like the Friday Night Lights renewal will continue to add unique event content to our experience. Enhancements like the DVR scheduler app on the iPhone and our new score guide are examples of new features that will continue to excite our customers. With a new satellite being launched in the second half of '09 and the largest library of 1080p movies in the industry, we continue to strengthen our HD leadership. A lot of our focus over the next few quarters will be on execution and efficiency. We need to continue to maximize opportunities like our AT&amp;T partnership while making sure we execute in attacking costs from programming to sales to service to G&amp;A. We need to do a better job in mitigating the challenges in areas like premium channels and find the right balance between top and bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial outlook for 2009, obviously some of our expectations have changed based on our first quarter results. The broader economic challenges continue to make it difficult to project the future and the economy has had some impact when we look at areas like credits, premium channels or ad sales. Nonetheless, we believe we can continue to grow our business in a healthy basis amidst these challenges.</p>
          <p>First, 2009 subscriber growth, which we previously expected to be around the 2008 level at the mid-800,000s, will now be significantly higher. We expect upside in our sub growth for the rest of 2009, but not like the upside we saw in Q1. We've already taken steps like reducing the discount new customer offers and further toughening up other terms for new customers that will reduce sub growth. Nonetheless, we expect 2009 net subscriber growth to exceed 1 million subscribers. Full year churn is expected to be around the 1.5% we previously discussed.</p>
          <p>As Pat said, ARPU growth will improve in Q2 over Q1, and second half ARPU will exceed the first half. However, we would now expect full year ARPU to be in the 2 to 3% range versus the 4% plus we previously expected. Overall, we feel the fundamental driving forces in ARPU are largely unchanged and still look to a 4% plus ARPU growth as we go beyond 2009.</p>
          <p>Most of our costs are in line with previous expectations and we still expect pre-SAC margin improvement. Our higher sub growth will reduce our OPBDA and cash flow growth a bit, but we believe we remain on track to generate $3 billion in cash flow before taxes and interest.</p>
          <p>Finally, a comment on our buybacks. As of the end of the day, yesterday, we've bought about 20.2 million shares for 4 &#x2013; about $438 million under the buyback we announced earlier this year. We will be allowed to continue to buy a limited number of shares daily between now and when we mail our proxy and the Liberty agreement. We are also allowed to do a tender offer during this period. Once we mail the proxy, we will not be allowed to buy shares until our shareholder vote. We are then again allowed to buy shares until after the &#x2013; after the vote until we close the Liberty deal.</p>
          <p>For the one-year period following the close, we're allowed to buy shares, but it is unclear how a purchase would impact our tax structure, so we're planning to get clarification from the IRS. Until we receive this clarification, it is not clear we'll be able to buy back shares in this period.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Jon.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. I guess good morning to you. Wanted to ask about subscriber trends and ARPU as you have moved into the second quarter. I realize we're getting sort of, from a timing perspective, getting now into weekly pacings. You have made some changes I think to your offers in the marketplace. I think you sound like you have intentionally dialed back some of the subscriber growth. Any sense after a month of the quarter where you think ARPU may shake out in 2Q, maybe gross adds, trends, I don't know if you wanted to comment on that front as well? And then, I wanted to ask Pat, if you strip the ad sales declines out of the first quarter, maybe give us a sense of what may be true video ARPU was, how material that might have been as a piece of the pie. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess really not going to get too granular on sort of second quarter numbers, so I'll probably comment more sort of directionally. We did in March reduce the discount &#x2013; our offer to open up some other terms and increase the canceling period.</p>
          <p>And I had to continue to do it. And I think as I said, we are by design, you are right probably, while we still need the growth opportunity, I think opportunity to take share, I think we do want a bit more balance. And we'll look to that. I think we still look for subscriber growth going forward, to be positive. But again, not like it was in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And the first quarter from our perspective, at first, the first quarter was always our toughest quarter and it got better as you went through the second and the second half and that certainly is still true. And clearly, to the degree we've made some moves that, particularly on, I guess, the two &#x2013; the two areas that I think we control more directly is sort of the credits and offers which we've tightened up a bit on. And probably a bit more focused on the premium sales. That will take a little time to get some traction, because you don't, it doesn't kick in right away.</p>
          <p>But I think those things will help on ARPU, but I think ARPU always had a trend to it that was weighted towards the back end. Again, you go back to what we had said early on, I think said last call, that really was the second quarter of '08 that we increased due to competitive and economic issues our offers and credits and therefore, you sort of had this cum that as you went through and as you went through the year into the first quarter and you look at the &#x2013; obviously credits and offers are a hit on ARPU. And if you look at the difference between first quarter '08 and first quarter '09, it's at a high point. If you look at the difference between fourth quarter '08 and first quarter '09, it's a tiny, small fraction of what it was on a full &#x2013; on a year-to-year basis. So, I think you, you certainly can see as those, as you sort of get through that period of those credits, particularly 12 month credits building as you went through second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, hitting a point of stability which will benefit ARPU as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and then, on the ad sales, kind of the year-over-year our ad sales were down about 10 million. Which again last year it was in the first quarter, it was growing year-over-year, and so now we've had a decline. So, you kind of get a little bit after doubling up of effect on ARPU in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just ask one follow-up Chase on the tender point you made earlier, are there any limitations to the size of that beyond obviously your balance sheet, and sort of financial flexibility, any legal constraints and any comments on timing as to when you guys might make a decision as to whether you'd put a tender in place? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no limitations on size and probably wouldn't comment on the timing; it's not that big a window. We probably mail I guess, probably &#x2013; mailing the proxy, I don't know, July or August, something like that, so it is not that big a window to start.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Actually wanted to follow up on that last question. I guess the &#x2013;  how much would you be willing to lever up? You have given different numbers in the past. And is there anything that can be done from Liberty's end to facilitate a share repurchase after the close of the merger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; on the lever up question again as I probably said earlier in the week, the credit markets have obviously been pretty choppy. To try to make judgments about where and what level of leverage was appropriate, feasible and the like. We've obviously been in the middle of a transaction that impacts has an impact on our future. So, clearly with the Liberty transaction behind us, I think we'll make judgments. We've to make, judgments and deal with the debt we're assuming as part of that which obviously we're comfortable with, and other dynamics, try and go out and look at the credit market, look at the realities of what we're able to do in the market around the legal structures that exist, and with the Board, make those judgments. But I think it's &#x2013; there are an array of things we've to factor in and again, try and make some judgments on. But I wouldn't say today we would have a target leverage that we could put out there in light of today's credit markets versus what would have been, I think a level of leverage we would have said a year and a half ago before the economy changed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in all honesty, we don't really have a great handle. I mean, we &#x2013;  we believe it was a positive. It's really tough to track this. We can look at we do sort of every month look at where are our subscribers coming from and &#x2013; and it's not up &#x2013; it's never the same, month in, month out. There was currently a bit more from over the air, which you'd end up saying &#x2013; looked at it from a lot of directions. Our gut is you we clearly &#x2013; we got, as I said, a bit more benefit from the digital transition than we expected. I don't think it was a defining event for the quarter, but I think it was a positive for the quarter.</p>
          <p>You really don't have visibility to the geography of where they are from. I don't think anybody has had; I think it is one of the struggles of this whole transition is it has been tough for all parties to really have the visibility and clarity on where these customers are. And I'm not sure I would say we've a great feel for what happens in July as it winds down. I think we were a little positively surprised to date. Whether that continues, I wouldn't bank on it just because I don't have enough visibility to really rely on it. We'll be opportunistic and that's what we said we were going to be. And we clearly are trying to take advantage of it to the degree there's something there. And I think by being focused on it and making sure we could prudently take advantage of it, we got a benefit. And If that opportunity is there in July we'll, as it sort of winds down, or whatever the end date is, whether it's June or &#x2013; I think it's July &#x2013; we'll try to do so again.</p>
          <p>But I &#x2013; we don't have that, we don't really have the visibility to it.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has a &#x2013; I don't think it is going to be a big variance as a percent first to second. I mean, first, I think we had a lot of pent up energy packed into the launch, and so I think we launched &#x2013; we launched really well, I mean, to our credit. I think AT&amp;T &#x2013; I'm not sure I have the right quote, said it was the best product launch they'd ever had. So, I think we actually found we really sort of sprinted out of the box. I think our focus is really to continue to improve this for the year. I think it is a great relationship. We feel very good about it, continuing to build it. But I would not say AT&amp;T will be a defining difference between second quarter and first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just want to drill down on programming cost increase based on the numbers I see. It looks like 2% per sub, and I think your guidance was 5 to 6% for the year. Just want to compare that to cable guys are talking about double-digits on that metric. Can you help us understand why such a big differential between big players in the same business? And second, do you think that 5 to 6% is still reasonable or are we going to be below that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we feel good about programming costs. I mean, there are differences. I mean, take an example, there are &#x2013; at least a couple of our large competitors launched the Fox News Channel that had a significant increase I think in the first quarter.  we had &#x2013; our deal had come up with the Fox News Channel a year or so ago, so we didn't have an increase. We didn't have a change on Fox News in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I think there are various &#x2013; I can't speak to others, but as I said, in the premiums, to the degree some of the premium services we've are our highest cost per unit product, and so to the degree we got hurt on ARPU by having fewer premium subs than we planned, we got benefited disproportionally on ACPU on the services that had a disproportionally high cost. So, I think some of it's the timing of where these things flow. And again, not all deals, not all channels come up at the same time, in the same place. And different companies get different players, I assume. I don't have visibility of their numbers &#x2013; get impacted different ways.</p>

But overall I think we do feel comfortable that &#x2013; Chase &#x2013; that the kind of the things that are pushing programming down that our ACPU growth this year will probably be below 5% that we mentioned before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi. At the end of March you ended a promotion where consumers were getting about a $20 discount. When do many of these subscribers start coming off the promotions and can you talk about what you are doing to mitigate churn as consumers come off these packages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the promotion, most of the new customer offers are 12 months. And again, so, if you look at what I've been saying, we probably stepped up the offers back in the second quarter of '08, which is &#x2013; as you went through in the second quarter of '08 you had one quarter and the third quarter you had two quarters coming up, and by the time you get to this quarter, you've got sort of more really &#x2013; a running rate that goes forward, and the end of March we actually scaled it back a bit.</p>
          <p>But they are generally, they are generally 12 months. Certainly one of the things we do is have a commitment that extends past it so we can get people through. Right now our commitment is 24 months. So, you come out it &#x2013; you're still under a commitment as you come out of the offer and we probably get people in plays on the, sort of more list retail basis.</p>
          <p>And then from there, we've an array of initiatives. Pat touched on the loyalty program. We launched and I think obviously at the core what we want to keep customers to mitigate churn is have a great service with great programming, and if people really love, feel, and love DIRECTV. We've launched the loyalty program to give some benefits that make them really feel like we care about them, and then, clearly we've money we use selectively to try to save customers, and I guess talked about sort of the cost and credits, which is the costs we're talking on ARPU credits and offers is really two pronged. Part of it's offers to new customers. Part it's credits to existing ones. So, for the right customer offering a some sort of deal to keep them if we make that judgment. And obviously, we don't treat all customers the same. So, a uniquely valuable long-term customer that we feel it's the right thing to go an extra mile to keep them happy, and it can be one time. Sometimes it can end up being sort of foregoing hardware revenue upfront, and sometimes it can be something more in a three or six-month timeframe.</p>
          <p>But the existing one has probably more variability to it between one-time and monthly. A fair bit of it's one-time, and probably the biggest chunk of that being things like hardware revenue, where somebody wants to upgrade, obviously something that we're getting a benefit if somebody is upgrading to HD and DVR, and so trying to incent that and make somebody feel like they got a great deal to stay on it. I think the fighting churn as they come out it is putting terms in place, delivering a great service, and then, using tools targeted tools selectively towards the right customers to try and keep them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other thing, Jeff, is that promotional offers have increased over time. We've built in some technology into our systems, so now an agent when they get an inbound call from somebody that's approaching the end of their promotional period or has just ended it, she gets a that agent will get a flag that lets her know that this maybe somebody that's calling about the sensitivity of price.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Charter bankruptcy, I would not have said  was a material change. I mean we've certainly targeted some of the Charter markets for a while, so that gave us a new dimension to it but I wouldn't have said, it's not all of a sudden &#x2013; it's not like Charter all of a sudden jumped on the radar screen. I wouldn't have said that was &#x2013; we're going to be opportunistic about it but I wouldn't again said it was a major change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The economy, yes, I guess I would end up saying, probably &#x2013; I mean, but certainly clearly, I wouldn't say we've great visibility to it. I don't think we feel it is getting worse right now. I wouldn't say it is getting better. But I &#x2013; so if that's bottoming. Again, I think we feel okay, as I think I said. You could even end up saying we marginally overcompensated a little bit. And I think in hindsight I'm not that sorry about saying we wanted to make sure we were prepared, and in place in case customers were more sensitive than we thought they'd be.</p>
          <p>But I guess generally, the honest answer is we don't really know. I think if I was trying to say a feel for it, I would say it feels relatively stable. You look at something like ad sales, it is not getting worse, it's not getting better. It's probably about what it's been, which is probably certainly a window onto one aspect of what we deal with. But from a customer perspective, I wouldn't say &#x2013; we certainly still have customers with price sensitivities, which leads to the premium thing, or still a bit more shopping for deals. But I wouldn't say that's a sort of meaningfully escalating, or changing in one direction or the other at this point in a meaningful way.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Chase, sort of strange question, but do you have any explanation as to why the credit agencies don't have you as an investment grade company today, even knowing you might lever up to 2 to 2.5 times to do a tender offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the reality is probably &#x2013;  we've had a lot of, we've sort of been in a state of flux for an array of reasons, and I think it is probably more up to us to define those parameters and where we want to be in &#x2013; with the credit market in place, where clearly you have a different credit market than you did before.</p>
          <p>And being credit ratings I think seem to have more of an impact on your rate than they would have a couple of years ago. But I think probably the biggest reason is really on us to push and get a better definition. Our rating clearly makes no sense given our balance sheet and cash flow today. The reality is, given the things we've had rolling around to anchor and really with the Liberty one I think being the final one that anchors it, I think we now are in a place where we can appropriately get some definition and make some appropriate decisions.</p>

I think we get &#x2013; my guess would be, it's not the extreme of either. We're not just blindly rated on &#x2013; we're not just blindly dealt with on the credit rating, but conversely, I don't think it is ignored completely either. So, I think with respect for what we're generating to, but I think we probably should deal it with more clarity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I know it's early in your AT&amp;T partnership, but DISH had mentioned that churn was higher with their AT&amp;T customers than with their non-AT&amp;T customers. So, what can you do to keep churn down? And then, I guess as a corollary to that, who essentially owns the customer relationships in your telco partnerships?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the latter, I mean, it is our customer. I mean, I guess &#x2013; I never quite know what owns means. It is our customer. We get paid for it, and essentially most of the relationship is around creating a price point that we each take discount to put the services together.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now, there's some aspects of the calls we handle. Some aspects we would like them. Right now, I think we handle most of it. In all honesty, that wouldn't be my definition of ownership. I think I would probably view that on, what's the best customer experience. I mean, I have had &#x2013; we've had this intellectual debate over time here as what is defining &#x2013; what does ownership mean? Does it mean you bill them, or does it mean you answer the phones? I think it is our customer and I think those things we decide on the basis of what creates the best customer experience.</p>
          <p>We know who the customers are. We've &#x2013; we don't have &#x2013; they're our customers, we've all the information about them we'd have about any customer. And we can offer things to them and provide things to them and do what we want. Today we answer most of the phone calls, but I think to the degree we feel it made more sense for &#x2013; have a single phone contact, so you don't have to go to one place for one aspect of it and another, I don't think that's ownership; I think that's just creating a better customer experience.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of churn, clearly, AT&amp;T we haven't got a lot of churn sort of this far into it. Obviously, we have other telco relationships that are much longer term. And I think we feel, I mean, first a lot of the tools are the same tools we talked about. And I think our view is the bundling helps provide a deeper relationship with the customer. And we'll use those tools. I think we've found effective ways to try to improve churn. As we've gotten more experienced initially with bells &#x2013; with Verizon, with Qwest, with BellSouth when we had them. And actually continue to focus on those subs from a quality perspective, credit perspective, churn perspective, just like we would with other subs, and actually sort of preliminarily, we feel pretty good about the AT&amp;T subs in all those regards. They've done a pretty good job right out of the box.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, out there, guys. Chase, I've seen, at least here in the New York market we've seen you go back to some of your older TV messaging in some of your older ads and things.</p>
          <p>You got a lot of productivity from your HD messaging for a long time. The cable operators have been saying of late that they're &#x2013; that they think they will have fully closed that HD sort of tonnage gap, if you will, by the end of this year or so. What do you think is the next source of messaging and competitive advantage that sells DIRECTV to your customer base?

          <p>I certainly, I do &#x2013; our view would certainly be we've got real legs left in HD. And as I said, we've got additional capacity and flexibility to do more things, and add more dimensions to HD with a satellite that goes up later this year. So, certainly HD is a place that &#x2013; we feel very good about the results we're getting today in HD and the response. And certainly, will continue to be a part of the message.</p>
          <p>I think one of the messages beyond that, I think in some ways we'll deal with &#x2013; I'm not sure I'm going to announce them too far in front of doing them. I mean, in some ways you're getting into what are competitive aspects. We obviously thought the DVR scheduler and the iPhone aspect of it was something we made a little noise about beginning of the year, and actually felt good about that. When we have something in content that we can tie together, I think The Masters, and some of the golf and tennis stuff we made a little noise about that in the content, and I think there's some stuff coming from a technology and in-home functionality that again, we can really take advantage of. I think, how we do that, probably I guess I'd say I'm going to leave more to, you'll know it when you see it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And if I could just ask one more competitive question. DISH was in the market with offers like a Turbo offer that was sort of HD only, and then, a 9.99 offer. Did you see any impact of those, or did those sort of miss your core customer base, sort of fly under your core customer base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the best way I would respond is I don't think you saw anything from us that responded to those. And I guess, if we thought it was impacting us, you probably would have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, I'm just looking at the guidance here. I think, Chase, you said on track for about 3 billion in about &#x2013; in total cash flow for this year. So, I'm just kind of looking at your Q1, and it seems to me any way I look at it based on the guidance and all the other factors you comment, it seems like you are actually on track to shatter that guidance. And I think that, based on your commentary, it seems like you have become more optimistic on overall business trends and I'm just trying to reconcile -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you may be looking at OPBDA cash versus interest and taxes. OPBDA clearly would be much higher than that, so I'm talking probably about a different definition of cash flow, my guess is, than you're looking at. So, I'm not &#x2013; I mean, OPBDA, which I guess as some people looked at as operating cash flow will clearly be higher. The 3 billion was talking about cash flow before interest and taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That helps, and then, the other question was on the HD advantage. I think the question was asked on that. I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you still feel that, when you look at some of the cable companies now approaching 100 channels, and it seems like by the end of this year most of the cable industry is going to be north of 100, so then at that point, what kind of &#x2013; what's the next card that you have that you can really play out there to allow, to kind of position your offering as maybe a superior technology offering? And I know you haven't talked much about HD choices as opposed to the channels. If you can also comment on that because that seems to be one of the weapons that cable guys have been touting as helping them to contain churn as well. Can you comment on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I guess we &#x2013; look, I think HD is not just &#x2013; I mean, they're sort of this, you know &#x2013; I guess I disagree with the view that HD is simply about sort of getting to 100 channels and saying you're done. I think it is finding ways to continue to energize that as we've done in pay-per-view, with things like 1080p, in mix channels and continuing &#x2013; and look, layering of brands on top of it. And I think a large part of, some of our inherent strengths of being able to &#x2013; talk about cable doing things, meaning, you go back to saying cable has a different thing in every market except for &#x2013; and a different message. We've a singular, uniform consistent offering of a quality in breadth, choice, dimensions. And &#x2013; that have continued to sort of add strength and dimensions in these areas that I just touched on that will distinguish those. We've capacity to add more channels, which we will as the satellite lights up in the second half of the year. And I think the combination of that brand strength with the consistency of the delivery of the quality, with the ability to continue to energize it not just through adding channels but adding other dynamics and features around those channels, I think all combine to create a real position of leadership that that truly will continue to have legs with us for quite a while.</p>
          <p>And I think we, I think we've always viewed content as a place we can lead. And to the degree we can, that's part of what we're going to do is continue to find ways we can add dimensions to content as a whole, and certainly, HD-related content is a part of it. And I think any research we do clearly continues to speak to the perception of us as a, consumer perception of us as a leader in HD and a strong leader in HD. And it really is the combination of marketing, brand, content and creativity, and unique new exciting features to it. And I think we'll be able to deliver on that.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So, just a quick one in regards to the telco channel. It seems that even if after taking out AT&amp;T out of that 235K or so, it looks like the Verizon channel also accelerated. I was wondering if that was the case, and if it was the case, why you think there was that acceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think for Verizon, I think Verizon did put a little renewed energy. I think they even actually &#x2013; and I'm going back in memory, which is never a good thing. But I think even last summer Verizon at one point said they were going to put a little more energy towards the DSL side of their business and I think we did some things with them toward the end of the year that we thought were positive. And I think we did have a sort of a renewed and positive energy to the Verizon side of relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And have you seen that continue into this quarter also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013;  again I wouldn't have called it a dramatic impact on the quarter. I think it's &#x2013; yes, I think there's a commitment, a greater commitment than there was a year ago. But I wouldn't, I guess I wouldn't view the shift in &#x2013; shift in Verizon was not sort of a meaningful event and it was not a defining event in sort of the first quarter results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, to their credit, I think they have had, good positive renewed energy that has helped them. But again, it would be modest in the context of our aggregate numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had two. First, SAC was relatively low for the quarter. Just want to understand is this a function of just better leveraging some of the fixed portioning of the marketing cost because gross adds were so high? And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about the outlook for Latin America and the key metrics, specifically ARPU? And do you think the net add rate kind of continues at the first quarter rate for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; probably &#x2013; I don't know if Bruce is on, I'll let Bruce speak to Latin America. If you're talking after currency I'm not sure we're going to claim we've great expertise on trying to tell you what the currency's going to do to the results. So, I think realistically we can we probably, on Latin American side we can comment on the operating aspects of it that we can control, which I think we feel good about, but I think for currency, we'll probably have to, whatever judgment exists on a macro level.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; what was -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>SAC and kind of the leverage of -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SAC, clearly we benefited a bit from the volume against the fixed marketing, or the portion of marketing that was fixed, so that was up &#x2013; it was a modest positive. I think beyond that, it was a place where hardware costs helped us. And I think it's that &#x2013; even though were significantly greater number of advanced products and advanced the high end of the advanced in terms of HD DVRs, not just DVRs, went up, I think the hardware savings were still clearly a real positive inside that. And I think just in the areas of sort of sales and installation, I think those are areas &#x2013; did have good discipline and I think generated results, but generated results in a disciplined way.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you still come in around that 725 level for the year or do you think given the first quarter you might actually come in a little bit better?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I would just say that in general I guess we would feel, continue to have pretty good confidence in the business. And historically the first quarter is in fact, our weakest in many cases. But &#x2013; so I would look to sort of, at least continue what we did in the next quarters. And I think with the launch of high-def which we've done now throughout the entire South American continent, the launch of prepaid, particularly in Brazil, and then, just I think in general overall probably improving mood down there, certainly vis-&#xE0;-vis the fourth quarter, that we're pretty comfortable with what the rest of the year looks like.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions. I wanted to just go back to the programming cost growth. I think you guys mentioned that you've gone back and renegotiated some of your affiliate deals. And I was wondering if you guys were, in these renegotiations, able to actually lower the dollar amount you are paying or is it just a slower rate of growth, and then, secondly, just can you give us a sense of, if the percent of gross adds that you've been getting from DISH has changed materially either year-over-year or sequentially? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Percentage. I didn't hear the second part. The percentage of what?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on the programming cost, again, I don't know whether renegotiating is the right phrase. It's really as deals come up and we negotiate a new deal at the end of a deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm probably not going to &#x2013;  those negotiations obviously are tough negotiations. I'm probably not going to get too far into what our goal is &#x2013;  to drive the cost is as far down as we can. Obviously, different programs come in all size and shapes and they are all, every negotiation is different.</p>
          <p>But I think we probably, we'll leave those negotiations and results to the private discussions with those parties.</p>
          <p>In terms of -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The percentage of customers from DISH. Again, I probably would answer that I think we feel we're competing pretty effectively with DISH.</p>
          <p>Within this quarter, with the AT&amp;T swing happening, probably need a little more visibility to try to factor out how is that &#x2013; how is that from January where it was on one side versus January, February, March on the other side is something that we're still sort of probably trying to get a bit better visibility to. But I would simply say I think we're competing. I think we're competing pretty effectively on most levels for subscribers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I guess sort of coming off of Craig's question regarding what sort of comes after HD. I just had two questions on that front. For any of the AT&amp;T and Verizon marketing -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you speak up a little bit please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry, sorry, my mistake. For any of the AT&amp;T or Verizon marketing that's going on, is any of that happening out of the telcos' local footprint? In other words, AT&amp;T outside their local footprint, or VZ outside theirs, and then, second, can you give us an update on the whole home experience sort of slated for 2010? Is that still Phase II I think you called it last time? Is that still on track? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, we're still on the for us, you are talking about marketing wireless essentially which would be outside their local footprint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's &#x2013; it is an active place with both that we are actively engaged with both Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T Wireless as I said, before, and I think we view that as a real opportunity for us.  we've done some. I mean, obviously have the iPhone app that is not just in the wired footprint, so there are clearly components of this that are going beyond. But I'd say that probably is really still more to come than &#x2013; it's certainly not &#x2013; again, it's really, I think an opportunity as we look forward, not something that we're out in any meaningful way today on. But I think we think it is a major opportunity for us to add a real dimension to the business.</p>

          <p>And the whole home solution. Yes, we're actually moving forward. We're going to move forward in the second half of the year. The first iteration again, is sort of to have boxes speak to each other. I was just looking at the demo yesterday that moves and has HD DVRs and HD boxes be able to access content from &#x2013; content from each other so that you can have a HD DVR and an HD box in another room in the house could access that disk, and tie-in to the PC. It's all &#x2013; which is really the first generation of it before we move to really a, which is really more a 2010 move to a generation of the box that is really built specifically as more of a media center tying two devices. But the first generation that we will be moving forward in the second half of this year is the one that's the first step that has the box's ability to speak is to each other as well as tie-in to a PC. So, that is on track for the second half.</p>
