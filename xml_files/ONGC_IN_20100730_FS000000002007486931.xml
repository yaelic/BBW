          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome to the ONGC Q1 FY '11 results conference call, hosted by Prabhudas Lilladher Private Limited. As a reminder, all participants' line will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today's presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Joining us on the call today from Prabhudas Lilladher is Ms. Amisha Vora and Mr. Dilip Bhat, Joint Managing Directors. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Nishna Biyani.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And over to you, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'm Nishna here and we at Prabhudas Lilladher are very pleased to hold this conference call for the first quarter FY '11 results of ONGC. Today we have the senior management from ONGC, led by Mr. D. K. Sarraf, Director, Finance; Mr. B.L. Ghasolia, Advisor, Finance; Mr. Vijay Ranjan and Mr. L. Nelson, Chief Manager, FNDIRC.</p>
          <p>The call will begin with some observations by Mr. Sarraf and the management team followed by a Q&amp;A session. Over to you sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you all in this ONGC earnings call for Q1 FY '11. I'm joined by Mr. Ghasolia, Advisor, Finance; Mr. Vijay Ranjan, General Manager of Training; Mr. Nelson, he is the Chief Manager and <mark type="inaudible" /> and we will be shortly be having somebody from ONGC Ltd with us.</p>
          <p>The financial results for the first quarter of 2011 have been taken on this call by the Board of Directors of ONGC yesterday, that is on 29 of July 2010. These results have been posted on ONGC's website, as well as given to the print media for publication and I hope that all of you would have seen it. However for the benefit of everybody, let me give the proxies of these results.</p>
          <p>Gross sales revenue stood at 13,710 crore as against 14,972 crore in Q1 FY '10. The net profit after-tax is 3,651 crore against 4,448 crore, that is a decrease of about 24.5%. The decrease in profit after-tax is mainly due to increased share of under recoveries of all marketing companies amounting to 5,515 crore rupees, which we have been asked to via during the quarter, as against 429 crore during the corresponding quarter last year. This has adversely impacted our profit after-tax by 3,119 crore rupees after accounting for the <mark type="inaudible" /> and asset benefits.</p>
          <p>Gross billing for 2009 was $80.80 per barrel as against 60.58 in the same period last year. However, after giving discount by subsidy, the valuation for crude oil in this quarter was 48.04 per barrel as against 58.25 in the same period last year. That means there has been a decline in the net price of crude oil by more than $10 per barrel.</p>
          <p>In addition, descending of Indian rupees during the first quarter of this fiscal has also impacted our gross revenue adversely. The exchange rate of rupee versus dollar was 45.67 vis-&#xE0;-vis 48.67 in the first quarter of 2010. That means for each barrel of billing we earn three rupees less. As a result, after <mark type="inaudible" /> for crude oil in rupee terms was 2,194 rupees, 2,194 rupees per barrel in the current quarter as against 2,835 rupees per barrel in the quarterly quarter last year. This has an adverse impact of 862 crores on the sales revenues. So that means 862 crores was the impact of the exchange addition.</p>
          <p>Then, as you are aware, the government of India has revised the price of APM gas with the effect from 1 of June 2010, as we develop $4.2 per MMBtu which includes <mark type="inaudible" />. Because it favorably impacted our gas revenue by 539 crore rupees in the first quarter, though the impact during this quarter was only for one month.</p>
          <p>Revenue from value-added product has also gone up by rupees 282 crore in this quarter. Income from interest and dividend has come down by rupees 380 crore mainly on account of less yield from investment. The averages during the corresponding quarter of the last year was 11.48%, which has come down to as low as 6.14% during this quarter in the review.</p>
          <p>As all of you are aware, during the year 2009/2010, ONGC Board has decided not to charge any interest from its 100% subsidiary that only can be estimated from 1 April 2009. This has a negative impact of 290 crores during this quarter of this year. Also the decision was effective from 1 October 2009, but the adjustment was made in Q3 of last year; that means for the first quarter and second quarter we had made the provision of interest receivable from ONGC Videsh with a reverse during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The operating expenses during the first quarter of this year has increased by rupees 408 crores, mainly on account of increasing manpower, water induction, machine and maintenance and the transmission cost. At the same time, there's a marginal increase in workover expenditure and initiative expenditure and provision control expenditure. Overall I would say that the operating expenditure, bulk of the exchange variations are almost equal to the last year's level.</p>
          <p>In Videsh, there has been no increase in the overall DD&amp;A cost, in which through that 3,113 crore as against 3,179 crore during the first quarter of last year. However some increase in depletion and depreciation cost is mainly due to addition in the properties, especially Rajasthan and other physical infrastructure. At the same time, survey and rival costs have significantly come down from 1,911 crores last year to 1,470 crores in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of physical performance, whereas the gas production has been more or less static at 5.76 bcm billion cubic meter during this quarter versus 5.75 bcm in the same quarter last year. However there was a marginal reduction in oil production at 6.05 mmt, which is million metric ton in the first quarter of this year and of course to 6.12 mmt during the first quarter of last year. That means there is a decline of about 1% in the net production.</p>
          <p>The production of value added products, namely LPG, Nasa, C2-C3, HQ, which was 864 tmt, which is thousand metric ton in first quarter last year was 801 tmt in the current quarter. For the domestic joint ventures, the question has been an increase of approximately 2% from 0.43 eventually last year to 0.55 mmt in Q1 of this year. The gas production has more or less been stable or stagnant for the joint venture at 0.65 bcm in this quarter versus 0.64 bcm in the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Some of the minute details about the adjusted results are already available on our website and hence I would request you to finish by leaving here and would be happy to take questions from all of you ladies and gentlemen. My colleagues Mr. Ghasolia, Mr. Vijay Ranjan, Mr. Nelson and now we have also been joined by Mr. Rakesh Sharma from <mark type="inaudible" /> and we would try to clarify whatever points you may have. Thank you and over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instruction] The first question is from the line of Niraj Mansingka from Edelweiss Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sir. Sir this is regarding the sales data. The sales to production ratio for the company has come down dramatically. Could you throw some color on that, how the sales to ratio has come up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mr. Vijay Ranjan has already brought out some data on this question and I will request him to throw some light.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. See the ratio of sales to production has more or less been on what has been expected in this quarter, and the only thing this time, it so happened that some of the refineries had some technical problems; like Numaligarh refinery in Assam and Koyali refinery in Gujrat and HPCL refinery in Bombay. All three refineries had some technical problem and therefore the take offs were less than normal. And because of this there was a stock buildup of roughly around 138 million metric towards the quarter and that is the actual increase besides the normal gap between sales and production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, that's all. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nipun Sharma from Mirea Asset Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon sir. Thanks for the appendix. Just wanted you to kindly remind us about your exploration development and deficit charges for the full year and how many were seen in Q1'11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Nipun.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mr. Ranjan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. See this current fiscal FY '11, we are planning to drill 154 exploratory wells and 216 development wells and we have a production target of 25 million metric ton of oil from the domestic operations and 2 million metric tons from our share in the domestic JV, and 23 BCM of gas from our domestic operations and 2.2 bcm of gas from the joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you please give me the split between how many exploratory wells and development wells have been drilled already in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter we have already drilled 28 exploratory wells and 54 development wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the CapEx outlay for the full year and how much has been spent for the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the figure for the full year, but the actual spend for the quarter is actually, we require some more time to compile that data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No problem. The full year target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Full year is 26,523 crores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Probal from IDFC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. I just had a couple of questions. One was on OVL. I know its not part of the result, but if you can give some color on how production has progressed in OVL and what are your sort of outlook for production for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And the second question was, what are the kind of estimates you are getting at the moment of subsidy for the rest of the year, of the total subsidy burden. I mean ONGC's share will perhaps be again a majority of that 33%, but what are the estimates for the total subsidy burden for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will answer the first part, that's the real production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Q1 production in this financial year has been about 2.3 million tons of oil and gas both put together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which has about 1.7 million tons of oil and remaining is gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And throughout the financial year, we expect more or less similar kind of a production profile that we have had in first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that would be around sir, it's around 6.8 million tons of oil and about 2.5 BCM of gas, am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, something very close to that. I mean what we are targeting is about 8.6 million tons of both and oil and gas put together, factoring it. Various things that might happen during the next nine months, where we would have some wells which would have a lower productivity or we would be putting on some other wells into the production stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And the subsidy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the subsidy, I would take this question. During this quarter already there is doubt which ODC has given or ODC has asked to give. It's 5515.54 crore against the total recovery which was born by the upstream, it's roughly 6690.50 crore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now a couple of things have happened in the recent past towards almost the end of the quarter. Firstly the government has increased the price of petroleum products as the government has been dealing with the prices of petrol. So this will have some positive impact on the total un-naturally position.</p>
          <p>And during the current quarter, first quarter, it was not possible to account for any contribution from the government, because of the true position. So evidently it is expected to come during Q2 or Q3, and at that time we expect that the subsidiary contribution by upstream will be lower than what it has been in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall we will say that the subsidy who's at the whole of the year is expected to bet better than the first quarter, but however it would be difficult to predict. It will depend on various factors, including the global prices, the equity of the government to trade, especially on SSC sites and so on, and also very importantly the contribution in terms of idle points or projects which comes from the CFRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just a small follow-up question sir, but the share, I mean irrespective of the government cash. I mean in terms of the timing and the mechanism of the government contribution, upstream would be still probably 33% of whatever burden it is for the rest of the year, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to say and to predict whether upstream consumption would be 33% or a different number. In the past, for several years it's been one-third of total facility contribution being made by Justin. But it's difficult say that whether the part will be repeated or not. It would depend on various factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The next question is from the line of Raj Gandhi from Principal Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Gandhi. Good afternoon to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sir. Sir I just would like to know how do you account for the royalty that you pay in the Cairn field, because 100% right is according to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As per the production sharing agreement, 100% of the royalty is to be paid by ONGC. And therefore, we have accounted for 100% of the royalty as expenditure. Also only 30% of the crude oil is received into ONGC's books...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that can be fully reflected in your accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is already reflected in the accounts. That mean it is on the conservative side, whereas as you perhaps would be aware, been representing to the Government of India for <mark type="inaudible" /> which we paid on behalf of the operator Cairn. And we expect that some of the revision should come in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just net of this royalty, what was the profit or loss from that Cairn JV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the separate number of how much profit or gain we have made from the Cairn JV, but the fact remains that it would not be a profitable venture if we continue to bear 100% of the royalty against 30% of the revenue, but we are doing all of our best and we expect some resolution of the problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so just sir, your KG field FDP is approved. Will you write back the provision made earlier? Because I guess the UD value you already written it off, but once the FDP is approved, will you have to write it back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could not understand your question there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, this UD well which you have drilled, even though it was successful because you were not about to drill in that block for the foreseeable future, you had written-off that expenditure of I think about 900 crores. So will there be a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a very good question. We have made a provision we have not written-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Had we written it off, there was no question of writing back.</p>

          <p>There are two parts of this block, the northern part and the southern parts. So, as the northern part is concerned we have filed the document on 16 of July this month. This is called the Declaration of Commerciality. For this northern discovery we have filed it. For the southern discovery, some more work is yet to be done and once the digits approves this Declaration of Commerciality. This is meant to develop this northern part which we call in the northern discovery area, along with certain nominative discoveries. In the nominated blocks we already framed it in and it will perhaps move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, what is the amount of CapEx and production end result of the declaration that you made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is too early to say that what is going to be the CapEx, but as far as the document which we have filed with DBS, the CapEx is expected to be approximately US $5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the production under this?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean again, the production as we go forward would need to be filed soon, both from the NDA which is NEFT block as well as the nominated block, but the production which we have at this every point in time is 86.97, about 87 Bcm of gas production and 4.5 million of crude production over the thin line and the deep production is expected to be in 2016 which is about 13 Bcm of gas, plus, about 8 Mnc of oil.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Vijay Ranjan tells me that we are yet to do certain jobs for the southern area and that some more time is available even as the norms to file the document of DOC and would take about six to 12 months for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vidyadhar Ginde from DSP Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. In fact, a lot of my questions have been answered. But just to clarify further, on the Rajasthan thing, as and when the government accepts your suggestion, is it going to be the composition, is it going to be retrospective? And when do you expect the resolution? Do you expect it in the current year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vidyadhar, we have been trying for resolution since 1998, it's been 12 years. So for me to say today that how much it would take is very difficult, but what I can say is that the decision with the government in various ministries is at a very advanced stage, and now there has been a realization in the government also that what ONGC has been saying all these years, more than a decade, is quite reasonable.</p>
          <p>ONGC has agreed to develop this block in the vested interest based on certain conditions which were made by the government, and hence it needs to be reimbursed to ONGC. But it's difficult at this point in time to give timeline, that how much time it would take. And obviously we have transferred the investment from the constructive effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the second question was again relating to KG, though a lot it has been answered. Two clarifications; one is that the numbers which you mentioned, I presume are for recoverable reserves. Are they only relating to the northern portion, and what was the oil recoverable number? Was it 4.5 million tons or what was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I want to repeat that. First of all, the numbers which I said, they are of recoverable reserves. That is the cumulative production profile of the discoveries and the discoveries here mean the northern development area of the KG block, plus certain other discoveries from the nomination block. So we would be combining these two areas, which would be one of the first in India to have a development of the nomination block, as well as the NESP blocks. The cumulative production in the field is 4.5 million tons, and the peak production again happens in 2016, which is 0.841 million tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question in this context is that, are you likely to still have 65% stake in this field because you have palmed out stakes to players, which I think at least one or both of them are gone out, so what's the status on that? I think eventually you're likely to have 65% stake or higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These details are getting worked out today. Practically we own 90% of the participating interest in this field and going forward, how much we own and how much we form out if any, those details are getting worked out. We are in discussions with the different companies, but nothing has been finalized as yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Just one more thing, that when is the production expected to start oil and gas from the northern development area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As per the documents which we have filed with the DTH, it is 2016 calendar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's start year as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There is two wells we plan to drill. So in the first year itself we achieved the peak production and the only thing I'm not very sure is whether this 2016 refers to the calendar year or the financial year. Perhaps it's calendar year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much sir for the opportunity. My question is regarding the excess inventory buildup which has happened in the western area. When do you think this will translate into &#x2013; is this going to happen quicker or it's going to let's say in one quarter or it will take some more time and spread over a few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these are a very temporary phenomenon, which always happen sometime in the oil industry. Some of the refineries, they do go for planned shutdowns. Even unplanned shutdowns also do take place in the refineries. So we have some storage capacity. The refineries also have some storage capacity.</p>
          <p>So here in this quarter, there was some problem with reference to the heavy oil in Gujarat, which we have been acquiring finally. As well as in the northeast there was problem in the minor refineries, plus the HPCL refineries are also uplifting the crude below their normal uptake. It will be built up on gas and we expect that trading, it would come to be normal very soon. It's not a cause of concern to us.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions, one on the KG basin field, you know where TATA oil and Petrobras backed out. Now what is the status on that? And how soon do we see partnership happening, as well as what's the outline of basically the production if any by them and when do you expect it?</p>
          <p>And second question is on, how do you expect the gas growth? Would it be flat year-on-year for FY'11 and just for the next a couple years if you can explain? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So we can see the exit of certain partners in the KG block. They express their desire to quit the block, the candidate in the early season. So as NP is concern, as we just said we are working on the various proposals, but no decision has been taken, but let me assure you that we ourselves are capable technically and financially to complete the development and we are taking necessary actions towards that.</p>
          <p>The last part of the question, that I think it was on gas production. As I just said, there are two, three areas on which the gas or pipe would come. Firstly, in 2011 and 2012 beginning, the production from Tripura would increase substantially once the power plant of ONGC Tripura Power Company is commissioned.</p>
          <p>I would increase from 1.5 million cubic meters per day to almost 6 million cubic meter per day. Then we have increased in C-Series a gas production, which at present is 1.1 million cubic meter per day and perhaps it would increase to 3 to 4 million cubic meter per day. This too would happen in the short run.</p>
          <p>The two wells which are longer in term, one is NDA and the nomination block which I just said happening in 2016, as well as we would have a substantial increase in gas production from Daman area, as well as certain developments we have there. Plus on the east side we have DL15 and D1, which is likely to come in the production from 2011-12, which is likely to be 2 million cubic meters per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you. And one more question on, what was the gain share that ONGC recorded this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, basically the changed production, what has ONGC shared from the Ken field this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So initially a document called Declaration of Commerciality is to be filed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And after that, DGH, the government, they'll work to approve that. Once they approve it, then the operator has got I think maybe one year. So the operator gets further time to file the documents which is the FDP, Field Development Plan, which is a very, very detailed document. It covers that how many play point will be there, how many wells would be there, what would be the production quantity, where the production would come, what would be the production profile? The costs are fine-tuned in terms of CapEx as well as OpEx. So all these details are there. This is a very, very detailed document. This Declaration of Commerciality is a brief document, but based on the technical data which we have today.</p>

          <p>Hello, sir. I don't know whether you have covered this. Basically depreciation cost for the quarter was higher year-on-year. Is there any specific reason to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There is a specific reason to that. The first reason was the commencement of production from Rajasthan block in a significant way. And I think there was an effect of 60 crore of depreciation charged for Rajasthan block. In addition that the existing facility for the existing production, some more facilities have come, though the production has not gone up significantly. So because of that, after all depreciation charges increased.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There's a follow up question from the line of Vidyadhar Ginde from DSP Merrill Lynch; please go ahead. Mr. Vidyadhar, your line has been unmated, you may go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The question I wanted to ask, a couple of questions. One is that, of the exploration variance planned in the current year, how many are planned in NELP blocks and in the Eastern Offshore region, one. And the second question was, as far as the Rajasthan field is concerned, how much reserves, 2P reserves have been accommodated in this field as of the number which you gave us for March 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of the question, I'll take the answer. Out of the total number of exploratory wells planned for the year, 154, roughly around 10 to 15% of the wells have been over the last two three years they have increased, so if we even try to maintain the same figure, around 15% of the rents will be in the NELP block.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And on the Rajasthan question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the question you had for Rajasthan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question I had is, that of the reserves which you had mentioned to us as 2P reserves as of March 2010, how much of these reserves are from the Rajasthan block, where you have 30% stake along with Kim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vidyadhar, it's likely that the REC, Research Activation Committee, once in two years for estimating the results in nomination blocks. And for these, the DSC block, it fits only once a year, and the significant location has been in the current quarter, in the category of crude oil reserves. So, we don't have any upgraded results as to who does those results, but from 10% if we were to provide these results, we have used the results which the team has used for their decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, but the number which you gave us in March 2010 is only of nomination blocks. It has even nothing from the pre NELP Rajasthan block?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it has to be there, because in Rajasthan we have only pre NELP block, we don't have any nomination blocks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I know that, but so therefore you gave us a 2P reserves number of ONGC in India, or a figure of JV as well as nomination of March 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does the JV 2P reserves as of March 2010 include something from Rajasthan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rajesh Ghoghari from Religare Capital Market. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is Vallabh here. I've got a couple of questions, one is the ramp up of things. Imperial Energy, how you see the ramp up for that? The second thing, the second question is the number of deepwater wells you are going to drill this year and the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think Mr. Rakesh Sharma from ONGC will take the Imperial question and then deepwater question we will take up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Imperial at the moment is producing at the rate of 1,7000 barrels a day and we expect that its going to be more or less the same, except for a little upside that we are going to have once the weather window is good for carrying out exploration wells and development wells. More or less, this is going to be the case for this yearend and in the next calendar, in the first quarter will see some little upside coming out from Imperial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just want to add on that, because I am not wrong, initially you guided for a pretty high number. What we are seeing is that like the ramp up is not going as per that. So any specific reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first reason that I would enumerate is the technical challenge that is being forced up by the reservoir. The reserves are ample over there, it's only the question of reservoir bleeding it out the wells.</p>
          <p>Now the reservoir as you would know had just commenced production when we took it over. So this reservoir was not fully examined for its production features. As and when we started drilling wells and going along enhancing the production, we have encountered some difficulty in the form of hydro fracturing the reservoir so that it can bleed.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of skills which are still being tested and once these tests move out, we will implement them on full scale and that probably is going to add to enhanced production at Imperial. Till that time we are carrying our studies on hydro fracturing and to hold up the fracture, so that it can bleed.</p>
          <p>We would like to retain this kind of level that we have achieved till now, starting from 6,000 when we took over, today its almost 17,000 barrels a day. So we like to maintain this profile, as well experiment and then take something which is very fruitful in the reservoir on a full scale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question was on the deepwater wells. You will be drilling this year and next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year actually we will be drilling 15 wells. Next year also it will be the same amount, around 15, 16 wells will be there, deep-water wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have rig time for that to drill these 15 wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have the rig time for drilling all these wells.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ghoghari, do you have any further questions? So we'll move on to the next question. The next question is from the line of Mr. Harshad Borawake from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just wanted to recheck the number of the peak production from the northern development area for gas, could you just repeat that number?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in south we are quite high; that's why there could be a need for restating that. I said 12.96 BCM up to 2016 which is gas, and 0.841 MMT of oil.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just wanted to confirm this question <mark type="inaudible" /> that Imperial Energy will peak at 40,000 barrels per day. How authentic that is data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said in my earlier answers, probably you had access to what we were answering. There is a technological challenge that we have encountered. The reason is, there was a little anticipation which has firmed up as we have gone through the project. The project was a very primary producer at the time when we took and now there is a potential that the project has which has to be exploited. The numbers that you have 40,000, it is possible in the near future, but the only in between is the technical challenge that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, can you clarify on this value? Can you give the report that the east coast development where you plan to produce this production of 140,000 barrels per day, how much CapEx is involved in that sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, for the east coast we can get that from the NDA, Northern Development and Discovery Area. The oil production would be 0.841 million metric tons per annum, because this production in 2016 which translates to totally about 16,800 barrels per day. The CapEx of the whole of this NDA plus certain discoveries in the nominated plot, I said that it would be around US $5 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sir. Sir, just one clarification I was seeking. In your initial comments, if I heard right, you were saying government is still considering the compensation in the form of cash or bonds. I thought it was settled in that the compensation will be in the form of cash or that's not the position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sir, just one more thing. Could we get a specific date on the Carabobo project and were the reserve numbers from that project included in our reserve numbers which was given out in March '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Carabobo project was signed on 12 May 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So whatever reserves they come out, out of a certification process, there the sovereign interest of Venezuela would also play a vital role. Once they have accepted the kind of numbers that the consortium projects to the sovereign body, those numbers will be carried pro rata, based on the share that we have in the project in our books.</p>
          <p>Now it's very early for us to say what numbers are there, because there is a huge process of first establishing what is the kind of reserve over there, taking it to the sovereign body, getting it certified or accepted by them and then billing it back to the books.</p>
          <p>The numbers that probably you must have come across are the ballpark numbers which normally companies take when they are trying to acquire an asset. So these still have to be established, they have to proved out and then sovereign certifications have to be procured on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And the one last thing sir, in the recent economy the TD allocation to us was cancelled. Is there any material impact of that on us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see any material impact of cancellation of 0.4 million cubic liter of gas per day. It was not adding to our bottom line rather, it would have added to our top line only and corresponding expenditures. So bottom line will not impacted.</p>

          <p>Congratulations for your excellent conversations and discussion going on. I would just wanted to know, what is the status with regard to the Rajasthan Refinery Project, which we hear that ONGC is going to take it and then some interest has been shown by the EIL also to take part stake and all that. So can you update on that, what is the status?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I will update. We have always been saying consistently that we would put the refinery if it is economically viable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in case it is not economically viable, that viability gap would need to be bridged by the state government, by way of direct interventions or by way of some tax concessions. So we have already taken up with the state government, on their proposal how they would bridge the viability gap and we are yet to hear anything final from them. In the interim, I mean we are studying, tightening the visibility reports for the proposed refinery, but that could again take a couple of months.</p>

          <p>The next question is from the line of Kanish Shah from Quantum Advisors. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to know, you had given us number of 539 crore of additional revenue on account of the gas price increase. Could we just have a number as to what was the net cash addition on account of this incremental gas price for you during the quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second is that, are you planning to increase any kind of production in the existing EPM fields as a result of this change in the gas price policy or any kind of a more investment that you are planning to invest as such in this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there is the 539 crore <mark type="inaudible" />, that is our gross revenue which comes from the increased gas price. 10% would be taken as revenue regarding group's royalty and a one third group approximately would be the possible change, so the balance would be eligible to be changed as well as to the ESE of the company. On analyzing as per our estimates, it's a little north of 5,500 crores of revenue and more than 3,500 crores of effect would be there for increase in gas price.</p>
          <p>As regards to your second question, there could be certain inclusion in gas production from the fleet, because of the increase in gas price, but I doubt that it would be significant for us to make some significant impact on our top line or bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the reason is are we having &#x2013; I mean, basically the production is from the mature fields. Are we facing any kind of a decline of which probably earlier would not have existed because of the constraint in the prices and now you would be willing to invest and either maintain the production or try to increase it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just that possibilities would be there but there may not be any significant top line impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Not a problem. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> from RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, you provided guidance on production volume for oil and gas for FY '11. Is it possible to provide similar item for FY '12 and '13? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just hang on. We are deliberating who will take the question within our team. I think Mr. Nelson is coming forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In FY '12 the crude production is expected to be around 27 million metric ton from our domestic operations and 3 million metric ton as our share in the domestic JVs and gas production is almost to continue to be at the same level of 22 BCM from the domestic operation and 2.7 BCM from our joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if possible to talk on FY '13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FY '13 we have not made any plan. Basically you may be aware that we make plans based on the 11th five-year plan from 2007 to '12. When we draw the plan for the 12 to 5 year period, from 30 to 17, maybe towards the end of this year or the early next year there maybe some guidance that will be available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But obviously so now you are looking at big increase in production in FY '12 itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But again, this will be reviewed around October. We will be seeing a completion of all the capital projects and the field-wise it will be reviewed and the production plan will be firmed up when the budgets for the current year is revised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Appreciate my concern that I think when you said you're falling short of its target, so that's why I was wondering what's the connection level on the rise in production. Because even in this year, 25 million tons you are guiding for a slight increase in production, whereas there has been a drop in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, look we are really aware of the concerns of the investors, as well as the others are concerned of the performance of the production, but the production may not increase significantly in the short run. There would be a certain increase in production definitely in the mid terms, when some of our existing schemes we have completed. But during these long term, due to certain things which we have, which I just elaborated some time back, that there would be a significant increase in production for this year again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, 2 million are increased between FY '11 and FY '12, to me is a very, very big increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm seeing that you will likely to see a very significant increase, not in the short-term, not in the mid term, but in the long-term on gas. But on oil, we did not see any significant increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly sir, I think in the earlier questions you had mentioned that the Mahanadi block appraisal wells will be drilled in the next one or two whatever year or so. Would it be possible to state whether that block will be developed and production will start before 2016, i.e. before the KG block or would it be after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we have got two-three wells plan there, but after appraisal when we go for the timeline; definitely it will be after PG 19.2 commencement of production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question, you mentioned that you paid 100% of royalty for the Rajasthan's last joint venture with Cairn. Is it possible to share what were the exact royalty to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have readily available with me, but some of us can workout. I think that Nelson has got the figure with him.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See royalty, total 171 crores we have accounted in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a 100% basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On 100% basis in the Rajasthan block.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. That's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darshan Narsim from Systematics. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just a couple of questions from my side. One is, the exploration plant you said that is for 154 wells to be drilled in FY11. Can you give me specifics please? And the second question is on guidance on built-in plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Region-wise break up I don't have right now with me, but then I can give you onshore and offshore break-up. We are going to drill 106 wells in onshore and 38 wells in the offshore. I'm getting up the details. I don't have it right now with me, but I can always tell you at a later time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much would that <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the deepwater wells will be something like 10 to 15. 15 wells it will be for the current year. So maybe all the deepwater wells will be these kind only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second on the guidance please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance for FY '12 and onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FY '12 onwards we haven't made anything right now, but the budget process is right now on. Maybe in a month's time, we should be able to give you for the next two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one more question from my side. You earlier said in the conference call that out of 10 to 15% of these <mark type="inaudible" /> and the balance in nomination.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when are your nomination licensing getting expired and will you see more billing happening in your NLP blocks on that denomination? Because you said <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is true. Right now we are in the almost terminal stages of the PEL block on fixed and term payers. So whatever investment we made we want to monetize them at the earliest possible. So that major concentration is still on our PEL blocks only, and may be two, three years down the line our concentration will definitely shift more toward NELP block than what we are doing right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rajesh Ghogari from Religare Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Balaji here again. It's just in continuation to the earlier production guidance for gas, what you have told is <mark type="inaudible" /> there is not going to be any significant rise, but if we go by our earlier remark, it was that Tripura power plant is going to come somewhere by the end of next year. So in that case the production is going to go up sharply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. The thing is that by 2012 the Tripura power would come and the production would increase 1.5 million cubic meter to 6 million cubic meter developed there. In addition to that, the deep production would also increase from 1.1 million cubic meter per day at present to 3 to 4 million cubic meter and finally the portion from D1 and DR15 would also increase perhaps from 2011 and there could be 2 million cubic meter. But a more significant increase would be when the KG, NBA and certain other block they start producing and certain more will be disclosed on this site.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to want to understand, are you seeing some production fall in your 18 fields, means <mark type="inaudible" /> fields at Bombay <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been a decline in our fields, but then we are making it by way of our IOR, UOR and putting new discoveries into the production base. And that's has made us maintain the production for the last four, five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What it means is that, we can see an increase of around 7 to 8% next year in gas production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. That's correct. Though it is growing, but since the decline is being more made up, so you don't see an increase really in the absolute terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vishwas Katela from HDFC Standard Life. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, sir. I had a question for Nelson actually. He said royalty for Rajasthan was about 171 crores for the quarter, have I got the number right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 171 crores, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one, I just was seeing the numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting it wrong, but for this quarter last year the royalty payment for onshore bill was 622 crores. And it shows that it has fallen to 519 crores for this one first quarter FY11, am I getting it right? But here this royalty is 171 crores, which actually last year should have been zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing is that last year the realization is much more. Nowadays we are paying royalty on a regular basis, so it varies along with the new time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So net realization basically rather than gross.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So that is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nipun Sharma from Mirea Asset Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. My question is for Rakesh-ji. Rakesh, I just had a sense OVL is looking for properties all across the world, but in specific can you talk to us about the OVLs value for U.S. shale gas? Is that something you are looking at seriously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See OVL, at the moment has got considerable expertise and capabilities in conventional oil and gas. Now, as we move along, being a petroleum company, the growth strategy naturally should include our reach onto the difficult oil and gas as well.</p>
          <p>So yes, something like oil sands or shale gas certainly are on our drawing boards and we are looking at some of the assets that are being talked about in the market. So gradually as we develop a good eye or if we see considerable commercial products in any of these and parallelly if technology is not a barrier, certainly we will try and pick up something in shale gas and oil sands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But this technology barrier can always be bridged by the way of partnership <mark type="inaudible" />. Is there anything you guys do towards the partnership towards the shale gas or maybe domestically even?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, there are two sided approaches which are being done on the shale gas. ONGC in domestic areas is also attempting something. That certainly is a capacity that we would be having when we go abroad as OVL.</p>
          <p>The second is that there are areas specific requirements sometimes. Either it is a deeper horizon which has to be penetrated or it is a relatively tighter horizon, but the volumes are so spread out. So there would be a different connotation all together in terms of technology, which might be required. What you said earlier was partnering a technology firm. Those options are also on the drawing board. Not only investing, but also partnering a technology expert, so that we have a hedge and the capacity builds up quickly for the future growth of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But in the near term we should only expect conventional oil and gas acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I beg your pardon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the near term we should only expect conventional oil and gas fields as acquisition targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way. Near term you should expect that OVL would be reaching out for the difficult oil and gas as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
