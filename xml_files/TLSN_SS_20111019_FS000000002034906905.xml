        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that we are ready to start.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to TeliaSonera's press conference for the third quarter of 2011. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, Head of Investor Relations. I have with me our Chief Executive Officer and President, Lars Nyberg; and our CFO, Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist.</p>
          <p>As in the two previous quarters, we have another press conference that I know that some of you are interested in starting in about an hour, so we have the ambition to close this conference within one hour. And after the formal presentation from Lars and Per-Arne, we will do Q&amp;A as usual.</p>
          <p>With that, if Lars is ready, we are ready to begin. Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. Welcome.</p>
          <p>I think we had a good quarter. I think you've seen it already. We had growth, 2.4%. I'm pretty pleased with that. We improved our EBITDA margin. I'll come back on that in a minute. Our earnings per share was lower than last year. Two reasons: And you all know that, it's Turkcell delivering significantly worse results than the year before; and currency. And we had very strong cash flow in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As I said, 2.4%, the drivers of this was Mobility Sweden where we grew 6%, Kcell in Kazakhstan, Ncell in Nepal, Yoigo in Spain and Ucell in Uzbekistan. I make the point that if you do analyze the growth in actual kroners, half of the growth basically comes from Eurasia area and the other half comes from Mobility Sweden and Spain. So, it's sort of half-half in local currency. In reported currency, it's even more in Sweden and Spain than in Eurasia.</p>
          <p>This is something I am very proud of. It's the 12th consecutive quarter that we improved the EBITDA margin. We are now clearly in the upper quartile of the industry if you compare with our competitors. This is the result of a lot of work over many years with a lot of people. I'm not sure how much higher it can go, but I'm really pleased with the level that we have achieved over the last four years.</p>
          <p>I want to talk about a few other things because the quarter is so much in line with expectations, so there's not much to talk about in my opinion. So, I'd like to talk about some other things that I think are exciting for TeliaSonera.</p>
          <p>You know we did a rebranding in the spring of this year. I said then that it's probably 80% internal reason and 20% external reason. And I think it really worked very well for us. It revitalized the company. It underlined our ambition to behave as one company, which is not part of the culture in TeliaSonera.</p>
          <p>This picture shows the spontaneous &#x2013; the red one is the spontaneous awareness of our different brands. And if you show the logo, then the lower graph tells you how &#x2013; if you see the logo, you connect it to TeliaSonera or Omnitel or whatever the brand is that you are familiar with in our group. So, I'm very pleased that it has been received so well. And as I said before, internally, it has meant a lot to the company.</p>
          <p>We did something in connection with the rebranding. You might remember that. We lowered the data roaming tariffs in the Nordic and the Baltic countries quite significantly. I believe that we have now come to a price level that I would say is reasonable. That means that the earlier prices were unreasonable.</p>
          <p>With these reasonable price levels, I think the usage will go up and I actually know it is going up significantly. So, I think it's going to be a good financial decision for us apart from the fact that our customers now can use mobile data even if they are not in their home country and be sure that they don't pay an astronomic amount of money. This week, we extended this offer beyond the Nordic and the Baltics to the European scene. And you can expect us to do even more outside Europe going forward.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons why we did this was, I am like you, quite often in airports. So, standing in the &#x2013; at the gate with three people in front of you and three behind you and hearing all of them saying to each other, don't forget to turn off the roaming. I thought that must be wrong. So, now, we have prices that people won't turn off their roaming. They'll use their telephones and I think we'll make more money out of it.</p>
          <p>This increase of traffic requires us to invest. And I wanted to highlight that we invest quite a bit of money and capital into our networks to ensure our first priority in this company, which is network quality or quality of networks. It includes, of course, buying frequencies. You have to have frequencies and we have been successful in two auctions. We paid a lot of money, but it's worth it because you need a lot of frequency to be able to guarantee good quality networks.</p>
          <p>We continue to roll out the 4G, the new technology. And maybe more important in the short term is the capacity expansions that we do both in Sweden, Norway and Spain because of the growing traffic volumes. We had traffic volumes a year ago growing about 100%. It has gone down a little bit, so maybe it's growing like 50% at this point in time on an annual base.</p>
          <p>And as you also know, we did agree with Telenor to create a joint network in Denmark to ensure we are number three in Denmark &#x2013; they are number two &#x2013; to ensure that we have a real first-class network in Denmark.</p>
          <p>We talked about M&amp;A activities. We always said that our first priority when it comes to M&amp;A is to increase ownership in core holdings. In this quarter, we announced the intention to increase our ownership in Kcell. Very important. Kcell is a significant part of Eurasia. And because we owned via Fintur 51% of Kcell, we didn't even have in effective means more than 50%, we had less, something like 35%. And in this way, we will increase it significantly which I'm very pleased of. It's just sort of the &#x2013; we did the same thing in Uzbekistan before we had Nepal a month ago and now we have Kcell.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you're going to ask me about Turkcell. I think if I try to measure where we are compared to a year ago or two years ago, I think we have made significant progress. We actually have three areas on where we are trying to make progress and it's &#x2013; two areas are legal. It's the damage award we got in Switzerland which, I think, was significant. The other one, of course, is our agreement with Altimo to cooperate. They have their fight with Cukurova and lately they won their second round and it's now appealed and will go to privy council in London. That's going to be the final decision. So, I think we're making progress there.</p>
          <p>Something happened in connection with the EGM or actually the evening before the EGM. The Turkish authorities announced a decree that says all the biggest 30 companies in Turkey &#x2013; the CMB, the SEC of Turkey, demands that there will be more independent directors on the Board. That's something they have argued with Turkcell for many years, something we have supported for many years. Cukurova has blocked it with the help of the Chairman of the Board. And now it's a decree, a law, which we welcome. And I think that being implemented in the correct way, I think that in itself will take away the deadlock that we have in the Board which would be very good for the Board and maybe more important for the company, I believe.</p>
          <p>Yes. We did not change the outlook after the third quarter, so it remains the same. Before I give the floor to Per-Arne, I have one more picture which for me personally is as important as any of the other pictures because we are on a journey &#x2013; I've talked to you about that many times. We are on a journey to change the culture, the values, the way we do business in TeliaSonera. And many of the decisions we have taken have been tough, tough on employees, tough on management. And we do something called employee commitment score. We ask people in the company how they feel about this company in quite a number of questions. We do that once a year and we had an 85% response rate, which is, I think, very good. 85% of our employees actually answered it and here are the results.</p>
          <p>We have now gone &#x2013; in the four years where we have done this journey, we have gone from below 60% to 74% commitment among our people. I'm extremely proud of this. This also makes me more confident that we will be able to continue to improve this company because the verdict from our employees is we are on the right way, we are doing the right things. They're actually &#x2013; if you study the details, they're saying it goes too slow. So, anyway, I'm very happy about it. Per-Arne?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As Lars said, at the beginning here &#x2013; quarter, which is good, stable and I think that's good in this kind of environment that we're living in today, producing more than 2% in sales growth and also an improved EBITDA margin. This is supported by lower costs. As you know, we have talked about cost efficiency. And we could see now the effect coming here in the third quarter which meant that we were actually down with a half of percentage of our OpEx.</p>
          <p>That also means that if you look at the first nine months, we are now at 2.7% at top line growth. EBITDA is increasing with 5.4%. And cost today of the nine months is increasing with 2.5%, which means that we're now getting a better balance that we described that we should get after the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I made, during the last press conference, three predictions. One of the first was that we will have less impact from FX, and that has actually happened, even though it was a risk to state that, you never know what happens. But you can see right now that the euro exchange rate is now coming closer to what we had at the end of last year and the impact is now roughly at 2%.</p>
          <p>That also shows that we have had an organic growth during the last six or seven quarters in our group, which I think is a strength. And if you look at that, probably more in detail, we usually talk about Spain and Sweden when it comes to mobility, et cetera. But this quarter, I think it's important to note there was about &#x2013; both Estonia and Latvia showed positive growth. I don't know whether this is a sign of recovering the market. We see that GDP is actually growing in these countries. But so far, we haven't seen much of a recovery, but this is, at least, a tendency.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Sweden in mobility, I think it's not only the top line growth that is impressive, also their margin. They are now more than the 47% in EBITDA margin. And that I think is an extremely good performance in this kind of environment.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, also growing, with Kazakhstan 16%, close to 17%. We have seen that Uzbekistan continued to grow, 35%, and Nepal, 106%. Both Kazakhstan and Nepal is well above 15% when it comes to EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>Broadband, still, I would say, a struggle. Sweden is down with 4.8% on top line. You can also see, wholesale is down roughly 9%. What is positive in broadband is that Sweden actually increasing the margin from low 41%, up to above 41%, and we could also see an improvement in wholesale. So, their cost efficiency measurement has also given result.</p>
          <p>And that creates the picture that Lars showed before that. We continue to increase our EBITDA margins for the 12th consecutive quarter. In this quarter, we have especially an improvement from Mobility growing from 30.3%, up to 31.8%. Meanwhile, both broadband and Eurasia is rather flattish compared to previous quarters. I know that I will get the question about the gross margin and it's pretty stable, I would say, according to the way we are measuring. If we sort of calculated backwards, as I'm sure you usually do &#x2013; he's not here today &#x2013; it is a bit of a difference, but that's more connected to FX changes than operational issues.</p>
          <p>I talked about the addressable cost base and that was also the second prediction I made at the last press conference. I said that we need to be pretty flattish during the second half year to reach our outlook and we are now down to 0.4% and we also do change the trend which was growing between 2% to 4% during the last three, four quarters.</p>
          <p>This is basically the effects that we could see from broadband. But also if we take Mobility, they have done a good work on the cost side. They are down roughly 1.3% on the OpEx. Taking away Spain, they're actually down with 5%, so this measurement has actually taken place in reality which I think is very, very good.</p>
          <p>One of the concerns we have is the income from the associated companies. You can see that it's dropping, you can say, dramatically. Biggest impact has actually at Turkcell which &#x2013; with roughly SEK430 million, very much connected to the Belarus. But we see also a downturn in Megafon, where roughly SEK80 million is connected to FX, but the rest, roughly SEK150 million to SEK160 million, is connected to lower margins, tougher environment where you have lower ARPUs or revenue per minute and also pressure on price. That hits, of course, our EPS at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>But what we can steer to more on a day to day basis actually improving as you can see here on the EPS side. Operations up with SEK0.07 meanwhile associated is down with SEK0.12. If we take the impact from FX and we take the first nine months, the impact from FX is roughly SEK0.31 which is &#x2013; has a great impact on the EPS at the end of the day. It's less evident now in this quarter and hopefully also even less evident in the fourth quarter this year.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest, as Lars said, 13.6% in CapEx to sales. And I think it's good that with this year has been more even distribution of the CapEx. So, we are slightly above what we were last year, but we have been working more, I will say, consequently during the year with the investments that we have. As we also said, or described, we also bought license during the last couple of weeks in Sweden, 1800 megahertz where we paid SEK920 million. This is not included in these figures. This will be booked in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Cash flow is always key, especially in these times. And we had a strong cash flow. Basically, based on tax paid compared to last year at the third quarter, we had a major payment in taxes. Now, we're coming back to most of the normality and that generated a cash flow of SEK5.1 billion in the third quarter. That also means that our net debt is going down slightly from 1.87 to 1.80. And I predict that this will continue to also go down during the year.</p>
          <p>The third prediction I actually made also was we should have a strong cash flow which you could also see on the last or the previous picture.</p>
          <p>Debt maturity schedule is also important. We have during the coming three years a rather decent amount to refund. But next year will be a little bit tougher with the SEK10 billion, then we have SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion in the coming years. And I'm very pleased with this maturity schedule because this will not put us under any pressure when it comes to refunding ourselves in the market.</p>
          <p>And we actually went out &#x2013; was it two or three weeks ago and catch &#x20AC;500 billion bond where we paid for &#x2013; I think [4.30%] only for ten-and-a-half years which is a very, very good pricing for long money. And you could also see that we tried to get longer out on this curve and we actually have also invested in a 20 years bond in Germany.</p>
          <p>For some comments about the pension funds and our pension obligations in the newspaper a couple of weeks ago, I think sometimes you mix this up with an enormous life company. I would say, as a company, we are very pleased to have dedicated cash for our pension obligations. And even though we might have a slight deficit, this is a long-term obligation that we're talking about, roughly 15 to 20 years. So, I do not see this as a problem, rather as a very good thing for a company our size to have dedicated cash for our obligations. So, do not mix this up with the normal life company that might have problem today with lower interest rates and so on. This is important for us to have this in our books.</p>
          <p>Finally, from the last third quarter, we continue to grow in local currencies, Eurasia, Spain and Sweden continues. EBITDA margin continues to improve for the 12th consecutive quarter. We have a decline in our cost base as we have said before. And we have a strong cash flow generation which means that we keep within the range from our target, our net debt to EBITDA. And that also means that given the performance today, we could also keep our outlook for 2011. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Per-Arne, and I also invite Lars back to the podium. And we will start with a couple of questions and we'll see if there are anyone here and we have a microphone hopefully and we give the microphone to Stefan.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Stefan Gauffin, Nordea. First of all, I would like to start with the claim from Cukurova. I also noticed that you'd receive some cash from Altimo in the fourth quarter, SEK100 million. Regarding the claim of US$932 million, how can you like get your hands on that kind of money? And secondly, if successful, is there any sharing agreement with Altimo relating to that cash? Secondly, moving into the operations, I noticed there was an increased churn in the mobile operations and some subscriber losses in several markets. Are there any quarterly specific items to be aware of? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, whether we get hold of the cash or not, I don't want to speculate all night. I think it's a strong point that we got this award from the International Chamber of Commerce. I think it will help us. Our main objective is to break up the deadlock in the Board of Turkcell, ensure that we get good governance in Turkcell and that the Turkcell starts performing. And I think this award can help us reach those objectives.</p>
          <p>And I haven't comment much on the agreement with Altimo. And I don't intend to start doing that, but it is true that we got $100 million a couple of weeks ago. We have an agreement with Altimo where the objective is for them and us exactly what I said, we need to have a functioning Board for these companies. It's a great company; it just needs to start performing. That's the objective. And we have an absolute deadlock.</p>
          <p>As part of that agreement, there are certain milestones being met and there are payments going between us. I think about two years ago, we received a $50 million payment from them for a certain milestone and we've received now $100 million from them for a certain milestone. And there are further milestones agreed upon that could actually generate more payments. We'll see.</p>
          <p>I really don't think the payments are that important. What is important is to get this company Board deadlock broken up and get this company to perform again. You can see how much effect it has. When they do a devaluation in Belarus and that's not working in Ukraine, you see what that means for us on our EPS. That's my concern. And whether I get X or Y dollar from this award is less important to me, much more important is that the company starts performing again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the churn rate. If you take Sweden, for example, they still keep a very, very low level of 15%, which I think is impressive. Then we have seen Norway, we have seen Denmark that has sort of changed with 4% or 5% yields, and I don't know whether you would like to comment on that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some specific clearing out of inactive subscribers going &#x2013; for instance, in Lithuania, I think it's 180,000. There are some small items in Finland as well. So, there are some inactive subscribers being taken out of the operational data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question from Thomas at the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thomas Heath with Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on Sweden Mobile saw a fantastic EBITDA margin. How much would you say this links to the growth development in Sweden Mobile? The Swedish market is pretty outstanding. If we see a little slower growth ahead, how do you expect margins to develop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have predicted that the growth will decline now for 15 quarters or something. And I've been wrong every quarter which my colleagues are very pleased that I'm wrong. I sort of &#x2013; if I'm wrong, I'd like to be wrong that way. So, I will be very cautious saying there the growth will slow down in Sweden. I think the mobile data clearly is the driver of it. But we don't see the decline in the voice traffic to the same extent or if you compare some other markets. So, in general terms, the Swedish market is a very sound market for all the operators. We are clearly number one.</p>
          <p>Volume is the key to everything in our industry. And being number one, you are clearly helped. If you look at the EBITDA margin we have compared to the other three, we are way ahead of them. But because it's &#x2013; we have the volume. It's the same thing in Denmark, just the other way around. We are number three in Denmark and our margin is something like 15%, 16%, 17%. Kenneth Karlberg once told me that the EBITDA margin equals in percent, equal yours market share in percent, and I think he's right about that.</p>
          <p>So, if the &#x2013; your question was, if the growth rate goes down, of course, the EBITDA margin will come under pressure. I don't see &#x2013; I don't foresee a dramatic change of the margin, but it will come under pressure. That's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what I think is specific also in this quarter is that the 47% is pretty high. You could only keep that over time, but the combination of good cost control, lower OpEx and not so much &#x2013; the increase is not so much depending on equipment sales, very, very minor part of that, so that also helps the margin upwards, so it helps the margin upwards. So, if these fundamental things are changed, the volume will also change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, if I &#x2013; thanks for that, very clear. On Finland, on broadband services, you note in the report that the cost cuts aren't quite enough to compensate falling gross margins. Do you see a need to sort of do something a bit more dramatic? It's been a little volatile, the margin in broadband services Finland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we need to do something dramatic. You remember, we did something dramatic in 2008, 2009 timeframe. I was pretty new and we really had to, in one shot, get the cost down and we took down 20% of the people in Sweden, for instance. I said after that, I don't think we're going to have those kind of programs anymore, but management needs &#x2013; in this journey we are on, are we changing the behavior? We have to be cost conscious every day, and I think that starts to work.</p>
          <p>That's what we're seeing now. And certainly, in broadband, and they have two challenges: They have to be cost-conscious everyday, which I think they are. Then you have a technology shift in broadband, which is an enormous challenge. We're going from analog to digital technology. So, we have too much skills of analog and we have not enough skills in digital. So, Malin Frenning is challenged with two things at the same time. That's why that job is so complicated.</p>
          <p>But there's no discussion to me that the cost has to continue to come down. It has to come down much more now. Actually the cost in digital side has to go up most probably, but the total cost has to come down. So, it's really a complicated and challenging management job.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we gave them some credit for that because the addressable cost base was actually down 7% in the quarter. Lena, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lena &#xD6;sterberg, Carnegie. First of all, a question on your revenue guidance. You've maintained the guidance at 3% and your 2.7% for the first nine months, but I think in the quarter you're at 2.4%. So, you say around 3%, but what's the flexibility if you're coming at 2.5% for the full year? Is that still 3%? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then I was also wondering on the roaming agreements, the data roaming in Europe, is there just specific operators that you have sort of mutual contracts with or how does that work or what will the financial impact be for you for lowering the charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the last one, which I think is more important or more interesting maybe, yes, we do negotiate with other operators. And I think there is &#x2013; this issue has finally, finally become a little bit of an hot issue in the industry and I'm very pleased with that because I think this industry has made &#x2013; I think it's a major mistake that for so long have had these kind of prices. And I think it works against the industry, not only the perception of the industry, but actually it's not a good business decision. I was alluding to it before when I made my presentation.</p>
          <p>People turn off their roaming when they leave, leave our land. And we are in the business of them turning it on, not turning it off. If you have a 95% gross margin on zero, it's still zero, right? So, I like people to use their phones, but they don't do that if the prices is sky high. We all read about these articles about family going skiing in Switzerland, kids talking to each other in the ski slope, coming home, SEK10,000 is the bill, right? And I think the industry has made a mistake not addressing this before.</p>
          <p>Now, we're addressing it and some of our colleagues close by is addressing it. And I think the whole industry will have to address it. So, when we sit and talk to those other operators, there is a willingness to help by lowering their prices. And, of course, we are lowering our margins to get the business going.</p>
          <p>And I am convinced that this will have a positive impact. Now, first year maybe it will have a negative impact. If you look at what happened in the Nordic and the Baltic, H&#xE5;kan Dahlstr&#xF6;m thought it would be this much loss, not significant for you to bother about, but for me to notice. And is less now than we've predicted. The loss is less. And if you guys go on growing this volume by the 100% for a couple of quarters and we have no loss.</p>
          <p>So, on the growth &#x2013; on the forecasting, do you want to talk that through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I could take it. 2.7% is still around 3%. When you go down to 2.5%, then I may sort of &#x2013; you could assess whether it is. But we are talking about tenths about a percent. We're talking about 20 million for each tenths. So, it's a very, very small amount we're talking about. That won't really change the picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will come back to the floor. We have a number of questions on the conference call. So, please, operator, can I have the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from Andy Parnis from UBS. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys. This is Andy Parnis at UBS, just two questions. First of all, in Spain, I just wondered what's your outlook, I guess, over the next 12 months for Spanish subs growth and margin? Should we continue to expect margin to be low single digits or mid-single digits, whilst you're going for 200,000 subs growth quarter, or is that subs growth likely to slow and margin improve? And then, secondly, in Kazakhstan, I just wondered what impact have you seen from Tele2's entry in Kazakhstan? And are we likely to see sort of a slowing growth or loss of share there as Tele2 builds up its position? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with Spain. Spain has historically had high price levels, significantly higher than, for instance, in the Swedish market. Those price levels are coming down, very much thanks to Yoigo. We started as a price fighter, remembering having a higher price in Spain actually as a price fighter than we get in Sweden.</p>
          <p>Now, the competitors or the incumbents, they have responded by lowering their prices. So, I think, the general trend is to lower prices. We believe that we will continue to grow and, as I said before in another answer, this is a volume business. If you can increase your volume, you will improve your bottom line.</p>
          <p>So, I think, Spain will be a tougher market for all the people who is in that market, including Yoigo. But I think we are well positioned with the brand and the perception of the brand, what we stand for. And therefore, we think we will continue to grow the business, which will improve the results.</p>
          <p>In Kazakhstan, I wouldn't say we have seen results of &#x2013; there is, of course, higher competition. Instead of having two players, we now have three players. Tele2 is a good company and I respect them. I think that we are, with Kcell, positioned as the number one, the premium brand with a very good quality. It's a huge country, geographically. We have a great coverage.</p>
          <p>The mobile data will come with a 3G license being issued a couple of months ago. I'm very confident about our position in Kazakhstan. But, of course, with three players instead of two players there is more competition. But, my god, we are four players in the Swedish market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you see, you probably saw, Andy, that we had a similar growth in the third quarter as we had in the second quarter and they had a strong subscriber intake as we saw this morning, but so did we. I think that we passed 10 million subscribers in the third quarter in Kazakhstan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Laurie Fitzjohn-Sykes from Citi. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Laurie Fitzjohn form Citi. Two questions, first on Sweden Mobile. It looks like your service revenue growth accelerated up to -towards 8% if take off <mark type="indiscernible" /> subs and offsetting slightly lower handset sales from the lack of an iPhone launch. Is this growth in service revenue underlying? And if so, what would be driving it?</p>
          <p>And, then secondly, maybe more of a general question on Turkcell. I know you can't get into details but one thing that's come up and quite apparent through their processes is the strong local support that Cukurova has. And I wondered, longer term, do you have any concerns about owning it, having a stake in this asset without a local partner? I mean, in some countries, I know a local partner is important, do you think that is important in Turkey? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I start with Turkcell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, yes, it's true that we normally have or quite often have a local partner and I don't think it's the same necessity in Turkey as we have been for such a long time in Turkey and have relationships by ourselves. I wouldn't rule it out, but you can't have a partner with you are fighting with that is blocking everything you want to do. So, in that sense, it's non-discussion. And, as I said before in an answer, our primary objective is to resolve the deadlock in the board, get proper governance into this company and get the management back to performing and generating profits and dividends for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to Sweden, I mean, the service revenue, yes, I mean, it's mobile data is close to 40%. You have voice also steadily growing with I think 2% quarter-on-quarter. And, as I said before, equipment sales is very marginal. I mean, if we are growing with, I don't know SEK250 million, SEK20 million is equipment and the rest is more like other services, very much based on the data growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. The small increase that you said came in the third quarter, Laurie, is correct as Per-Arne said, it came from increased mobile data actually and voice, similar growth as in previous quarter. So, hopefully, it was increased usage on roaming that drove that increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'd be good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we take one question more from the conference call before handing back to the floor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jakob Bluestone from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, I've got a couple of questions actually. Firstly, on Turkcell, you said in your opening remarks that you believe the introduction of the decree for more independent directors will end the deadlock. Does that mean you believe we're close to seeing a resumption of dividends at Turkcell?</p>
          <p>And, then secondly, just in terms of the cash that you received from Altimo, you said there might be more such payments assuming you hit certain milestones. Could you give us a ballpark of how much more money you stand to receive assuming you hit those milestones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last questions, I can't even if I wanted to, because there are different levels. And I don't want to speculate what milestone, how do we meet it and so on and what is the result.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I think the issue on the dividend in Turkcell has to do with the fact that we have asked in the annual shareholder meeting to &#x2013; as the biggest shareholder, we've asked for a discussion and then a decision on who sits on this board. I think that's a very normal request from the biggest shareholder.</p>
          <p>That has been blocked by the Chairman together with Cukurova and we have responded by saying, as long as you don't treat the annual shareholder meeting in what we call a legal way, we will not participate in that meeting. And therefore, we're not going to vote on dividend either. Now, if you speculate in the fact that we would get the deadlock resolved and that new Board would behave in line with the laws, of course, we will vote for all items on an AGM, including the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just for my understanding, so the proposal from the government now is something you would consider sufficient for resumption of dividends, is that a fair characterization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I said, if we break the deadlock in the board, and the board accepts that the shareholders have the right to discuss who sits on the board, and have the right to decide who sits on the board, then you have a legal annual shareholder meeting and, in such, we will certainly participate. And we will vote on all issues, including the dividend. I do think if we could get three independent members to the board, that will automatically break the deadlock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We go over to the floor with a couple of follow-up questions. We have Stefan here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Stefan Gauffin again, Nordea. I just want to follow up on the question on Spain. You have guided for a cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter. Regarding the EBITDA breakeven, Lars was quite clear that once you've reached EBITDA breakeven, you will not go under any quarter. Would you say the same rules apply for the cash flow breakeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't thought about that, so it depends. I could imagine you want to make some investments in quarter one, two after you make the breakeven and we take a decision we want to grow the capacity. I mean, in Spain, we make &#x2013; it's very favorable financially to us, the more that traffic goes in our own net. And so, if we would decide for medium-term financial reasons to expand our own network in Spain and, therefore, take down the cash flow to a negative number in one quarter...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... it could happen. So, that wouldn't be as black and white on the cash flow as I am on the EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Take a follow up also from Lena.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was wondering, the last financial crisis, you experienced some difficulties of refinancing because the whole capital markets froze and you decided to take a more cautious view on your dividends. Given that you've now paid out a generous sum to shareholders and your gearing is up by 1.8 times, you said currently you're not seeing any constraints due to refinancing but that could potentially happen given what we see in the markets. Should we assume that you take a more cautious view on dividends now again or how should we view your sort of view on the gearing and the shareholder remuneration for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, that we keep to what we have said when it comes to shareholders remuneration that if we see that we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders. At the same time, we have said that we should have a gearing between 1.5 and 2. And it was when we went below the 1.5, we started to talk about the repatriating cash to shareholders. So, I think that's the one thing we have to look at.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we should always be cautious in these times when you don't know whether you have access to markets. The most important thing when you look at future dividends and extra dividends is what kind of refunding needs you have the coming years and that was one of the major reasons why we made this buyback program for 2010, now executed in 2011. So, I think we stick to our policy that we have had but, of course, we should be cautious in these markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if you want to hear the other side of the coin, I think we've also said for a couple of years that we want to improve our yield and be more competitive, which we have done and, I think, we both think that's also important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this is a discussion and weighing the pros and the cons. And there are pros and cons. There are both a wish to maintain a good attractive yield and being cautious and making sure that we have the funds available to us. And this discussion changes what happens in the world; we can't control that, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be back in Q4 with that. We have a question also from Lars before going on to the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Lars S&#xF6;derfjel with &#xC5;landsbanken. And Lars you mentioned that Denmark here in your comments. And I think we all agree that it's a scale problem there. Building market share again, it is a quite lengthy process, so what other actions can you take to offset &#x2013; you had mentioned the network sharing agreement with Telenor to get the costs down. Are there any other actions you can take in the medium term to improve the profitability in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so. And I H&#xE5;kan Dahlstr&#xF6;m in Denmark, myself, Per-Arne and some other people, we are having a discussion. What are we going to do? Are we just going to do more of the same? It hasn't worked for the past five years, so I think we have to do something different. And I'm not going to stand here and tell you what it is, because I don't know, yet. I might have a hunch what I think it's going to be, but Denmark is an important market, so let's not get that wrong now. It's our home market. But the profitability levels are not acceptable. And we have to find a solution to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me restate a little bit. Given the current volumes, given the current subscriber base, what kind type of EBITDA margin would you consider to be acceptable or reachable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't thought about it in the last couple of quarters because we're having this fundamental strategic discussion, what position do we have, what would you want to have, how are we going to &#x2013; how does that company look like, et cetera. But I do remember three years ago, four years ago, when I came in here, I said, you've got to be at least a 25%, right? And we all said, yes we should be 25%, and now we are at 16%, so we have a problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Denmark is also a bit different when it comes to the contractual lengths, you are still allowed to have six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So, I mean, the point is that the whole market has to lower volume but we are at a lower range of that, and that we need to change.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one question for me on Swedish broadband. We didn't see the size of improvement in EBITDA margin that we had expected following the second quarter head count cuts and given you took all the costs for those in the second quarter. Why was this? And should we expect margin improvement acceleration into Q4? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had, during the third quarter, some extra costs for fault handling, and that sort of took down the cost decrease that you should have expected, so this explains, pretty much, I would say, lack of impact from the cost side. It's still a good impact, but perhaps not as much as we would have expected.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

The pricing for the 1.8 auction appeared relatively high compared to auctions elsewhere in Europe of around &#x20AC;0.25. Why do you think this was the case? Was it predominantly to avoid the cost and disruption of transitioning customers onto a different frequency band?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just a bit more of a follow up on Spain. In Q3, the revenue trends still appeared strong. But can you just give us a bit more color on why EBITDA came in significantly below consensus expectations? And also, do you see any signs for any price cuts at Yoigo to preserve your low-end brand position, given the price moves over the summer by your competitors? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the first question, yes, I agree. I think we all agree with you that the prices came in higher than we expected. And I don't want to speculate why, but they did. And I think as &#x2013; if I speak on behalf of the industry, we have to watch out and, I think, the authorities needs to watch out. We all remember what happened 10, 12 years ago when those license costs skyrocketed and brought nearly down the whole industry. We are not even close to that now. But yes, they were a bit higher than we had anticipated. Having said that, I'm very pleased that we got those five slots because it ensures that Telia, the brand Telia in Sweden, can continue to deliver a network quality second to none.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the question on Spain and the margin. Two reason why it deviated, I think, versus consensus, Terence. One is that competition has intensified in Spain during the summer and after the summer. And you can see that from our churn rate going up to 35% from 32% last year. So, we still have the same subscriber intake, but it cost us a little bit more money to get those customers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, that you are probably not aware of, the 1,800 license that we bought in Spain, we started to pay a license fee. The annual license fee in Spain for that license is &#x20AC;18 million. So, we paid roughly &#x20AC;3 million in the quarter for that. That is probably something that you didn't capture before the result. You had a question also if we're going to lower the prices to follow competition. I don't know if you want to comment on that, Lars, in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have to ask the guys who run the business in Spain. I don't know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terence. We go on to the next question operator please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Ulrich Rathe from the Jefferies. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. On Finnish fixed, Finnish broadband, Lars, you sort of mentioned that you believe there's nothing dramatic needed given current trends. So, does this mean that sort of the mid 20s margin is sort of the right margin? You're content with that at those levels roughly?</p>
          <p>Second question, vis-&#xE0;-vis these milestones in Turkey, obviously there &#x2013; you have said several times you don't want to comment on details but can you give us just a general sense what nature these milestones are? What sort of criteria are they related to it if you don't want to get into the details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is details. I'm sorry, I won't comment on that. I understand your question and I understand your curiosity. But I have said as much as I want to say. I think, I might even just create more confusion if I said more, because it's a complex agreement. And I'm happy with the agreement and I'm happy with so far of what we have achieved. But I won't say anything more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to broadband in Finland, I don't think that we would sort of speculate what is the future margin there. The most important thing is that you have a balanced approach between costs and also the top line and we're working with both things right now. And what, at the end of the day, what would be the margin remains to be seen.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. I have three questions, please. If I may return to Turkcell, Lars, your comments about the CMB's decision. Do you, at this point, have any understanding as to how the three so-called independent board members would be appointed and by whom? And secondly, at the Investor Day this summer, you announced the establishment of the new common network operation center for the Nordic Baltic countries to be established by year-end.</p>
          <p>We haven't heard much about it since. Is there anything you can share with us on your progress; is this good or bad? And thirdly, when do you think you'll be prepared to give us some more information on the network sharing agreement in Denmark? I'm thinking technical side and also the financial benefits you would expect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the last one, I think H&#xE5;kan Dahlstr&#xF6;m said when we announced it that we weren't looking for financial improvements out of this in terms of historical data. We were really looking to share future investments, maintaining the level we have today and not increasing the burden. To have a network with the quality that TeliaSonera always insists on, we would have to invest significant amount of money going forward in Denmark and by sharing it, that significant money is half, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's really not making a lot of savings, OpEx savings, but ensuring we have the right quality in the network also in Denmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Network operating center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the NOC. The NOC is just the first milestone. I think, Peter, the more important question, actually, is, are we making progress in the multimarket operation? And I think that the answer is yes, with a little bit of hesitation because it's so early stage. And the things that we have to do are complicated. It has to do with OSS and BSS technology. It has to do with people, maybe even some legislation. So, that's why I'm a little bit hesitant because I don't think &#x2013; I'm not hesitant because I don't believe we're going to do it, I'm hesitant that I don't have much proof.</p>
          <p>And I know we are all very committed to this. I think this is &#x2013; if it succeeds, which I believe it will, it will be the first time in the industry that we actually are taking synergies cross-border. It doesn't happen very easily in this industry, for maybe good reasons. And we're going to prove it's possible. That's what H&#xE5;kan, who is taking the lead but Malin with the broadband is following.</p>
          <p>So, I believe you'll have one NOC by the end of the year, but much more important is, what are we going to achieve in the next year in terms of really making sure that we are able to take down costs and improve efficiency, and improve quality of the technical management of our networks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The first question was about the independent in Turkcell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a new law, so you have to wait a little bit for the interpretation of the law. But you asked who is going to appoint directors. For me, that answer is very simple. It is the shareholders who point directors in the board, nobody else. But I do think that the authorities will have some influence on definition of who is independent and who is not. So, that's where I think we stand, but as I said, we need to have a dialogue with the CMB and other shareholders and see how the practical interpretation or implementation of this law, how it looks like.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. My first question is around your language of &#x2013; your views around fighter brands. You suggested this would be a transition that the consumer market faces. Do you expect fighter brand to gain traction in all your markets including your home market ultimately?</p>
          <p>And, then secondly, I've got a very detailed financial question. On slide 22, the free cash flow waterfall shows an increase in dividends from associated companies in the quarter. Which associate paid a dividend this quarter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start with that. It's Lattelecom in the Baltics.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the issue of fighter brands, yes, we have seen a tendency in the last five, six quarters that the growth comes more from the fighter brand than the established brands. I'm not at all convinced that that trend is going to continue. I think it's important that TeliaSonera with our brands that normally are number one or number two, we try to take the premium position with the best quality in the network, world-class customer service combined that with an efficient organization, that's sort of our strategy.</p>
          <p>We have to articulate the value of the premium brand and defend the premium brand. It's absolutely not in our interest that this whole industry goes to fighter brands only. That would be a bad development for us I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just a follow up, in Sweden, you appear to have really defused the power or the impact of this fighter brands. Do you think that that can continue indefinitely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing continues indefinitely, as far as I know. But, I think, we have good management. Erik Sverker runs our mobile business in Sweden and we have Joakim <mark type="indiscernible" /> when he was running the business in Sweden, we're the number one. We should not start price wars. We have to respond to them sometimes but we will not start them if we are number one.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Maurice Patrick from Barclays. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Maurice from Barclays. A couple of questions, first of all on Denmark. Obviously the network sharing deal in place will focus on the cost side, but I wonder what plans you had on the revenue side to turn that around, just like I said, more longer term question on that?</p>
          <p>And then on the roaming points you made earlier, Lars, how much money do you currently make say in the Swedish business from roaming because clearly, offering cheaper roaming can stimulate demand, but obviously it could cannibalize near term what you currently have, so perhaps give us a sense of how much you can make right now as a percentage of revenues on, say, messaging and data? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I try to answer the last one first, but not exactly the way you asked it. 12, 15 years ago, in this country, the price per voice minute was about 10 times higher than it is today. The question is do we make more money now or did we make more money when it was 10 times higher? The answer is we make more money now.</p>
          <p>So, we have reduced the prices by 90% and we make more money now because of volume. This is a volume business. And I am convinced that the traffic volumes will dramatically increase outside of the whole market Sweden for the Swedish customers when they travel if the prices are reasonable instead of being unreasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we go back to Denmark, you asked about what was the revenue pattern. And I think that, as Lars said, we will now be able to invest much more in this market as we could have done on the standalone basis. And that will hopefully give us also more revenue going forward. That is sort of an important part of this, that we could never get the coverage that we get today, together with another player.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Perhaps as a very quick follow up, on the roaming points, presumably one of the barriers to this is on the cost side is as much as you need all your other European partners to play ball if you are to make &#x2013; if you want to cut prices, then of course, the wholesale cost, if others don't cut that, that could, of course, impact the profitability. Do you think you can really influence that, or is it just down to regulation to cut it over time? I'd love your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I've said that in the beginning of this conference, I think the industry is coming together, and not because of regulation, but they are finally &#x2013; the industry is finally coming together realizing this is not a good policy. I believe we have been shooting ourselves in the foot for years having these kinds of prices. And yes, I do think that those operators that we have to negotiate are much more understanding of this argument. But the problem has been as much ourselves and putting margin on top of those prices. So, it's not only the other side, it's also our own responsibility. And therefore, we have decided for this change, and I feel very comfortable that we will make more money after this decision than before.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Three quick questions, if that's okay. The first one is on Finnish Mobile. I know you've churned away some subscribers this quarter. But the current headline numbers seems to suggest that you're losing share in Finnish Mobile. I was just wondering whether you could give me some color on the market developments, whether you are losing share and how you plan to address that.</p>
          <p>Second question is on Spain, and whether you still see yourselves as long-term investors in Spain, or whether it's a market you'd consider exiting at some point in the future. And then the third question is on Kcell. I was just wondering how and who decides on whether the increase in stake is through Fintur or directly through Telia. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the last one, I mean, it's a decision for the Fintur board and the shareholders of Fintur, which is Turkcell. And if they say no, they are not interested, then Telia, certainly will do the investment. So, that's how it works in Fintur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finland, I think that we just have to wait and see when the other guys have reported. So, I think that we did a slight improvement in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, so let's wait with that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>The final question comes from Dominik Klarmann from HSBC. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Just a big picture question on regulation, please. There is this new idea out of Brussels to basically stimulate fiber investments by reducing copper ULLCs. But it appears pretty counterproductive to me but I'm just interested how serious you take that threat and if it influences your ongoing fiber rollout at all? And maybe just in more general terms, how you sense the EU Commission is thinking about fiber regulation today and if that has changed over say the last six months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have spent some time in Brussels together with colleagues, not only telecom operators, but also telecom equipment suppliers and content providers under the chairmanship of Neelie Kroes, we had two meetings. My perception of the commission is that they are really anxious to put good telecommunications services to the EU people, and that will require a lot of fiber investments. And the investments are huge.</p>
          <p>And I think there is an understanding in Brussels that if that is supposed to be financed by private companies, there got to be an acceptable investment environment for those investments, otherwise there won't be any private money. And I don't think EU is in a position to finance this whole fiber rollout.</p>
          <p>So, I have some expectations actually that it will be an interesting or at least an acceptable environment in which we can invest. That's how I feel about the fiber investment in Sweden. It is an acceptable environment. It's not totally stable, but it is at least acceptable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you think this idea of reducing copper ULLCs is rather unlikely to materialize?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
