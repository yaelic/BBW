        <plist>
          <p>So I will start during the next 15, 30 minutes to explain to you what is our vision about the company, where we think we are and especially what we have to do for the future, to start. And after that, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will explain all the figures.</p>
          <p>To start, I will start with what we call the main step change for the company. For the first time, the sales are above &#x20AC;20 billion. I said for the first time because it's true that the last 15 years, because the growth, but because we divest a lot of businesses, for the first time, we go across &#x20AC;20 billion.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow, we achieved the target we fixed in 2009, above &#x20AC;2 billion. The sales in what we call the growth markets, more than 60%, and you will see in the following presentation where we were a few years ago.</p>
          <p>And another very important items for us, or KPI for us, is CO2 impact, minus 35%. We achieved the target we fixed with the company. And you will see that doing this, we also improved the quality of the business and the efficiency of our businesses.</p>
          <p>If I look at the first element, the &#x20AC;20 billion, as you can see, how do we deliver this? I put on the right side of the charts a lot of brands. The main important thing is we are not looking to just European brands, or French brand, or Spanish brand, or the historical brand of the company. You'll start to see new brands like Mizone, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:55) from Russia, Oikos, Cow &amp; Gate in the UK. So all the main brand of the company are participating to the evolution of our net sales, which is the best balance we can imagine, even in water because we put Evian for sure, but you have also Bonafont. And as you know, we rolled out Bonafont from Mexico to Brazil to Poland and the success of Bonafont in Brazil is a really good one. That's the reason why we think we will continue now to grow the net sales with our main brands.</p>
          <p>The cash flow, the good news for us is, yes, we reached the objective to 2088. In the same time, we continued to spend CapEx, spend to invest CapEx, because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:53) follow the growth we have and to continue to build the new countries, we have to have a very sustainable CapEx policy. In the same times, as you can see, we present there some acquisition which help us also to continue to deliver the efficient growth of the campaign.</p>
          <p>The next one is a very important one. So everybody can be very happy about this because it's very fashionable to say that everything is doing very well because of the emerging country. We grow double digit. And if you really look at how do we grow in the emerging country, you will see that Danone is one of the most performing company in the emerging country. So we are really growing double digit, but not 10%, above.</p>
          <p>For me, the important thing to understand, and we will see that in the following presentation, is it's not because we grow outside of Europe, which represents now more than 30%, that we don't have to take care of Europe because nobody knows. I don't want to be the nasty guy, but I'm doing this job in now 20 years. So, okay, Europe is in trouble. The emerging country are booming. Nobody knows what will be the situation within 10 years, or within 15 years, or perhaps within five years and going back up within six year, I don't know, because this country present also some difficulties, could be politic, could be currency, could be &#x2013; I don't know, the evolution of the raw material in this country. So we have to be careful to continue to work both side, not only commenting the evolution of the emerging country just to be the best in class. We have also to consider the global company.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it's a fact that now this company, the Danone company, deliver more than two-third of the turnover of the net sales in the emerging country. And we are lucky because within this emerging country, two of them, and especially one of them, is a very stable one and a very rich one, the U.S. And I will present to you how do we deliver the result in the U.S.</p>
          <p>For us, it's an emerging country with perhaps less risk than the classic one. But for us, it's an emerging one. We grew double-digit. The buying power is very strong and the evolution is good. And you will see some good news also on the market, on the dairy one.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at the right side of the chart, it's just incredible. Germany is no more there. Brazil took the place. If you look at the ranking, France is still number two. And we are lucky because within Europe, France is a country where we are delivering the best results. Spain is now number five. So it's a total different model for us. And if you look at the curve on the left side, I don't know if that will continue with the same speed. I don't know, but it's clear that whatever we think about the company, we can also say we do nothing in Europe but time after, it's like the snowball. The emerging snowball is going very fast, bigger and bigger year after year. We improved the margin, we improved the sales, and the snowball of Europe is going lighter and lighter, even doing nothing. This company will reinforce the model within the next four or five years. But on top, we are going to do things in Europe.</p>
          <p>The CO2, just to show you that even if you are taking care of environmental issue or even social issue, it's not because it's nice, it's because we are convinced it's impacted positively the results, even the financial results of the company, when we decide to achieve the minus 30% CO2 impact. For example, we have to reduce the weight of the PET of our plastic bottle. Doing this, we save money.</p>
          <p>When you look at what happened with the <mark type="ph" /> meat (8:25) in France and everybody talking about proximity, when the main, the center of the strategy of our basic plain yoghurt in France is the milk of our farmer, it's because on the environmental issue, also social, because we want to pay the right price to the farmer. But you can see that now, the actuality, what you see in different market, it's becoming as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:54) to claim the milk of our farmer. So that's the reason why we present to you also the results, even if you can't consider it's something apart for us. It's totally part, in the center of our strategy.</p>
          <p>So, the 60/40 sales of Danone Group, I am not going to explain. You can read. Nothing to explain. On the left, 60% and you see &#x20AC;12.5 billion sales growing 12.4%, and that will accelerate. On the margin, something I explained since now, 20 years, we are where we planned to be, means we grow faster in a country where the margin is growing faster too and one where the margin of the emerging are going to be above the mature markets. So we will have this famous double-positive click effect, growing faster with better margin.</p>
          <p>And you have the figures, nothing more to comment. 80 basis points improving the margin. And I remember all the equation I got from the emerging &#x2013; from you saying, do you think you can improve the margin in the emerging? Yes, because basically we achieve a critical size and we are talking about the country we started in 10 years ago. But as you know, we opened new countries and these new countries we will roll out exactly the same strategy than the one which are delivering this result today.</p>
          <p>It's not the end game. For me it's the beginning of the new story. And on the other side, yes, 40%, and you see also the result, like-for-like minus 3% top line and 190 basis points like-for-like margin less. But we deal with this, and the wrong thing will be to focus on the left, on the green, and just milking the blue. And we are going to restate the blue, and I will explain that to you. Obviously, the idea is not to have them to switch from minus 3 to plus 10. Forget this. But you will see an example in the water business. When you fix Europe, you grow 10%. That's the leverage we are running after and it's exactly what we are going to explain.</p>
          <p>The result of this equation, sales plus 5.4%, so we can say we are in trouble in Spain. At the end of the day, the Danone model still deliver 5.4%. Is it good? Is it as we said in our jargon, our language, is it an empty glass or full glass? It's a full glass for us. It's a full glass. We still have a huge opportunity on the green side, but we are going to fix the blue one. How long? We'll see. Not tomorrow. But anyway, the snowball of the green one is running much more faster so we are protect and you have the result plus 5.4% whatever the difficult of Europe.</p>
          <p>Margin, yes, we missed. We make the profit warning and I remember you that we did it just to protect the green side. We don't want to push up the price in China just to deliver margin in Europe. No, no, no. Otherwise, we will kill China and one day we will be in trouble. So we have to fix Europe with Europe solution and continue to deliver and to push as fast as we can the emerging country.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow, as I said, we achieved the target. For me, the result of 2012, a positive, definitively positive. So the green part, the one you like. Me, too. I will not comment again this because I did it. But just to explain to you with some example. The fresh dairy U.S. On the left, you have the full range of Danone including Stonyfield because when you are talking to the U.S. you have to look at the fresh dairy division, not only brands or certain brand.</p>
          <p>So when you look at all our brands and the translation in the middle in term of market share, for the first time we are leading the category with a 31.9% market share. The second player, 27.2%. That's the first time of our life since 15 years, we are at the base neck-to-neck or just below, and the reason why is because the competitor number one didn't react as we react on the Greek segment.</p>
          <p>Okay, we are wrong. Okay, I was telling &#x2013; I can't translate that in English. Upset that I want to say more in French about this situation. But it's a fact that the team find a way, not only the U.S. team, the way we decide to invest, the way we decide to react, and you have the results in the bottom, in the middle, Danone Greek, 9.4%, in the segment which is now between 30% and 40%. And you will see the position on the Greek segment on the next chart.</p>
          <p>Oikos, we multiplied by 2.2. And the main important thing you have to understand, the main one, not the market share, not the reserve. The one here, category advisor. We are now covering more than 32% of the retail as a category advisor because the only thing we have to deal with in the U.S. is to expand the shelf. Otherwise, when you look at Activia declining not because Activia is declining, just because they need space to least the Greek who they put out Activia because there is no maturity in the market but we have a good news on that subject.</p>
          <p>The good news is the title of this chart, forget yoghurt, forget the category. For the first time of our life, we have a food product called yoghurt called Greek yoghurt, which is fitting with what the American consumers are eating. I even don't want to say diet because diet in French means something else. It's too restrictive.</p>
          <p>For the first time, the yoghurt category called Greek, which is no more specialty, which is now a category is fitting with what the U.S. consumer expect as a food because of the protein, because of the history of their diet. And that's the reason why this segment is now more than around 40%, more than 30%, and it's moving every week.</p>
          <p>And you have there, the blue line, vertical blue, which is the segment, the Greek segment. I'm not sure you have already seen that in every market in every country, but the products, at the first time of my life, I saw that. And now we are very happy to have decide to invest and not to answer to the question about over capacity, price war, all that kind of question. We are there. And if you want to understand why I'm saying it's good news that we have a product fitting with the American diet, because we have a full range of products, we launched the Greek Oikos, and you have the market share. But we launched also Light &amp; Fit Greek. Light &amp; Fit is a very old product in the U.S. diet and it works. It's flying.</p>
          <p>We will launch an Activia Greek. And we know &#x2013; Greek for us means cheese, nothing else, because the technology is a new technology we didn't have. Now, because of this volume we can invest. The product behind the technology we have. Oikos is a Greek yoghurt. We are launching in Europe, Danio in the UK, in some other country, even if we already have, but we are playing the positioning, the protein positioning, the <mark type="ph" /> satiety (17:56) positioning.</p>
          <p>So it's a new segment for us not only in the U.S., not fighting with the existing product. Greek in Europe means indulgence. It's a lot of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:10).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of fats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of fat. In the U.S., 90%, 99% of the Greek segment is zero-percent fat, which is totally different from Europe, but we launch. And we can see the different &#x2013; the result of this.</p>
          <p>Russia. Russia, we are on track. We are delivering exactly what we promised and exactly what our plan was. Means the end of the year, we accelerate because of the relaunch of the big brand of Unimilk. And beside this, we have also good news in the Danone range. Activia and Actimel are really growing in Russia and we can see the result of the relaunch of Prostokvashino, and T&#xEB;ma and Bio Balance, and on my chart, I have plus 8% but I think the plus 8% is 13% or something like this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is a mistake. The plus 8% is plus 13%. When you know that Prostokvashino is the current range of Russia but we changed totally the packaging. We learn the quality. We work on the product basically all across Europe and all across the world. We are working on the quality of the packaging, the product, the texture, the flavor, everything.</p>
          <p>Baby nutrition. A few comments. Just flying because of emerging country. For your information, what we are doing in baby food and you can see how we gain market share on our universe, country universe because we are not everywhere. We have a strategy which is called blue house, the one here, what we call expert and ambitious mums and the red house. We just re-launched the red house in China and I'm sure we will roll out one day in some countries and why not China, the blue house. And the blue house is more, more value, much more value than the red one.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have also beautiful results in China with all the &#x2013; the way we connect to the consumer. Less and less advertising, more and more digital, which is something you will find also on some of the product and also Hong Kong and Internet business. We are not disclosing the figure by the time being but just imagine that the sales for Internet is booming for us in Asia and in China. So not a lot of comment, it's going very well.</p>
          <p>Waters. Not only waters because waters is doing quite well, the waters, H2O, thanks to Evian, thanks to Badoit, thanks to Salvetat, thanks to Bonafont in Brazil. But the best score is delivered by the Aquadrinks strategy where we grew, as you can see, at CAGR 20%. And obviously the margin are better in this product than in the plain water. And if you look at in the room beside, we are going to launch the Pure Aquadrinks in France, in the UK, and it's really a winning story. So we are going to roll out this.</p>
          <p>And you have the reserve of the new steps for us. For example, Aqualene water, they're both 10 billion liter of water Indonesia. In front of big competitor but more &#x2013; it's just a question of water. If we have more water, we can sell more. So more than 10 billion,</p>
          <p>Bonafont is a brand which is now above &#x20AC;500 million turnover following Brazil, Mexico. And Mizone. Mizone, the brand we sell to the Japanese, we sold to the Japanese but we keep it Indonesia and China. It's more than &#x20AC;500 million. And we are launching this small thing you have in the right, a product called Blue because we don't have the Mizone brand for the rest of the world so we launch it in India. And we are testing in the big city. We consider a city as a country and it works.</p>
          <p>So now we have to decide what will be the best road to market, how to roll out country &#x2013; not by the full country but city by city to make the same success in India, we have here for example in China. This is our ambition. Europe, not yet. Just the example, just to help you to dream a little bit that situation of the water division, the only difference with Danone equation, we fix Europe because Europe is, depend the country, between minus 3 plus 3. And Evian is doing well, and you can see the results of the division, which is growing double digit because the main subject we have in Europe are linked to the dairy, not because the dairy is not good, because historically the weight of the dairy in Europe is stronger than in the other division. It's just arithmetic, but that's the equation we fixed since now two or three years in the water division. On top of that, we launched in Europe the Aquadrinks. So we will see an improvement and so on.</p>
          <p>So now I go back to the global equation and I go to the European part. Again, same figures you saw a few minutes ago. First of all and the idea for us is to explain quickly, how do we want to tackle this European situation because we will tackle it. We are not going to sleep waiting better days or better environment as everybody explained to us every day. No, we are going to take care of our situation.</p>
          <p>First of all, like in every country, in every business line to take care of the category. Forget the Danone brand, market share, the private label, no. We are going, it's our job. We have a leading brand. We are going to work for the category. Translation means one yoghurt a day. So we are going to do everything we can do to explain to the consumer, to explain to the stakeholder, to explain to the health community, you eat one yoghurt a day. Just doing this, that will refurbish the category. On top of that, we are working on the nutrition. We are developing an <mark type="ph" /> internal (25:10) health benefit and so on and so on. But this is how to drive the category.</p>
          <p>Second, value for money. I am told that everybody is laughing because we are talking about the key scope and whatever, but it's our job. We are not in the technology. It's our job to make the difference in the shelf. We can't continue just to make productivity by reducing the quality of the pack, by reducing the quality of the mix. We have to invest in a new ferment to get a better texture or we must have &#x2013; I was in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:49) company in Geneva last week to talk about the flavor to get the natural one, how to forget aspartame, how to move in that direction. We must have the best product and the best marketing execution.</p>
          <p>And I have this cup in front of me. Go to the shelf. Look at the old-fashioned cup and look at this cup and you will see the difference. When you know that people are buying product, 60% of them when they are just in front of the shelf. So we have to work on this, and it's exactly what we are going to do. The best product and you have example, the best packaging, again, you have example and the right price point for sure.</p>
          <p>Some product we even don't have to advertise. It's much more important to promote them. It's like an investment if you find the right way to speak to the consumer. And obviously, we still have differentiation and innovation. Some of them are really innovative, some of them are just an example, if you look at the size of our format. In every country, we have a big cup of Activia, a big cup of cheese. Not in France, not in Spain, why? So we are going to benchmark all our best SKUs and to see how we can roll out them, not big innovation. But clearly, we will develop the consumption. And for me, the idea is first of all, grow the volume, second place, the mix, and you will improve the margin. It's a very simple equation. Not so easy to deliver. That will take time. But that's the right track we have to follow.</p>
          <p>Example of this, in Europe, I already speak about the key scope. But just &#x2013; you have the example of Velout&#xE9;. For the French, Velout&#xE9; is a very old-fashioned product. Okay, the mix is less than with Activia, whatever. But I told you, volume, mix, and the margin will follow. Velout&#xE9;, we grow &#x2013; you don't have that on the chart but the growth is 20%. Every week, we grow 20% since we launched.</p>
          <p>Badoit. Badoit is growing plus 7% and Salvetat is growing double-digits. Nobody knows Salvetat. It's a local brand for everybody, but we grew double-digits. It is in volume the biggest sparkling water in France, in volume, not in value. So that's the reason why we think we have to really reinvest in Europe.</p>
          <p>I will not spend a lot of time on this but it's clear that &#x2013; how to connect the consumer directly is a much more important thing. And the next step, I don't know when but very soon will be when people will pay with this, because if they pay with this, we are linked to them directly. We don't have to make a <mark type="ph" /> gondola egg (28:56). We can send directly to one guy or one lady, a promotion directly on the phone which is already working. So the revolution is for tomorrow. The link between the consumer and our self is for tomorrow.</p>
          <p>When you know also that since you have a big consumer, you put one euro on them, you grow the volume. If you are a small consumer, I put one euro on you, you will not move. Means with, like in Spain, even if Spain is declining but we are still &#x2013; still in Spain, we have product growing. If, let's say with 3 million consumer, you reach 60% of the growth. Now, with the new technology, we can really reach these 3 million consumer and they are heavy consumer. We know how to keep them in our portfolio. We know how to build loyalty with them, and that is the future. That's the reason why you saw switch from classic advertising to digital, including promotion, because with the promotion, you recruit this consumer. That's the reason why I said that promotion is not just through the window, but it's really an investment. So we are going to &#x2013; and we have some example a little bit in those.</p>
          <p>With the competitiveness plan in Europe, as everybody announced this morning, yes, we said a few weeks ago we want to save &#x20AC;200 million. How? Honestly, the target for me is not to save &#x20AC;200 million. It's a consequence. But I think t's time for us to readapt the way we work in Europe.</p>
          <p>As we said, we consider that the crisis in Europe will not stop tomorrow. So we can't wait. We have to adapt our self. And you know that when Danone decides to adapt, we adapt because we react very quickly. So we give us two years to readapt our organization, means to simplify. For example, we have 66 CBU. We are going to switch our language to cross CBU, cross country CBU, which is very well known for an Anglo-Saxon company but that it's going to be a little bit different with Danone because we will keep the specificity of each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>If we are talking about brand activation and consumer activation, we will keep the management and the people we need to stay specific for category, because we don't have link between baby food and water and dairy in terms of brand activation and consumer connection. We have some but not a lot. We want to keep this specificity.</p>
          <p>Now, all the function, what we call the function support, we are going to merge. In the same time, we are going to ask less to small countries. Just imagine that in small countries, we have the CODI, which is the <mark type="ph" /> comit&#xE9; de direction (32:05), which is exactly the same than for the big country. So we are going to ask the big country in term of support function to take care of their small brother beside. And that though is the explanation of adapt, simply and at the end, the consequence will be a savings of &#x20AC;200 million. We have more explanation on this chart if you don't understand, but it's exactly what I just explained.</p>
          <p>The conclusion of my presentation, and I try to make it with only one shot, which is this one. 2013, a year of transition, because we need this year to deliver everything I explained. Europe, adapt and fix. And those markets obviously we will accelerate. I'm not saying we will continue. We will accelerate. That mean we ask our people to focus on their profitable top-line growth, which is a model we know perfectly. And 2014, we expect the group will go back to this strong sustainable profitable growth equation. That's the future of Danone.</p>
          <p>And now, I will let Pierre-Andr&#xE9; translate that within figures, because I know you like figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Franck. So I'll run you now through the main financial elements of the year 2012. Starting as we always do with the snapshot summary, on which you can see a few things. The first one is that indeed we have crossed some important milestones this year with sales at more than &#x20AC;20 billion and with a cash flow which is in excess of &#x20AC;2 billion, as we had fixed to our self as a target.</p>
          <p>The second thing you can see is that we have finished the year in line with the expectation, with our expectation principally, in fact, slightly above for a part of the objective. Top line-wise, we end up with 5.4% organic, and I'll come back to that, but this is slightly above what we expected. Margin, minus 50 as we announced back in May of this year. EPS, &#x20AC;3.01, in line with what we expected, and free cash flow is slightly above as we already said. So a year, which globally towards the end has been slightly better than expected.</p>
          <p>If I start with the sales, nothing major on this chart. 8% reported growth is made of forex effect which has been positive by 2.5% driven by the relative weakness of the euro and the strength of other currency, in particular the Chinese yuan. Very little scope effects. And then the more important element is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:22) growth, which is at 5.4%. Well balanced between volume and value at 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter has been more or less in line with what you see for the full year with 7.3% reported of forex effect which is positive close to 2%. And top line growth for Q4 which has been 4.9% with a 3.2% volume which is the highest of the year. I'll come back to that. And 1.7% value effect.</p>
          <p>In fact, when you look at the sequence, the interesting thing is that we end up at 4.9% despite comps which were higher in Q4 last year in particular on water. We'll come back to that. This reflects three different trends. Underlying trends in Europe which have remained very much in line in Q4 with what they were in Q3 with, of course, putting aside of course the question of the comps. Performance in emerging market which remains strong. I'm talking in particular of China, Indonesia, and Brazil.</p>
          <p>And the performance in the CIS and Noram which has been as related as Marc mentioned. We'll see that. But we are close to 10%% for the combination of CIS plus Noram this quarter. Volume value, the good thing is that volumes are growing, regrowing, reaccelerating versus the previous quarters at 3.2%. And the second good news is that this is true for all categories, all businesses, i.e., water <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:16) but also dairy.</p>
          <p>Geographical dynamics. I'm not going to stay on this slide. This is the way we use to present the geographies. For those who were in St. Petersburg, we have introduced a new weather present geographies, which is this one and this is the one we are going to use for now because we believe this is showing a more consistent geography. So showing Europe excluding the CIS or what we could call Western Europe or Continental Europe showing the CIS and Noram together because we believe we are in the same strategy in these two countries, i.e., developing the dairy category, volume and value, investing heavily to do so and trying to improve and build the margin.</p>
          <p>And last region which we have called ALMA for Asia Pacific, LatAm, Middle East and Africa, which is essentially in fact, the emerging markets of the group. What you see on this chart is interesting. So it's on Europe situation which remains under pressure with minus 5. The difference versus Q3 being sorry, essentially in the comps of weather and the trends otherwise remaining very similar.</p>
          <p>CIS plus Noram, you see the acceleration, and in particular, the U.S. have &#x2013; sorry, North America have been crossing the 10% this quarter while CIS is high-single digit. So very much as we expected, but a real acceleration in Q4 and the region ALMA has been still very strong with a 14% top-line growth.</p>
          <p>I'll now go through the performance by division. I'll start with dairy and everything I told you so far really applies to dairy in the sense that we have a 1.3% top-line growth, which is up versus Q3 and this is very much the consequence of Noram and the CIS accelerating while Europe is fundamentally staying with the same trends.</p>
          <p>Volume value reflects this as well. Volume up 0.4%. It's too early to say that they are up for good and for their own ground, but it's clearly a positive sign after seven quarters which had been negative. The value element reflects the fact that we have started using this more, the price-promo element on top of innovation and legally to consumer, the price-promo element in certain countries in Europe and in particular, in Spain.</p>
          <p>So I mean, Franck told you a lot of things are going on in Europe, in the whole world. But in Europe particularly at the moment, we are trying to introduce a lot of things. We have here the KISS cup, which is a new cup if you go <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:30) introduced in France on some SKUs and is going to be extended to the other very soon. Actimel is being introduced with additional flavor and there's going to be many more things coming in particular on the Greek side in Europe in the coming quarters. We obviously continue to innovate as well in emerging markets. And you have examples of that here in Argentina and in Brazil. So that's really for dairy.</p>
          <p>Waters, it's another really good quarter. 8.5%, but the 8.5% has to be seen in the context of a base in Q4 2011 of 23%. So that shows that the performance is indeed very good. It allows water to end up the year with a 10% top line growth, which means that for the second year in a row, they are growing double digits. And I think that's a very good performance which reflects what Franck was mentioning to you, i.e., steady trends in Europe, and at the same time, the emerging <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:37) and in particular Mizone with China and Argentina are really growing very, very strong.</p>
          <p>You see that as well on the volume value equation, volume remains strong and this is very much Aqua, Mizone, and Levite. The price mix remains positive despite the comps in Europe, and thanks to the positive mix, which is induced by the development of the Aquadrinks in all geographies.</p>
          <p>And again, a lot of things keep going on and we keep introducing new products, mainly on the fields of special edition on water, and you see that's on &#x2013; with a new bottle edition made by Diane von Furstenberg. The My First Bottle of Water by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:32) and then, on the Aquadrinks, with new flavors being introduced in France this quarter and the beginning of this year. After the success in the UK, it's been working very well. U.S., an example by the way at &#x2013; for those who are in the room, at the exit of the room.</p>
          <p>Baby nutrition, that's an engine which is growing very steadily, very strongly, very regularly. Another quarter which is very strong, 12.1%, allowing the year to end up at 11.6%. Again, this is as of last year. Another year of double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>The trends remain very much the same, i.e. the milk are leading the pack. The food is a bit weak, in particular in Europe. Meats are growing in all geographies and they are obviously growing faster in geographies &#x2013; in Asia, sorry, with the excellent portion by Franck in China and in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>In fact, in China the renovation of the mix went extremely well over the second half and allowed us to take the first position in terms of market share in this market.</p>
          <p>In this, we grow as well. In this business line as well, we keep innovating. This is true in the food. We are renovating all the range of jars in France with the Bledina food jars and 17 new recipes more adopted we believe to the current trend of conception, less salt in particular and better taste.</p>
          <p>We are as well introducing new ranges in all markets from the &#x2013; on the milk side in &#x2013; yes, in all markets.</p>
          <p>Last, medical nutrition, it is continued self-performance we say so because this is clearly below the performance of last year with Europe at 6% versus 9.4% for 2011. We all know this is very much due with some pressure in Europe, in particular, on the part of the business which is reimbursed. The good news for this quarter is the fact that North America, which was under competitive pressure, is doing better and emerging markets keep doing very well as well, in particular, China, which is developing at an impressive pace.</p>
          <p>And here again, we keep introducing new renovation or innovation. Souvenaid is being introduced very gradually. This has been the case in the Netherlands in Q3, Q4, and this is the case now in the UK. We continue doing it again very gradually.</p>
          <p>So that's very much it for the sales. I'll move to the margin element and the rest of the P&amp;L now. So margins starts with the total margins, which is spread between current items and recurring items or in non-recurring items. Non-recurring items have amounted to &#x20AC;200 million, which correspond for half of it to acquisition, i.e., integration costs on one hand for Unimilk, which are and on the other end some acquisition fees. And the second part of it correspond to some impairment in some businesses, in some small businesses.</p>
          <p>So that gives us margins which goes from 14.72% to 14.18% in terms of trading operating margin. Most of it is of course like-for-like. There's a few element of currencies and scope.</p>
          <p>Now within this, the analysis shows that we had, at the end, 6% inflation on our costs as we expected, which have been partially offset by our productivity, which was up to &#x20AC;589 million. But that was not sufficient to fully offset the increase of our &#x2013; cost inflation of our costs. We decided to go for some price increase, some pricing in some geographies, but not in all of them, which means that part of this difference has been offset by price increase. But there remains a gap of 50 basis points which drives the margin from 14.72% to 14.18%.</p>
          <p>Another way to look at the margin evolution is of course very importantly <mark type="ph" /> this year, (46:18) the geographical one. Again, with the new geographies, you see very much what is happening, i.e. that in Europe, we've been under pressure. All businesses have been under pressure of inflation, which we decided not to translate into pricing, for all of it at least. And on the other end, the deleverage, which has been very steep and which has driven us to decide to target the &#x20AC;200 million cost saving for 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>In the other markets, margins are up in the region ALMA, which is very consistent with what we are trying to do. And of course, the important thing as well is to see that the margins are strongly up in CIS and Noram, which means that we have not only in these countries managed to accelerate the top line and to win the battles which we had to win, but we have also been able to do so while keeping improving the profitability. In particular at Unimilk, for the second year in a row, we have a margin step-up which is in excess of 100 bps and that's been the case as well in the U.S. this year.</p>
          <p>The rest of the P&amp;L shows an improvement of the recurring net income. The topics to be noted are the increase &#x2013; the income tax, I'll come back to it the following slide. Financial expenses are up, fueling a decrease in the non-controlling interest with the buying of some minority in Spain. I'll come back to it as well, and fueling as well the reduction of the number of shares. Non-controlling interest are therefore down, reflecting what I said, plus the fact that the results of Spain are anyway down, not fully compensated by the increase of the results of Russia.</p>
          <p>Taxes have been &#x2013; the tax rate is up, broadly speaking, from 26% to 28%. This is showing tax pressure in different geographies and in particular in France, with the application as soon as in 2012 of the non-deductibility, or the limitation of the deductibility of the interest, which has already &#x2013; which has started impacting us this year. And clearly, we are going toward 30% with the additional taxes which are going to be weighing on us in France from 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>So this drives an EPS which is up by 4%. The number of shares being modestly down since we have positioned the share buyback more towards the second part of the year. And therefore, they will have greater impacts in 2013. So it's going from &#x20AC;2.89 to &#x20AC;3.01, clearly helped by the currency and scope, which represent most of the increase. The organic or underlying increases of one point, which can be analyzed with five points on the top line, minus three on the margins, minus two on the taxes, and plus one for the rest and in particular, for the financial items.</p>
          <p>Cash, we generate in excess of &#x20AC;2 billion this year and you have the waterfall. I'm not going to stay too long on this one. I'm going to switch to the other one, which is more interesting and which shows what Franck said, i.e. we have indeed driven the cash flow from &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2008 to &#x20AC;2.1 billion in 2012. This is a commitment we had and we have delivered it.</p>
          <p>The interesting part to me is that it's been done while keeping investing strongly in our business, because we have maintained our CapEx level between 4.5% and 5%; 4.7% this year. And thanks to a continuous improvement in working capital, in particular in the businesses which were new back in 2008, i.e. Baby, Medical to some extent, and more recently, Unimilk. That gives us the &#x20AC;2 billion. Our objective for 2013 is very much as well to continue delivering &#x20AC;2 billion, obviously ex non-recurring items. I'll come back to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>This cash flow has allowed us to do three things, A, to do some M&amp;A and in particular for last year, to pay for the most of it, for the acquisition of our business, our baby nutrition in India, i.e., <mark type="ph" /> the (51:31) Wockhardt. It's allowed us to pay dividend for &#x20AC;1.2 billion and it's allowed us as well to make some share buyback, &#x20AC;300 million, and to keep deleveraging the company for &#x20AC;342 million.</p>
          <p>This means that the balance sheet remains strong, with a net debt which is ending up at &#x20AC;6.3 billion, down versus last year. And credit metrics which are extremely strong. The other interesting picture in this balance sheet is the fact that the total balance sheet grows very modestly, 26.3% versus 26%, which means that the extension of the means &#x2013; of the capital to grow the business is very much under control.</p>
          <p>Two quick points before I conclude about two the financial decisions. Spain, you remember that we said in June that we had been buying back one of the minority shareholders for &#x2013; sorry, 8.6% of the stake of Spain with an impact &#x2013; net impact on the debt which was &#x20AC;80 million. We have basically reproduced the same with another group of minority shareholders between June and now.</p>
          <p>And therefore, by buying back 9.4% we've gained a net impact on the debt of minus &#x20AC;80 million. So a positive impact on the debt. We have now 75% of Danone Spain with &#x20AC;1.2 billion of remaining minority shareholders. It's more than that in the balance sheet at the end of 2012 because part of that has been done in the first weeks of 2013.</p>
          <p>And for the rest of the balance sheet management, we have completed share buyback. As we had announced back in October for in the month which was between &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;700 million. It has been &#x20AC;639 million since we announced that. So we are very much on track with &#x20AC;700 million we said.</p>
          <p>We are proposing to the board of directors to cancel part of the treasury shares as we are obviously moving on with buying back of shares and we are going to propose to the AGM dividend, which will be with a constant distribution ration, payout ratio of 48% and therefore a dividend of &#x20AC;1.45 per share, which will be paid in cash.</p>
          <p>So that's what I wanted to say to give you in terms of number for 2012. With respect to 2013, Franc gave you the most important part of what we are trying to do. Our priority is to go back to a strong and profitable growth as soon as 2014 a strong and profitable growth, which is going to be driven by two things. The ongoing developments, fast development over categories and brands in the Americas, in Russia, in Africa, in the Middle East and in Asia.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, gradual stabilization of Europe both in terms of sales and in terms of margin. One of the tools to achieve that is going to be the cost saving plan, which aims at reducing our cost by &#x20AC;200 million but also at simplifying our processes in Europe and making us more agile and more able to catch the growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>The first one of the &#x2013; sorry, the organizational part of this plan is being presented this morning. And together with some savings in terms of the trading, make most of the majority of &#x20AC;200 million, it will imply of course some non-recurring costs and we estimate that the total non-recurring elements, including this, are going to be amounting for 2013, &#x20AC;450 million. &#x20AC;450 million. That's the estimation we have.</p>
          <p>For the rest of 2013, for the other elements, we therefore expect sales to be up by at least 5% with the first quarter, sorry, which is going to be more challenging given the comparison base. We expect the operating margin to be down by between 50 basis point, which is very much the trend we had in 2012, and 30 basis points if we take into account the fact that we expect to have some saving from the saving plan coming as soon as the second part of 2012, which will make us go towards minus 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>And last, we expect free cash flow to be still strong, with another year at &#x20AC;2 billion, except of course the cash elements of the non-recurring costs I've just mentioned to you in relation with the cost-saving plan.</p>
          <p>So that's really what I wanted to add, and we have now, I hope, a bit of time to take some questions and try to answer them. We'll start with the room.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Pierre Tegner from Natixis. I have three questions. The first one is considering the below the line items you will probably face in 2013. I ask this question because my feeling is that you have done the job in guiding the market considering organic growth and operating margin evolution of this year.</p>
          <p>But should you take the opportunity to remind as you have made considering taxes and also below the line items we will take this year just to have more of the focus on fundamental and less on EPS? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is on Yakult. You said one year ago during the Q1 that you were discussing with Yakult. I understood that you continue to discuss with the company. So could you give us much more color on where you are now and what you want to do as you change your plan considering your collaboration?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on U.S. Could you give us an idea of your growth &#x2013; gross market you had in 2012? And what do you expect for 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the three, starting with the first &#x2013; yes, absolutely. Starting with the first, we expect the EPS to be modestly up in 2013. That's as a result of what I told you in terms of sales and margin but also in terms of tax which are clearly going to be up. I remind you that we have the addition of the tax on dividends this year in particular, plus a few other one.</p>
          <p>Minority interests are clearly going to be down. Equity interests are going to be down as well if and when, but that's a matter of days, we end up signing and closing Morocco sometime this year. And last financial charges should be used to be fueling a share buyback as we want to maintain our credit ratio to level which are consistent with our current rating, i.e., A- as always. Okay, so the sum of all of that gives you an EPS which will be modestly up.</p>
          <p>Yakult, it's really an operational alliance, an operational story. We've been having very good cooperation for the past few years. Today, we are in discussion with the management to try and enhance this collaboration and possibly to go further than the fields we have been exploring together so far which were limited to research and development on one hand and some JVs on the other.</p>
          <p>So the idea is how do we their fields in which we can mutually take advantage one from the other in terms of operational synergy. This is very much an operational story and not capitalistic story. We have absolutely no intention to make a style move or to increase our shareholding in Yakult in any manner. The game is really to keep cooperating and developing synergies. So that's where we are for Yakult.</p>
          <p>Last, on the U.S. growth markets, well, there are many, many aspects in your question. The market has kept being up in value for the year 2012. It was down in volume at the beginning of the year and it's been progressing and going up in volume towards the beginning of the year. So that's clearly an improvement.</p>
          <p>We expect the market to continue growing and still driven by Greek. In fact, today, we are still, despite our pace of growth, we are still in the position not to have sufficient capacity to deliver the demands. So we are still in the process of increasing capacity in the U.S. to match the development of Greek.</p>
          <p>Greek went to about 35%, 36% of the total category in 2012. Today, it is above that. It's about 40% and it keeps expanding and growing. So that, we believe, is going to continue driving the market and driving us in 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Liam Rowley from Barclays. I know you're doing a loss in Europe, but just specifically on pricing, you mentioned that, at the end of the third quarter, that you'd taken some adjustments and a little bit of increased promotion and that's come through in the fourth quarter. But I'm just wondering whether there's much incremental to come in 2013, or whether just the four quarter, you've done what you need to do, I suppose, in Europe. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on Baby in China, I mean, clearly it's gone spectacularly well this year. But I'm just wondering, one of your competitors talked about a ramp-up in promotional environment, more competitive intensity, and I'm wondering whether &#x2013; I mean, particularly around Chinese New Year, I know this is this year rather than last year, but whether you're seeing that and how you see the competitive dynamics in 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First one, we think it's exactly the inverse. The way they manage people, by the time being, it's exactly the inverse. The classic answer to the difficulty in Europe is more promotion, pushing down the price, something we did in the past, in 2008, 2007.</p>
          <p>And in term of mindsets, it's exactly the inverse. We want to play the mix. So obviously, on some product, we are cutting advertising and making promotion, and it works, and we get the right volume. But with some other product, it's exactly the inverse. We valorize. When you do the <mark type="ph" /> key scope, (1:04:54) you valorize a product, because we don't think that the only way of finding the solution is to reduce and pushing down the price. Having said that, there is a difficulty. The clear difficulty is the raw material impact, which is growing, and we will expect, because of the crisis, a decline of the raw material. And that was not the case.</p>
          <p>And it's not a question of what usually we call pricing power. We are no more in that game of, you have a strong brand, you can push the price up. If you go to Spain, whatever is the strength of your brand, and we are strong, Danone in Spain is very strong, you can't transfer to the consumer 100% of the raw material price increase. That's the reason why you have to play the mix. You have to be careful about your existing product. You have to launch more add-value product.</p>
          <p>So when you launch Aquadrinks, it's a bit a mix. When you launch &#x2013; and on the same time, we have to be careful not &#x2013; if you let your people driving this situation, they will damage your product because they will reduce protein, they will reduce the number of fruits, they will reduce the active &#x2013; the ferment. So you damage the product.</p>
          <p>The way out is not by going down. The way out is by going up, which is exactly what we are doing with this new strategy. With a result we know, so it's not a dream. We know that we have some success.</p>
          <p>The question after in term of promotion or pressure or economic situation is, do we think that France will be the same than Spain, but Spain is very different. If you look at the price gap between the brand and the private label, it's 200%. France, the average is 120%. Totally different. And the margin in France was already less, much more less than in Spain, so the impact is less, whatever the situation will be.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the idea for us is to, let's say, reduce the cost, not of what we put behind the product in the advertising, promotion, digital, increasing sales force, but to reduce the cost we have in the, let's say, functional jobs around just to support brands, because we continue to think that we can really animate these brands and having success with these brands. And you will see difference between you and me, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:14) perhaps in the division of Danone, but we have growth plan everywhere.</p>
          <p>And I use and I leverage your question also to explain the bonus system of Danone, because we change a little bit. We were focusing people on different items. And this year, we asked all our general manager for at least 70% to focus on top line growth. And our financial team will take care of the rest, to be sure we are not doing stupid things, because we have to control everything. But in term of management, the mindset of Danone is switching to the top line, which is exactly the same for the emerging country, because the main difficulty for us is to manage people declining and manage people flying. They are part of the same company.</p>
          <p>So we need the right KPI to manage them and the right KPI's top line growth, because you will improve the margin by growing the top line with better product, not by pushing up the price. And if you do promotion, it's because you need more volume because of your factory, because of many things, because that the way we are going to deal.</p>

          <p>China, not to make too long answer. Two things: a) a real good part of our performance in &#x2013; or real <mark type="ph" /> hap (1:09:14) in our performance in 2012 has been the relaunch of Dumex, what we call the <mark type="ph" /> red house (1:10:46). And this clearly has been taking market share away from competitors. So I think what people are mentioning is that there's one figure &#x2013; two figures I would like to give you which illustrate that. We have grown in Q4 as we have in Q3 and Q2 and the year. We have grown single digit in China in volume. We have grown double digit in value. So there is absolutely no promotion or price-cutting to be read in these figures as you understand.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From Warren Ackerman of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. It's Warren Ackerman here at SG. I've got a couple of questions. First one is for Pierre-Andr&#xE9;. Can I just check the phasing of exceptional charges for 2013 and 2014 from the European restructuring program? I'm just wondering what those impairments you talked about were. You said small businesses in 2012, I think that was about &#x20AC;100 million. Could that repeat in 2013? And is there any other exceptionals on top of those? So the question really is, what is the fully loaded exceptionals for 2013, 2014? How should we think about the phasing of those charges?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, I just wondered whether we could just discuss the Actimel brand. I mean, it's your second biggest brand after Activia. It's the brand that in St. Petersburg, you mentioned was deemed by some European consumers as being quite artificial. I was interested, Franck, in hearing that you were <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:44) talking about natural. I was just wondering, kind of two, three years down the line, what are your kind of thoughts about that brand, how you turn that brand around, how you reposition Actimel to try and get it to grow? I know it's growing in Russia, but not in many other markets.</p>
          <p>And then the final one is just on France. I think you said at the beginning of your speech that France was actually the best performing country in 2012. I'm just wondering whether you saw any kind of any change in trend in Q4 in France, given the recent budget and what you're kind of &#x2013; what are you budgeting for France in 2013 in terms of top-line growth and margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first one and then pass then the mic to Franck for Actimel. On the exceptional charges, the first about 2012 and the impairment, this is about, for the biggest part of that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:51) sorry. This is about our discontinuation of the fruit operation, of our JV with Chiquita, which we announced I believe some month ago, and which we have provided for in the accounts. There are some small impairments as well in some <mark type="ph" /> water (1:12:42) operation in difficult environments such as Middle East, but which are unlikely to repeat. So to take your questions, in fact, globally about the impairments, no, I don't expect that this is going to repeat next year.</p>
          <p>On the phasing of the expenses, well, I would say that most of it is in 2013. I don't expect to have additional provision to be taken in 2014, at least not for any significant amount, given that we have most of the savings, which are covered by this to-be-passed provision, or this estimate of provision.</p>
          <p>Franck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On Actimel, I will be short, because we are going to re-launch Actimel, adapting ourself to, especially in Europe, the regulation in term of advertising. So there is room to do things, so we are going to change a little bit the formula to adapt ourself to claim what we want to claim.</p>
          <p>On top of that, Actimel is &#x2013; not only Actimel, but all the fresh dairy where we are exposed to Europe, it's less growing or even going down, but it's true that in the emerging country, all of them where Actimel is, we are growing, including Brazil, including Russia. And we have also project to use the capacity we can have in different factories to launch new product, perhaps totally different, but to have new product proposition for the consumer. So that will take time, but that will be fixed.</p>
          <p>And honestly, I think we achieve the level of sales with what I was calling the high consumer, or the heavy consumer. We still have a very, very strong heavy consumer target group on Actimel. We have to reactivate, especially with digital. So we will change totally the mix of Actimel.</p>
          <p>I was talking about France. I don't know if it is much more better, but it's less bad than some other south European country. And in term of top line, what we expect, not only from France, but as I said, I don't expect, and I don't want to ask to the people of the European countries to switch from plus 10%. It's a whole story. And I'm not sure this story will come back anymore. I don't think we will grow up in France or in Spain or in Belgium or in Italy or in Portugal plus 10%, plus 8%. We will find product growing this. As I told you, Salvetat is growing 20%. It's a sparkling water in France. Velout&#xE9; is growing 20%.</p>
          <p>So we have example within France which shows that we can perhaps expect to grow, or let's say to be in a range between minus 1%, plus 3%, something like this. Don't ask me when. But we know it's possible. Now if we do that, we will leverage incredibly strongly the emerging country. And the equation we present to you, we will continue to switch the equation between emerging country and major country, but not by letting go down the major country. Just by accelerating the emerging and doing our job in the major country.</p>
          <p>On top of that, I think we can imagine to gain market share. If we are suffering, some other player are much more suffering than us in our categories in Europe. So the idea is &#x2013; and the good news is that ideas are no more coming from Europe. Ideas are coming from the rest of the world. The best practices we have in the emerging country in term of product execution are now coming to Europe. The Aquadrinks are not coming from Europe. They are coming from Argentina, Brazil, a country like this.</p>
          <p>The new packaging of Badoit, and if you look at the new packaging of Font Vella in Spain, is coming from Argentina. So this rollout is going to change also, and that's the reason why the idea for us is to step-by-step, is to bring back not only France, and France will participate to that, but Europe, between minus 2%, plus 5%, something like this. And if it works, you have the example of the water division. The water division is exactly in that situation and we grow double-digit two year in a row. So that's the idea. I will not develop all the plan we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quickly clarify, just with Pierre-Andr&#xE9;, just going back to the restructuring question again. So just from a modeling point of view, should we be modeling sort of &#x20AC;500 million of exceptionals in 2013? I think you said a two to three-year payback on the &#x20AC;200 million of cost savings, and would it be true to say most of that is cash?</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from David Hayes of Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just two areas for me. Firstly, on the &#x2013; just following up on that U.S. discussion. Can you just confirm, you made the point about the concern some people have had about the price point for Greek. Can you just confirm that the last two or three months, you've seen that Greek price point generally hold? And then coming back to your capacity limitation point, can you give us a little bit more detail as to how the capacity comes online for 2013 and therefore, that volume constraint basically improves?</p>
          <p>And then the second question for me is on the cost savings, obviously a little bit more detail today about the &#x20AC;200 million, very focused on admin support functions. I just wonder whether you can talk about whether there is a review taking place on the operational side in Europe, whether there is opportunity, you think in the future, of cost efficiencies via plant rationalization, distribution changes, et cetera. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. So I'll take the second first on the cost saving, to say that what we are going ahead today in terms of cost saving is a) the vast majority of the &#x20AC;200 million targets and b) is concerns <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:33) essentially organization in Europe and therefore head of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:38) more than anything else. There's no operation in it, and we don't believe there has to be operation in need, because our diagnosis is that we have a global cost issue in Europe, given the inflation, the difficulty to pass price increase to the consumer and the overall weakness of the economy.</p>
          <p>So we are &#x2013; sorry, your diagnosis that we have no role issue of organization which we want to simplify and make more agile. We don't believe we have an overall question or issue of capacity. There's been no drop of volume in France. There's been no drop of volume in the UK. There's been &#x2013; in many countries, capacities continue to be utilized very well, and this is true in all businesses. There may be capacity issues to be dealt with in some countries and on a local basis, but certainly not at the European level. So don't expect us, as part of this &#x20AC;200 million objective, to come with things related to operations. If any, these will be local.</p>
          <p>And yes, Franck reminds me, which is obviously important, that this is all coming on top of the productivity which we generate year after year, which used to be, long time ago now, at levels of 300 and which we have been able to step up significantly since, if I remember well, 2009, going gradually to &#x20AC;500 million. And this year having a specifically high number of &#x20AC;589 million, but the &#x20AC;500 million-plus is basically a good benchmark of what we can repeat year after year. And therefore in 2013. This is, obviously, completely apart from the topic we have been discussing at the beginning of your question.</p>
          <p>U.S., price holds, basically. There's no &#x2013; we have seen no pressure on price. And this is very consistent with the fact that there is a lack of capacity. There is a lack of capacity at our end, there is a lack of capacity at the end of some of our competitors. As you know, capacity are being installed, but as they are being installed, the demand continue to expand. And therefore, we continue to be in an equation where we are building capacity to match the demand which keeps increasing.</p>
          <p>With respect to our capacity, there's no precise date. We have several tranches which are going to increase capacity progressively as we move into the year. It's not like last year where we had a big focus at the end of December. This year, there's going to be several ones helping us to progressively ramp up.</p>
          <p>It's obvious that, at some stage, there may be some more competition on the pricing and we do expect that. We don't believe there's going to be no competition on pricing forever in the BRIC. But we don't believe either. This is something I have explained several times, that there will be a huge price war which will be destroying the profitability of everyone. The profitability of the U.S. market is the profitability of a nation <mark type="ph" /> site (1:25:17) growing market and it's, on the contrary, increasing year-after-year to reasonable levels.</p>
          <p>So I hope it answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good. Just two follow-ups on that. Just on the Greek side, with the new capacity coming online in-house, is it fair to assume that the mix is starting to improve as well on the Greek product range as you bring in new products? Is the mix starting to improve as well on the Greek side as you've got now in-house capacity, more flexibility in that sense on new innovation?</p>
          <p>And then on the cost side, just wonder whether if you can confirm, in terms of raw materials, you mentioned 6% inflation in 2012, whether you can give us a range for that equivalent in 2013? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For 2013, we expect low to mid inflation versus 6% this year. And we expect cost saving to be closer to &#x20AC;500 million. The other part of your question &#x2013; yes, on the Greek, indeed the fact that we have more capacity in-house is indeed helping. But as I said and I repeat, the demand is increasing and therefore we keep using external capacity as we need it. So it's helping, but it's really marginal.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Celine Pannuti of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a few questions. First one is on Europe. We have seen a worsening trend in Q4 versus Q3. Could you elaborate in which divisions we've seen that? And could you give us an update on the situation in Spain and Italy in terms of like-for-like decline and what has been your pricing initiative? I think in the Q3 conf call, you said that you were starting to look at your price point. Can you give us an outlook for what to expect in the coming quarters in southern Europe?</p>
          <p>My second question was on the water. Quickly, should we be looking at double digit as a sustainable like-for-like growth?</p>
          <p>And finally, on your equation for 2013, can you give us a bit of guidance on how to balance H1 versus H2? And when you talk about modest EPS growth, should we look at low single-digit as modest? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at what? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Low single-digit, is that modest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More or less, yes. No, modest is modest. It's clearly not mid-single, neither double. So, yes, another term will be in fact low single digit. You're right. So several things on Europe. I think you're referring to one of the charts of the presentation which shows that we are at minus 5 versus minus 4 in Q3. As I said during the pres, this is mainly due to the comps in water. A significant part of the 23% of last year performance in Q4 was due to Europe, and therefore, the basis of comparison was very high.</p>
          <p>If you take in particular what is of interest to you which are the trends in dairy, they are very much in line Q3 to Q4 in all countries volume wise and there is a bit more negative pricing in Spain as we have indeed as you mentioned started changing adjusting the price points.</p>
          <p>The result of that cannot are going to take a bit of time to be seen. I expect, we expect to have gradually more visibility on this in Q1 and Q2. I think at the end of Q2, we'll have more visibility before it's going to be difficult again because we have a significant imbalance in the base of comparison which make the reading difficult. For the moment, what we see is a positive reaction, in particular on some products in which we have changed specifically price points. The consumer reacts well, but this is in an environment which remain extremely shaky.</p>
          <p>So to make it short, we continue doing what we had planned to do. We don't see any &#x2013; I mean, we see reactions which are pretty positive, but we need more time to be fully reassured about Spain. And I think that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And my...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. You had a question about the balance, H1 and H2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And water.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said Q1 is going to be clearly tougher in terms of comps. You see then what &#x2013; you see that's in Q1, you look at our base in 2012 with Q1 being in excess of 7%, if I remember well, when Q2, Q3, Q4 has been aside. So Q1 is going to be more difficult for the rest of the year apart from weather condition in what's everybody saw, was very difficult to predict. No reason to see imbalances.</p>
          <p>For the margin, there is an imbalance factor which comes to the fact that in H1, we should essentially see the same trend as the one we are seeing in 2012, so closer to the minus 50 and we should see the cost saving coming from H2. And therefore, H2 is going to be better in terms of margins than H1, plus as Franck reminds me, I'm too financial from time to time. There's a lot of innovation coming, which are clearly going to help as well from this standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just on water, my question was with the double-digit growth which you did in the past couple of years, is not a good run rate given the balance, regional balance and the innovation you are bringing in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Celine. I didn't understand the beginning of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, double-digit like-for-like in water, which you did in the past couple of years. Is that something we should be looking at given the balance of emerging markets and the new innovation in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on the high end. What I said last year and I think is still valid is that water, as an underlying base of growth of 7% to 8%. We can go up to 10% as we have done last year. But I think 7% or 8% is a better proxy for the underlying growth of this business.</p>

          <p>We have a question now from Robert Dickinson of Citi. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Robert Dickinson from Citi. Just a couple of questions, please. The first one is on your comment about returning to sustainable, profitable growth in 2014. Can I just clarify that, that means that you expect margins to start expanding again from 2014 onwards?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just around the launch of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Do the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is around the launch of Souvenaid. I realize it's early days but could you provide any feedback on the initial launch and success of this product, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer on Souvenaid. As you know, we decided to launch Souvenaid very, very, very slowly. It means we need the agreement of not only the health community but more important of the families suffering or the communities suffering from this disease.</p>
          <p>And in some country, we have to go slow because we want to be reimbursed so we can promote also, otherwise, we are not legally correct. So it's a very slow process, doing quite well but not impacting by the time being the division that we will extend to two or three new countries just now. And it's a real in process situation, nothing to really comment.</p>
          <p>Where we are is good but we are not booming because we don't want &#x2013; we want to be adapt by the community really suffering from the disease. So we don't want just to advertise and launch the product as a yoghurt.</p>
          <p>It's clearly a serious product, so we have to build the loyalty and the seriousness of the product, which is a long process but we have &#x2013; there are so many product about Alzheimer going up and failing because they don't have the support of the family and the community as we prefer to take this process to launch, even if it is much more slower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just add to last comment about profitable growth, which I answered very quickly. All definition of profitable growth is indeed margin being up. So what we expect and target is for our margins to be gradually stabilized with all the innovation in top line. We are talking about in Europe and at the same time being helped by the effect of the cost saving, which are going to impact for the maturity of it 2014. So that's indeed a good understanding from your side.</p>
          <p>Thank you all. We'll end up here. Thank you very much for those who have made the effort to come in to this room. And we look forward to seeing you or talking to you on the road. Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>
