        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report record results for the full year 2008, supported by another strong quarter of good operating results and financial performance. Two years ago, we reported record results. We surpassed that in 2007 and now again in 2008, we've set new high water marks for volumes, revenues, gross operating margin, EBITDA, net income and distributable cash flow. We increased the cash distribution per unit paid with respect to 2008 by 6.5% over the amount paid for 2007. At our Analyst Meeting last March, we announced our goal of increasing the annualized cash distribution per common unit to at least $2.12 by the end of the year. We did this while also retaining over $300 million of distributable cash flow despite the impact of two major hurricanes on our Gulf Coast operations, a global recession and volatile financial markets.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported net income of $228 million or $0.44 per unit, a 41% increase over the $162 million or $0.30 per unit we had for the fourth quarter of 2007. We also had near record gross operating margin of $522 million for the quarter, second only to the first quarter of 2008. Gross operating margin this quarter was reduced by total hurricane effects of approximately $36 million.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Pipelines and Services segment posted a 56% increase in gross operating margin this quarter over the fourth quarter of last year, with each of its businesses reporting higher quarter-to-quarter results. NGL transportation volumes were a record 1.9 million barrels per day this quarter, compared to 1.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of the prior year, and this increase is despite the loss in volumes in our pipelines due to the hurricanes. We also had increased NGL fractionation volumes, equity NGL production and fee-based natural gas processing volumes this quarter compared with the same quarter of the prior year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we transported a record 9.1 trillion BTUs per day of natural gas in the fourth quarter and 2.1 million barrels per day of NGLs, crude oil and petrochemicals. We continue to benefit from our diversified business mix that provides multiple earnings and cash flow streams, and from our broad geographical footprint, which supports our energy value chain strategy.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow for the quarter increased 26% to $331 million from $262 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our distributable cash flow provided 1.2 times coverage of the $0.53 per unit cash distribution declared with respect to the quarter. For the full year, distributable cash flow provided more than 1.3 times coverage of the cash distributions paid to the limited partners with respect to 2008. As a result, we retained a record $313 million of cash in 2008, enhancing our liquidity and providing additional flexibility to fund our growth while limiting our need to issue additional equity.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we also raised 138 million of cash from newly issued units through our distribution reinvestment plan. This also includes $62 million that was reinvested in November by Dan Duncan. The combination of retained cash flow and proceeds received from the distribution reinvestment plan provided Enterprise with approximately $450 million of equity-related liquidity in 2008. Dan is also committed to reinvest another 65 million in the distribution reinvestment plan this month and has indicated his willingness to consider investing up to a total of $260 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>We've been proactive in taking steps to significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility since the beginning of the credit crunch. Since November 2008, we have raised approximately $1.6 billion of debt and equity capital, including our recent 10.6 million common unit offering in early January, which was the first equity offering in the United States in 2009. As a result, we begin 2009 with a solid $1.6 billion of liquidity, including the $226 million of net proceeds from the equity offering last month.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2009, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to maintaining adequate liquidity and funding our capital projects, debt service and distribution growth. We have evaluated all of our potential capital projects in light of today's capital markets, and prioritized those investment opportunities. We currently have approximately $800 million of growth capital expenditures planned for 2009 and expect to spend approximately $180 million of sustaining CapEx for the year. This is less than the 1.5 to $2 billion we have spent in the past on growth projects, but we could increase our capital program if the capital markets become more accessible later in the year, as some economists forecast. While we have many attractive investment opportunities, we will be deliberate in our approach and do not intend to get ahead of our ability to prudently fund our growth while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We have three major capital projects that should commence operations this quarter. We're in the final stages of commissioning our new Meeker II cryogenic natural gas processing facility and expect to begin extracting NGLs by mid-February. In March, when both Meeker I and II are available, we expect to be processing approximately 900 million cubic feet a day at the complex. We expect this volume to increase to one to 1.1 Bcf a day in the third quarter, as expansions to our Piceance Basin pipeline system are completed and gas that is currently being produced is delivered to our plant.</p>
          <p>The Exxon Central Treating facility located near our Meeker complex in the Piceance Basin was completed ahead of schedule and under budget and is expected to receive first gas flows from Exxon in March.</p>
          <p>The Sherman Extension natural gas pipeline will begin ramping up volumes this month, with volumes expected to increase as compressor commissioning is completed by Enterprise and Boardwalk later in the quarter. We have long-term agreements with shippers for one Bcf a day of capacity of the Sherman Extension.</p>
          <p>This year, we are scheduled to commence operations at new facilities totaling about $2.3 billion of capital investment, including the three projects I just mentioned. Other projects include the Trinity River Basin gas pipeline lateral, the Shenzi Oil Pipeline, the Marathon gathering system and the Kobrand Valley pipeline. In the second half of the year we expect to begin operations on additional expansions to our Piceance Basin and our Texas Intrastate pipeline systems as well.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to review a few business highlights for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, gross operating margins for our NGL Pipelines &amp; Services business increased 56% over the fourth quarter of 2007. Estimated lost business for this segment in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to hurricanes was approximately $11 million, while gross operating margins for the fourth quarter 2007 benefited from nine million of business interruption insurance proceeds.</p>
          <p>Our Gas Processing business reported the largest increase in gross operating margin of the three businesses in this segment, an 82% increase to $204 million in the fourth quarter, compared with 112 million of gross operating margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. This business had a 27% increase in equity NGL production, increased NGL marketing activities and strong natural gas processing margins, in part provided by our hedging activities. We hedged approximately 75% of our 2008 equity NGL production, at prices that were significantly lower than prices actually seen during most of the year. We also hedged approximately 67% of our expected 2009 equity NGL production in 2008.</p>
          <p>The increase in equity NGL production was primarily attributable to the higher volumes extracted at the Meeker processing plant and the Pioneer plant, which began commercial operations in February of last year. Combined, these two plants are currently extracting an average of 63,000 barrels per day of NGLs.</p>
          <p>NGL demand for petrochemical production was down in the fourth quarter as you would expect, given the downtime due to Hurricane Ike and inventory management in light of reduced demand for petrochemical byproducts. Ethylene crackers operated at 72% of capacity in November, producing ethylene at an annual rate of 45 billion pounds. According to the Hodson Report, they operated at 57% of capacity in December, and an estimated 59% of capacity in January.</p>
          <p>The good news is February industry operating rates are expected to increase as up to five ethylene plants that were idle due to economic or maintenance reasons are in the process of coming back online, according to industry consultants. These plants, which have a combined 10 billion pounds of capacity, could increase ethane cracking by as much as 125,000 barrels a day to 675,000 barrels per day, which compares to average ethane cracking in all of 2008 of 715,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margins from our NGL Pipelines and Storage business increased 32% to 116 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 88 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher transportation volumes on the Dixie and Lou-Tex NGL pipeline systems, a 25,000 barrels a day increase in NGL transportation volumes, and higher tariffs that went into effect in mid-2008 for our Mid-America and Seminole pipelines, and lower pipeline integrity expenses on our South Louisiana pipeline. Gross operating margin from our NGL storage business at Mont Belvieu also increased $7 million. Volumes associate with the NGL pipelines and storage business totaled 1.9 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 1.8 million barrels per day at the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our NGL marketing business is utilizing our storage facilities to take advantage of the current contango market and lock in at least $40 million of margins for 2009.</p>
          <p>Operating margins from our NGL fractionation business was $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 23 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. NGL fractionation volumes increased 10% over the prior year to a record of 444,000 barrels per day this quarter, with most of that increase coming from our Hobbs, South Texas and Mont Belvieu fractionators.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported gross operating margin of $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 101 million for the fourth quarter 2007. Gross operating margins for the San Juan system decreased $16 million this quarter, due to lower revenues from transportation fees indexed to natural gas prices and condensate sales. San Juan natural gas prices averaged $3.91 per MMBTU for the quarter versus $5.89 per MMBTU for the fourth quarter 2007. Our natural gas marketing business reported a $7 million increase in gross operating margin this quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. Total onshore gas transportation volumes increased 15% to a record 7.8 trillion BTUs per day in the fourth quarter of 2008, surpassing the record set in the previous quarter of 7.6 trillion BTUs per day.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Offshore Pipelines &amp; Services segment was $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $74 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Gross operating margin was impacted by $25 million this quarter from hurricanes, including $23 million for lost business.</p>
          <p>Independence Hub and Trail contributed a record $56 million to gross operating margin this quarter, averaging 894,000 MMBTUs per day. This compares to $48 million of gross operating margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2007 on an average throughput of 719,000 MMBTUs per day. This improvement was more than offset by lower demand revenues and lower volumes at the Falcon platform and lower volumes from our other platforms and offshore gas and oil pipelines due to disruptions caused by the hurricanes. We estimate that the impact of lost business related to Hurricane Ike in the first quarter of 2009 will be a decrease of approximately 15 to $20 million in gross operating margin before any future recoveries from business interruption insurance.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical Services segment reported gross operating margin of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, $2 million less than in the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily due to weaker results from our butane isomerization plants and our octane enhancement facilities.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Randy, I'd like to say again that we are very pleased with our performance this quarter, especially given the negative impact on our businesses from the hurricanes early in the quarter and the weakness in the economy. Our strong performance enabled us to continue our impressive track record of increasing the quarterly distributions for the 27th time since our IPO, while also retaining cash flow to provide us with additional financial flexibility. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to raise $1.6 billion in the capital markets over the last three months, increasing our liquidity during these volatile and uncertain financial markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that our strong fundamentals distinguish us from many other MLPs, particularly in today's market. The quality of our assets, our large diversified footprint, and our portfolio of organic growth opportunities positions us well for the future growth. Our lower cost of capital and our ability to raise capital in challenging markets should enable us not only to weather these times better than many of our peers, but to actually prosper as a result.</p>
          <p>At a time when some other partnerships have stopped increasing their distributions or in some cases reduced them, we are proud of our track record of 18 consecutive quarters in which we have increased our quarterly cash distribution per unit. We will continue to manage our business with a long-term view and we believe our investors will be rewarded by our consistent performance, solid results and financial discipline.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Randy Fowler for a financial review of the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. As Mike mentioned, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses and the solid results this quarter. I would like to start my discussion with items below the gross operating margin on the income statement.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization expense in the operating costs and expenses section for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased (sic) [increased to] $147 million from $139 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to increased property, plant and equipment from the additions of the Meeker and Pioneer processing facilities, the expansion of the Mid-America pipeline from Skellytown to Conway, and the Petal natural gas storage cavern in Mississippi.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense increased to $24 million this quarter from $21 million in the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to higher employee expenses, which include the reclassification of certain salaries and benefits that were classified as operating expenses last year.</p>
          <p>We reported $110 million of interest expense this quarter compared to 92 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Average debt outstanding increased to 8.8 billion this quarter from 6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to debt incurred to fund growth capital investments and also working capital. The provision for income taxes increased to $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 from six million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher Texas margin tax accruals.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditures, we invested approximately 670 million in growth capital projects and acquisitions, and spent 59 million in sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2008. The majority of the growth capital spent this quarter was attributable to the Sherman Extension pipeline, the Meeker II cryogenic processing plant, the Mont Belvieu well utilization program and the Shenzi oil pipeline. During the quarter, we also completed three smaller acquisitions of a natural gas pipeline and interest in from natural gas liquid pipelines; those three together totaled approximately $180 million.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we invested approximately 2.1 billion in growth capital expenditures and $189 million in maintenance capital expenditures. At December 31, 2008, we had $9 billion of debt, including 100% of our $1.23 billion of hybrid secured and $484 million of debt at Duncan Energy. Enterprise had liquidity of approximately 1.4 billion at December 31, 2008, which included availability under the partnership's credit facilities and unrestricted cash. We also had about $182 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2008 that is associated with our natural gas processing hedges that will revert back to the company on a month-to-month basis in 2009. During the first week of January as Mike mentioned, EPD received &#x2013; net proceeds of about $226 million from the issuance 10.6 million common units. Adjusted for those proceeds, Enterprise's liquidity at December 31 was more about 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>In November 2008, we took advantage of the dislocation in the debt capital markets by retiring $17 million of our 7.034% junior subordinated notes &#x2013; these are part of the hybrid security &#x2013; at a significant discount, resulting in a $7 million gain. This is included &#x2013; okay, as far floating interest rate exposure was approximately 20% at the end of the quarter and the average life of our debt was approximately eight years, and our effective average cost of debt was 5.7%.</p>
          <p>At December 31, our consolidated debt balance was $9 billion, and this consolidated debt balance includes the debt of Duncan Energy, for which Enterprise does not have the payment obligation. Adjusted EBITDA for 2008, which is EBITDA after adjusting for equity earnings and actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, was $2 billion, which is a 39% increase from that of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt, adjusted for the 50% equity content in the hybrid, to the adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months was about 4.2 times at December 31. Including the January 2009 equity offering, pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA would have been about 4.1 times. And again, that EBITDA, as we have mentioned earlier, was negatively impacted by about $123 million of hurricane effects in 2008, which without those effects could have further lower debt to EBITDA to about 3.9 times. Also, keep in mind that our leverage ratio was a bit elevated due to debt balances reflecting a significant amount of the capital cost for the Sherman Extension natural gas pipeline, the Meeker II natural gas processing plant, the Shenzi oil pipeline and the Exxon Central Treating facility, which are complete or substantially complete, but not yet contributing to EBITDA.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn the call over to Hank to discuss Duncan Energy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. This was the pretty exciting quarter for our partnership. Not only did we report significantly higher net income and distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2008 than that reported by the partnership for the fourth quarter of 2007, but we also completed in early December our second drop-down transaction by acquiring controlling interests in three Enterprise midstream energy subsidiaries, which we sometimes refer to as DEP II. This $730 million transaction is important to our partnership, as it significantly expands our base of midstream energy assets in Texas, provides additional opportunities for us to develop organic projects, and diversifies our sources of fee-based cash flow. The natural gas pipelines and related assets acquired in this transaction are strategically located in high demand areas, with access to prolific natural gas supply regions in Texas, including the Barnett Shale play.</p>
          <p>An example of new organic projects which were included in the acquired businesses is the new Sherman Extension gas pipeline that runs right through the heart of the Barnett Shale region and interconnects with Boardwalk's Gulf Crossing pipeline. As Mike mentioned earlier, this 178-mile natural gas pipeline is almost fully subscribed, with agreements in place for one billion cubic feet per day of its 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of capacity.</p>
          <p>Finally, the businesses acquired in this drop-down transaction also provide Duncan Energy with control of a significant portion of the supply sources for the businesses we acquired from Enterprise in our initial public offering. For instance, we now control not only the NGL transportation systems that transport a mixed NGL stream from various South Texas gas processing plants to our Shoup and Armstrong NGL fractionators, we provide the NGLs that are being transported by our South Texas NGL pipeline system and are stored in our Mont Belvieu NGL storage facilities. The partnerships received fees for all of these services.</p>
          <p>Before we get into the partnership's financial and operational results for the 2008 fourth quarter and year, I would like to discuss the accounting treatment of the recent DEP II dropdown transaction. Because of Enterprise's historical common control of the partnership and the businesses acquired in the drop-down transaction, our financial and operating results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, have been recapped in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to include the results from these midstream energy companies as if we'd owned these businesses since January 1, 2007, even though the partnership has only owned these businesses since December 8, 2008.</p>
          <p>Therefore, all historical, financial and operating data reported today, other than distributable cash flow, include the financial and operating results of the newly acquired businesses, and will not be comparable to the financial results for the corresponding period that the partnership published prior to December 2008. However, we have added a significant amount of information in the exhibits to our earnings release and hope it will be helpful in evaluating the effects of this recap.</p>
          <p>Now onto discussion of our financial and operating results. We reported for the fourth quarter of 2008, a 58% increase in net income to $10.8 million or $0.39 per common unit, from $6.8 million or $0.30 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2007. As good as that was, the partnership did even better with respect to distributable cash flow. Distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 63% to $15.4 million, compared to 9.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2008 included $5.6 million from the DEP II midstream businesses for the 24-day period to the end of 2008. On an annualized basis, this represents an approximate 12% return on our investment in these businesses.</p>
          <p>In 2009, each of Duncan Energy and Enterprise expect to receive cash distributions from the DEP II businesses of approximately $87 million, representing an approximate 12% priority return, with any excess cash flow being shared 98% to Enterprise and 2% to Duncan Energy. The distributable cash flow generated in 2009 from these businesses should support our goal of increasing our annual distribution rate in 2009 by 3%. Of course, the cash flow generated from this priority return is in addition to cash generated from the businesses acquired by Duncan Energy in connection with our IPO.</p>
          <p>On January 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Duncan Energy's General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4275 per common unit, a 4.3% increase from the $0.41 per common unit paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2007. Distributable cash flow for the quarter provided 1.2 times coverage of the cash distribution to be paid on February 9, 2009, with respect to the fourth quarter of 2008, with 1.1 times coverage for all of 2008.</p>
          <p>We will now turn to segment performance. As I mentioned earlier, except for distributable cash flow, the financial and operating results for the partnership have been recapped for the fourth quarters and years ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, to include results from the DEP II midstream businesses for the entire periods, even though the partnership only owned these assets since December 8, 2008.</p>
          <p>The Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline business segment reported gross operating margin of $33.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $41.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The Texas Intrastate Gas System, a DEP II business, reported an $8.9 million decrease in gross operating, margin primarily due to a favorable gas imbalance settlement received by that business in the fourth quarter of 2007. The Acadian Gas Pipeline System reported a $1.6 million decrease in gross operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to slightly higher operating expenses during that quarter, and a gain received by Acadian on forward sales of natural gas in the fourth quarter of 2007 that was not received by Acadian in the fourth quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting these decreases in gross operating margin were higher transportation volumes and fees from the Texas Intrastate system, and increased gross operating margin from our Wilson gas storage facility, which had operational issues in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Natural gas throughput volumes increased 17% to 4.9 trillion British Thermal Units or BTUs per day, compared to 4.2 trillion BTUs per day in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Pipeline &amp; Services business reported gross operating margin of $25.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, up from $24.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net of operational measurement gains and losses from the partnership's Mont Belvieu NGL storage complex, which are allocated to Enterprise and reflected on our financial statements as an adjustment to parent interest. Gross operating margin was $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year, compared to $23.6 million in the same quarter of 2007. This quarter-to-quarter increase was primarily due to higher storage revenues from increased excess throughput storage fees and volumes, and increased fractionation volumes at the partnership's fractionators in South Texas.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Sherman Extension discussed earlier, another of our growth projects this year is the expansion of our Shoup NGL fractionator in South Texas.</p>
          <p>Together with Enterprise, we are investing approximately $13 million to increase the fractionator's capacity by 10%, to 77,000 barrels per day. We expect to complete this expansion late in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>While NGL Transportation volumes were 124,000 barrel per day in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 136,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2007, fractionation volumes increased 13% to 81,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2008, from 71,000 barrels per day in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures on a 100% basis, from both the DEP and DEP II assets were $15.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and $54.2 million for all of 2008. This compares to 16.9 million and $62.6 million of maintenance capital expenditures spent for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased $1.1 million to $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of Duncan Energy's borrowing of 282 million in December of 2008 under its new bank term loan, in order to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Enterprise in the DEP II drop-down transaction. Total debt principal outstanding at the end of 2008 was $484.3 million, compared to $200 million at the end of 2007, primarily as a result of that borrowing.</p>
          <p>We had total liquidity of approximately $110 million at December 31, 2008, which includes availability under the partnership's $300 million revolving credit facilities, as well as unrestricted cash, which was $10 million higher than at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>In closing, we had a very eventful and successful fourth quarter. We look forward to what we expect to be a solid year in 2009.</p>
          <p>Randy, we're now ready to take questions on Enterprise and Duncan Energy.</p>

          <p>Question on expansion plans in the Piceance: in light of what a lot of the producers out there have been saying on their fourth quarter calls, do you still feel pretty good about near term expansions there, as well as return on that capital you'll be spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Jim Teague. Yeah, we feel pretty comfortable where we are in the Piceance. If you take a look at what we're doing is, we're expanding our Piceance Gathering System to tie into production that in some cases is already there, shutting down other facilities in order to bring that gas to our plant, and then tying into wells that have been drilled and is waiting on our pipeline. And I think Mike said in his comments, we expect by the end of the year to be in the neighborhood of 1.1 Bcf a day of processing at the Piceance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I don't know, Mike, if you can comment in terms &#x2013; or Randy, if you can comment in terms of what pricing levels you're hedged for NGLs this year and whether you've layered anything on for 2010 as well?</p>

          <p>No Gabe, we don't give those numbers out, and frankly we continue to look at the markets and those change as we go forward. We may actually put on more hedges, but suffice it to say, we did mention that we had layered on hedges for 2009 in 2008. So you can &#x2013; at least the prices are better than they were at the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of things on your hybrid securities, you mentioned you'd repurchased these two tranches &#x2013; pretty significant amount &#x2013; they've been trading in the 50s dollar price-wise, 16 to 19% yield, if you think of them on a yield to first call, and that was how they were sold and everybody's assuming it's a par call on the first par call date, as they were initially issued. The question is, given 16 to 19% yields, those would be unlevered returns to you if you were to buy them back. Why wouldn't you be doing more of that? It would seem to make a lot of sense; it's a higher &#x2013; presumably a higher return than a lot of your organic growth projects</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In November, we did see a, if you would, a chunky piece of those securities again &#x2013; $17 million offered &#x2013; and when we did see it, I think we bought it at about $0.58 on the dollar, so you're right. I think yield to first call was about 16%. We did view that as attractive, and while in December you may have seen some of those trade down lower in the 50s, they've since rebounded back up into the, call it high 50s, low 60s, but frankly while it may be quoted at that, there's not a whole lot of volume at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I take it you guys are going to keep looking at that trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll come in and take a look at that, because you're right. 16, 18% return on that. And, if you would, to a degree, at those kind of levels, again I think I we'll be deliberate in it, but you are coming in and trading, if you would, 50% equity credit for 10 years, you're basically trading that for call it 40, 42% equity credit permanently. So that's attractive to us also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And one other thing, then: in terms of the contracts with the processing keep whole and percentage of proceeds contracts, I was just wondering if you could just tell us the most up-to-date average contract length, and how long it would take you, if you will, to if you wanted to see up the whole business and see up the assets, how long that would take you to kind of run off the existing POP and keep whole contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the way those contracts have stood up, and frankly you look at the production, we don't have necessarily long-term contracts for fixed periods of time. A lot of these are percent of the &#x2013; or rights of the field. And so it really depends on how long that production continues -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of our keep whole exposure, virtually the only place we have any real keep whole exposure is in the Rockies. That's what you had to do to get the business up there. If you remember, we've got two benefits from our position in the Rockies. First of all, we put in a lot of flexibility in those plants to be able to turn them down pretty dramatically. An example is, one train in Meeker, full-out production full recovery, so about 35,000 barrels a day. When we turn that back to dew point, we're producing in the neighborhood of 3,000 barrels a day, still meeting downstream gas pipeline specs.</p>
          <p>The other thing, though, is we have a pretty strong basis advantage in the Rockies. We feel like our basis advantage out there in our plants will be the last to be turned off and the first one to be turned on. Even through this &#x2013; what we've been through in the fourth quarter, I don't think we were in rejection more than two days, so those plants continue to produce full out.</p>
          <p>Everywhere else, in South Texas, we're primarily percent-of-proceeds and fee-based; in Louisiana, we're primarily fee-based, percent-of-proceeds. And if you'll recall, a margin-band with our largest producer, whereby if they are below a floor, they take the hit, above a ceiling, they get the benefit. We get everything, that's in the middle.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, on the NGL side of the business, you discussed the five ethylene crackers coming online. Can you give us a sense of what you think that does to the domestic ethane market and also what it means to the supply-demand balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think Mike said in his comments that we're talking about if those crackers come up in an ethane preferred mode, which we expect them to, that it'd be about 715,000 barrels a day of ethane. That's ethane from gas processing plants. A lot of times what you see in the Hodson Report, you'll see higher ethane numbers. They include in that the off-gas that comes out of refinery units as an ethane. So when Mike says 715,000 barrels a day of ethane use, that's from gas processing. I would expect <mark type="inaudible" /> to help me. I think probably if you look at the capability to produce in the 725 to 740 range, if everybody is full out producing ethane from processing, I'll get that number for you.</p>
          <p>If you look at where the petrochemical industry is, and you look at the cost of producing ethylene today, the ethane is the most advantaged feedstock by a long shot. It's some $0.15 a pound better off than naphtha. If you look at a billion pound a year ethylene plant and you calculate that out, that's $150 million in the course of one year. So we expect as these crackers come back online, we think ethane will be preferred. We ran our models for our budget this year at about an 80% run rate for petrochemical plants. That would equate to somewhere between 750 and 800,000 barrels a day of ethane use from gas processing. We get in that level, we feel pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you still feel pretty comfortable that the demand is going to be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel pretty comfortable that &#x2013; whenever you come out of a month where they ran at 57%, I spent the first two weeks in the fetal position in the corner of my office. What we're seeing is, we're seeing these guys come back up. I think we're seeing them run at about 70%, 75% we're expecting in February.</p>
          <p>What we do is, we go and we look backward, and when you look at the troughs that we've experienced in the past, an 80% run rate is a deep trough and it's pretty traditionally where they run. Dan [Duncan] will point out to you that the last trough we had, they ran at about 80%, but they were running heavy liquids at 100% of their capability. The difference this time is that the NGLs are the preferred feedstock. So we feel pretty good that we're going to get back to those levels. Those aren't barn-burning levels, but the levels that we feel comfortable with and we feel like we will be fine at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate the insight. And Randy, just one big picture question for you. When you look at your liquidity profile as it sits today, and a lot of expectations out there for you guys to generate somewhere around $350 million in excess of what you distribute in 2009. Can you give us a sense of how you consider balancing distribution growth versus retaining cash? Is that target 5.5 to 6.5% year-over-year Bcf growth range still intact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Darren, it's Mike. When we look at the distribution rates that we pay each quarter, we really look at the amount of distributable cash flow we've got, we look at the CapEx that we've got, we look at where we are in the cycle of our construction projects. And clearly, if we're in the middle of a big growth cycle, where we've got a lot of capital employed in projects that haven't yet started generating cash flow, our distribution coverage ratio is going to be a little lower. We purposely have restrained distribution growth. We met our objectives and we plan to continue to increase our distributions, but until we get more stable financial markets, we're not going to be heroes. We're going to continue to do what we've been doing, building facilities and increasing distributions on a quarterly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one final question for you, Mike, and this builds off your prepared commentary. When you look at the external markets specifically for acquisitions, can you give us a sense right now of how wide the bid-ask spread is on multiples?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't gotten into a bidding situation lately, but just looking at the assets that are on the market today, our view is that the sellers are perhaps a bit unrealistic about the multiples it's going to take to clear the market. We do think as we get deeper into 2009, that that bid-ask spread is going to narrow and hopefully, if the financial markets are cooperative, there may be some additional opportunities for a company like Enterprise with a strong balance sheet and a lot of liquidity.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This question relates to DEP. There are several organic growth opportunities tied to the assets that the partnership acquired including the Wilson storage project, the fractionator that you mentioned. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide some color on what DEP's CapEx may look like in 2009 and 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, I think I believe the Wilson storage is not actually included in the DEP II businesses. Those are still owned by Enterprise. At some point when those are completed, we would have the ability to invest in our share of those assets. But again, we do have that &#x2013; we're still finishing up right now the Sherman Extension pipeline. We have the Shoup fractionator. We're looking at, there's a extension off of the Sherman Extension that we would have the opportunity to participate in. So I think right now our capital program for 2009 looks pretty robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would you be able to quantify what DEP's capital requirements would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Sharon I think we're in pretty good shape. You come in and you look I want to say probably at the end of the quarter, the liquidity at DEP was around 90 to $100 million, so I think we're in pretty good shape on that front. I think for the most part, with DEP's ownership percentage and the way the partnership agreement works, DEP could elect to invest more or less in projects like the Trinity River Basin project, and it would just work off that priority return. In the Shoup fractionator, again, I think I that's a modest size, that's only a $13 million growth CapEx project, and DEP would do about 66% of that. So again, I think it's all manageable from a DEP standpoint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Randy, you gave us the leverage numbers with the hybrid and then pro forma for your equity offering here. You obviously did incur a lot of debt with the Sherman Extension, Meeker II and Shenzi. If that EBITDA was rolled up, what would the pro forma leverage look like with that added cash flow? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ross, we'd love to put those numbers in the press release, but unfortunately the lawyers and the accountants would have a heart attack. Obviously with over $2 billion of capital into service in 2009, we've spent a lot of money that, as you point out, isn't generating cash flow yet. But obviously, if you did the kind of pro forma, including the 12 months of cash flow associated with those projects, as Randy said, it would look considerably better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give me maybe a rough idea of what the debt associated with those projects was which is not currently generating cash flow, maybe just a ballpark?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross, in coming in and looking at it, I want to say to you probably about everything is baked in.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a standpoint of Sherman, again, we're just finalizing that project, so maybe call it $460 million or so of that project has already been spent. When you come in and you look at Meeker, maybe about 470 has been spent. If you come in and you look at the Shenzi oil pipeline, maybe about 150 has been spent. Those are the chunkiest ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then I'll just apply a multiple that I think is reasonable to back into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've also got the Exxon central treating facility that's complete, just waiting on gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ross, this is Dan. If you add all those things up Randy was talking about, it's about 1.6 to 1.8 billion that we would make on in EBITDA in 2009 that we did not make in 2008. So some of that comes on beginning in first quarter, majority of it will probably come on in first quarter, a lot of it come on &#x2013; a little bit of it come in the second quarter and some in the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Yeah, let me take the last half and I'll let Randy give you an idea of what the projects are. In terms of returns that we have on specific projects, we don't give that out, but as may have been a leading question. Obviously in today's market we expect, as do all of our peers, expect higher returns on assets. And that's not only for newly constructed assets but it's for existing assets when they come up for contract renewal. Randy?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, and then as far as in 2009, probably the chunkier pieces of that would be the Trinity River Basin lateral, which is about $225 million, call it; completing the Sherman Extension, probably about another $40 million. If you come in and you look at the Marathon gathering and the other Piceance Basin natural gas pipeline work that we're doing, that's probably about $165 million. That's the chunkiest ones; everything else gets down to $20 million here, $30 million there.</p>

          <p>A lot of MLPs are looking at cost savings in 2009. Can you comment on anything you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 2009 is probably not that different from the last half of 2008. We try to maintain a pretty tight partnership in terms of cost. But clearly in this market there's a couple of things could working for us. One is that we've got a substantially smaller CapEx budget. So we've got a lot of people that we had used as contractors that frankly we don't need with a smaller CapEx budget.</p>
          <p>We've also had a large number of open positions, in really across all of our disciplines, primarily in engineering, operations, IT and accounting. And frankly, I had a very difficult time filling those positions. Now we're going back in reevaluating all of our open; positions to see if we still need them. And so to the extent that they're critical we'll fill them to the extent we don't need them in this kind of an environment, we're not going to fill them. We're requiring everybody that has those open positions to go back and rejustify them.</p>
          <p>We're also looking across the company at staffing levels and making sure that if perhaps we have overstaffing in certain areas and understaffing in others, that we move people around to balance that out. So we're doing things that make sense for our partnership today.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to look at the cost of our equipment and our capital items. Steel costs have gone down. Our procurement guys do a great job of sourcing materials at the lowest cost and they are pushing on our vendors to get costs down as well. So I think we're taking the same kind of steps that most other partnerships and companies are taking, for that matter, but we try to do that every year, regardless of the financial markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A lot of my questions have been already asked. But you mentioned obviously in the light of the current environment that you're being more specific and prudent in terms of where you spend your money for growth CapEx. If the markets do open back up and things do improve throughout the year, where are the areas that you're looking at other projects? Where are those opportunities? What segments &#x2013; what areas you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think that they're really across the board for our Natural Gas Liquids Pipelines $ Services and for our Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services. That's probably the two areas that we're going to focus on the most. Not a whole lot planned on the Petrochemical or the Offshore, although obviously the top, the big project for us and that's probably enough to say grace over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously, you mentioned a couple of minutes ago you had a higher capital cost environment and you're requiring higher rates of return on assets. How does that translate specifically when you are entering into these new projects? Are you just requiring more up front from counterparties and customers, charging higher rates? How does that work in practice, given your debt and equity costs at where they are now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's across the board. I think it's the fees that we charge for our services, primarily, but clearly we've got a lot of assets that's contracted or coming up for renewal, some of our storage assets in Mont Belvieu, we've been successful in increasing the rates there and frankly, our customers understand the need for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>John Tysseland from Citi, you may ask your question.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Great quarter. Real quick, a couple of questions, just could you guys discuss EPD's NGL inventories at the end of the year and how those might have changed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? And then also how much of those inventories have you really sold forward with your previous comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you want to tackle that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of EPD inventories, John, as you know, we have a policy of a flat pricing book, so we're not outgrowing inventories, other than you heard Mike mention our contango play: we book inventories with that, but we've sold those forward to retain the flatness of our book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in line of the current environment where you saw some of the petrochemical companies coming down or reducing utilization rates, do you see that changing at all in 2009 or in terms of being able to take advantage of any opportunities or do you expect to just keep on what you've been doing in maintaining that flat book and just playing it real conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to keep doing what we're doing. That's the policy of ours. But our system is quite dynamic, and that gives us the opportunity to arb the system either between locations or timing, and that's what we've been doing. We see ourselves continuing to do that to the extent the market gives it to us.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier, we have seen increased pull from petrochemicals beginning in February that we think is pretty positive and we expect it to continue. In addition, we've seen unbelievable activity on our export docks, as Mike said, at higher fees than traditionally we've charged. We just so far in January and February, and what we've locked in in March, we're right at seven million barrels, and we're seeing fees of seven to $0.08 a gallon, where traditionally that would have been more like, Dan, 2.5? in that range 2.5 to $0.03 a gallon. So validating what Mike said, what we're doing is, we're bidding higher fees, and what happens in this system is whenever we see problems in one area, it's almost like it's inherent, John. There is opportunities in other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great clarity. I appreciate it. Thanks, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John, This is Dan. Let me give you a little bit more color to it. There's industry publications that show the inventories of natural gas liquids and along with natural gas and crude oil and everything. If you go back to industry publication, they talk in inventories in total versus what we talk about is what Enterprise's inventories are. If you go to EIA, propane is probably up 10 to 15% over last year; if you go to API on ethane, it's probably up 50 to 75% on total. Butanes are up; all your NGLs is up. So if you look at total inventories on an API type deal, which comes out once a month, about a month late, they probably &#x2013; natural gas liquids inventory, to your question that you asked, is probably up close to 75, 80%, which is basically what crude oil is up, and like pushing, I think pushing at an all time high of crude oil right now. I think, if you look at Mont Belvieu from an industry perspective deal, probably Mont Belvieu is at an all time high or supposed to be an all time high natural gas liquids.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean that we feel that natural gas liquids will be weak next year. If we go back to, and Jim mentioned before, the 2002-2003 timeframe, where when we'd operate at 80% capacity, the heavy end of the package then with crude oil being cheap ended operating over 100% capacity with the light end at that time because gas was high priced relative to crude oil. Gas was operating at about at 55 or 60% of capacity. What we see now in the petrochemical market this year is based on today's prices of natural gas, based on today's prices of crude oil once you ship, you get by the one month which is being affected by WTI, or if you look at the Brent crude oil , which is now more the actual probably crude oil quotient that international market is looking at it, instead of looking at WTI.</p>
          <p>We feel that the natural gas liquids market, which is a light-end market petrochemical, would be operating at 100 to 110% plus of nominal capacity. Nominal capacity gives them a downtime probably 30 days every year, but they can operate 15 to 18 months and haul out capacity, and operate basically 110% of actual capacity on liquids. So we think that will happen this year only because of the ratio between crude oil and natural gas.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about six or $7 million. But remember, in the fourth quarter of 2007, it was still under development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's what I wanted to confirm. So it was basically seven against zero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About that. Yeah</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of, you mentioned you've got 800 million of announced CapEx with a healthy backlog. Any quantification about roughly what that backlog of potential projects might be, should capital markets ease up a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. John, when we went through looking at 2009 capital budgets, we had our commercial guys list everything that they'd like to do, the projects that they thought would be attractive for Enterprise, and we pared that back from about $3.5 billion to about $800 million. So it's a big backlog; good news is that most of those projects aren't going away. So if the market come back to us, we have plenty to draw upon, and they certainly are there for 2010 and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on acquisitions, obviously there are distressed assets, some distressed players out there. Maybe you could comment on potential consolidation this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We get that question frequently. It seems like every year we get it. But you're right, in this year there are more distressed players. It's difficult for us to think about doing a merger with another MLP, simply because, if I can't find an MLP where we like all of the assets, or that we would actually be able to keep all the assets and not being forced to divest by the SEC. So I think what is more probable for us is looking at discrete assets that companies or partnerships might be selling as a way to raise liquidity, and frankly, that would be more attractive to us right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regard to the distribution, you've been raising it $0.0075 per unit per quarter for a while. Is it safe to assume you're likely to continue doing that for '09? Because I didn't hear you mention a target exit rate for '09; like for '08, I think you had targeted at 2.12, which you kept to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Hi, Yves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just elaborate a little bit on the natural gas marketing, as it relates to, one, investor dollars; number two, given the winter-summer spread, what kind of opportunity that might present? And within the context of the first two questions, is this $7 million a reasonable run rate for the next quarters going into '09 or would you expect to build significantly upon that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Yves, this is Chris. With regards to the first part of that question, the $7 million run rate for the fourth quarter, typical in the gas marketing business &#x2013; and you hit the nail on the head with regards to the winter-summer spread &#x2013; we ought to recognize probably 50 to 75% of our earnings in the first and fourth quarters, and the balance over the second and third quarters. With the spreads opening up right now, as we went in through '08, we only had seven Bcf of total storage capacity leased. If you look into '09, we're looking to have around 12 to 13 Bcf of storage.</p>
          <p>So with regards to working capital, I don't think we peaked above $40 million last year in total working capital, and that was with a $10 gas environment in the spring and now we're working in a $4 gas environment. Even though we're doubling our capacity, I don't think our working capital requirements are going to <mark type="inaudible" /> be at all. And we're very favorable with regards to the $2 and $2.20 spreads front to back. We're very active, much like Jim said earlier in the NGL business, we run a flat book. So we have plenty of assets to arbitrage and take advantage of price through the assets as opposed to having picked flat price risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Yves, let me add some color to what Chris was talking about. It hinges upon not in doing the deal of marketing natural gas and building up that market. <mark type="inaudible" /> other people that <mark type="inaudible" />, and also gets into our <mark type="inaudible" /> we go gas daily versus as we go inside first. We also get involved on <mark type="inaudible" />. So the amount of money that we were looking at, that like $7 million, that only related to what the profit he made at the marketing on things that he's doing. It did not relate to all the value that he brought to the Enterprise <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>A lot of the throughputs that we're now getting, that we would not have if he had not been here. So a lot of his value <mark type="inaudible" /> is that we've got and that's the reason a lot of our other assets with increases this year over last year. In fact I think last month, just pick a number, I think January &#x2013; he'd come in and we have never done this before other than last year. We went to gas daily on all of our fuel, and a lot of our PPRs, rather than go into that first.</p>
          <p>So that was $7 million that he made in the month of January that doesn't show up with him as a marketing company, but it does show up on our books. We keep a running scale of what every department does. So we're <mark type="inaudible" />  Jim Teague in his deal and Bill Ordemann in there. Bill is in charge of all the assets and the costs of them, where Jim is in the marketing side. We keep those type of things within the company to figure out how our people are doing and how they're doing things relative to all of our peer groups. So that's where he really comes in play also. I just wanted to get that color out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Yves, in addition to that, Chris has storage from our storage subsidiaries that he pays for. So that's a cost to him, it's income to the storage affiliates. Same thing with the pipelines, where he's paying pipeline rates for capacity. It's showing up as revenue for the pipeline affiliates and a cost for him. So the seven million is after all of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Can I &#x2013; just two follow-ups to that. Number one, Chris, how much does it cost today to cycle gas from storage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a variable basis, Yves., or what's the rental fee for the actual capacity for the storage itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The latter. I'm trying to handicap how much can you actually bring to the bottom line on a $2 spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a salt facility, on a salt dome facility, you need more than $2 spreads to make money. On a traditional reservoir, a $2 spread will make you money. Typically you're under lease &#x2013; typical reservoir storage winter-summer, you're looking at about $1.80 is your cost. By the time you get your carrying costs and all that things in there, it's about a breakeven proposition to be honest. It's a matter of how do you use that facility and don't worry about the winter-summer spread as much as the weekend-weekday cash market and futures market are &#x2013; moves at a different speed. If cash and the futures moved in the same, in unison with each other, storage is less valuable, but like &#x2013; for example, you'll see weekends at Waha that will &#x2013; it'll go down to &#x2013; in the middle of December, we were buying gas at $2.80 out at Waha on the weekends and selling it on $3.80 during the weekdays. So a dollar spread weekend to weekday, where the futures is, as you see, in the NYMEX looking on the newspaper every day, you see that $2 spread and say wow, that's good money. That is good money, but it's how you use it on a daily basis is where really the value is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I promise my last couple of questions here. One is, is there a need for additional storage capacity and do you think Enterprise will boost the budget to do that? And the second is could you just elaborate why expenses are going up on the on the Texas Intrastate System?</p>

          <p>Let me take the first crack at the storage. There is a lot of new storage facilities that are being put in place. We've got record amounts of gas, it seems, that are in storage every week, but we have decided not to do a lot more in developing additional storage at Petal or some of our other facilities. We do expect that Chris will continue to look at storage assets owned by third parties and contract for some of that capacity in locations where it fits his business, but right now, we don't see a need to own substantially more.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Yves, as far as your question on &#x2013; as far as the expenses on the Texas Intrastate, a couple of things. One, as Hank mentioned in his notes on DEP, there was actually an imbalance settlement in the fourth quarter of 2007, and that's a favorable settlement. So, if you would, that reduced operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2008. So it wasn't necessarily that you were seeing a big increase in other operating expenses. Pipeline integrity expense was up a little bit, but not that much. It was mainly more attributable to that settlement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi good morning. My question is are you guys seeing any situations where because of low gas prices producers are cutting back drilling? And I understand that you have your pipelines basically fully subscribed out for the next five or six quarters. But are there any situations where if I look say, eight or ten quarters out, we could have a situation where producers are cutting back drilling because of lower commodity prices, and now once your pipelines, once that six or &#x2013; five or six quarters that you have where you're fully subscribed, once that runs out, you may be running at less than 100% capacity or something below your ideal capacity, because there just doesn't as much gas coming on at lower commodity prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. I think our view is if prices go too low and too many rigs are laid down, the price boomerangs and rigs come back up &#x2013; and that's the reality of the market. So no, I'm not really concerned about three years down the road, not having anything in the pipes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim also had mentioned earlier that there are a number of wells that have been drilled and waiting on assets to get complete so they could connect. So there's no reason to expect that's not going to happen; that's new gas supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, what is the price at which your incremental capacity is coming through your pipe, meaning what price do you feel like you need to where the pipes are basically fully subscribed over long periods of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really more of a function of what's the price of gas in which locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It varies by location. I mean, if you are in one location, you may need $4; if you're in another location, $3 works. I guess also you probably hadn't seen the service companies' fees coming down yet. As those come down, that price you need becomes even lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the finding and development cost makes a difference too and frankly we're focused more in the areas with the lower finding and development costs.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>This is Dan. Let me add a little bit of color on natural gas liquids, which also affects amount of gas that's produced. If the drilling activity continues to go down, and let's say they do produce less gas &#x2013; we don't think they will, while they may not grow much &#x2013; a lot of natural gas, but we don't think it's be reduced by any sizeable amount. But if they do reduce gas and you do get less natural gas liquids, then there's a lot of natural gas coming on in the Persian Gulf and Qatar and Egypt and West Africa. At those times, those also those claims on natural gas liquids over there.</p>
          <p>So, if you do back off gas here and you back off liquids, then we have the only major import terminal that feeds the total industry, not only the petrochemical industry, but the refining industry too, and the home heating deal. So those volumes would be brought into our import terminal and based on that, we make the same amount of money off of our import terminal or our export terminal, or every which way we go as we would from new production that comes on in Wyoming and Colorado. So we have the same revenue stream coming into us based on the overall demand in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now if you take the worst-case deal, you could do nothing and everybody goes down in the United States, I think the whole economy, to some extent, would be affected. And I think under that particular case we'd be affected to some extent, but we would probably be less affected than the other companies that are in the business, so I think anybody that's in the pipeline business gets less affected.</p>
          <p>But if we lose that last 10% volume in our pipeline, that's not our major profit. That first 10% is our major profit on the pipeline because it's moving either gas, crude oil, or natural gas liquids through a pipeline. When you get into that what we call fuller pipelines, you make very little profit off of them than with that last 10% because of the operating cost.</p>
