          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Volvo Report on the first nine months 2012. Today, I'm pleased to present Olof Persson, CEO. For the first part of this call, all participants will be in listen-only mode, and afterwards there will be a question-and-answer session. Olof, please begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome all to this Volvo Group third quarter conference call. There is a presentations on the web and I will guide you through by telling the page number I am talking to.</p>
          <p>So please follow me to page number two. And I think that the heading on this slide pretty much summarize the three dimensions that we have seen in this quarter; the slowing demand, the one-offs and the under-absorption.</p>
          <p>And as we have communicated earlier, we did see a one-off coming on the UD trucks and the restructuring of the UD trucks. And we also have then had warranty and an increase in the warranty provision, totaled the one-off to SEK 1 billion. The slide shows also then that we are now running on a SEK 318 billion 12 months revenue and if you do exclude one-offs in Q3 we have a SEK 25 billion 12 months rolling operating income.</p>
          <p>Then please move to slide three, where we &#x2013; as usual I will come back to trucks and CE. Just a few words on Buses, Penta, Aero and Financial Services; I think Buses is continuing to struggle on a very, very difficult market around the globe. We do see a continuation of &#x2013; a combination of low demand and high capacity on the European market and particularly city bus market. A lower than normal activity on the American market and Brazilian and South American markets, particularly Brazil who is still suffering from the switch over between Euro III and Euro V on the bus side.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we do see a good &#x2013; still a good level of buses. And as we have communicated, we have decided to &#x2013; in the European bus market and our production to concentrate that into our facility in Poland and that is a decision in principle and negotiations with Unions are ongoing on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Penta, I would say that the volumes and the market situation is still very tough. You do have a marine market that is perhaps, at the best, bottoming out in the U.S.; still very tough in Europe and also in the industrial engine side we have seen tough market conditions around the globe during the quarter. But still I must say that posting out 8.5% profit in a business environment like this is something that shows that Penta is working very hard on its cost control and flexibility.</p>
          <p>Slide five, we are going to see Aero and it coming in the quarter with a good result of 14.3%, SEK 1.6 billion and we of course wish them all the best in its future now within the GKN family.</p>
          <p>A few words on the Financial Services; in general a good quarter, SEK 11 billion new financing leading up to a 27% penetration, which is within the frame, I think it's healthy between the 25% and 30%. We do see that delinquencies and losses are low, the stability and the quality of our customer financing has proven healthy during the quarter. We are also now having a good profitability with SEK 383 million in the quarter. And of course now looking at the return on equity on a 12 months rolling, almost 11% and moving upwards towards VFS long-term target of between 12% and 15%.</p>
          <p>Moving into page number four, just quickly, I think the trends if you look at &#x2013; on our regional distribution is basically the same as we have seen in the previous quarters where Western Europe is down with 12%, Eastern Europe basically it's flat, North America up and then you have South America and Asia trailing downwards. Confirming the picture now, we can see that the upturn in North America is not offsetting the downturns in the other markets which means that we do have a decline quarter-over-quarter with 6% in our revenues.</p>
          <p>Also interesting to note that our split regional-wise now is 52% in North America and Western Europe, and we do have still of course major operations and activities, Asia still around the 22%, South America 10% and also Eastern Europe around 7%.</p>
          <p>I will come back with the &#x2013; more detail on Truck and CE but before that I will like to hand over to Anders, who then would go through the cash flow and the balance sheet a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, thank you. Let me talk a little bit about the cash flow there on the left hand chart on page number five. As you can see there, we are recording a negative cash flow for the quarter of a little bit more than SEK 7 billion, and now of course the main reason for this is in the headline. It's the production cutbacks that are affecting our payables negatively. Even though quarter three is not seasonally a very good quarter, of course, this is the major impact that we see really from the payables here.</p>
          <p>Then on the right hand chart, we see on the investment schedule that we have quite an ambitious one and the split up as we see here is really from the bottom on the leasing side primarily then Volvo Rents, a very important distribution channel for us where we have invested in a new fleet and this is more or less coming to a peak now in this quarter and now we have a renewed fleet in this activity and this distribution channel.</p>
          <p>Then of course, on the tangible side we have invested in &#x2013; primarily in growth markets, like in Asia and Russia on our factories and the new tooling side, whereas on the intangible side we see an increased capitalization of R&amp;D like on the Euro VI and the <mark type="ph" /> advanced technique (6:40).</p>
          <p>Flipping then to page number six on the capital efficiency side, you see on the left hand side our CCC days and the affecting elements there. I'm keeping a very close watch then on the inventory. Now our inventory is flat in absolute terms, but we are showing then a slight up trend in relation to sales, and of course this is something that we are addressing and that we really keep a very close eye on. And again on the CCC days, uptrend into 28; from an historical point of view, still a very good number, but there again we have to close &#x2013; keep a very close watch on this.</p>
          <p>Finally then on the right hand graph we see on our ROC, down from the peaking 28%, but still yielding a very good 23% on our investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Anders, I am now moving on to page seven and I would like then to spend a little bit more time in discussing with you the Trucks and then also the Volvo CE.</p>
          <p>On page seven you can see the trend lines in sales and the bridges and basically what you can see here is of course is the same <mark type="ph" /> region of (7:59) distribution as we have for the group in total, with ups and downs in the different margins &#x2013; markets, sorry. And then looking at the operating income then showing at SEK 2.8 billion or SEK 6.2 billion if you exclude the one-off cost basically trailing on a decent level in profitability in the underlying business.</p>
          <p>But of course, the quarter three and I would like you to follow me into page number eight and there looking at the trends in Q3. And we can clearly see that we did have a declining demand in the different markets. And what happened during the quarter was actually that September, which is normally a growth month where we start to see the orders coming in and order them to fill up the production for the autumn &#x2013; didn't come in.</p>
          <p>I would say that this uncertainty that we have said in Europe, spreading from southern part of Europe via France then also went into the rest of Europe. We also saw the uncertainty in North America coming through as well.</p>
          <p>And I would say that Russia, Eastern Europe and Brazil, you could add those &#x2013; through Russia and Eastern Europe to this line as well. We saw a decline in demand and a lot of uncertainty. But in Brazil and Russia and Eastern Europe, we saw basically good signs and in the case of Brazil we have seen, I would say confirm good trends coming into the order intake.</p>
          <p>This has led also that the inventory levels, which Anders also talked about, has been our absolute focus here. Because when you see those kind of development, our reaction is very much to keep a close eye on the inventories to make sure that we don't go into this kind of uncertain situation with a high, too high of a production rate.</p>
          <p>And we took a number of actions that you can see on the right hand side in the quarter three to proactively and conscious decisions to react quickly and also making sure that we are adapting the production level. And as always, it starts with our component manufacturing engines and transmission. And we have taken that down in the quarter with 10% to 20%. We have also then followed up with lower production rates for Volvo in Brazil, stop weeks in U.S., and then we also took the decision in quarter three to be implemented during quarter four with a further reduction in the Renault Trucks production systems by 20%.</p>
          <p>This kind of breaking that we have done means also that we have the under-absorption cost. The breaking cost in the system and that amounted in the quarter as under-absorption cost of SEK 600 million.</p>
          <p>Now looking into Q4, we have, of course, a number of actions and also focuses that we have. First of all, I would like to stress that we do have a further readiness to adjust production, if needed and if the order intake does not support the production levels that we have.</p>
          <p>We also said that we will be &#x2013; I would say more active in our market activities in order to find and be really &#x2013; of course, on a selective basis, see if we can get market, get businesses into our production system by being slightly more aggressive in certain markets and certain segments around the globe.</p>
          <p>And focus will very much be for the fourth quarter to ensure that we are adapting our production capacity together with adjusting our inventory levels in order to be really fit for [Euro] V going into our assumed market that we are down forecasting for 2013. So that would be very much in focus going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving down into page number nine, we are looking at the order intake and the numbers are there for you to review and you can &#x2013; I think I would like to highlight that we are having the same book-to-bill as in Q2 &#x2013; 90% &#x2013; that you can see also that South America, and that is particularly Brazil now, have a book-to-bill of 116% and you also see that we do have an increase there of 19%.</p>
          <p>You could also note for instance that Mack, which we discussed in the second quarter who had high negative number because of the high order intake in Q1, now it's coming back with a sequential, better order intake to 41% and moving then up to the book-to-bill rate substantially higher than we saw in the second quarter. However, of course, the book-to-bill rate if you look at the right hand side is something that we follow extremely careful and I think that the trend you see on the right hand side of the chart shows now how fast we are and how fast we have become in order to really adjust our orders &#x2013; sorry, our deliveries &#x2013; with the order intake that we are getting.</p>
          <p>One important part in relation to this slide is, of course, our market share; how are we doing on the markets. And if we take, on the European market, we are continuing to have a historically high market share level. We have dropped a little bit, if you look at the rolling 12. On the other hand, in U.S. on a 12 months moving we have increased our market share, and the same goes in Brazil where we also have somewhat increased our market share. So we are keeping our market position on the important markets that we're talking about and that is also very much important to me.</p>
          <p>If we then would sort of look at the first small indications of October, I would like to say that if we look at Europe we see a cautious stabilization in the order intake, but, that it is very early, but it is a cautious stabilization. If we look at U.S., we start to see a small signs of improvements and I would say in Brazil we definitely see clear signs of improvements in terms of the order intakes. So that is basically the reading we can do from the first, call it three weeks in October.</p>
          <p>If you then move to page number 10 and look at first our 2012 forecast, it's unchanged throughout all the different regions. We do 230,000, 250,000, 90,000 and 30,000 in Europe, North America, Brazil and Japan, respectively. And basically this is where we believe the market giving them the registration pace we see and the activity levels that we do see.</p>
          <p>And then if you look at 2013 forecast, we basically say that we do see a sideways movement into 2013. And let me go through then on the North America in both, in 2012 and also the forecast, we are continuing to see in the North America a reasonable-to-good level on the dealer side in terms of activity level. We do see the fright volumes are keeping up, the spare parts volumes are keeping up, the profitability of our end customer is holding; but there is an uncertainty, both in terms of the presidential election coming up but also the budget discussions that are ongoing in the U.S. at this point in time.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we do see a sideways movement and this is very much driven by the macroeconomic uncertainties that we definitely do have. Whereas we see in Brazil a slight uptick going from 90,000 to 95,000 on the back of this denominated financing and other stimulus activities that we have seen coming here at the back end of this year. And Japan, we then believe moving sideways.</p>
          <p>You then follow me into page number 11, talking about CE. And here, again, I would like to stress that what we see here is very much a scenario where CE, as we also pointed out in the Q2 report, where we have a market situation, where the markets have slowing down and weakened in a number of areas.</p>
          <p>If you look at the sales bridge, you can see that we are following basically the same trend as we have done previously over the years with the exception I would say with Asia, -25%. We have been able to &#x2013; thanks to our strong position in China &#x2013; holding up and holding against the market drop there throughout the year. Now we have two impacts I would say, one is of course China continues to be on the low side and then also, the drop in mining in South East Asia, which is of course, also an important part or a part of our business, which then is in that region.</p>
          <p>Due to the fact that we have a break &#x2013; put on the brakes very hard in order to make sure we get the pipeline right and when I talk inventories &#x2013; the complete pipe by not only our own inventory, inventory and production and all the others but also the whole way out to our dealers to make sure that we are having a balanced pipeline going into 2013.</p>
          <p>And if you go on to page number 12, we expand a little bit more of that when we look at the trends in Q3. And as I said before, we do have a weakening construction market and actually a rapid slow-down in mining. Now if you look at mining and the importance of mining and as you know, we are in the so-called light mining segment and not in the heavy mining; approximately 14% of what we see is units are in mining.</p>
          <p>We believe and we see that the industry as such has quite high inventory levels; that, in combination with the lower demand, means of course that we do have a price pressure and we have seen that price pressure coming throughout in the different markets. And we do also then see that we have an order book reduction.</p>
          <p>I think that if you look at the actions implemented in Q3, we can see that we started to break quite early and if you remember from page number 11, the decline of sales, it's 9%. But if you look at number of produced units quarter-over-quarter, it's actually 35% lower.</p>
          <p>And of course, if you break that hard, which I absolutely think is a right thing to do, looking at the pipeline and looking at the inventory situation, I think that we also see that now by doing this for five consecutive months means also that we do have a positive cash flow for the first nine months in Volvo CE despite the lower end. And again, it's a conscious decision of stepping on the brakes. It is something that we do in order to prepare ourselves for next year, and I can assure that we come in to 2013 in a good shape.</p>
          <p>But also here, if you look at actions in Q4 and going forward, we, of course, are looking very much on having the readiness to adjust reduction further if needed. And again, also here in Construction Equipment, we will have selected market activities in order to make sure that if we have good opportunities, we think it's strategically right to do so then, of course, we can also support the production system by going after some business.</p>
          <p>CE has been &#x2013; looking at this cost structure in what I would call a second wave. We had the first wave in CE when we sort of reshaped operation and started to focus on growing in China and elsewhere. Now, CE is in its second, three-year period in terms of strategy and are looking at right-sizing and looking at all kinds of costs in order to become more efficient.</p>
          <p>When we look at the markets, also here we have a &#x2013; if you take the midpoints in our <mark type="ph" /> countries (21:14) for 2013 we are basically looking at the flat movement of China, basically -5% to +5%. And Asia &#x2013; excluding China a little bit on the negative side, midpoint from -5%, I would call that due to the mining. In North America midpoint 0%, Europe midpoint somewhere south of 10%, due to the lowering in the market we have seen this year. And South America basically at midpoint 0%.</p>
          <p>We did do some updates for the 2012 forecast. We have before, in Europe, +/-0%, now it's a 0% to -10%. And in China the slowing down has continued and we now look at &#x2013; instead of -15% to -25%, we are looking at -25% to -35% and then it will go into more of a flat market next year.</p>
          <p>So if we then look at the page number 14, our second to last slide, summary. Slow truck orders in September. September normally a very important month to build up for the orders in production, it didn't happen and we took the actions. Flat inventories in Q3 in absolute terms, in relation to sales, we saw an upward trend in inventories &#x2013; very much in focus going forward. We will have an impact production of the September fallback also in Q4. And we will have other absorption also in Q4 due to the braking that we have done.</p>
          <p>Though we truly believe that those are the right decisions to make. We are not gambling on uncertainty; we're reacting on the same as we are getting. And we have now positioned ourself for the remainder of the year to have the right pipeline, to have the right production capacity and have the right cost structure in order to attack the market scenarios that we do see coming in 2013. And as I've just said, we have the markets basically moving sideways. That is our forecast and our best estimate at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Finally, I just want to give you an update also on activities we're doing on the strategy and this will be a recurring slide coming back in each and every quarter. As I promised at the Capital Markets Day, we have this time to report on the launch of the New FH, which is of course known. But also then the two right-sizing and changes that we're doing in our sales and marketing organization, the right-sizing of the UD Trucks and then the new sales and marketing organization for trucks in Europe, in Middle East and Africa. The UD Trucks right-sizing activity is completed and so much so that we know that it's now 950 employees including temporary that will leave us by January 1 of 2013 and that is actually 10% of the total work force in Japan that we're now right-sizing.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the sales and marketing organization for Trucks in Europe, Middle East and Africa, we have given you a guidance for a restructuring cost of SEK 900 million that will come starting in Q4. We are in the midst of negotiations and discussions. So I would not comment more upon it today, but we will of course come back to the market when we have more to tell about this, but we thought it would be good for you to have that as a guidance that we do see restructuring costs coming also on this one.</p>
          <p>So I would like to just stress that the activities that we are doing in the third quarter and the way we adapt our production capacity in order to position ourselves going into next year has no impact on the speed, agility and the determination in order to go on and execute on the 20 targets that we presented at the Capital Markets Day.</p>
          <p>And just as a final note, I can also tell you that we are going in now to start our frames discussions when it comes IS/IT costs, when comes to R&amp;D, when it comes to say some marketing activities for 2013 in order to align ourselves to meet the 2015 targets, long-term. So that process is set up and will be up and running.</p>
          <p>And by that I would like to conclude my presentation and leave the floor open or the telephone line open for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Nicomai Gerard from Commerz  E&amp;G (26:45) please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Regarding the I-Shift production you have shifted to Hagerstown, Maryland, to United States, you said you have reduced the component production for engines and transmissions. Will that affect the Maryland production and will be imported from Sweden, or will you be keeping the same production level for I-Shift in Sweden &#x2013; in Maryland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will &#x2013; our distribution channels &#x2013; our distribution channel, the way we support our production system in terms of engines and transmission, that is set and we will not change that. So the volumes that are coming and going into the American market will be produced in Hagerstown as before. Then of course that volume will be reflecting the volume that we see on the American market; but the way we support and supply our internal system will not change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Frederic Stahl from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. It's Frederic here from UBS. Three questions please. First of all what do you estimate the payback will be on the SEK 900 million of restructuring you're taking in Q4?</p>
          <p>The second question would be on, well if you could explain, it was a while since we had this kind of destocking you're going through now; if you could explain the moving parts behind the mechanics, behind the relatively small reduction in book value of inventory versus the destocking you've done and the hit to P&amp;L you got. So if you can just give some color on that, that would be great.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the Bus business, I guess this is more of a strategic question, but given that you're now going through a relatively large change in &#x2013; across the group, isn't it also time to review buses, the future of buses within the group, is this really an asset you want to keep in the long run? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I take number one and number three and then I think Christer, if you then give a little bit of light of the &#x2013; on the second question. Frederic, when it comes to the payback of the SEK 900 million, I would like to come back to that once we have the discussions and negotiations that are ongoing right now finalized, and that we can and we will communicate. So, I would like to come back to you on that once we are finished with that and being able to communicate more exactly.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the Bus, I've been very clear that I do see a large synergies in the Buses on the engine side, on the chassis side, on the electronic system side, and also on the new technology side &#x2013; just to mention hybrids, for instance. Now that doesn't mean that we can have a Bus business that is running on a sub-average profitability and we need to and we have taken for instance a restructuring step now in &#x2013; and a decision in principle, regarding city bus reduction in Europe and we will continue to try to drive that profitability up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frederic, its Christer. Can you repeat the second question you had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just wanted to understand your &#x2013; the book value of your inventory has only changed very little between the quarters here, but you have destocked and you've taken a big hit in the P&amp;L as a result of that. I was just wondering what the &#x2013; you know what's behind this. How does the mechanics work here behind the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can say the inventory &#x2013; when we look at increasing inventory, we were referring it to it &#x2013; in relation to sales, because it can &#x2013; when sales is declining and you're sitting on an inventory, it can very quickly become a problem. So you are right that in absolute terms the inventory was more or less flat, but measured in relation to sales, it's increasing and that's what's concerning.</p>

          <p>I was more interested in how the under-absorption &#x2013; you know how the mechanics behind that calculation works, but we can take that after the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The under-absorption is more related to the production. I mean when we talk about the increasing inventories, we actually look at what you have outstanding in the  dealer network as well. So you have, for instance, how we saw the pipeline inventory increasing in Construction Equipment; it was not only our inventory, it was the whole dealer network that started to become too much inventory, and then that's what we are looking at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. It's Alex White at JPMorgan. I wonder, could you talk &#x2013; I've got three questions, please. Firstly, could you talk a little bit more about Construction Equipment within Asia? Just wondering if you can give us some sort of indication of the Q3 volume development in China relative to the rest of Asia?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Buses, can you give us an indication on what it will take to get back to a breakeven level and when you think this might be achievable?</p>
          <p>And lastly, some idea around what we should expect from a cash flow perspective in Q4? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When it comes to construction equipment in China, it is of course a &#x2013; and I think we have there a 25% decrease in Asia, and big part of that is of course in China following the market. And what we have seen before, as I said, in the quarters up to this one, we have been able to hold that up rather well with our market share.</p>
          <p>I would like to add to that, that despite this, it is a very important market still even with this drop and it's also good to see that we continue to be number one in China with SDLG and the Volvo brand together. So we are holding our fortress, we're holding our positions in China on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Buses, there are &#x2013; and we are looking at lot of different activities in order to increase the Bus profitability. But I think also that at the end of the day there has to be a jive between what we are doing in terms of getting profitability and markets as well there. But, definitely there are lot of things that we can do ourselves and that we are addressing and we are in discussions with that, so.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the cash flow, Anders, perhaps I can leave that question to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On Q4 of course, it's very hard to give an estimate or a forecast here. It's a matter of a really the inventory reduction that we are working quite heavily on of course and we are expecting and we are forcing ourselves to really reduce the inventory and make an impact on the cash flow for Q4.</p>
          <p>Also we have other things like the payment pattern for a company like SDLG that we are quite dependent on of course. And then the major question of course is the development on payables in a scenario where there are pulled breaks and so on in the production system; and of course, that is the major thing that we need to watch very closely.</p>
          <p>So in essence, it's very hard to give a fair estimate. Seasonally Q4 is a good, the best, quarter for us. And so it was the last, the year before that, and of course our aim and our focus here will be to produce a very good cash flow for Q4.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. (sic) [Ms.] (35:24) Laura Lembke from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello Laura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine. This is Laura from Morgan Stanley, sorry.  I actually just have two questions left. The first one is on your production cuts, just coming back to this. I mean, based on the market outlook that you've given us both for the end of this year and also into 2013, I mean, can you confirm, or is it the right way to look at it and to say, unless you see a further deterioration in end markets, we won't see any further effects from that say cost under absorption post-Q4? Is there anything else to come that we will see in Q1 2013?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is regarding your outlook. Obviously, I mean, you're expecting truck and construction markets to remain largely flat next year; but then on the other hand, you've made some kind of positive comments in &#x2013; that for example, October was shaping up a little bit better than expected. So I'm just trying to really reconcile the two statements. I mean would it be fair to say that your 2013 guidance mainly reflects the lack of visibility that you have today, but maybe there is some scope that markets could actually develop a little better? Is that the right way to look at it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, when it comes to the production cut and the aligning, both in terms of the production and pipeline inventory, we are of course doing that in order to get into shape based on the forecast and the market estimations that we're doing. So we're trying to keep consistency saying that on one hand now we see the market and we do forecast the market of this size and therefore, we are shaping ourselves into that market development. And by doing so, we also then of course are looking at in the 2013 where we should be in balance.</p>
          <p>Now, you can have and we do state in the forecast as well that for instance in U.S., even though we're talking about the flat market, we say that with the uncertainty that we do have there, in terms of the presidential election and the budget discussions, that we are forecasting a slower Q1.</p>
          <p>And those kinds of effects you can have Laura in this one. But as a whole and as a market of course, that is our aim then to make sure that we are in line and that we are balanced, if you look at it from a full year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the forecast, we have tried to midpoint our results, taking in all these kind of different inputs that we're getting with pluses and minuses, risks and opportunities and trying to put ourself in a situation where we midpoint ourself into the forecast that we are putting forward here and that's exactly what we have done.</p>
          <p>For instance, in Europe, we have the uncertainty, not on a macroeconomic level, but we also have the Euro V, Euro VI uncertainty, how would that play out during the year, next year, it's very difficult to say. So, of course, it's a combination of the visibility, as usual. On the other hand, we are also then utilizing all that data crunching that we are normally doing in order to put our forecast together, and this is the best estimation that we can do. And then, of course, you have opportunities and risks to that service, so that's a little bit what we're doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Question on the warranty reserves that you talked about previously and you mentioned in your report. The adjustment that you make, is that reflecting a certain specific issue that you've had, or you're also higher-ing the warranty per vehicle going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a little bit of the selected market activities that you are mentioning, if you can give some further color on that it would be appreciated, what you really intend to do. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When it comes to the warranty position and the increase, we're talking about a legacy problem. That is what we are having and what we see. When we take the &#x2013; I think Christer did mention &#x2013; but it's around SEK 8 billion, we went in this year with SEK 8 billion of warranty reserve. And we then look at the activities that we do have on the first half year and then the first nine months of activities, and we do see then that we in order to fulfill our warranty commitments and other things that we have, that we have it under, under provision you can say. And therefore, we need to add that to it and that is the one-off time that we're doing that, so there is &#x2013; and then on the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you're not changing the amount reserved, probably, you can going forward or it's an adjustment for activities in the past only?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is more a legacy issue that is related to quality issues that we had some time ago and then that we are adjusting for now. So it should not impact going forward as the quality on the product coming off the lines today are at the right level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you, and then the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then when it comes to the other issues. I mean, when we say that there is selective marketing activities that is, when we see that we have from a strategic point of view or that we have a tactical point of view that we can actually by being more aggressive than we have been before. And I'm not only talking price here, it's the total offer that is important to remember &#x2013; everything from financing to customer support agreements and what have you. Then we have said that we would be more open to do that.</p>
          <p>But I want to stress that we are and I truly believe this is the right strategy. Very careful about the pricing discipline because it's easy to get into the trap and do something now that it would be difficult to recoup at the end. But on the other hand, I also think that there is always a way also for us to make sure that we protect market share and by that also getting individual units out, which then have a good basis for our fleets in the different markets. So it's not going to be sort of a general thing. It's going to be surgically and it's going to be tactical, it's going to be strategically and we're going to work on the whole pallet offering that we have to the customer.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon. I've got two questions please. Firstly, the thing that really struck me in your numbers today, Penta sales down 15% and the margin is down two percentage points, CE sales down 8% and there the margin halves. I know you've had some issues on under absorption, is my next question. But could you talk a bit about the structural difference, maybe is Penta best managed, does it having an inherently more flexible cost base, does it have a shorter inventory pipeline because it was quite a stark difference between the two businesses.</p>
          <p>And my second question is, can you explain in more detail what you mean by under absorption; now you have this big number of SEK 1 billion, is that because you're running production currently below sales or you're running production more slowly than it was a year ago? And also I'd like to know what the cost levels are like in the Trucks and inventory because I'm assuming if you've been running your production more slowly for Trucks you ended up with the end of the quarter with a high unit cost and therefore you have a headwind in Q4 even if production rates normalize just because you're delivering and invoicing high cost trucks you made during the course of the third quarter. So if you could help us understand what that SEK 1 billion actually is, that would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me then &#x2013; I mean, when it comes to Penta and comparing that to CE or the Trucks there are of course structural and business differences that are definite. I mean if you look at the process of marine business for instance, you have had marine business down now for quite some time. We're almost talking a couple of years of the rather low, and that means also that you have had time in Penta to really adjust the cost structure and the flexibility in the system on the marine side.</p>
          <p>When you look at on the industrial engine side that is basically engines coming out from our engine system and it is a selling on engines from our engine factories into OEMs and others who are dealing them with versatile products or power generation, which is of course an easier to adapt and also to manage in terms of cost structure and making sure that you get that out. So they are definitely structured, but I wouldn't take away the fact that they have done a very good job in order to manage the downturn in a good way.</p>
          <p>But I wouldn't compare them. And it is a &#x2013; if you look at VCE, if you look at Trucks &#x2013; it is a much more complex business, and as I said, one of the key things is that they have been on a very sluggish market now for almost two years on the marine side in particular where they have their own manufacturing and have been able then to adjust to that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the SEK 1 billion then I would like to hand over to Christer and see if you can do a short explanation around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, it comes back to the standard cost system and how that is set up. When you are producing you have surcharges added to each and every product you produce and then it goes into inventory. Surcharges for fixed costs, whether it's depreciation or other type of fixed costs that you have in manufacturing, and when you produce less, you will add less surcharges and less of the cost <mark type="ph" /> flows (46:29) in the plant will go into the inventory and surcharges and the variances will actually be impacting the P&amp;L immediately in the month that you have a difference. So if you have set the normal standard cost at 100 and you are producing 90, you will get the variance of 10 in the quarter that is incurred.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the theory. I am interested in the practice. What does SEK 1 billion mean? What are you comparing to? Because it's a very big number and if you're giving these numbers it's <mark type="ph" /> qualified (47:07) to know what they mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's you can say, the actual cost is of course all the cost of blue colors and white colors et cetera that we have in the manufacturing operation. And then in the standard cost systems, you add a certain portion of those costs to each and every product that is then produced and going to inventory and then later on sold. But in this quarter, we were producing very few units, so the variances became very high and that you get immediately into the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But surely you don't get it until you actually deliver the truck, so &#x2013; and I am assuming you allocate your direct payments every month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You get the gross profit when you sell the truck, but the variance, you get in the month you have it, so to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the SEK 1 billion is compared to a normalized production run rate not necessarily what you're selling or what you sold last year, but a notional normalized rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for each plant you have a normalized production, let's say that two of the plants will have a normalized production of the 25,000 trucks. And if we were to produce that number of trucks it's &#x2013; the variance would be zero. But if we are under-producing we are &#x2013; you can say, we get the variance or we have to adjust the standard course down let's say to 20,000 and then the unit, we will burden each and every unit produced with a higher surcharge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just &#x2013; my last question on this, can you tell us how production ran versus sales? What's the percent &#x2013; what sort of percentage of sales you're running at in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number I don't have on top of my head right now, Peter, because really what's happened is, we started to break the component manufacturing engine and gear boxes quite a lot. And then you have a lead time until you see the assembly operations breaking and to put those production &#x2013; I don't have that up here now Peter, we would have to look into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's been helpful, what you're saying, I just wanted to understand more about to help us model going forward there where that number comes from so I can understand more of the sensitivity. Thanks for the &#x2013; your commented answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that a conclusion is that when you break production you get the negative variance in the month it is incurred. You could say the alternative would be to continue to produce and put that cost into inventory if you want, but then you have an inventory problem.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Andreas Brock from Nordea. I have one question. A lot of companies have reported weak September sales, but something big happened for you in September as well. You launched your FH new truck. I know when you talk to people in the industry they are very excited about this new truck. Do you think that has had any impact on your sales? Perhaps, on your orders perhaps customers decided to wait a few months to evaluate the new truck?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I believe the order book is open for this new truck, how have the orders developed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in general you can say that I totally agree with you that the excitement in the industry is very high for this new truck. And I think also that the excitement of the classic, or let's put it the Icon FH that we are now selling is also very high and we see a lot of interest in that.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't say that we see that and we know how to handle these kind of switchovers between products. We have done it before and we know how to handle in terms of managing the customers and expectations, and the renewal that the customers need. So I wouldn't say that we have seen any of that yet.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the perception and then also the situation for the new FH, I am not &#x2013; I don't think we are normally giving that kind of information at this point in time, but I can say that the interest and the perception has been very good in terms of interest risen by the new FH.</p>
          <p>So the conclusion is &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; see that the September numbers and what we see going forward here has been impacted by this new truck. And when it comes to the orders, it's great interest and a lot of positive comments, but we do not comment upon the order intake on it.</p>

          <p>We can say also that it's really in the second half of next year that we will have volumes ramping up. We are starting some lower production in March and  gradually ramping up, but it really &#x2013; as we come into the second half of next year, so that's why we would say &#x2013; I would say that orders will start to come in more into next year for the new version.</p>
