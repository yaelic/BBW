          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Total Earning Results Q2 2011 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson and CFO, Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello and thank you for calling. As usual, I will make some brief comments and then we will go to the Q&amp;A. We reported our second quarter results. Compared to last year, the adjusted earnings per share increased by 6% to $1.80 per share, reflecting the higher oil and gas price environment.</p>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter, which was a very good quarter, adjusted earnings per share decreased by 5%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes mainly due to seasonal maintenance in Libya as well as higher taxes including the new tax hike in the UK and Venezuela as well as mix effect in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>The upstream results include some other mix effect that I will comment on later. The downstream was resilient but lost some ground in an unfavorable environment and the chemicals segment continued to perform well. We have three specific items in the second quarter that I would like to comment on.</p>
          <p>First, effective April 1st our 12% share of Novatek is included in the income from equity affiliates and we are reporting our shale operation, which was 115,000 barrel per day net to Total in the second quarter. Under the IFRS rules, we have to amortize a large portion of the difference between the purchase price of $4 billion and the accounting value of our 12% share of Novatek's equity. This means that the contribution of about $50 million of income from Novatek was reduced by about $35 million of amortization. So our results include a net of $15 million. We expect this contribution to increase over time as Novatek's position grows and domestic gas prices in Russia increase.</p>
          <p>Second, in March 2011 CEPSA was moved from equity affiliates to assets held for sale. Under the IFRS rules, we no longer include the financial results from CEPSA but the on-stream production is recorded until the sale is completed. So we will have the volumes for July although the sale is essentially closed. For comparison, CEPSA generated about $75 million per quarter on average in 2010 and contributed about 25,000 barrel per day of production.</p>
          <p>And the last item is Sanofi. This was moved from equity affiliates to other investments at the end of the second quarter 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, Sanofi contributed &#x20AC;101 million that was on the income from equity affiliates line. And in the second quarter of 2011, Sanofi contributed &#x20AC;170 million of dividend in the other financial income line before tax. So a net contribution of &#x20AC;115 million.</p>
          <p>The environment, as you know, remains favorable for the upstream, challenging for the downstream, particularly in Europe, and stable for the chemicals. The Brent price has been well above $100 per barrel. European refining margins have been squeezed by high oil prices on one side and weak product demand on the other. Chemicals perform well and even without strong growth in the global economy, there has been good demand for our chemical products. The euro/dollar exchange rate has been volatile, leaving the dollar weaker against the euro. We are a dollar company, but this affected our results in euro. Macro concern over sovereign debt issues have affected euro index equity markets and we believe this has continued to have an impact on our share price.</p>
          <p>Just to wrap up on macro events affecting our industry. Production in Libya was disrupted in March and has been stopped. The impact on Total was 15,000 barrel per day in first quarter and 55,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. In Yemen, the Yemen LNG facility is operating normally. In Nigeria, following the election in April, there has been some unrest but the effect has been very limited.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we are continuing to move at a very active pace. This is illustrated by our second quarter highlights that include launching the Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II developments in the Norwegian North Sea, the start of the Angostura Phase II production in Trinidad and Tobago, the third discovery on Block 17/06 in Angola, plus a gas and condensate discovery in Bolivia, the acquisition of a 49% stake in the shale gas play in Poland, and the acquisition of an additional 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa project that raised our share to 75%.</p>
          <p>Upstream production in the second quarter was 2.311 million barrels per day. Compared to the previous quarter, production decreased by 2.5% mainly as a result of maintenance of the most part in the North Sea, and to a lesser extent in West Africa. Normal declines, the disruption in Libya, seasonal weakness in Norwegian gas sales, portfolio changes including the sale of Cameroon and the PEC price effect. All these impacts were only partially offset by Novatek.</p>
          <p>In addition to the lower volume, the mix effect was very negative in term of net income per barrel in the second quarter. Maintenance affected some of our highest margin fields so the Novatek and CEPSA volumes represent about 6% of our production, but as I said, because of the accounting treatment, there was not much of a contribution to the net result. Looking ahead, maintenance will continue in the third quarter. However, by the fourth quarter we should be back to a normal production level and we will have the benefit of starting up the Pazflor field in Angola.</p>
          <p>We will make our media presentation in September. So we'll not make too many comments at this point except to say that we still expect 2011 to be basically flat compared to 2010. The outlook for production growth is strong and 2012 is expected to be a very good year.</p>
          <p>For the downstream and chemicals, we are making major changes in the portfolio. The sale of CEPSA has been completed and we should receive the funds today or Monday. This is &#x20AC;3.7 billion or about $5.3 billion. This marks our exit from the downstream business in Spain, meaning also that we have already exceeded our target to reduce worldwide refining capacity by 20%.</p>
          <p>In June, we announced the sale of our UK marketing business for about $600 million and we are continuing to work on the sale of our Lindsey refinery. This sale is taking more time than expected, but we are still in talks with potential buyers. At the corporate level, the balance sheet is very strong. Gearing at the end of the second quarter increased to 24%. This reflects the payment of the dividend for $3.6 billion, and also the funding of recent acquisitions, including SunPower for $1.4 billion and Novatek for $4 billion. In the second quarter, we received the cash from the sale of Cameroon for $100 million and the ongoing sale of Sanofi shale is $600 million. In the third quarter, our gearing should go down significantly after we receive the cash from the sale of CEPSA, UK marketing, the Gassled pipeline, and part of the regime.</p>
          <p>So the balance sheet is really very strong. With the portfolio changes announced so far this year, we expect to have about $11 billion of acquisition and about $10 billion of asset sales. CapEx excluding acquisition and asset sales was $5 billion in the second quarter, in line with our $20 billion budget.</p>
          <p>On dividends, we are now on a quarterly basis and we have announced that the next dividend that will be &#x20AC;0.57 per share payable on December 22nd. This is in line with our average 50% payout ratio. In fact, using the second quarter as a base, the payout is 46%. That concludes my prepared comments, and I am ready to start the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Alejandro Demichelis. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Two questions. The first one is, in terms of these maintenance going into the third quarter, should we assume that these going to be at a similar level to the second quarter? And then, in terms of your CapEx into the second half, should we assume that this is going to be at the run rate that you have seen so far this first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Alejandro. Your first question was maintenance. I think the maintenance level for the third quarter, you should expect the same level as the second quarter. On the CapEx rate, it's a $4 billion per quarter, about, so we expect our budget to be matched by $20 billion this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all I've got. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mark. Oh yes, I hear you very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. A couple of things. Will you account for SunPower on an equity basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we were unable to account SunPower this quarter because we didn't have the time to incorporate the result of SunPower due to the late transaction date. But we will account a full consolidation for it by third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you share anything with us in terms of the &#x2013; your &#x2013; the terms of your participation in the Yamal LNG project at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have signed a memorandum of understanding. We have not yet finalized the agreement. I think it will take maybe one or two more months to finalize it. But everything is progressing normally and you should expect something, I would say in two months time, the latest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just check back on your production comment, Patrick, for 2011 flat with 2010. I'm still assuming, as I believe was indicated previously, that that excludes Novatek.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our initial guidance was not including Novatek. But during a few events happened &#x2013; first of all this was at $80. So you have the price effect. Then you have the sale of CEPSA, which took off 25,000 barrel per day. Then we lose the Libya production, which is about 55,000 barrels per day for our share, so in aggregate Novatek, she being used by all those events. And now we're flat at $110 per barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Flat at $110?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Patrick, it appears to me, although obviously given the disclosure, I can't be sure. It looks to me that the LNG earnings in this quarter were really quite weak. Can you comment on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can comment a little bit. But I'm not sharing with view exactly. We have been able to catch seven cargos this quarter. And I think, basically Nigeria LNG is doing well. We had good result, but it's in equity. The LNG impact was unfortunately canceled by the impact of the Venezuelan asset. We have the PetroCede&#xF1;o, which is accounted using the equity method also, where we are facing fees of tax, which reduced the impact of the PetroCede&#xF1;o result. So in aggregate, I think we have a good contribution on LNG, as the volume were up by 12% in comparison to second quarter of 2010. You remember when we said in the past that LNG represent 25% of our net income? Today it's 30% of our net income for upstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you say 30%, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, three zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one final one from me on taxation. I guess from looking at the release that you booked the full impact of the 12.5% increase in the UK tax in the second quarter. And I'm not talking about the remeasurement of deferred taxes, but rather the operating effect. Is that accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, yes. It's cost about &#x20AC;60 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the tax rate on refining and marketing as well as chemicals, Patrick, was also a bit high in this quarter. Any particular reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far on the top of my mind, I'm sorry, I can't answer this question. I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mark, and I hope to see you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. Just got more of a philosophical question really about the pace of acquisitions and divestments. And obviously we've seen a lot of those over the last several months. Do I get the impression from reading your release that the pace of this is now coming to an end, or at least slowing down dramatically? I know you're focusing the company more on delivering from those acquisitions, rather than still being in the mode, if you like, of trying to reshape the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true, Iain, that we did a lot. This first semester, we acquired about $11 billion of assets, which is a lot. I'm not so sure we are able to continue at this pace, and you are right that we need to make those assets delivering results now. Nevertheless, we are still open to opportunities. And I don't want to be missing opportunities. I remind you that we have a very strong balance sheet, enabling us to take our option to make other acquisition if there is a possibility, but there is nothing in the top of my mind yet. But I want to leave it open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one other thing. Given the slow pace of Lindsey, I presume we should assume that's going to be a 2012 event now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, I don't know, but hopefully we try to secure something by end of this year. Being frank with you, we were in talk with a buyer. We were very close to conclude, and this buyer wasn't able to secure its financing. So we had to switch to another one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I, just for the last one, just ask you the obvious question the other integrators have been asked in this earning season? Having seen what some of your U.S. competitors are doing in the downstream, is that something which at all appeals to Total, or are you still very much an integrated company, as far as you're concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as we are concerned, we are an integrated company. We see some benefit of it, and as there is nothing in the pipeline to break up the company today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no great surprise. Thanks very much, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Hi, Patrick. I have three questions. The first is on Novatek, on the amortization rate. Could that fall over time if you prove up more reserves? Is it something that you've allocated to the resources that you've acquired, and therefore you could see a falling amortization rate as you prove out more resources from what you have acquired?</p>
          <p>Second question is just on the payout ratio. I noticed you referenced again a target to hit 50%, but do you think honestly that that is an appropriate metric for judging your dividend? My sense is that the way you've held it, there may be a feel that perhaps you'd overextended the payout ratio and maybe a better mix in the next year or so as things sort of play out with the dividend and buyback.</p>
          <p>And the third is just coming back to Ian's question on Lindsey, is I think again you referenced in your remarks that you hadn't anticipated the sale of CEPSA. Correct me if I'm wrong, but my sense on Lindsey always was that although part of it was to sell the refinery because you wanted to reduce refining, but also that selling a U.K. refinery is a rather more straightforward process. So having reduced your refining cover anyway, I mean would it be part of your thought process to say, well fine, we're happy with the refining cover we have, and we'll hold Lindsey for another time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Novatek, we amortize the difference between the purchase price and the equity value of Novatek under 1P reserves. So technically there were &#x2013; there if more discoveries in the 1P reserve of Novatek increase, the amortization will reduce mechanically. As of today, the amortization rate is about $35 million per quarter. Obviously, we expect not only an increase of the reserve by Novatek, but also an increase of the production; that's why bought 12% of Novatek. And the effect of Novatek in our net income will increase gradually to the roof of production and the increase of the gas price also in Russia. So that was on Novatek.</p>
          <p>On Lindsey, when you said we did not expect CEPSA, actually we were in talks on CEPSA &#x2013; we started talking about CEPSA more than a year ago internally with IPIC. Obviously, we can't say that to the market, because we were not sure that we would be able to conclude the transaction. But it does not change our mind on Lindsey. I know and I have to tell you that I fully support the team in charge of that. It is extremely difficult to sell a refinery today. But we pursue this idea and we want to sell Lindsey. And hopefully, we have no potential barrier able to make it. And basically we wanted to be out of the U.K. market. Sorry to say that to a U.K. citizen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I very much like Total fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then your second question was about payout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've always been transparent about that and we always make it clear. You may like it or not, but our payout ratio target is the 50%, assuming an average oil price scenario. You're asking the question, could we make some more buyback, if I well understand your question. We haven't make any decision in that respect today. Our balance sheet is strong, but the ratio we are giving is still at 24. So it's not so low today. And so I repeat myself, but the payout ratio being the 50% target, this is what we see, and I think we will maintain it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one quick follow-up on Novatek. Can we basically assume you're going to execute the follow-up option that you have to acquire the additional stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we have the intent to do it. You need two parts, the buyer and the seller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will try at least to get the 15% stake. I think we can say that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. Could I ask, quite a lot of the acquisitions you've been making have been in the gas space and very specifically in LNG. Is that because that's an area where you think you add a particular edge, or is this because that's partly where the opportunities are now being offered? And will the group as a whole be looking to perhaps add a little bit more oil through non-organic processes as we move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lucy, for this question. First of all, we make acquisition where there are opportunities. We made acquisition in the heavy oil in Canada with Suncor. We made an acquisition in the LNG sector with Ichthys with GLNG, for instance. But you shall not forget that we also made the acquisition in Uganda, buying a 30% stake in the Block 1, 2 and 3 with Tullow being the one who discovered those blocks. So yes, we have some new in GLNG sector. We have a large expertise in LNG. That's why companies like INPEX or Santos call us to support them in their project. There is not only LNG, as I mentioned to you. We have been also, thanks to our good reputation of being a very good operator, called by Tullow for their oil discovery in Uganda.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And would you say there's any kind of geographic sort of bias in terms of your preferences or again, is it just where there's value, you will go?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no geographic preference. We are open to work mostly if it were where we are legally able to do it. There are some countries where we can't, like Iran, for instance, but that aside, we are open to every country.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow. Okay. Your comments regarding the Novatek amortization, you discussed it in the context of changes in proven reserves. I don't quite understand that linkage. I had thought that that amortization was dictated by the difference between purchase price and the equity value on the balance sheet of your interest, which is a function of a lot of different things other than just proven reserves. Could you help me understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I try to make it with my &#x2013; the amount to amortize is the difference between the purchase price and the equity value of the company. That's one part. You have to know at which pace you're going to amortize it. You will not amortize it at the unit of production, i.e., you take the ratio of your production divided by the 1P reserve, and then you have the ratio to compute the amortization for one particular year. The premium, the overall premium to amortize is $3.3 billion and it has been allocated 75% to proven reserves and 25% on potential resources.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi good afternoon, Patrick. I just have a couple of questions. Firstly on Ichthys LNG, I believe you've now contracted all of the off take for the project. At this point, are you still confident in an FID in late 2011 or early 2012? And my second question is on the Port Arthur coker. It's now in the commissioning stages, I think. Could you maybe quantify the contribution of the coker from 3Q onwards? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Kim. On Ichthys, we have contract all the volume already. By the way, we have already formalized about 65% of the GCC and we confirm that we will FID this project by late 2011.</p>
          <p>On Port Arthur Coker, unfortunately I can't quantify it yet. But the coker just recently started running at full speed and I think we will be able to update you next quarter when we will have one full quarter with the coker running perfectly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick. Two questions, if I may. The one on Libya, do you have, say, an estimated schedule if things were to settle quickly, and how many months will it take for Total to resume production and to produce 55,000 barrels per day rate? And the second question is on Pazflor. What kind of timing we can expect in terms of starting up and then reaching plateau?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Libya, we are not going to speculate and give you any estimate of how long it will take. Honestly, we don't know yet. I know that some of the operator give you some estimate, but honestly we are unable to do it now for our production.</p>
          <p>On Pazflor, we are quite close to start-up. It will be a start-up for the during the last quarter of this year and the ramp-up takes three to four months.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you for your interesting question and comment about Total. I would just like to remind you that we are having our first all-day Analyst Presentation in London on September 26. The focus will be on <mark type="audio gap" /> (31:57). We are obviously very enthusiastic about the major changes we have made in the portfolio and about the opportunities for growth that we have in front of us. And we believe that the comprehensive review is the best way to communicate with you. So I hope you will be able to join us on the 26th of September and for whom that means the good luck of having some vacation, good vacation.</p>
