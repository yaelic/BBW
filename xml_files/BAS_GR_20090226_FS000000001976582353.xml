        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to BASF's 2008 Annual Results Conference, here in Ludwigshafen. I would also welcome all those of you who are watching our webcast at this moment or who are listening microphone. Overall, I would like to say that BASF delivered a solid performance in 2008, despite a rapidly deteriorating business environment in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And we would like to talk about the BASF results today. And with me today are J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht, the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors; Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer; and Hans-Ulrich Engel, Member of the Board and amongst others responsible for the Oil and Gas segment and, in particular, he's also responsible for the Ciba acquisition.</p>
          <p>J&#xFC;rgen Hambrecht and Kurt Bock will review with you the 2008 financial results. They will also examine the business actions we have taken in 2008, and they will discuss how BASF will tackle the challenges ahead of us. Following their presentations, all three gentlemen will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remind you that we are webcasting this event. We have already posted all the numbers and charts on our website, as you know, and here the address of the website is basf.com/share. I also would like to ask you to please switch off your mobiles and your BlackBerrys.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to ask Dr. Hambrecht to start with his presentation.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our analyst conference today. 2008 certainly proved to be a turbulent year for the global economy but also for BASF. After a very good start we have been on track for a record year up into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We experienced a dramatic fall in customer orders, especially towards the end of the year, November and December, and we talked about it. The speed and the scale of this downturn have surprised not only me, most of you, most probably, too.</p>
          <p>1976 was the year when I joined BASF. This was a crisis year at that time from '74 to '76, this have been a crisis. We have experienced many more in the time in between, but never ever I really I have to say, have I seen and most probably all of you have not seen a dramatic downturn appearing in all regions at once.</p>
          <p>In this difficult environment BASF generated sales of 62 billion, exceeding the record level sales posted in 2007 by 8%. At 6.9 billion EBIT before special item was the third highest in history of BSF. Moreover we again generated a high operating cash flow of &#x20AC;5 billion and earned a significant premium on our cost of capital of 1.6 billion. However, earnings decreased because of the massive decline in demand in key industries and due to the fact that price increases could not fully offset higher raw material costs over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>We promised our shareholders, we promised you that we hold, we would pay a dividend at the previous year's level even in difficult times and we stand to this. This morning we have proposed to the annual meeting a dividend of &#x20AC;1.95 per share for 2008. The decision is subject to approval by the Supervisory Board. This offers our shareholders a dividend yield of almost 9% based on current share price. We stand by this dividend policy that we announced a few years ago.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to pass on Kurt, who will lead you a little bit more to the details &#x2013; through details.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks J&#xFC;rgen and also welcome from my side. As you already heard, 2008 was still a successful year for BASF despite dramatic headwinds in Q4. I will now present our financial result in more detail.</p>
          <p>From January to September 2008, sales increased by 11%. In the fourth quarter of 2008, sales declined by around 3%. This was a result of a dramatic decline in volumes of 13%, which was not compensated for by price increase and currency effects.</p>
          <p>Prices rose 7% versus prior year but declined about 10% in the chemical business compared with the third quarter of 2008. Obviously price and volume changes vary greatly from business-to-business as I will explain later.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, sales grew by 8% to &#x20AC;62.3 billion, mainly due to 12% higher sales prices. Volumes remained at the level of 2007.</p>
          <p>EBIT for the full year fell by almost 12% to approximately &#x20AC;6.5 billion due to the massive decline in demand in Q4. Fourth quarter EBIT dropped by 82% to &#x20AC;292 million. It includes special charges of &#x20AC;234 million versus &#x20AC;153 million in Q4 of 2007. Of this amount, &#x20AC;141 million were due to restructuring measures mainly related to the write-down of assets in the Styrenics business as a result of lower profitability.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of streamlining production capacities in this business. Furthermore, we shutdown the butanediol/THF facility in Korea.</p>
          <p>In the Coatings division we wrote down assets and established provisions for measures to improve the production and cost structure in the US, in Asia and in Europe. In the intermediates division we had to write down the butanediol plant in Malaysia due to unsatisfactory profitability. A special income of &#x20AC;28 million resulted from the reversal of a portion of the provision established in 2006 due to the mothballing of the THF plant in Caojing, China, which we had explained at that point in time.</p>
          <p>In 2008 the financial result declined by 28% to minus &#x20AC;487 million. In Q4 BASF reported a financial result of minus &#x20AC;288 million. The depreciation of the Russian ruble resulted in losses on foreign currency debt as the production company for the Yuzhno Russkoye natural gas field, which is consolidated using the equity method.</p>
          <p>Income before taxes and minority interest for the full year 2008 amounted to just under &#x20AC;6 billion, compared with almost &#x20AC;7 billion the year previous. In the fourth quarter of 2008 income before tax and minority interest declined sharply to &#x20AC;4 million. In the first three quarters of 2008 BASF generated net income of &#x20AC;3.2 billion. Due to the &#x20AC;313 million loss in Q4 net income for the full year declined to &#x20AC;2.9 billion, a drop of 28%.</p>
          <p>The loss in the fourth quarter is entirely attributable to our chemicals activities, whereas oil and gas contributed &#x20AC;339 million to BASF's net income. Net income for 2008 was also negatively impacted by the increase in the tax rate to 44.7% and by higher minority interest of &#x20AC;393 million that were mainly related to oil and gas. The increase in the tax rate was triggered by the higher level of non compensable income taxes on oil production, which rose by &#x20AC;549 million to almost &#x20AC;1.9 billion. And keep in mind in 2007 BASF benefited from non-recurring non-cash income of &#x20AC;229 million related to the German corporate tax reform. Earnings per share were &#x20AC;3.13, a decrease by 25% compared with 2007.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a closer look at how our segments performed in the fourth quarter. And our annual press conference report provides in depth information on our segment results so we'll only focus on the most important developments. First, Chemicals: in Q4 this segment suffered from a steep decline in demand, volumes were 10% below the level of last year's fourth quarter. Across all divisions BASF has taken action and has reduced capacity utilization rates worldwide and temporarily shutdown plants. In Petrochemicals margins came under considerable pressure from the decline in demand combined with new capacities in the market, mainly in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>From year high levels in Q3 2008 prices for many of our major basic chemicals collapsed in Q4. For instance, ethylene from a high of &#x20AC;1,200 per ton in Q3 to below &#x2013; to the low of 500, about &#x20AC;500 per ton in January; propylene from 1,000 to about &#x20AC;430 per ton. And in Asia and in the States, this development happened even faster.</p>
          <p>Sales increased only in the Inorganics division due to higher prices for basic products, especially ammonia and urea, which resulted in higher earnings.</p>
          <p>Now, Plastics. In the fourth quarter, our Plastics business was hit the hardest. The drop in demand in important customer industries such as automotive, construction, textile and furniture affected all regions and led to a significant loss. Production was adjusted. Inventories were reduced at lower margins due to the decline in sales prices compared with the previous quarter or written down in some cases.</p>
          <p>Sales in Performance Products were almost at last year's level. Income from operations before special items declined. Earnings improved only in the Care Chemicals division due to higher prices and lower fixed costs. Earnings in Acrylics &amp; Dispersions and Performance Chemicals declined due to considerably lower volumes and margins. Production was adjusted accordingly.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Functional Solutions segment declined, in particular, due to a significant drop in demand from the key industries, automotive and construction. In the Catalysts division, earnings failed primarily due to the weak performance of mobile emission catalysts.</p>
          <p>The loss in construction chemicals was driven by higher cost for raw materials, combined with very weak demand. Income from operations in Coatings was burdened by the implementation of the restructuring and efficiency measures I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Obviously, diversifying our portfolio and acquiring businesses with excellent competitive positions, based on technology and customer focus, is not much of a help when our customers just stop buying.</p>
          <p>The market trend for Crop Protection products remained robust in the fourth quarter. Positive currency effects in particular due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese Yen did not complete the offset negative &#x2013; slightly negative volume effects. Prices remained flat. Sales and earnings decreased slightly due to lower volumes mainly because customers in Europe brought purchases forward to Q3.</p>
          <p>We had a good fourth quarter in oil and gas. Lower oil prices led to a slight decline in earnings in exploration and production. However, this was more than offset by an excellent gas trading business. Higher volumes and finally, I have to say, improved margins helped to more than double the respective EBIT.</p>
          <p>Now comes our famous segment, our non-segment other. The sales decline in Other reflects a very difficult Styrenics business in Q4 and lower volumes and prices in raw material trading. The steep decline in earnings basically reflects the following: A loss in Styrenics, plus a write-down of certain of the assets following an adjustment of our production platforms, a very weak and negative fertilizer business in Q4 and finally expenses related to the hedging of raw material price risks.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss our cash flow statement. Following an increase in inventories and trade accounts receivable in the first three quarters, we succeeded in achieving a &#x20AC;2.4 billion reduction in the fourth quarter, in particular through our production cutbacks. This is also why we succeeded in generating fourth quarter cash providing by operating activities of &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Despite the loss &#x2013; it's at the same level as in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the full year, BASF recorded cash providing by operating activates of &#x20AC;5 billion and a free cash flow of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Even in Q4 we generated a free cash flow of about &#x20AC;570 million. At approximately &#x20AC;3.5 billion net expenses for investment activities we were slightly lower than in the previous year. In 2008 expenditures for acquisitions totaled &#x20AC;637 million, same level like the year before. This is basically related to the purchase of Revus Energy in Norway.</p>
          <p>We generated proceeds of &#x20AC;73 million from divestitures. A &#x20AC;2.5 million payments related to tangible and intangible assets were at the previous year's level and were again below corresponding level of depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>Cash provided by financing activities amounted to &#x20AC;459 million in 2008 compared with minus &#x20AC;2.2 billion in 2007. Between January and early October, we spend a total of &#x20AC;1.6 billion to buyback BASF stock.</p>
          <p>In view of the economic crises and the conditions on the capital market we have stopped the current program and will not ask this year Annual Meeting for authorization to repurchase shares. Our current authorization runs out in mid of October.</p>
          <p>Finally let's have a quick look at our balance sheet. The balance sheet total rose 9% to &#x20AC;51 billion, long terms assets rose by 1.7 billion. On the one hand this was due to higher intangible assets, primarily due to the acquisition of Revus Energy. On the other hand, a number of investment projects and increase in participations accounted for using the equity method as well as higher deferred tax assets also contributed to this rise.</p>
          <p>Inventories increased slightly compared with the end of 2007. Trade accounts receivables declined. Despite the global credit crisis, we further reduced the number of days of sales outstanding.</p>
          <p>Cash and cash equivalents increased significantly compared with the end of 2007 to &#x20AC;2.8 billion. Higher market values of derivatives held to hedge against currency risk contributed to the increase in other assets. Stockholders equity decreased by &#x20AC;1.4 billion, mainly due to our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Total financial debt at the year end was &#x20AC;14.5 billion and net debt &#x20AC;11.7 billion which was &#x20AC;2.4 billion higher compared with the end of 2007 and only slightly higher than at the end of Q3. Approximately 57% of our financial indebtedness was long term debt. Our medium to long term debt financing is based on corporate bonds with a balance maturity profile. In 2008, BASF issued several bonds totaling &#x20AC;1.6 billion as well as promissory notes of roughly &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>And let me state at no point following the Lehman bankruptcy, did we have difficulties in issuing commercial papers at very attractive conditions. In November 2008 and in January of 2009, we issued bonds for 1.25 and &#x20AC;1.5 billion respectively, compared with the market conditions were attractive, but reflect the higher returns expected by investors.</p>
          <p>In October 2008, we increased the maximum potential issuing volume of our commercial paper program from &#x20AC;7.5 billion to $12.5 &#x2013; sorry $7.5 to $12.5. As of December 31, we had used approximately $6.1 billion of this program. As back up for the program committed and unused credit lines of $6 billion are available as well as a credit line of CHF3.5 billion to finance the acquisition of Ciba.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the 2009 as you all followed Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's each downgraded their ratings of BASF by one notch reflecting an increased business risk in the wake of the economic crisis and our financial policy, which both agencies perceive as being shareholder friendly and we don't object to the latter statement. We did not expect to these decisions will have an appreciable impact on conditions for our short and long term capital market financing.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our financial performance. Let me now hand back to J&#xFC;rgen for the much more difficult task of taking a closer look at the year ahead. Thanks</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kurt. Ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the outlook, let me talk about a few other points which are, I think, important. We are tackling the challenges ahead at the right time, decisively, flexibly, and quickly. We will continue to take these actions at the right time, keeping a careful eye on costs and reducing them further is therefore our top priority to all employees in the company.</p>
          <p>As our brands portfolio, we are better positioned in a recession than many other companies in our industry. We are supported by our <mark type="inaudible" /> structure and the extent of our participation in markets like crop protection, nutrition, cosmetics, hygiene and, of course, also oil and especially gas. We remained solidly financed as Kurt has mentioned just and have one of the best ratings.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the most important thing is to safeguard our future and this is talking about innovation. During this economic crisis, we certainly will continue to finance our R&amp;D at the same level as we did in the past. So even in this challenging environment, we are a reliable partner for all of our stakeholders, I have to say. We also led the industry in immediately reacting to the downturn. By reducing, for example, production, shutting down plants, we managed inventories and accounts receivable as tightly as possible, and achieved the 2.4 billion reduction of our working capital in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We also accelerated the implementation of longer term measures, most of which are already having an effect and which will improve the long-term operational excellence even for us as we continue to optimize our production base. Examples are our planned closures of Coatings in U.S., Asia and in Europe. Kurt has mentioned the butanediol/THF plant in Korea and there is more to come.</p>
          <p>We will quickly indicate our recent acquisition and read the synergies. We have reduced our CapEx spending and we have accelerated restructuring and efficiency programs as, for example, NEXT, which is well known to you leading to at least &#x20AC;1 billion savings latest 2012, but already contributing in 2009 and '10.</p>
          <p>This relentless approach to operational excellence makes us more resilient in the current situation. Our fixed costs are continuously well below 40% of total costs. As a matter of fact, we are today at the same level of fixed costs as in the last downturn year in 2001, in absolute terms. And have doubled our business and outperformed the market in gross.</p>
          <p>Ciba and BASF, next topic. Our operational excellence in scale as well as our experience in successfully integrating businesses will also be the key success factor in quickly integrating Ciba and realizing the benefits, which are estimated and we have talked about this I think during our last conference call, estimated at least to reach the average synergies in the chemical industry during the last years, which is about 5.5%, based on sales and I have to say sales of Ciba. We expect the closure of the acquisition towards the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>One of the strengths of BASF over the last few years has been our strong cash flow generation. Even in the increasingly difficult year 2008, we have continuously generated a free cash flow 2008 about 2.5 billion. And our focus again will be in 2009 on cash flow generation. There has been some discussion about the use of our cash flow in 2009. And you would have asked for this anyhow later.</p>
          <p>With this chart here, I would like to show how we are adapting to the current market conditions. As I have explained earlier, we have put in place several measures to reduce our inventories in accounts receivable. From these measures, we expect a cash inflow of at least &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>We have already mentioned that we will keep the level of R&amp;D expenditure stable at 1.3 billion. We expect to reduce CapEx by about 20% from the 2.5 billion spend into 2008. In this way we improve our cash flow without limiting our ability to grow in the future. With regard to acquisitions, our focus is first and foremost on the integration of Ciba. We aim to keep the dividend stable, and as Kurt has mentioned we stopped our share purchase &#x2013; repurchasing program.</p>
          <p>Now, to the outlook: 2009 will be a year of unprecedented challenges. Following the dramatic drop in our global business in the forth quarter of 2008, demand for chemical products has not picked up since the start of 2009. A reversal of the trend is not yet in sight. On the contrary, the situation in our sales markets is worsening and inventory levels and the value change are still too high. As a result, the chemical industry is continuing to shrink and this will have impact on our company as well.</p>
          <p>There are therefore big, big question marks with regard to all forecasts at the moment. Our attempt, and I really have to say, an attempt to give a rough outlook for 2009, is based on the following macroeconomic conditions: a decline in global gross domestic products of 0.3%, a decline in global chemical production, excluding pharma, of 2%, so the chemical industry will shrink by 2%. An average exchange rate of $1.3 per euro and an average oil price of $50 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Based on this and despite the acquisition of Ciba holding and the Revus Energy, we expect a decline in sales compared with 2008 and an even greater decline in income from operations; and this is partly due to the integration costs we will face. We nevertheless aim to at least earn our cost of capital and keep our dividend stable. All in all, extremely ambitious goals in the current economic climate, and let me repeat this, these are all in all, both together interrelated, extremely ambitious goals. But the team of BASF is pulling together and we have the spirit to fight. And it's a right time to show what we can.</p>
          <p>And with this we open up the floor for discussion.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I would like to thank both gentlemen for the presentation. And now ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite you to put your questions forward. As we have done in the past please limit your questions to only one at a time so we can take as many questions as possible and off as many participants as possible, and of course you're always welcome to come back in the queue and ask another question.</p>
          <p>So I would like to start with Mr. Dunwoodie and then Christian Faitz and then Jenny Barker and then Mr. R&#xF6;diger please.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So Mr. Dunwoodie this is table number 3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I can just start with the outlook, you talk about earning at least your cost of capital. On your calculations, what would that equate to in terms of underlying EBIT for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me give it a try. First of all, let's start with 2008. We said we have revenue of 1.6 billion and when you receive our interim report in a couple of weeks, two weeks, then you can find on page 27 the exact calculation. This boils down to cost of capital in 2008 of &#x20AC;3.9 billion, and the methodology is described also in our Factbook which you can also find on the Internet.</p>
          <p>Having said that, you have to keep in mind that in 2008 the cost of capital rate was 10% and in 2009 we will apply 9%. The 9% basically reflects the higher debt load of BASF on our balance sheet due to the Ciba acquisition. There are a couple of question marks; what is the average capital employed in 2009? We don't know yet. So you have to make an estimate in that respect as well, but I think I have given you a few hints how to calculate this.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Here we go. Okay, thanks. This also has to do with your outlook, you talk about rather depressed automotive and construction markets, as far as I understand you, but at the same time in your Functional Solutions outlook, you talk about higher sales in Construction Chemicals and also higher earnings due to certain restructuring measures, I guess. But can you maybe elucidate a little bit what has happened there, what makes you so confident that Construction Chemicals will in fact perform better this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start I think that we are not absolutely happy with the overall performance of Construction Chemicals. This is to start with. The first one is, we have lost market share and at the same time we have done quite a bit of restructuring which had a real impact on the EBIT line. So what we will see going forward is our product portfolio, restructuring, and more focused on the specifics of the respective markets. This will improve first. Second, we do expect towards the end of the year that there's stimulus packages of the respective governments into infrastructure will have a certain impact and especially at mixture businesses, and with this we do expect that we will have a major improvement on both sides, more on the earnings, less on the sales course.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your commitment to the dividend has been very, very clear for a long time and therefore today's announcement is not a surprise. But can you say specifically, if things were bad enough that you actually had to borrow to keep the dividends stable, would you do it? Would you borrow to keep it stable?</p>

          <p>Jenny, very clear this is why I said, if we &#x2013; looking to the outlook, all in all, which means earning a premium cost of capital and dividend goes together, if we don't earn a premium cost of capital, I think it will become very difficult.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Why are you so positive on the outlook for agriculture solutions, when you on the other side mention that your nitrogen fertilizer business was very weak in the fourth quarter, and it's obviously that it's not getting in better shape in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, people have to eat, that's always helpful in that respect, so that industry has an underlying demand for food, and we don't see a complete restructuring of that market in that respect. But more seriously, when you look at the market right now, prices have come down for the commodities from the very high price which we have seen in the past, but they're still above historic averages. We have a couple of special factors like a very severe drought in Argentina right now, which really helps also to propel prices or keep them up.</p>
          <p>Then you have to keep in mind that when you look at the share of wallet at the farmer level of Ag products, that is a relatively small part of what farmers really to have to spend in most agricultural product areas. They spend much more on fertilizer, they spend much more on equipment, they spend much more on interest, on gasoline; for instance diesel, all these costs have come down. So for a farmer to cut back on Ag production products is the last thing he wants to do because it really affects the productivity and the quality of what he produces. So we basically see good reason that the market should develop nicely, there is obviously a big question of weather.</p>
          <p>And then there is a second issue, which is really about BASF's competitiveness in that market, and we are very, very confident that we have a very good product line. We had an excellent development in 2008. We achieved an EBITDA ratio on sales of 26, above 26%, which is above our target, which we had established 25%. So I think we go into 2008 with &#x2013; very well-prepared to capture some share and to grow successfully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kurt, maybe I am complimenting from the fertilizer corner. So you're right, and the first quarter fertilizers have been not a very good business, because all the inventories have been filled up, expectations and prices will go down. Now fertilizers are now sold to the market because fertilizer season now begins. And this means nitrogen fertilizers will certainly be a reasonable good business, but as the farmer certainly looks at his costs, most probably potassium based fertilizers will be reduced because you can bring this out every second year, whereas nitrogen fertilizer, you need to apply every year. So all in all, I would say fertilizer business is partly impacted, but on the other hand on agric- on our agricultural products, crop protection so to speak, this will be all what we can see, the real growth area, and this by the way almost is the only industry which will grow in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just wonder whether you can talk about the Asian chemicals market at the moment, you mentioned the downturn was particularly acute in pricing and demand in the fourth quarter. Just wondered whether you can talk about what you're seeing at the moment in the Asian markets and the outlook for the year as far as you can see it? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in Asia we have the hope that after Chinese New Year, which is always some kind of a point where you get a little bit uncertain, that the market will recover. However, we have to say it is not recovering. So Asia is not doing well. I think if I look back in 2008, the biggest disappointment only has been Asia. We have known about North America, we have known partly about Europe, but we really expected that Asia would perform better under the overall circumstances, which did not really materialize. And looking into the overall scenario for the time being, I would say this is not recovering. On the other hand, if it comes to stimulus packages, I would say, yes, they are more immediate in reaction and really being pushed through into the market compared to the developed markets in North America and in Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have a question with regards to goodwill. We have seen from some competitors, some goodwill write-downs on acquisitions. If I'm informed correct, you still have some considerable goodwill from the Engelhard acquisition as well as from the Construction Chemicals acquisition. Do you see any need for, or the possible need for write-downs on these goodwill going forward? And also in connection with the Ciba acquisitions, do you see any risk for write-downs that we can expect and what would that do to your financial position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I take that one? First of all in 2008 we correctly had no goodwill write-down. There was no need, and I can assure you that our auditors squeezed that quite a bit, whether we really had the decent outlook and planning done for all respective businesses, so we are on the safe side with respect to that. Ciba, I don't think that is really an issue which you raised here. First of all we have to close the deal, then we will integrate, then we will capture the synergies, then we will restructure, then we will grow the business. At the end of the day it will be a successful BASF and I don't see any need to think about goodwill write-down for Ciba right now.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the background there is that the Libyan government wants basically to harmonize the agreements that they have. We still have a concession agreement that goes back to the early 70s, if I remember correctly. What will be the potential impacts if we move to a so-called EPSA 4 agreement? What happens there is we do not have anymore 100% of the oil, but we get what's called cost oil and what is called profit oil. So if we come to a conclusion and to an agreement here, you'll see a drop in sales. You see also a drop in EBIT, but on a net profit basis there shouldn't be any change there because what we are striving for is obviously equal value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question on your short-term financing. Since we don't have the bond benefit of the annual report yet, but you seem to know every page of it already Dr Bock. Can you explain a little bit what's behind the much higher short-term financing compared to last year and also compared to the September 30 levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The higher short-term financing largely basically reflects the growing working capital until the end of Q3, and then we have the Revus Energy acquisition. We bought 15% of Ciba already last year, and it was just very cheap to borrow short-term. We pay U.S. dollar interest below 1%. This is a long-term solution, obviously not given to current market situation, that's the reason why we went out and issued bonds last year for 1.6 billion, on top of that we had promissory notes of roughly 600 million, and we went again out in January and issued a bond for 1.5. billion.</p>
          <p>That obviously is more expensive than short term financing, but that is the cost of having long-term financing on the balance sheet. And the idea is as I said in my little speech, to have what we call a mature, balanced, maturity profile, which we basically have. When you look at the details you find that over the next few years we have certain maturities which can be easily refinanced and also this year I think we will still be able to get money from the capital markets if we wanted. Does that answer your question? Okay.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Hobenoose table number 9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding your E&amp;P upstream earnings, they have been quite resilient. Is this due to the nature of the contracts or is this caused by hedging, and how do you hedge your forward gas sales? Or should we expect a further decline in Q2 and Q3, or has this to do with specific kind of the contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, first of all with respect to the resilience of the earnings in E&amp;P in Q4, keep in mind there that we have higher production and this higher production predominantly is higher production of natural gas coming from Yuzhno Russkoye, and this is not priced at the same price as you price oil. It's priced on a formula, and according to that formula you look at the past several months and that's an average price. So, you don't have the immediate decline there.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, with respect to our natural gas trading business, which you then refer to, we benefited there certainly in the fourth quarter from positive time lag effects. I got the question at our Q2 conference; what's happening with your gas trading business? Why is it negative in Q2? Well, there we have the negative time lag effects. In Q4, we see very positive time lag effects. Looking into Q1, we also benefit from positive time lag effects, but they will then cease some time, which means that we will see lower results in Q2 and Q3.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question regarding your plastics division; that had very weak earnings in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit how much of that is due to the use of high raw material prices and inventory write-downs and how does it look like in the first quarter as benzene prices, the most important feedstock of this division, came down by 70% or something like this. Do you have already the advantage of these lower raw material prices in Q1? Or will that come later? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plastics, I have to admit this also has been for us also a disappointment in the fourth quarter certainly. The main reason however, has been the absolute collapse of the market. If you have only an order income of, let me say 50% partly only 40%, what to do? And then you have inventory at the same time the prices go down so we had write-downs, yes, in inventory, three-digit number, this was substantial. I really have to say this going forward into Q1 I'm rather pessimistic looking into the overall order income than what's going on. So, I think the reduction in raw material costs will not help to the extent you may expect, not only for us, for the entire market. This will be an issue of really closing down plants and adjusting capacities which will have, on the interregnum time, a negative impact on the costs side.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Gilbert [UBS Warburg], table number 6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the CapEx guidance for 2009 of a 20% reduction, obviously, you're on about 1.9 to 2 billion of CapEx. And as I understand, you expense a bit of maintenance CapEx as well, and the currency will help you on the CapEx as well. Can you just clarify what were you spending the money on, and is there a basically point of no return certain projects that you have committed to, which you might want to &#x2013; would want to scale back on them now but can't because there is a point of no return in the construction et cetera. If you could elaborate where you're spending the roughly 2 billion in 2009 that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all you are right, postponing is certainly also an issue where time will help because the cost in the related within &#x2013; in CapEx is coming down to a certain extent, and this helps besides the necessity to adjust to the needs of the market. You have the market is shrinking, you see it certainly have to think about whether investments are still reasonable.</p>
          <p>But looking into investments and give &#x2013; and I'm giving you some examples; there are even investments we have accelerated. For example, one, which is biodegradable polymer, Ecoflex. This is certainly pushed forward because the market just wants to have this product. And there are others, yes, where we are in the midst of executing, there is for example, cyclodecanone, which is produced here as a precursor for polymers. We are selling to the market. It's polymer, but also in parts it's for the aroma chemicals.</p>
          <p>And then looking into new technologies which are in the making is the DEACON process in Antwerp where we recycle chloride in a different way. Looking then into Wintershall. Wintershall and our oil and gas business is a different story. So we will invest into the E&amp;P piece of it, and we will certainly also invest into the gas infrastructure. So there is basically no reduction, or let me say storage, high duct storage facilities. This will be done because this will be needed.</p>
          <p>Looking into North America, could I think be the most important investment we have around the world. And urgent need is in agricultural products, in crop protection, because active ingredients, we are short in supply. So we need to have these investments. All-in-all, if you look into the regions, majority will go to Europe, mostly driven by oil and gas division. Second major piece is Asia. Yes we will enlarge Nanjing. This is postponed only to a certain extent, but execution will be done, and certainly we will then look into North America.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've currently given us in the report outlook statements by sub units. I just wondered whether you could give me the factors that lead you to be optimistic that profits from performance polymers and coatings can rise in 2009 given obviously the still poor automotive markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For performance polymers, we have basically started to restructure. We have basically sold one plant in the UK, where we had still a lot of costing related. And we have &#x2013; we will do further restructuring. This will certainly help to improve the overall performance. So I'm pretty sure that the &#x2013; on EBIT terms, this will improve. Coatings, and Kurt has mentioned this already, we are doing the restructuring around the world, where we are closing down entire sites in Asia, in North America and in Europe and this restructuring measure will certainly contribute to improve the overall performance of coatings as well. Having said this, I need to put a proviso into this. Visibility is awfully low. And I said I'm trying to make an attempt for an outlook.</p>
          <p>Now if you are sitting in a car and driving, and I said this morning, maybe the one or other have heard this. Formula 1 racing in fog will be called off. We are in a Formula 1 race, which cannot be called off. So what are you going to do? You just drive as far as you can see that there is a contour, that there is some kind of an orientation. Now as we go forward, as I've said, things &#x2013; first half of 2009 certainly will be worse than second half of 2008, and you know this, I don't talk about a secret here. Now all in all, as we go forward, we need to look very, very carefully into the overall business scenario, but based on the assumptions, and by the way, when we talk about any kind of key performance indicators, we always put assumptions on this.</p>
          <p>Later on, you never talk about the assumptions, you just take the key performance indicator irrespective of the assumptions. We &#x2013; I'm really meaning that these assumptions we have made are the real basic fundament from which we start in attempting an outlook in the forecasting. I need to say this because it's almost dangerous to make an outlook at this very moment, and you might be caught very quickly.</p>

          <p>Our next question was from Mr. Evans [Cazenove] table number 5, and then we have Rhian Tucker [Credit Suisse Securities] on table number 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the functional division and specifically the Engelhard auto cat business, obviously the automotive industry remains extremely tough. But how do you see the outlook developing for that side of the business in terms of new legislation, environmental legislation coming through to, in theory, benefit demand for auto cats despite the industry background? And also secondly, just on the tax charge for '09, can we expect it to fall back to the '07 levels going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me say that obviously 2008 was a very difficult year for our catalyst business. Chemical catalysts did well, refinery catalysts was okay, they had an issue with very high raw material costs but could basically work through that over the course of the year. What we call mobile emission catalysts, automotive catalysts, was very difficult and was negative in Q4. Overall for the entire year, it was still a positive result. But we got hit by a bus in Q4 I think that's fair to say, because there was so much demand destruction in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>You have to keep in mind that we are heavily exposed in the United States where we are market leader in catalysts. We have a very high market share in heavy duty diesel, which is by definition a very attractive business, because those catalysts are big, and the bigger the better. That market almost evaporated. You're right, however, in stating that there is new regulation and that regulation basically drives additional demand. So the underlying concept is still absolutely valid for that industry that with new regulation, there is demand growth and lots of opportunities for all competitors in that area. But again, in heavy-duty diesel, if no trucks are being built or sold, new regulation doesn't help.</p>
          <p>What was positive in 2008 was Asia. We had a very decent growth in Asia of 27%, which I think was quite gratifying, but even the Asian market has shown signs of weaknesses lately. So talking about the automotive industry in 2009, I think J&#xFC;rgen alluded to it, we don't see any growth in the automotive industry in 2009, that's quite clear. What are we doing? We're trying to control what we can control, that is basically cutting back costs. We have reduced our workforce in catalyst. We have changed work schemes and have tried to come down with our costs as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>Just because legislation was one of the points you made also, I would say for the time being at this very moment legislation is not a promoter of the business because if you look into the truck industry, it's, I would say, almost dead. 99% less compared to last year time period. So there is no promotion by any kind of legislation at this moment, if you don't need trucks, legislations will not help. And it may change going forward at a specific point of time, but not at this very moment, I have to say. The tax rate here also. You alluded to the tax rate but we can --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a famous question I hear every quarter. Haven't really changed my answer. It's &#x2013; the underlying tax rate is roughly 20% plus. It fluctuates a little bit. But if you take out the non-compensable oil taxes, you are arriving at about 20% plus. What I can tell you, however, if we change to EPSA contracts in the oil and gas business, your life will become much, much easier because this just disappears and then we can really talk about the tax rates, the real tax rate of BASF.</p>

The question from Tim Jones [Deutsche Bank] was were the Dow/Rohm &amp; Haas deal to fall apart, would BASF have any interest in looking again at acquiring Rohm &amp; Haas? And the second question, please can you provide any guidance on the level of the Others line in 2009, and also on the potential level of the net financials line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks like I got some more difficult question to answer. Others is a basket of many, many different issues, you can clearly now see in our quarterly report what is the cost of our corporate headquarter, what is the cost of the research activities, what is fluctuating, really is the mark-to-market of our currency positions and our raw material hedging positions that can have a positive effect or a negative effect. It was negative on balance in Q4. That doesn't mean it has to be negative in Q1 as well.</p>
          <p>But certainly Q4 was special also in the sense that Styrenics had a very, very weak quarter operationally. They had a gain in 2007, and they had a loss in 2008. That change was more than 100 million, just to give you an idea. On top of that came restructuring measures, special write-downs, in the Styrenics business, which will not reoccur in 2009 obviously.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Just bringing together some of the comments you've made on inventory through the course of the conference. You said inventories went up during 2008, and you said one of your cash saving measures during 2009 was pulling down inventories. Now given that you are effectively one of your own biggest suppliers through the chain, can you talk a little bit about where the inventory is in the chain, is it upstream? And if your downstream operations stop buying from your intermediates, who stop buying from your upstream and oil and gas businesses, how long is it going to take for that de-stocking to wind its way all the way up to your gas businesses?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me give it a try, frankly. So first of all, we had inventory write-downs in 2008, and you'll also find this in our annual report at the end of the year; we had a write-down of &#x20AC;160 million. On top of that come certainly products which we sold, which were produced at higher historic costs and which we could only sell then during the fourth quarter at lower prices because prices have come down. That effect is more than the 160 all-in-all it's probably fair to say roughly 400 million was the inventory, m&#xE1;s o menos, more or less in 2008.</p>
          <p>Your question about where is the inventory sitting in our value chain. The turnover upstream is relatively fast, so in our Krakow operations we have inventories. We have NAFTA for 15 days max. So we almost immediately see the effect of changing raw material costs upstream. But downstream, obviously we have sometimes very long value chains. We have products sitting in our warehouses which had to be reevaluated over the course of the fourth quarter, and which also as I said before caused some pain selling those inventories. What we have done in Q4, we reduced inventories, and that is what I said in my speech, Q4 we reduced inventories. We had an increase in inventories between Q1 and Q3, volume-driven and price-driven. And in Q4, we had a decrease again, volume-driven partly, only partly price-driven. What can we say for 2009? Hard to predict. Our goal is absolutely to get as much cash as possible out of our working capital, that's for sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would like to insert another question from Marco Siebel from JPMorgan, relating to the natural gas trading business. Could you please give us an indication for the split between volumes and increased selling prices that have led to the sales growth in gas trading in Q4? And how should we think about volumes in gas trading in the full year 2009?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first part, was we would like to have an indication for the split between volumes and higher selling prices that have led to the sales growth in gas trading in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, second part?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one was how should we think about volumes in gas trading in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me start with the second part of the question. Volume in gas trading in 2009, I'd say extremely difficult to predict, because gas trading in the end will be significantly impacted by what we see happening in the overall economy. I think for the first two months of the year, it's fair to say that weather helped to compensate for economic downturn, but I do not see this continuing through the rest of the year. With respect to volumes and prices in the Q4, we have a volume effect there in the range of roughly 10%, and we have a price currency effect in the range of 55 to 60%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On your plant shutdowns in Q4 and also on your plant shutdowns in &#x2013; closures, permanent in 2009, could you elaborate a bit on the kind of volume decrease coming from prolongated vacation or temporarily plant shutdowns in chemicals, and what can we expect in terms of capacities in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Towards the end of the year we had to take really very tough actions and I think we reduced capacity by almost 40% in certain areas of chemicals. Not entirely, just to give some idea. Other parts have run at full capacity, also in chemicals, I have to say, because we have &#x2013; they are basic commodities and also specialties. Going into 2009, if we look into the market entirely and translate this into upstream, I have to say, as we mentioned already, it is 25% down. For the time being, as I said, visibility maybe for one, two months can change &#x2013; indication, meaningful indication for getting better out of there at this very moment.</p>

          <p>Yes. I just wondered whether you could talk to us about your thoughts on acquisitions this year. Should assets come up, and in particular whether, given the operational challenges at the moment, there is even the sort of the management time, I guess, to be able to consider reasonable sized acquisitions should they emerge? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, you may have heard this morning, I have already said there is no large acquisition out for us this year. We need to take care of the integration of Ciba and we need to take care of the business. There might be however, smaller acquisition pieces which fit very well to our respective business and which will have a rather short return, not absorbing, your point is correct, not absorbing a lot of management capacity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wondering, in the current environment, given your relative strength, whether you can talk about the opportunities you maybe see and where they are to take market share from essentially weaker competitors who may find the going a little bit more difficult than yourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, for us, value goes before volume, and I think we have in most of our business demonstrated this. You can see this nicely in the performance products area. It's not the right &#x2013; not the time to go for volume. Having said this, there is another effect because there is a lot of question marks behind quite a few of our competitors very generally speaking.</p>
          <p>A lot of our &#x2013; a lot of customers come to us and tell us, BASF is important to us, we would like to have you as at least last &#x2013; the supplier of last resort. This is a real issue, and it is coming more and more, because I think what we try to offer is more than just product. This is paying back, but of course not everywhere, so a very general statement here to take volumes away from others, I think my message is, it's not the time to do that because there isn't enough capacity in the market and everyone can do that. Capacity has to be reduced, this is the message, not volume increased, capacity reduced. This is the key message to the entire industry.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have a question on your cost cutting program next where you also pointed out to do investments in the magnitude of 700 million. Can you give us a split, how we should calculate the investments for the next three years? And maybe you can give us some details, what you understand on investments. Is it CapEx, and if it's CapEx then how should we see that in the connection to your announcement that you want to cut CapEx by 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When we talk about the savings, we also &#x2013; of next, the program, we also mentioned that there are some costs associated, so part of that investment is actually ongoing cost just to implement certain measures. We are talking really big time CapEx spending for achieving this target of saving roughly a billion Euros, this is our next program.</p>
          <p>In that respect it's not affected by the goal of reducing our CapEx spending by about 20%, and you have to keep in mind that most of these measures, which we plan to implement right now have very short payback periods They are very, very economical.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. One of the things that came out of the press release and the conference is that we've seen a lot of supply coming on in some areas at the same as demand is weakening. Can you go through some of the most important business areas and where you see the supply-demand the most unbalanced at the moment because obviously those areas will take a bit longer to fix themselves when demand comes back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could make this very short and say it is almost everywhere too much capacity. But your question is a little bit more going into the future as additional capacity has come on-stream and will come on-stream.</p>
          <p>So I have to say yes, there are areas which are more hit and others which are less hit. And just -just a very few here, always assuming that things are getting substantially better, this is may be your assumption, certainly on the petrochemical side, there is a surplus of capacity, and especially also on the first added value step; meaning Polyethylene, Polypropylene, Monoethylene Glycol, these are the areas where we see additional capacity coming on-stream and this may really have impacts even longer term.</p>
          <p>However, having said this, on this err there is portfolio of trackers and polymer plants which are outdated and no longer economy of scale and I do anticipate here and you will hear this and you have heard this already looking at the US, that some of the capacities will be closed down forever, this will accelerate going into the second quarter I have to say.</p>
          <p>If you look into other areas, let me just take petrochemicals, in our case these are solvents or oxalic acids this is a much better place to be in. The same applies to plasticizers, especially if you are more in the higher added value businesses as we are. And acrylic acid, yes, there is additional capacity but here is a reasonable growth also going forward. Now this is let me say the better part, what is at this very moment a little bit frustrating, but in the medium term, I think would become better is &#x2013; are the isocyanates TDI and MDI because if demand is down 50%, there is all of a sudden huge over capacity despite the fact that in the past this has been rather tight, or if not to say very tight. These are a few examples and if we go further downstream it's getting awfully complicated. But it may help you a little bit for the time being.</p>
          <p>Shrinking markets have a very special burden and need special attention and I only can repeat myself, capacities have to be reduced especially in the areas where there is long-term no competitiveness from the basic setup of those assets.</p>
          <p>Sophie, sorry Jenny. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just on the restructuring going forward, could you give us ballpark numbers for the cash restructuring spend that you expect to make this year and next year and any year beyond that you would like to go to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, I would say this is for me at this very moment awfully complicated to answer, and I think for Kurt as well. If you look into what we did in the past you may anticipate similar figures. However, I am not sure what the measures will have to be. As I said capacities have to be closed down. We have taken in quite a bit already in 2008, anticipating restructuring, especially if it comes to closure of entire sites but we are not at the end, and at this very moment as I said visibility is very low, we may be forced to take even tougher actions and therefore, Jenny sorry I can't give you a figure here.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we insert a question from Michael Eastwood. Having January numbers and whatever order book you have, will Q1 2009 be better than Q4 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think we'd say Q1 should be better than Q4, and there's only one reason for that. This is, our ACAM business will have a much better time in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So to make this a simple answer. Going beyond that I really have to say this is difficult, for the time being all those order book are not filled up so we are still running at the same, and I said this already, at the same capacity level as we did towards the end of the last quarter so no hope for major improvements here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was another question from Thomas Gilbert [UBS Warburg], table number six.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you can I come back to the discussion on over capacity, obviously you have been leading the field in signaling temporary closures, now from what we see there has been a lot of temporary shutdowns from everyone and the worry is that as soon as there is a little bit of a demand pick up or a little restocking and everybody is switching back on and is killing that little plant. But you then also said you expect the high cost capacity producers to fold in, in the second quarter. You cannot play a signaling role there or do you have larger high cost facilities in your view where you could signal again, the industry, we need to start shutting down capacity indefinitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really have to say, we did this already. If you look into for example the Coatings area, we certainly have signaled this to the market. This is one example. This might be for your taste too close to the customer. And you would like to look more to the upstream. Here we have to say we are maybe better off than many others because we have done our homework already. However, at the same time we certainly have already started to close down plants for example in Styrenics areas. So we will signal this to the market as we go forward. Finally we will talk about this when things are happening because we need to talk with our employees first before we talk to you. But you will see there is more to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we are moving to some agriculture solutions questions. Was there any impact from product patent expiries in Q4 for agriculture solution, if not, how will AG solutions sales grow in 2009 given epoxy conosol and fipermian patent expiries? And the second question is why were prices in AG solutions only flat, given 8% plus in Q3 year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that question came from Fraser Hill, who is now with Banc of America.</p>
          <p>That's correct, epoxy conosol and fipermian are both going to expire. That is nothing unusual in our business I have to say and life extension can be done by various methods for instance, new formulations and that is actually very effective. So we expect that both product families will still generate very healthy sales and earnings over the course of the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we also have what I already mentioned; we have quite a good pipeline. Let me just give you one example, a new herbicide which we will introduce this year, Jigsaw where we expect sales of about &#x20AC;100 million a year, and that will be now introduced in North America. And again, we talked about the agricultural market, our optimism is very much also based on the strength of our pipeline and that has to be kept in mind whenever we talk about this.</p>
          <p>Second question was why were prices in AIG solutions only flat. That is always a comparison year-over-year, so I can't really &#x2013; we have to go back to the price levels now in Q4 of 2007 to understand whether this was really a price decrease. I would very much expect that this is a portfolio mix factor and has nothing to do with any actually price changes for specific products. That would surprise me very much, but I can't give you a more precise answer. But normally, we don't lower process for our excellent products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, people are desperately, desperately looking for any tiny little glimmers of at least the end of the de-stocking. You have been clear about your view but I'd just like to ask about something specific. PVC prices have risen a little bit in recent weeks in Asia. The commentary is that that has been associated with some return in demand at the end of Chinese New Year. That obviously directly contradicts what you say, can you &#x2013; have you seen anything anywhere, no matter how small which might at least signal an end to the de-stocking, if not a recovery of underlying demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, I don't see this. And let me give you my very personal concern I have, going forward. I think what we will see is &#x2013; I'm not sure how to translate this in English, [Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peaks and valleys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, peaks and valleys is not the right thing. You have a saw &#x2013; saw tooth maybe, you will see restocking and blips in certain areas. And you've seen this in PVC. By the way, we have seen since partly in polyolefins and polyethylene. It went already up. There was a demand, so capacity loadage was better in January &#x2013; late January and February. So it went up and very often you will see because underlying demand is not solid, it is not sustainable it will go up and blip, it will burst. And I am concerned about this, because all of a sudden the one of the others is talking about recovery but the basic fundamentals Jenny, I would rather like to tell you something else. I really have to say this.</p>
          <p>But I do not see this happening at this very moment. And just look into the inventories of our customer industries. In the U.S. you have this basic data available, they are published and you have 150 days of inventory. In the last quarter &#x2013; in Kass &#x2013; in last quarter, last year there was a protection of 12 million relatively speaking in the border and sales of 10. So what does this mean for the industry? And you can translate this forward and back, and if you look into the electronics industry similar picture, less so because this is more quickly reacting. But all in all, if you look into this and translate this into demand, fundamental demand, and in a turnaround in demand, I really have to say, I'm sorry, I don't see this yet.</p>
          <p>So maybe I am too much in the fog, others are more in light on the sky. There is one hole where they can see the sky but no horizon, yeah. I don't see that for the time being, unfortunately not. And I am not really a pessimist. I try to be a realist, and realist at this very moment cannot offer you certainty. We cannot offer you certainty.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, certainly will. And let me first of all start with last part of your question, increases in cost, no. The budget is 7.4 billion. Therefore the project and the last project reviews have shown that we'll stay in that budget or Nord Stream AG that runs the project, will stay in that budget. You may have seen also over the last few weeks the announcement coming out of Nord Stream AG, now all the approvals or permits, applications have been filed. The environmental impact assessment study has been finalized in English, the national versions will be available by the beginning of March. So we're in full swing there with respect to the Nord Stream Projects. Our overall target is to have the permitting processes done by the end of December 2009. And then to start actually with laying of the pipes once we have all the permits in place. So that for the first pipeline &#x2013; there's two pipelines, therefore the first pipeline we have gas in for October 1, 2011.</p>
