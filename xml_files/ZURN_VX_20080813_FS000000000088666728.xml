        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. And welcome to Zurich's half-year 2008 results announcement. In the face of the most volatile financial markets we have seen in decades, as well as rate pressures in some commercial General Insurance markets, it's my pleasure to announce that Zurich has once again generated excellent financial results, maintaining strong operating profitability, achieving targeted meaningful growth, and adhering to a disciplined approach to investment and risk management practices.</p>
          <p>Of course, when Zurich reset its course nearly six years ago now, we did not do so anticipating a perpetual bull market, eternal hard market conditions or a good luck streak when it came to catastrophes. Instead, we aimed to imbed the processes, structures and mindsets that will be capable of generating strong operating results, irrespective of capital gains or losses.</p>
          <p>We set out to create a diverse portfolio of businesses that could withstand the traditionally cyclical nature of this sector. By balancing our General Insurance exposures, both geographically and by line of business and evolving our Life Insurance strategy. And we committed to developing the balance sheet strength and management discipline that would allow us to deploy these capabilities, both defensively and proactively, depending on market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our half year 2008 results, with business operating profit and net income up, illustrate our ability to execute on that strategy across a diverse portfolio of businesses and highlight the focus and determination of Zurich's management team and employee base.</p>
          <p>From a growth perspective, the targeted nature of our efforts, as illustrated in this updated chart, is reflected in the 1% increase in local currency gross written premiums. We continue to leverage our global presence and target those markets that prove most promising from a profitability perspective.</p>
          <p>In Europe, steady underlying growth was supplemented with a targeted M&amp;A strategy, resulting in a 6% growth rate, split evenly between organic and inorganic sources.</p>
          <p>In international businesses, the implementation of local growth strategies generated 9% local currency growth across our regions, led by Latin America and South Africa. Global Life continues to combine new products with expanded distribution capabilities both in mature and emerging markets. To achieve 9% ABE growth for the six months, showing further steady improvement in Q2. And Farmers, through the exchanges ahead of market rate increases, enhanced distribution productivity and innovative new products, grew its fees and other revenues by 9%. These are impressive results and reflect well on our ability to achieve meaningful growth in the markets we target for expansion.</p>
          <p>The common success factors in all of these efforts is a disciplined approach to customer, product and distribution excellence and an accomplished management team capable of motivating their people to perform under challenging market conditions. This proven ability to grow profitably also positions us well for when commercial markets turn. As North America Commercial and Global Corporate are already proving successful in balancing refined risk appetite with segmented growth initiatives to generate solid profits in difficult markets.</p>
          <p>Further illustrating our future growth capabilities are the results we are already beginning to see from our targeted acquisition strategy, as we successfully integrate Bristol West, Zurich Retail in Russia and other new operations. Most recently, the series of transactions we announced in Turkey, Germany, Brazil or Spain, illustrate the methodical and disciplined approach we take in expanding our operations in ways that match our strategic and financial objectives. For example, the three transactions in Spain not only expanded our bancassurance capability, but will also position the Group as the second largest player in a market where we said we wanted to grow.</p>
          <p>Our disciplined approach is similarly reflected in the many deals we do not pursue. since we will not jeopardize our strict internal hurdles, no matter how well of a strategic fit any potential acquisition may appear. But our focus is not and has never been unbridled growth. So while targeting markets around the globe for growth, we have also been transforming our operations to make them more resilient to external pressures and better equipped to actively capture opportunities, wherever and whenever they arise.</p>
          <p>Example of these range from the expense management initiatives we announced in the U.S. and the U.K. over the past few months to the investments we continue to make in upgrading IT systems, enhancing distribution capabilities, streamlining capital structures and generally improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our businesses. These efforts are fueled by the continuing success of the Zurich way initiatives where we remain well on track to meet our target for 2008.</p>
          <p>Beyond even our operating success though, our investment portfolio generated a robust 2.1% non-annualized return, illustrating the benefits of managing a strong cash flow in a disciplined and systematic manner. That same approach is also why our expense &#x2013; exposure to the most distressed asset classes remains minimal. Does this success mean that we are immune from the impact of fragile markets? No, and we are constantly vigilant for opportunities to improve our capital efficiency and investment returns. Does it mean we are immune from rate pressures in the General Insurance market? No, and in fact, we will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to protect our margins as some units begin to feel the brunt of top line pressures.</p>
          <p>What our success does indicate though, is that Zurich has a proven strategy of profitable growth and operational discipline, and that we have the people and processes to execute on that strategy. That strategy continues to drive strong operating results, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and steady net income increases. In the end though, we are in the risk business and as the last 12 months have shown us, risk comes in many forms. To mitigate and manage those risks, we will remain focused on exercising operational and financial discipline, as well as pursing profitable growth through customer, product, and distribution excellence. That is why we were able to announce such strong results today and while we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 16% ROE target across the cycle.</p>
          <p>Now, for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'll turn the floor over to our Chief Financial Officer, Dieter Wemmer. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to present another milestone in our series of strong results. This quarter shows much consistency with the first quarter, a continuing demonstration of the resilience and diversified nature of our business and of our strong risk and other functional management. These strengths have enabled us to continue to absorb the strength of the market. The business operating profit was strong and contributed to by all operating segments. At a total level, we have an increase of 8% reported by our core activities which, were up 19%, or 13% in local currency. A very satisfying performance.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through the detail by segment of our results starting with the top line on page nine. Again, in these market conditions, we are very pleased not only with the levels of growth but also that we have been able to achieve it in the areas we laid out at our strategic targets. The continued pattern of growth in General Insurance is in line with our strategic plan and has been achieved despite challenging market conditions. Overall, General Insurance gross written premium growth of 1% in local currency, was driven by 6% growth in Europe General Insurance and 9% in international business. This is a strategic shift in our premium volumes towards European and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>The growth was underpinned by many individual initiatives. You are aware of our announced acquisitions, so let me highlight some organic examples. For instance, in Italy, gross written premium growth of 12% in otherwise flat local market is underpinned by expansion in the tied agent and small broker channel successfully exploiting our position of having the highest industry customer satisfaction index score in Italy in five out of the last seven years. In Germany, as a result of the ADAC joint venture, 2008 gross written premium has grown by 4% in local currency. We have grown the number of policies with ADAC, Germany's biggest automobile club, by 14% since 2007 to 375,000. This alone has led to a 6% growth overall in personal lines gross written premium, which is clearly ahead of market growth. In Russia, where the personal lines market has grown at 25%, Zurich has delivered underlying growth levels of 43%, way ahead of the strong market development. This has not been at the expense of our integration process.</p>
          <p>For example, through the efficiency of the Zurich approach by year-end 2007, we had managed to reduce the head count in Russia by over 600 and have since achieved underlying premium growth of 43, whilst maintaining a flat head count. In contrast to these growth efforts, we are selecting to step away from business that is not meeting our marginal requirement in Global Corporate and North America Commercial. Across these two business divisions, we saw a 3% reduction in our gross written premium in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Life, annual premium equivalent grew by 9% in local currency. This was a more balanced growth pattern than we saw at the first quarter, with most operations recovering in the second quarter. We still saw continued strong growth in emerging markets. In Germany, following on from of recent debt pension increases in the first quarter, we achieved annual premium equivalent growth of 13% in the second quarter, making 33% growth in the half year. In the U.K. where new business decreased 7% in the first quarter, we delivered 18% plus in the second quarter, resulting in a net plus of 7% growth for the half-year. We are a leader in unit linked investments and savings products, many of which contain valuable guarantee feature.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of extending this range to provide retirement solution. In the first half of 2008, sales of unit linked and individual savings product actually increased by 7% in local currency. However, with the current interest rate environment, investment market volatility and real estate slowdown, the challenges to grow new business remain. This was evident in the U.S. and in Ireland, where annual premium equivalent was down 14% and 12% respectively. Although in the U.S. we did see an improvement in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Italy, Spain and our local Hong Kong operations, growth improved in the second quarter, supported by additional sales campaigns. Farmers Management Services remain on track with a growth in fee income of 9%. This is in line with the continued good levels of underlying premium growth at the exchanges of 5.7%, excluding the transfer of small business of North America commercial. This growth is as a result of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, such as integrating Bristol West.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to look at the General Insurance segment in more detail on page 10. Across General Insurance, premium rates are down on average by 3% at the half-year compared to the same period for 2007. Although rate reductions appear to have been slowing in the U.S. during first quarter, there is a slight worsening of this trend in the second quarter. European experience on the whole remains positive and goods rate increases can be seen across international business, with average increases of 3%.</p>
          <p>Looking at Europe General Insurance, rate increases can be seen across Continental Europe, with some offset from Ireland and the commercial business in the UK.</p>
          <p>Overall, the picture is positive in that it indicates flat rate increases year-on-year with a slight upward trend even with the U.K. in particular personal lines In North America Commercial, as premium rates falling 5%, there has been a modest decline in premium volumes as we continue to walk away from unprofitable business.</p>
          <p>As a result of the execution of our strategy to focus on margin enhancement, our rate / late experience continues to remain ahead of industry data. Global corporate rates have declined 8% at the half year, mainly as a result of rate reductions in the U.S., which have now reached 12% at the half year. The picture is much more positive in Europe, where rate reductions have been small and stable at 3% overall. The U.K. appears to have seen more competition in the second quarter with reductions of 5%. International business, as I mentioned already, rates up by more than 3%, driven by strong double-digit increases in South Africa and smaller positive rate increases across Latin America. Pressure on rate remains in Greater China, Southeast Asia and Australia, although local actions are showing signs of success as the level of rate reductions has slowed.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the next page to dive deeper into our General Insurance results. With business operating profit up year-on-year by $398 million, the General Insurance business continues to show good resilience as it again generates a year-on-year increase in profit. This is the result of an increase in both investment income and underwriting result.</p>
          <p>Investment income is up as a result of higher levels of invested assets generated from our strong operational cash flow. The underwriting result has improved by $109 million as a result of lower loss ratio driven by an absence of catastrophe claims, but largely offset by the level of large losses in the U.S. and despite an overall deterioration of our expense ratio. Overall, the combined ratio has improved by 0.3 percentage points to 96.2%.</p>
          <p>Actually, on a risk-based return basis, which is a much better profitability guide than the combined ratio, General Insurance continued to show good underlying results. At the half year, the General Insurance adjusted operating return on equity before tax was 28.9%, well ahead of our 25% target. Now we can explore the expense ratio in more detail on the next page, page 12 for the people on the phone line.</p>
          <p>Our ambition to invest in increasing the efficiency and customer focus of our business remains strong. In fact, as we see the benefit of past maturing programs our appetite for operational transformation remains. Naturally the expense line is impacted by this ambition with investment in new initiatives and the benefits of maturing transformation efforts. For instance, we took a number of transformational steps in Germany and Spain, these businesses are now operating with expense ratios already approaching 21% giving Zurich enormous flexibility to balance volumes and margins.</p>
          <p>We have also made good progress in our expense management programs in the U.S. and U.K. In the U.S., where we have reduced employees by over 6%, we have during the second quarter booked restructuring charges of $63 million at the half year. In the U.K. program, we are still finalizing the details of the head count reduction, but we're confident in making good progress in our aim to reduce our cost base by 10%.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we plan to include a restructuring charge of roughly $50 million. Having said that, our expense ratio of 25.6% was 1.4 percentage points higher than at the half year 2007 driven by changes in business mix, which continues to increase the commission ratio and through continued investment in strategic initiative.</p>
          <p>The increase in the commission ratio of 70 base points is the result of active portfolio shift to more profitable businesses such as <mark type="inaudible" /> business in North America Commercial. Non-commission related expenses increased by 70 basis points as a <mark type="inaudible" /> as a result of a number of different factors impacting the business division.</p>
          <p>In Europe, this increase was due to continued investment in operational initiatives such as, Zurich Connect as well as a distorting impact of a higher expense ratio in recently acquired businesses, such as in Russia. In Global Corporate, the main driver of this increase was a reduction in the volume of fee income, which is accounted for in the expense ratio. In North America Commercial, the actual change was very small.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a more detailed look at the loss ratio on page 13. The underlying loss ratio remains broadly flat year-on-year. This is a very encouraging performance and comes despite rate reductions on average across General Insurance in 2008 of 3%. We continue to see the benefits of our Zurich Way Program in our financial performance with the pace of our improvements and the implementation of our growth strategy, successfully mitigating industry cycles.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail, we see a higher incident of large claims, which includes the weather related events in North America. Our experience appears better than the market on average, although it was certainly a busy quarter with over 1,100 tornadoes in the U.S. alone.</p>
          <p>Europe however was much quieter without any major catastrophe event in the second quarter. Our large and major catastrophe experience was one percentage point better in loss ratio terms than the 2007 level. Our diversified book continues to support the stability of our earnings, prior-year reserve for leases at the half year were $609 million leaving our overall reserve strength in line with year end 2007.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the reserve movements on slide 14. With the level of reserve and conservatism remaining unchanged, we see a 1% net off currency growth in reserves. The prior-year movement is the result of many small movements across the global book following the quarterly reserve reviews. This level of stability in our prior year development is a reflection of the maturity of our reserving processes established in a systematic way a number of years ago as a part of the Zurich Way of reserving.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to make a comment on inflation. We have taken a more detailed look at our inflation experience this half year. We have experienced claims inflation across our General Insurance portfolio of around 3% over the last few years. This has been in line with the level of inflation we anticipated and our actuaries continue to see no noticeable change in the current claims environment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 15. With the hurricane season in progress, we have included a slide giving an overview of our major catastrophe reinsurance protection. We buy our reinsurance on an economic basis with the prime aim to protect balance sheet and solvency. That is why we have supplemented our coverage with a new global top layer. The reinsurance structure is organized with three main regional catastrophe covers operating independently for each of the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>These regional covers have similar structures and coverages, with limits on economic decisions based on the risks in each region. Sitting above this is a new single, global top layer, which offers an additional $200 million of cover against high severity catastrophe. Below all of this coverage, we have also renewed the global aggregate sideways cover, which protects us against the effect of a high frequency of catastrophe events. Protection here is for $500 million on aggregate losses in excess of $1 billion net retention.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the Life results on slide 16. As I said before, the annual premium equivalent growth improvement to 9% was as a result of the performance in a number of European markets. In the U.K., the sales campaign for Sterling Individual Savings Accounts, ISAs, was particularly successful offsetting the decline in the market for single premium bonds. In terms of distribution, independent broker continued to be the main contributor of our new business at 54%, followed by bank and direct distribution at 23%, Openwork our unique multi-tied distribution network in the U.K. at 7% Farmers tied-agent network in the U.S. 3% and other tied-agent distribution, the remaining 13%.</p>
          <p>We will expand our reporting by year-end in response to Global Life Strategy announced in May, which focuses on fixed growth pillars. The new business margin overall remained well in our target range and actually at the same level as in the first quarter. New business value increased to $342 million up from 319 million in the same period last year, although this was largely flat in local currency. Business operating profits at $766 million increased by 6% in dollar terms while declining 1% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>There were benefits from further efficiency gains in Germany, favorable claims development in Switzerland. An improved mix of business in emerging markets has contributed to the strong improvement in business operating profit here. The result was adversely affected by the weakness of investment markets, particularly in the U.K., where we have taken a one-off charge for the acceleration and the amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>However, the business operating profits result benefited from a number of other one-off items. This includes the unlocking of deferred acquisition costs in the U.S. due to reduced maintenance costs and improvements to ongoing operations in the U.K. following the disposal of the U.K. annuity book. In total, these one-off effects from investment markets, deferred acquisition costs unlocking and improvement in the U.K. have benefited the business operating profit for the half-year by about $30 million.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 17, a short look to our emerging markets business. Our emerging markets, which include Zurich International Solutions, the local business in Hong Kong and Latin America had sales growth of 14% overall, while still maintaining a strong new business margin. The key contributors to growth are focused development of distribution through bank partners and international broker networks operating in multiple jurisdictions. The business based in Hong Kong shows a decrease due to a different timing of sales campaign between 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the life embedded value results on page 18. I have already discussed the resilient growth in new business despite current market environment. The operating return at 10.8% is lower than last year as it includes a number of factors in the operating variance such as the disposal of the U.K. annuity block in 2007. As you would expect in such financial markets, the economic variance was negative across-the-board with a total of 1.15 billion.</p>
          <p>The largest drivers were under performing equity and property markets, increasing interest rates and widening credit spreads. These are broadly in line with the sensitivities published with the full year 2007 reporting. As a result, the embedded value return, which takes operating profit and the economic variance into account, reduced to 3.7% on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Farmers results on the next page number 19. Looking first at the business operating profits at the bottom of the slide, it decreased by 8% to $617 million driven by two factors as already discussed in the first quarter. Firstly, investment income decreased by $42 million largely as a result of higher dividends and cash transfers to the group reflecting our centralized approach to capital management.</p>
          <p>Secondly, last year included gains of $43 million on the sale of operating properties, which were not repeated in 2008. The gross management result has increased by 6% reflecting the continued good levels of underlying premium growth at the exchanges to which I'll come in a minute. The margin on gross earned premium reduced slightly to 7.1%, but demonstrated that the profitability to Farmers Management Services of the underlying insurance business in the exchanges is almost unaffected by market development.</p>
          <p>With that, let's move to the performance of the exchanges on the next page. The Farmers Exchanges which we manage but do not own have continued their strong track record on 2006 and 2007.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, they commenced the transfer of the small business portfolio from North America commercial. Excluding that transfer, but including Bristol West, they delivered 5.7% of premium growth in the first half of 2008 in a declining market environment. Five percentage points of this growth came from integrating Bristol West. The exchanges delivered the remaining almost 1% growth despite the challenging and flat market conditions and therefore outperformed the industry once more.</p>
          <p>This growth was added by a multitude of initiatives such as growing the tied-agent sales force and making it more effective, as well as renewed growth in the independent agency channel. The integration of Bristol West continues to run smoothly and is about to be completed. Bristol West's premium grew by over 18% year-over-year strongly ahead of non-standard competitors and it is this, which resulted in 5% of the growth for the exchanges overall as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>After the first half of 2008, all but one of the 29 tied-agent states have been rolled out and we expect to complete the rollout in the third quarter of 2008. I'm pleased to add that the Exchange's overall top line growth is profitable as the adjusted combined ratio is 97%. Still, the combined ratio has increased by 6.5 percentage points, over 4.5 percentage points are due to incremental increase in catastrophe charges year-over-year.</p>
          <p>This increase in catastrophe charges mainly related to storms in the Midwest in the second quarter, hitting in particular states like Texas, Kansas, Minnesota and Arkansas. The remainder of the combined ratio increase was driven by increasing loss trends in homeowners and auto. More importantly, the exchanges have continued to file rate increases since the beginning of 2007 in response to higher loss trends.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, the exchanges took rate increases of 5.4% in the auto book and 3.8% in the homeowner's book. Farmers plans to continue to file additional rate increases in 2008, as loss trends warrant. Going forward, the total market for U.S. personal lines is expected to take rate increases and the Exchange's target is to continue to outgrow the industry.</p>
          <p>Net surplus decreased as a result of the higher capacity losses and the statutory treatment of posts the unrealized losses on investments, and the transfer of the small business book from Zurich North America. Consequently, the surplus ratio decreased to 36.8%, a level we still consider to be solid. This decrease is not expected to have any impact on the Exchange's ability to fund future growth.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at the performance of our other business and corporate function segments on slide 21. On the other business line both center and other were affected by the impact of financial markets, particularly in the first quarter. The results in the second quarter were considerably better, although in center and some of the businesses in run-off and the other line profit also reduced as a result of lower level of fund of contractions. Farmers Re profit was down due to a reduction in the quarter share, as well as the effect of higher loss ratio in the Exchanges. Improvements in corporate functions are driven by lower headquarter expenses, the higher allocation of these expenses to businesses and some foreign currency gains.</p>
          <p>Looking now briefly at the performance of our investments on page 22, net investment income decreased by 3% in dollar terms, but is down 5% in local currency. This decrease was largely driven by lower average invested assets, mostly as a result of the transfer of the U.K. annuity and payment block of about $7 billion to Swiss Re last summer.</p>
          <p>Net capital losses for profit and loss were a negative $426 million, down 929 million as a result of the challenging financial markets in the first half 2008. Within this number were impairments of 495 million and profits on equity hedges, both of which were before policyholder allocation.</p>
          <p>Net capital gains to shareholder after policyholder allocation were 9 million plus, a satisfactory result in these markets. As a result, investment returns for P&amp;L is down 0.4 percentage points to 2.1 on an unannualized basis. Unrealized losses included in shareholders' equity increased by 4.6 billion in the first half of 2008 on both available for sale debts and equity securities. While unrealized losses on equity remained largely flat at 1.7 billion as reported in the first quarter, losses on debt securities increased by 2.9 billion. These evaluations of the groups available for sale bond portfolio were caused by rising interest in major markets.</p>
          <p>As it is our strategy to match our bond portfolio and corresponding insurance liabilities to a large extent, our economic position is only slightly impacted by this interest rate movement. Let me remind you of some key points of Zurich's disciplined investment approach. You can find further details in the appendix as usually.</p>
          <p>As emphasized, we continue to be very comfortable with the quality of our investments and our asset allocation. Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts to 4.6% taking into account our hedging programs which protect about a third of our equity exposure.</p>
          <p>Looking at the aging of our unrealized losses, in the light of our impairment policy, if all equity prices were frozen as of June 30, 2008, we would expect further impairments on equities to impact net income by less than $100 million in the second half of 2008, after applying policyholder shareholder split and taxes.</p>
          <p>We have confidence in the credit quality and future performance of our high-quality debt portfolio, including our very small CDO and sub-prime exposures. Our bond portfolios are of high-quality incurring limited impairment of 14 basis points or $171 million in the first half of 2008, of which 27 million were in the second quarter, underlining both the quality of the portfolio and its diversification.</p>
          <p>Of the total 171 million debt impairment, only 60 million were on U.S. mortgage backed securities including a 10 million write-down on U.S. sub-prime. Our investment approach remains disciplined. We carefully exploit opportunities arising from current market conditions. For example, we have increased our exposure to subordinated bonds and municipal bonds. In addition, we have added a highly rated CLO exposure of roughly $0.5 billion after the half-year to exploit attractive pricing in the leveraged loan markets.</p>
          <p>With that, let me comment on the movement on shareholders' equity on page 23. Shareholders' equity at $26.8 billion is down 7% on the restated 2007 year-end closing number. You can see the strong net income after tax performance which is driven not only by operating earnings I have already described, but also by a very pleasing reduction of the shareholders' effective tax rate down to 23%, an improvement of 1.7 percentage points over the year-end tax rates.</p>
          <p>During the half-year, we also paid the dividend of $2.1 billion and bought back $624 million worth of shares. To date, this year, we have bought back CHF 1.1 billion worth of shares, which is half of the 2008 program announced in February. The $2.4 billion of adverse movements in unrealized investment losses represents a 4.6 billion, which I mentioned in the previous investments' details, net of tax policyholder and other allocation.</p>
          <p>In summary, looking at the main drivers of our results &#x2013; growth reflects our strategic targets laid out in 2007. Acquisitions in 2008 in Spain, Turkey and Brazil will contribute to additional growth later in the year. Both Spanish acquisitions are likely to close during the third quarter and our first tangible step to deliver on the new Global Life strategy on bank insurance. The underwriting result in General Insurance was strong in spite of the relatively high level of large claim losses in the period. Underlying loss experience excluding large losses and prior year development was stable with a more optimistic outlook on premium rates in some of our markets.</p>
          <p>However, pressure remained in a number of our other important markets. We will continue to take actions to manage our expense base as evidenced in the U.S., in Ireland and in the U.K., while maintaining necessary levels of investments in transforming the business. Investments and investment income remain strong in a difficult period for the financial markets, demonstrating the discipline we have applied to investment management. The balance sheet strengths continues to underpin our ability to take advantage of market opportunities. The Group's solvency one position remains very strong with the ratio of 178%.</p>
          <p>As you know, we manage our capital with our internal economic first base capital model calibrated to an AA level. The buffer of available financial resources over this first base capital requirement at the half-year remains unchanged at the upper end of the range as at January 1, 2008. This strong capital position has absorbed volatile financial market conditions and takes into account $7 billion of cash outflow relating to the dividends paid this year, the entire 2008 share buyback program of 2 billion, and completed and committed acquisitions so far of about $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our continuous work on business improvement for The Zurich Way gives us a developing benefit across all these drivers. Finally, we believe that this results &#x2013; this set of results reinforces not only the resilience of our balance sheet but also that our determination to position the Group to find quality profitable growth in challenging markets is paying off. And now we are happy to take any questions you have.</p>

          <p>These &#x2013; on slide 38 you say that you have approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities wrapped by monoline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have &#x2013; I think we touched on it already in the last quarterly presentation, these are mainly municipal bonds and evaluation of these bonds and the waiting takes already into account, so to speak, that the wrapping has unfallen, so that it is unwrapped. And indeed we don't see actually any particular impact of this whether it's now seen as wrapped or unwrapped. But maybe Martin you want to add something to this?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I repeat it for the people on the phone line. What we have to add here is that what obviously counts is that the underlying quality is very important. So for us, the risk of potentially losing any cover through the wrapping, we consider as extremely minimal because the respective assets have an average quality of between A and AA ratings.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is Thomas Henkov <mark type="inaudible" />. I wonder what your scope for acquisitions would be now that equity has fallen due to the situation on the unrealized losses and gains in of your investment and on the basis also that you have done some acquisitions. So, looking forward what is the size of acquisitions that you are going to be able to finance without compromising your solvency situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, could you hear the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can hear it. So, let me say first, we don't comment on specific transactions in that form. But let me reiterate what I said, we will continue to maintain our financial discipline, but at the same time, we still have a very strong balance sheet that will allow us to take advantage of opportunities that will arise during this period of time; that's one of the benefits of the discipline in the way we've operated the business to-date. So, we don't see any difficulty in our ability to continue to execute on our strategy going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to add here that with the Solvency I ratio of 178%, I don't see that movement in the equity during the year reducing our capabilities. And also I mentioned that we still have the 20% buffer over our AA internal requirements, roughly unchanged from year-end. So that also gives us room for further looking at opportunities in the market in 2008 and '09 and it is not a solvency constraint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question from the telephone then, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question from the telephone is from Mr. Spencer Horgan, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you very much. And the first one is just on the &#x2013; coming back to the M&amp;A angle. Obviously, I think you'd guided previously to what sort of territories would be interesting from an M&amp;A perspective and I remember you mentioned Spain two or three years ago, and fair enough, that's what we've seen you do. I think you've also mentioned bancassurance and potentially doing something in Asia there as well. I guess the U.K. was a bit of less fail for most people looking at Zurich. So I wonder if you can, sort of, recap in what lines of business, or what regions you're particularly looking at potential M&amp;A or is it unlimited in that respect and you're just looking at all opportunities that might come up?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the balance sheet, did, Dieter, did I hear you say that the 20% buffer above the economic capital already included committed acquisitions? And then secondly on the Solvency I ratio, I think there's a bit of differing practice between companies about whether you take into account unrealized losses on bonds in that ratio or not. Could you just confirm whether the 178 is including or excluding unrealized losses on bonds? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I don't think there's any change and as the slide that I'd put up in my comments earlier, which we've been working off of in terms of the areas where we want to grow and those areas where we want to maintain margin, and that's what we've been executing on. We've said that we wanted to grow in Europe and North American personal lines, the emerging markets and we've been very specific in that and we've been investing in the direct business as well.</p>
          <p>But that's not &#x2013; that doesn't mean that we should exclude looking at things that may be beneficial to the portfolio, but let me just reiterate our disciplined approach in both the transactions we do is reflected in the deals that we don't pursue. And we will not jeopardize our strict internal hurdles, no matter how well something is of a strategic fit to any acquisition that may appear.</p>
          <p>So you have to have I think confidence in the fact that this management team over the six plus years that we've been together in driving this business has been very disciplined from an operational standpoint and a financial standpoint and delivering the results that we have and the point that we will continue to execute on that basis. That's what's allowing us to deliver the kinds of the results and the strength of the balance sheet that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the other two questions, that is actually the answer, it could be very short, it's yes, yes. So the committed M&amp;A acquisitions are included in the calculation of our buffer above RPC because that is &#x2013; we always include what we know already of these years. So dividend share buyback and signed and closed deals are included and the Solvency I calculation of course includes the unrealized losses on investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have another question from the phone please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from the telephone is from Mr. James Quinn, Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Two questions, please. The first one is on Farmers, the combined ratio of 104.2 in the first half and in the second quarter it looked to be heading towards 110. And I'm just wondering what's driving that? And in addition, since that's around about the breakeven level, does that mean you need to slow down the growth of the exchanges, or will you need to try and take actions to improve the cost base or to generally make sure that you don't start losing surplus?</p>
          <p>And just on that same tack as well, just with the U.S. regulator I think some U.S. regulators seem to be getting more skeptical about improving rate increases, which is obviously understandable given the economic pressures which are out there. So what gives you the confidence you think that you will be able to continue to put through the sort of rate increases you had from the first half? And so that's one, rather convoluted, first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is just on RBSI and I guess having not done this, what this means for your expectations for Zurich Connect. I mean, clearly you spent a lot of time looking at RBSI and I think one thing you've acknowledged is that your U.K. personal life businesses isn't an area strength for you, do you feel you need to increase the investment in Zurich Connect in order to get to where you would have been had you bought RBSI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with the second part of the question and then allow Dieter to deal with the financial aspects of Farmers and the pricing. I'm not going to specifically comment on RBF, we're committed to the direct business, we've been investing in that, we're one of the major players in that sector and we will continue our investments there and we see &#x2013; and continue to see buyers wanting different distribution lines into our products and we'll continue to offer that. And we see this as a growing part of our portfolio and we'll continue at the same pace that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no real change to your existing strategy, is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously we look at that strategy constantly and look for opportunities as they present themselves, but we're still committed to the direct line, direct Zurich Connect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'm wondering is whether you feel that it might be worth actually accelerating the pace of investment in order to achieve some of the goals you would have achieved had you bought Royal Bank's Insurance business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean as I said, we continue to look at that and a strategy is not based upon reactions, it's based upon study in long-range and we've being executing on the Zurich Connect strategy and if opportunities present themselves for us to capitalize in that market we will. So I think we're going to continue at the pace we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James coming to your Farmers question. I mentioned already in my speech, more than 4%, 4.7% is CAT impact in the combined ratio of the 104.2 and most of the CAT was in the second quarter. If you had the opportunity to fly across the Midwest of the U.S. in May, June, you could actually see the huge flooding but also there were these 1,100 tornadoes I have mentioned. These are small local events but 1,100 of them adds up. And in the four states I have mentioned, Arkansas, Texas, Kansas and Minnesota, Farmers has a particularly strong market share. So therefore the CAT events actually have hit Farmers probably a bit stronger than other competitors who are less exposed in this market.</p>
          <p>Does this &#x2013; the surplus ratio does not impact our capability to grow. We are still feeling very comfortable and as Farmers' reputation is very much based on their capability and fast response on claims events, actually all these tornadoes is a great marketing campaign for Farmers and will help the growth in future further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If there is another question from the room. I could see a forest of hands the first time, so let's have a look. No questions from the room, could we take another one from the phone then please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question from the telephone is from Mr. Andrew Broadfield, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning everyone. Two questions, one just looking at the Global Life BOP-ROE, I was wondering if you can just talk me through how that's evolving because I think a while back when you first disclosed this metric it was quite a laggard in the business. And I was wondering whether this is all to do with the top line or to do with the capital base as well, so just a bit of view on that will be helpful.</p>
          <p>And the second question just back to Farmers again, I apologize if I've missed it but I just wanted to try and understand a little bit better the drivers of that solvency decline if possible, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll try my best. So let's start with the solvency base of Farmers. I had probably to go a bit deeper in the calculation of this ratio which is following local statutory requirements in the U.S. Farmers has acquired the small business of Zurich North America. The earned premium, you'll see in our half-year is still the minimis number. The way the regulator is requiring you to calculate your surplus ratio you have to take into account already the 12 months' full annual premium of the acquired business.</p>
          <p>So therefore, the surplus ratio calculation is pretty much ahead of the integration and booking of the acquired premium. That drives &#x2013; that is of course a movement in the surplus ratio, you cannot see or derive from the numbers you have available. And then the other movement is coming from a reduction of the surplus position at Farmers. I think that was around $260 million if I remember correctly and this is as unrealized and realized gains and losses plus certainly the higher combined ratio impacting this.</p>
          <p>We don't see any impact in our growth for this year and I think that is the advantage of the Farmers system, which we have. We are getting the fee income, we manage the business and we are not hit immediately by the volatility of the business. We can smooth it over the quarters or even years, and I think that is a strong advantage Zurich has by running a U.S third largest personal lines business on this indirect basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, just on the first component, the small business -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, Global Life BOP-ROE, yeah, I think that it's an impact of both, actually it's a annuity book we sold last year to Swiss Re. One of the reasons was that was a very low ROE business, so we could release more capital than earnings. The earnings results were actually pretty small, if I remember, less than 10 million BOP was the long-term average of this annuity book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just going back to the Farmers question. The second component &#x2013; sorry the first component, which was the small business, am I right in saying that's not just a timing issue, that is a sort of a permanent reduction that will grow back again over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes because if you acquire almost a $1 billion of premium, that is even for a large organization of farmers that is a strong additional growth and that certainly dilutes the surplus ratio on day one, but as we were fully aware of the transaction on both sides, I think we could calculate and forecast a surplus ratio and we included it in our growth plans for the next year. So therefore, we are not surprised by it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next questioner on the phone, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I had three questions. One, I think maybe I was asleep before, but it's the first time I see what you call the non-core businesses, the other line reported kind of a little bit below the rest. I wonder why that is, are you going to sell it? Maybe, I don't know.</p>
          <p>Second is, on my calculation, all I did is I took the figure for large claims and that CAT and also the reserve releases on a quarterly basis and tried to exclude all those in the reported number. 2Q '07, I calculated 93.7% and the first quarter '08, 91%, and the second quarter '07, 91.6. So there seems to be a drift here of 2%, and this is excluding large claims, and I'm not quite sure. I mean, you probably can't talk about it, because you look at it slightly differently, but there does seem to be an underlying drift, and I'm just wondering whether that's something you're kind of happy or I don't know whether that's something which is going to stay there or if we're at a kind of new level.</p>
          <p>And the last point which kind of relates to that, there's obviously been a big rise in large claims, we saw that in the first quarter but if anything it's actually accelerated in the second quarter. And I'm just wondering how you're addressing that, I mean, when one does numbers and excludes large claims in understanding it, the temptation is always to think the kind of one-off, actually more than  that would be my temptation. But, I mean, what are you doing about it, are you getting away from commercial lines or I don't know, just a general question but to me it's a little bit of worry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address the large claims piece. Obviously, we look at all of these things as a part of the operational and financial discipline. As soon as we saw this occurring, we went back in and looked at the specific events and specific accounts to make sure that the underwriting discipline around those, we were not compromising. Because that would be the systemic concern that I would have. We satisfied ourselves that these were not a result of weakening in the underwriting events, it was really a function of having more events taking place in this period of time than we might normally have had.</p>
          <p>So there is no and getting to you &#x2013; your point here is it's a function of our slipping away from our underwriting discipline that we find ourselves, and some of these customers and some of the events that drove this have been customers for a long period of time, very profitable accounts and so there is no systemic issue from that standpoint that we can see at this point in time. I assure you as Dieter points out, we look at these rates every other week as we see making sure we're calculating our technical price and maintaining our underwriting discipline and we're looking at events like this for potential trends, so that we could react to them.</p>
          <p>As to the &#x2013; I think Dieter did point out the mix particularly in North America towards more commission-based business which drives up the expense ratio. But I'd let him take you through the details of combined ratios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael I think you had a question regarding other business also, I did not fully understand -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I was thinking, the presentation maybe it hasn't changed, but to me it looked as if it's a change and I was thinking, they're going to sell it, because it almost appears as if it's a little bit below the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's certainly more negatively impacted by the financial market as other businesses. We have still, under the remainings of our Zurich Capital Market activities still trading portfolios, which are 60 million lower than last year. Then on the one off on the Life business in the U.S. out of the old Kemper organization there is a weaker result and also we had the December group some increases on disability reserves and lower commutation. So therefore these businesses have contributed less this year. That would be the negative aspect, I think the positive one is that is the ongoing core businesses have a much higher share and a BOP number this year than last year. So that means that ongoing businesses are delivering strong BOP increases. And I think that is what counts.</p>
          <p>On your question regarding the underlying drift, we are deliberately not presenting quarterly results because we run our business on a year-to-date basis and these quarter-by-quarter comparison are driven by so many factors. There is seasonality in a lot of lines of business and then you have really to drill down to each line of business and each market to explain and analyze, what is the underlying comparison. I think that the way we present it gives you a fair description how is the trend compared to last year has moved and we are not showing the large losses separately because we want to excuse ourselves or to walk away from it, I think it should give you only a bit more insight in the underlying earnings strength and earnings power and this is the more volatile part of the business and as Jim pointed out, we didn't find any weaknesses in our underwriting processes.</p>
          <p>Therefore I consider the large losses, it might sound strange, as positive aspects of our business because that is in the end what is insurance doing, to cover volatility. If no customer has volatility then they don't buy insurance any more and this volatility therefore is also reflected in our results. The last two quarters, it was above average this volatility on large losses, so there is upside for the future</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions please. First of all, in The Zurich Way, I think, one of the targets is a two percentage point improvement on the combined ratio per year and I wondered &#x2013; I'm not quite sure how often or how accurately you measure that, but how are you running relative to that target? I think you may be possibly running ahead of that target and that's possibly an explanation for the good loss ratio.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Dieter, in the past you've made comments about wanting to improve the tax rate. That seems to have happened. I wonder if you could just explain what's going on here, what are you doing to get the tax rate down and what's the direction, is 23% sustainable or could it improve even further? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the tax rate. So, I think this 23%, we're substantially, I think in a better place than we were some time ago. I think that the 23% is a good level and a platform, which we used to work further on our tax rate, and there are more changes in our internal and corporate structure which will help and support the tax rate. Of course, as usually we are not making a forecast because tax rate is &#x2013; can be influenced by our corporate structure but also it is a weighted average of all the local incomes and as we live on the diversity of our regional incomes and don't manage the group to specific incomes in each place every year. So, you will also see movements in the tax rate coming from these ups and downs in local incomes. But the level overall, I think is a good one and we work further on structural improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question, well I think if you take into account claims inflation and the rate movements described in our disclosures, I think we are pretty much on track on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so rate changes plus or minus claim inflation versus what your &#x2013; the loss ratio, underlying loss ratio reported the difference is about the two points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plus the portfolio shift, which I think helps additionally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, thanks very much then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, do we have another question in the room before I finish off with the questions on the telephone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="inaudible" /> and I have two questions. First one is the U.S. insurance market, I was a little bit surprised to see that you have shifted your General Insurance portfolio towards Europe now. My question is how is the U.S. insurance market playing the troubles at AIG? I mean, it would be quite interesting to see, can you gain some market share, what kind of feedback do you get from your sites people. Can they really profit from troubles at AIG, I do know that you do not comment on competitors but it will be quite interesting to see how is the U.S. market doing.</p>
          <p>And, the second one is we have seen one or two negative surprises with, other than temporary impairments, with some of your competitors, perhaps Martin Senn could give us little bit more insight here &#x2013; how much is already impaired, how much could be running through the P&amp;L account in the next 6 to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, thank you very much for the question. I would want to say obviously, we don't comment on individual competitors and I think, I couldn't comment on what the issues are, what's driving the issues at AIG others than what I read in the press. However, we have targeted in the U.S. that we want to grow the personal lines business, that's been our strategy and that we see the commercial business in North America and the Global Corporate business as a place where we want to enhance our margins, realize that when the market turns having that position that will provide for increased upside because of the platform from which we're operating.</p>
          <p>And I would say that generally through for our business in general, if you look at the results that we have now and as these markets improve and which they ultimately will improve in the cycle as we make money, in this kind of a cycle, we'll be in a better position to capitalize on the upturn as well. Obviously, I tend to be a little competitive from time-to-time and my expectation is that our people are competitive and where there is opportunity for us to gain market share in any market and to gain market share on a profitable basis, my expectation is that we should execute in that way. So, as it relates to investments and opportunities there and your question perhaps Martin Senn could answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. I obviously will not comment on impairments at some of our competitors, but what we can say despite the very challenging market conditions, we've been kind of, I wouldn't say pleased, but definitely an impairment of 495 million on the $200 billion portfolio is kind of acceptable. Given the market, the fall out, it's probably a manifestation of the disciplined approach we're pursuing in Investor Management, but also the high asset quality, coupled obviously with the diversification we are looking at.</p>
          <p>From the $495 million of impairments in the second quarter, we have some $350 million impairments in debt instruments, sorry, in equities, the rest in debt instruments. And in the first quarter, it was tilted to the auto other where we have in the first quarter more debt impairments and less equity impairments. You have been asking on an outlook, I only can basically repeat what Dieter has already said in his presentation, assuming the freeze all asset prices in particular, the equity prices at this point and would make an analysis looking forward. Then you will have to count with an impact of less of $100 million until year-end. But obviously, that is a very hypothetical statement. I do not believe that financial markets will not move from now until year-end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for one more question which I think we'll take, one last question from the telephone please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. Ben Cohen, UBS. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. I just wanted to ask on two things. Firstly, Dieter you made some comments about inflation assumptions. Could you give us any sort of sensitivity of your reserving to that 3% that you talked about and would you be looking to actually put greater assumptions in going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second thing was just to flesh out maybe the comment that the economic solvency really hasn't moved despite the acquisitions that you made and some of the market weakness. Does this relate to diversification credits that you're getting, simply the fact that it all really relates to interest rate movements that hedge out? Maybe you could tell a little bit more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You're spot on Ben, the economic solvency, it's not influenced by the interest rate movements because that is with the assets and liability matching. There is no impact on the economic solvency from this perspective. The inflation assumption that is a much more difficult question because that depends pretty much on the markets and line of business. We have included in a lot of long tail lines, much higher inflation assumptions. So maybe John, do you want to comment on typical U.S. situation to &#x2013; to give some examples on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So in the longer tail lines of business, we use quite aggressive inflation &#x2013; loss trend inflation assumptions in the reserving process. And at this point in time, what we see, and what the outlooks that we are looking at in terms of inflation would not threaten those inflation assumptions that we have built in. That's not to say if inflation went up to double-digits or some area like that that we wouldn't have to make an adjustment. But, what we're looking at right now I think we're comfortable that we have the right levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That should be now the end of the Q&amp;A, I think we're coming to the end of our time. So perhaps I could ask Jim Schiro to wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Malcolm and I want to thank everyone for participating in this call and I just want to reiterate a couple of short points. As the figures illustrate, Zurich is well equipped to face today's and I would say tomorrow's market forces as our diverse portfolio disciplined operating approach and demonstrated profitable growth capabilities make us both resilient and give us the ability to be opportunistic as these markets continue to develop. Our cash flow is strong, our balance sheet is healthy and our commitment to rigorous risk management and financial discipline is unwavering.</p>
          <p>In short, we remain focused on our strategy and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 16% ROE target across the cycle. And again, I want to thank you for being with us today and for offering the questions and allowing us to respond to them in this forum. Thank you very much.</p>
