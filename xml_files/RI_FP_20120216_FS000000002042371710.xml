        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for being with us this morning and welcome to Pernod Ricard office. For those I haven't met yet and I haven't the chance to know, let me briefly introduce myself. I'm Jean Touboul. I am the new IR for Pernod Ricard, taking over the position a couple of months ago from Denis Fievet, that you might know. We &#x2013; I will not take too much of your time just to tell you that I formally, I am the group &#x2013; I've been in the group for the last seven years and my last assignment being as the CFO for Eastern Europe business of Pernod Ricard.</p>
          <p>And now, not to take too much time from the hour we're going to spend together, I will give the floor over to Pierre and Gilles for the presentation of the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you, Jean, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> that's Denis, bravely took the position of CEO of Portugal. But you know, we have &#x2013; it's very much the sort of career which we favor in Pernod Ricard, so to have people who go from operational to functional and vice versa, so to have really a very good view of the business, so thank you, Jean, for joining us at the holding company.</p>
          <p>So I will go quickly through the presentation in order to give you time for your questions. So, the numbers, I think, very self-supporting, sales plus 11% and recurring profits, plus 17% both in organic term and group share of net profits plus 20%, that as it is. That's led us to a greater guidance for the fiscal year, so for the EBIT, now we give guidance of close to 8%, coming from close to 6%, so it's a two full percentage point improvement. And I would say mechanically, net debt to EBITDA is reduced from close to four to close to 3.9.</p>
          <p>So what are the underlying trends that explain this performance? It's first of all, the sales dynamism and this is driven by the top 14 strategic brands and the emerging market that we will see later on, that the mature market, that's doing well also. We can post an improvement in our margin, while we still maintain strong advertising and promotional support for our brands, which by the way, is also motivated quite a good pipeline of innovation.</p>
          <p>We have an accelerated growth in our earnings and deleveraging, which I think is, as I'll explain with the guidance. And we made key steps in the refinancing of the group. So the numbers, sales of 4.6 billion, plus 8%, which means organically, plus 11%. The top 14 in volume, plus 9%, sales plus 14, which means that we have a positive price mix effect, emerging markets, at plus 18% and mature market at plus 6%.</p>
          <p>That's restated from the French re-buying, I will come back to this. It will still be plus 3%, so we can say that all regions contributed to growth in our sales. Margin, now at 62.1% for gross margin, coming from 60.8%, so it's quite a significant improvement. And we have, as I said earlier, a continuous support to our brand with A&amp;P, advertising and promotional expenditures, plus 8%, which is in line with the sales. And as usual, the top 14 strategic brand capture the bulk of it, 76%, to be precise.</p>
          <p>Accelerated growth in earnings, so profits from recurring operation, that's close to &#x20AC;1.4 billion plus 14%, and organically, plus 17%. Net profit from recurring operating &#x20AC;843 million, plus 16%, as it is. And net profit, group share of net profit, just round number, &#x20AC;800 million, plus 20%. And we have continued diverging that with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.9% at the end of December of 2011, coming from 4.4% at the end of June last year.</p>
          <p>We have the so-called duty hike in France that led us &#x2013; that led, in fact, our big customer, I mean, the Carrefour, Auchan and Leclerc to buy in advance. That's why we call it pre-buying. The duty increase in average represents 14% and so our customers basically bought the equivalent of three- to four-month of stocks in order to benefit from the last year duties. That represents additional, I would say, in term of sales, &#x20AC;98 million and &#x20AC;64 million in term of profit. And that, of course, that was generated last December and of course, will not reappear from the second half. And, of course, our guidance take the full impact of this.</p>
          <p>So restated from this impact, the first half would have been in terms of sales at plus 8% and in term of profit at plus 12%. That's if you deduct the &#x20AC;98 million and the &#x20AC;64 million. Not so significant, but still can be noticed, the impact of the Chinese New Year, which as you know, was two weeks earlier this year than the year before, which means that we have a good chunk of our sales which took place in December. Last year, it was in January and that represents a positive impact in term of profit of &#x20AC;13 million, but as you can see, far less significant than the pre-buying in France.</p>
          <p>Well, the economic environment, I'll go quickly, I will come back in the conclusion. Strong dynamism in emerging markets, improvements in the U.S. and subdued growth in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Our currency evolution, we have the same sort of situation that we had a year and a half ago. So the average rate which is used to calculate the organic growth represents a weaker U.S. dollar for the last half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2010-2011. But if you take the closing rate, the spot rate, we have a much stronger dollar at the end of December than at the end of June 2011, and that, again, the numbers are on the chart below.</p>
          <p>So, let's go to the detailed sales analysis. So, we increased from 4.3% to 4.6%. 11% is the organic growth. We have a relatively minor ForEx impact, minus 2%, and the group structure almost insignificant, minus 1%, because we had limited disposal impacting this first half.</p>
          <p>Just a quick focus on the second quarter. So, the organic growth is plus 11%, but excluding the impact of the pre-buying in France, it would have been plus 7%, and, again, ForEx and group structure are almost insignificant.</p>
          <p>Let's look at it by region. So you have for each regions on the left-hand column, the growth rate for the full fiscal year 2010-2011. And on the right-hand column, for the growth rate, organic growth rate for the first half, so it's full year compared to the first half, but we think it's the relevant comparison.</p>
          <p>You can see an acceleration of growth in most regions. Asia plus 15% to plus 18%; Americas plus 5% to plus 6%; Europe 0% plus 2%; in the case of France, the plus 25%, excluding the pre-buying, would've been plus 1%.</p>
          <p>Starting with Asia and the rest of the world, organic growth of 18%. This is driven by the cognac, Martell, plus 31%, the Scotch whiskies, plus 17%, the Indian whiskies, plus 26%. And we have also good results in the Wines, in Jacob's Creek which is developing in Asia, particularly in China.</p>
          <p>Champagne, for instance, we are the leader in China, of course, on a small base, but we are growing fast. And vodka, which is doing &#x2013; Absolut is doing pretty well in many countries like, for instance, South Korea. But we had a limited decline in Imperial South Korea and of course, unfortunately, the recurring uncertainty in Thailand with 100 Pipers, but it's due to the environment.</p>
          <p>Still Asia, but now the analysis per country. China very dynamic, the same with India. We could also mention that Vietnam is now becoming a major country and plus 67% and that's year-on-year, that sort of performance which we have seen.</p>
          <p>Africa/Middle East, nice result at plus 15%. Taiwan very strong, Taiwan retail as well. South Korea, despite the limited decline in Imperial, minus 2%, we have plus 4% and this is driven by Chivas and Absolut.</p>
          <p>Imperial, in fact, represent the evolution of the local scotch. As you know, there are some local brands in South Korea, which is mainly driven by [portion]. In fact, the market is changing. Hence, we believe that there is a long-term trend that will move from the traditional on-trade to the modern on-trade, which means that our assets for Chivas and Absolut is really what is will pay off for the future.</p>
          <p>Thailand, I'll not repeat what I said earlier, just to mention that Absolut is growing very fast. Australia, back to growth for both spirits and wine. And Japan, surprisingly, plus 6%, despite all the difficulties which the country went through, and we are particularly pleased with the growth of the Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t at plus 12%.</p>
          <p>The Americas sustained growth, at plus 6% organic growth, and you can see that the Top 14, the premium wines, and the key local brands are all in the range of plus 7%, which includes the [tailor] brand. That's suffered a little bit. Maybe focus on the United States, I think that the good news over the last six months and we don't see any change for the near future, that the U.S. market is on the recovery. The first line is given the &#x2013; gives you the Nielsen and the NABCA numbers for the full calendar year 2011, which are positive. The market is in the range of plus 3%.</p>
          <p>Then the premiumization is back. These numbers are extracted from the DISCUS numbers. And you can see that very simply, the more premium, the highest the growth rate. And so I think that's, well, back to the pre-crisis trend which we knew on that market. So there, very good news.</p>
          <p>The on-trade is seemingly back on track as well, which is good for premium brands in general. And this, at the bottom of the slide, this interesting analysis, which was made by DISCUS, which are the market share of the alcoholic beverage for spirits in green, blue for wines and gray for beer. And you can see that over the decade from 2000 to 2011, basically, the beer lost 7% market share, mainly at the benefit of spirits, which went up from 29% to 34%. And the same sort of evolutions can be seen for the last year or so. If you compare 2011 to 2010, you can see that still the spirits are gaining market share at the expense of beer.</p>
          <p>So, now for Pernod Ricard, yes, we had a good momentum of our sales, plus 5% overall and the top 14, up plus 6% and you can see that we had a good price mix, because the volumes were at 3.5% and price mix at 2.4%.</p>
          <p>Absolut is stable, which is probably below what we expect. But it's become the realization of our promotions and new initiatives. And so, we have a number of initiatives, including a new campaign which is to start next March.</p>
          <p>Jameson, still impressive, plus 37%. It is, of course, one of our leading growth driver. Another very good news is that now the turnaround of Malibu seems to be well established. We have solid growth, plus 5%, and this is driven by innovation, the cocktails. The Malibu Black, you know that it's a 70-proof version of Malibu.</p>
          <p>And month-on-month, volumes are growing and we are just about to launch the Malibu Red, which is a combination of rum and tequila, of course, with the coconut flavor. Glenlivet, plus 9% and the 18-year old, which is in the range of $80 in terms of retail price, at plus 46% and represent more than 40% of the growth of the brand. Kahl&#xFA;a is stabilizing, depletion is down minus one, but we firmly believe that all the initiative we've taken and in particular, the new positioning as coffee rum will deliver in some of the brand. So I won't say what I said minutes ago for Malibu that the turnaround is done, but I think we're in good track for Kahl&#xFA;a.</p>
          <p>For the other countries, Brazil, Canada, a very good performance and Brazil, for instance, the top 14 at plus 34% is a local brand, which are, of course, not delivering the same sort of growth. We have one exception, which is Mexico, we have a net sale decline. In fact, we are just in the process of a complete reorganization of the company with a new business model, portfolio rationalization, new commercial policy and then I would say also, new CEO. And all the other countries are doing well.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Europe, outside France, plus 2% organic growth. The top 14 at plus 4%. So again, the growth is driven by our strategic brands. The premium wines are declining, minus 5%, but you will see as it is mainly driven to the UK and that it's at the benefit of the value and the margin and the key local brand at plus 5%.</p>
          <p>Inside, we have a sort of depolarization in Europe. Eastern Europe is doing extremely well, plus 15%. Russia at plus 26% and the Top 14 even faster. Ukraine at plus 23%. And in Poland, we have the decline of the local vodka, but if you look at the Top 14 at plus 11%, the dynamic is extremely strong and particularly with Ballantine at plus 31% and we confirm our position of leading scotch brand in Poland.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have Western Europe. We have a limited decline, minus 2%, but it is a decline anyway. And of course, it's mainly attributable to the Southern Europe countries, Spain, Italy, Greece. And for the UK, it's, in fact, mainly due to the wine. The spirits have been posting a modest growth, thus &#x2013; a growth.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, Germany is resilient and that's our shipments, but the Nielsen are even more dynamic and we have a good evolution of the Top 14 and in particular, Absolut, Havana Club, Glenlivet, Jameson and of course, not to forget Ramazzotti, our Italian bitter, which, as you know, is the leading imported spirit brand in Germany at plus 8%. And travel retail, good performance as well.</p>
          <p>France, plus 25%, but of course, this is the pre-buying. So excluding the pre-buying, the underlying trend would've been plus 1%. Having said that, we have brand which are delivering very well and excluding any elements of trade loading, we have very good performance of Havana Club, which is the fastest-growing brand in this market in France. Then Jameson, Abelard, so and this is the result of a very good pipeline of innovation.</p>
          <p>Now looking by brands, so the same comparison, you have the number for the full year, the fiscal year 2010-2011, and the growth rate for the first half of this current fiscal year. You can see an acceleration of the trend for each category, and the top 14 at plus 14%, compared to plus 10%, the premium wine brand at plus 3% compared to 0%, the 18 local spirit brands, plus 12%, compared to plus 3, and the rest of the portfolio, plus 2%, compared to plus 1%. And the premium brand represent now 74% of our sales, compared to 71% a year ago.</p>
          <p>So now, the top 14. First of all, you have brand per brands, the organic growth of the net sales, the volume, and the pre-mix impact. You can see that with almost no exceptions, Malibu, Beefeater and Kahl&#xFA;a, all the brands post a positive price mix. Overall, it's 5%, and even including the French pre-buying, it would have been plus 7%. And so we have seven brands which are recording double-digit sales growth. I think it's quite a good performance.</p>
          <p>Let's review brand per brand. So Absolut Vodka, plus 4%, so volume plus 3%, sales plus 4%, but a little bit below what &#x2013; the trend which we want to deliver on the brand, but it doesn't change at all the strategy. And we have, for instance, a very good development in many international market, outside the U.S., Brazil, Africa/Middle East, our retail from South Korea, India, Russia. And so we have lots of initiatives, which I'll show you in a minute.</p>
          <p>Chivas, an impressive growth rate of plus 13% and we have double-digit growth in all regions. The Americas being at plus 8%, still very nice. Total retail at plus 21% and premiumization still going on, because Chivas 18-year-old and 25-year-old, that's plus 31%.</p>
          <p>Ballantine, plus 6%. Of course, it is impacted by the sales in France. We have only one country with decline of sale, which is Spain. All the rest is booming, I mean, Americas plus 15%; Poland, I mentioned that. And also, the premiumization with Ballantine 17-year-old and above and the 21-year-old, 30-year-old and we have even 40-year-old and the 50-year-old, which are booming and they delivered, overall, half of the brand growth.</p>
          <p>Ricard, plus 32%. That is the result of the pre-buying. Excluding that, I mean, the underlying trend is a long-term trend, which is stability for the brand.</p>
          <p>Havana Club, stable. That's below what we would anticipate normally for the brand, which for our customers, to double-digit growth rate. This is the result of, of course, the weakness in Spain, in Italy. In Cuba, we had some issues in term of deliveries and also, I'll say, a relatively weak tourist season, but it's not the &#x2013; in term of, I would say, margin, it's not the most profitable market by far. We have a very important project in Spain.</p>
          <p>I will show you the bottle in a minute, which is Richwell, Richwell by Havana Club. So it's a new product in the range, which is specifically designed to compete with the other, I would say, spiced rum on the market, hence, it would be Captain Morgan. But in Spain, it would be more Brugal and Barcel&#xF3;. So it's a rounder whiskey and exactly positioned as the same price of premium scotch, let say, Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>Germany, plus 4% but the Nielsen has it plus 14%. In fact, that represent very much the trend of the brand, double-digit growth. Strong development in France, I said that Nielsen, plus 23%. Russia, doing very well. In Chile, it was just the technical impact of the change of a distributor there because we wanted to concentrate all our brand into one single hand.</p>
          <p>Malibu, plus 5%. I won't repeat what I said earlier about the turnaround of the brand. We are very pleased with the performance of the brand. Jameson, plus 25%. I mentioned the U.S. earlier, but Russia, plus 52% and now is the second market for the brand. France, close to double-digit, and this is not taking into account any pre-buyings, so it's really the underlying trend. Flat sales in South Africa, but it is the result of a strong price increase, value strategy.</p>
          <p>Beefeater, plus 2% and its particularly good if you look at where this growth has been delivered, because it's, first of all, Spain at plus 4%. When you know how the market is behaving, it's a good result and also in the U.S., where the brand is positive, not to forget Africa/Middle East.</p>
          <p>Kahl&#xFA;a, minus 3%, but we are really in the process of turning around the brand with the new positioning and internationalizing the brand and you can see some nice numbers, Canada, Australia and Russia.</p>
          <p>Martell, plus 28%, out of which 17% is the price mix impact, so it's quite an outstanding performance, which, of course, is &#x2013; results from the development of the higher grade, XO, plus 38%, Noblige, plus 30%, and also, price increases. For instance, we just passed a price increase at the beginning of this year in &#x2013; sorry, the second half in China. And so, of course, Asia is a main driver of the growth of Martell, but you can see that U.S. were doing well, as well in Russia. Glenlivet, plus 19%. That, of course, is the result of the numbers in the U.S., but also in the rest of the world. We mentioned, for instance, Taiwan at plus 58%.</p>
          <p>The champagne, what we can say in the champagne is that there was definitely a recovery for the year 2011 and you probably saw the numbers published by the CIVC, the industry organization. There was probably a little bit of disappointment for the month of December that was for Europe. On the contrary, what they call le grand export, which means outside Europe, continued on a very strong trend. That is reflected in the hierarchy of Mumm at plus 5%, but very good numbers anyway, with just France and Italy at minus 1%. On the contrary, Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, which is much more linked to, I would say, the rest of the world, outside Europe, plus 22% and you can see the U.S., plus 32%, Japan, plus 12%, and France, plus 27%. By the way, France is more a boutique brand.</p>
          <p>And China is now the fourth largest market for the brand, and I can say that with Mumm and Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t, we are the leader on the champagne market in China. And Royal Salute, our Scotch Whisky, we start at 21-year old, at plus 34%, I think is this self-supporting number.</p>
          <p>So, wines, I won't get into the detail, but just three numbers; volume minus 1%, sales plus 3%, profit plus 10%. That's the value strategy. If you remember it was the same sort of numbers I show you for the full fiscal year 2010, 2011. We continue on this first half and we will continue for this current fiscal year. So this is the value strategy, so you will see and you'll continue to see that we have the &#x2013; in term of volume, maybe disappointing numbers, but it's really favoring profit through volume.</p>
          <p>The key local brands, good numbers, plus 11% in volume, plus 12% in sales. We have, for instance, the continued dynamism of Indian Whisky at plus 26%, and particularly, Royal Stag and Blender's Pride.</p>
          <p>Passport, plus 21%. It's a brand which delivers very, very good numbers in many different markets and we believe that Passport is certainly part of our offering for the &#x2013; to reach the middle class. Those who can't afford the Chivas and the super premium brands. So we will certainly make more efforts in Passport in the future.</p>
          <p>We have also strong local jewels, ArArAt in Russia, Ramazzotti in Germany, Olmeca in Russia and Eastern Europe including Turkey, Something Special for Latin America. Clan Campbell and Pastis 51, that's the result of the pre-buying and the only difficulty which we have is Seagram's Gin, minus 4% and 100 Pipers at minus 8% and it is very much because of Thailand.</p>
          <p>I will go quickly through this, but it is just to give you a flavor of the direction of our marketing initiatives. The first direction is really ultra prestige and luxury. For instance, in the ultra prestige, we just launched the Chanteloup Perspective, which is a sort of super XO, super in the sense that it's just retail at twice the price, &#x20AC;250 compared to &#x20AC;120. So, of course, the liquid is different, but the packaging is absolutely impressive. Then into the luxury. L'Or de Jean Martell, which the bottle hasn't changed but the packaging, the case is, it is really like a luxury luggage I could describe it, because there is a handle. It's magnificent. If some time, we can show it to you.</p>
          <p>And in the, I don't know, ultra luxury, we have the Tribute to Honour Royal Salute at US$200,000 a bottle, and we have the cooperation with Harrods in some of our &#x2013; then, Jameson. New product is Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel, that's retail at US$35 compared to US$22 for Jameson. It's a non-aged product, but of course, the blend is better. But as you can imagine, the margin is a lot better, which means compared to the very nice margin of Jameson, it's very good.</p>
          <p>Then we have the new TV commercials, which is the Hawk of Achill. I think we should view sometimes, or if you want, we can do it on some stage. And of course, it is extended to the digital world, because you're invited to solve some quest and the mystery of the missing barrel. And that's on your favorite iPhone.</p>
          <p>Absolut Vodka, a lot of initiative. I will not mention all of them, but to say that we're very pleased with the test &#x2013; market tests we made on Elyx. We slightly improved the packaging, as you can see in the top picture on the right-hand side. In fact, we took lessons of the consumer and the trade reaction. The packaging in essence is not changed, but we improved the visibility, the clarity of the packaging and now, it's in the process of being launched in basically almost 30 markets. And this question mark on the bottom right is just to pre-announce the new drinks campaign. The first wave has been extremely successful. We saw that in the brand equity and now, so we have the second wave of the Absolut drink campaign and, hopefully, reproducing the very good result of the first wave.</p>
          <p>Malibu, yes, is turning &#x2013; the turnaround of the brand, thanks to this virtual circle of product innovation, limited edition, creative advertising, digital initiatives and so on.</p>
          <p>Chivas, to give you an example of combining traditional media and digital, in fact, you have a trailer which was on the &#x2013; not a TVC, but on the TV, that's really attracting the consumer to go and see and watch the two movies and on the website, one which is 13 minutes and the other one which is, I think, almost 10 and it was very successful. I invite you to go to the Chivas website and watch them, if you have not. That's a very nice movies made by the very good directors. Ballantine's, I mean, we continue to have very creative advertising, including on the Internet.</p>
          <p>For Jacob's Creek, I mean, the value strategy is supported by advertising, promotions of innovative products, for instance, the Cool Harvest and with featuring Naomi Watts. Sponsoring, we were a sponsor of the Australian Tennis Open and Facebook application, so really covering the full range of initiatives. And we have plenty of other digital initiatives, I won't go through them. But, of course, we will answer to any of your questions.</p>
          <p>And sorry, and some other key initiatives for us, so limited editions, new packaging, product innovation. You have &#x2013; the Ritual is the second on this chart. So we can see the different bottle.</p>
          <p>By the way, the brand name is Ritual by Havana Club, so Havana Club Ritual. So it's really, hopefully, a good design. And maybe for the sponsorship, I should mention that we signed a new contract for the Formula One, and so Mumm will remain the brand for celebrating the victory for the Grand Prix, so this year, of course, and the next subsequent three years. And that translates into some numbers, which certainly, Gilles will go through with his usual smile.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre. I think that those numbers give me a smile. Surprise, I think they are as strong as you said. Let's have a look at the P&amp;L. Top line growth 11% organically, EBIT growth 17% organically, so that's very strong. Even restated from the French pre-buying, our figures are very strong, 8% growth for net sales, 12% growth for the operating profit from recurring operations, with an improvement in our margins, which, I think, are an important element.</p>
          <p>So starting with the different effects, organic growth has been obviously the main driver of the growth in net sales, 17%. Group structure impact was very limited and we had a negative ForEx impact in the first half on the EBIT, which was &#x20AC;34 million, but we expect it to turn positive for the full year, because of the reinforcement of the dollar versus the euro. And based on the current rates, our estimation is that the ForEx impact for the full year should be around &#x20AC;25 million positive.</p>
          <p>Let's have a quick look at the gross margin, up 12%. Gross margin rate was up more than 120 basis points, 90 basis points excluding the French pre-buying, so a strong growth reflecting the premiumization. On the one hand, the positive portfolio mix with our top 14 brands growing quicker than the rest of the portfolio, which is obviously part of our strategy, and also, the improvement of the quality mix on all brands. And also brand by brand, we had a higher growth of superior qualities on the brands like Martell and the Scotch portfolio.</p>
          <p>We managed to increase prices. On average, on the top 14, price increases were higher than 2%, and at the same time, we've been very disciplined on our cost basis and we have managed to keep our input cost below a 2% increase, on average.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P, still strong, growing by 8% in the first semester. Excluding French pre-buying, we managed to keep a stable A&amp;P to net sales ratio, taking benefit on the critical mass we start having on some key brands in some key markets. We put the money where the potential is at the highest. Three-fourths of the A&amp;P investment was spent behind the top 14 brands.</p>
          <p>We give priority to the emerging markets. We had a 20% growth in A&amp;P investments there, and at the same time, in areas where the potential risk is lower, we managed to optimize the A&amp;P investments. A&amp;P was down 5% in Western Europe. Structure costs, they were up 8%, so slightly below the top line growth. They also &#x2013; structure costs, it's about resources. It's also about investments behind our key market and our key strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>From a market standpoint, we allocated our resources in particular in the commercial organization to the fastest-growing markets, the BRIC, as you see, China, India, Russia, Brazil had a strong double-digit growth in structure costs, so to strengthen our distribution network there. We have also invested in newly-created subsidiaries in Vietnam or in sub-Saharan Africa, where we created a region. And at the same time, in Western Europe, for instance, we had a moderate growth of 2%, in line with inflation.</p>
          <p>And apart from the country focus, we also try to focus our resources on the key topics, which are in line with our strategic development. So more money behind digital, more money behind innovation. We have innovation directors in all key brand companies. We launched our breakthrough innovation group and also talent management, which is a key priority for the group, and we have launched the Pernod Ricard University.</p>
          <p>So a consequence of all that, profit from recurring operations was up 17%. Restated from the French pre-buying still very strong growth, 12%. And we have gained operating margin in that period. It was enhanced by 160 basis points overall and restated by the French buying, still a very strong enhancement at 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>So very quickly by region, I won't obviously cover the top line growth, which has been presented by Pierre. So we'll focus on profits, operating profit growth. Everything is green there, as you can see. All regions renewed their contribution to organic growth, obviously, with a strong momentum in Asia, 27% growth in operating profit, a good growth in Americas, 6%. A good growth in Europe, 5%, despite the tough environment in Western Europe. And obviously, a very strong growth in France, which is largely due to the French pre-buying. So Asia/Rest of the World, top line growth, 18%. We had a very strong growth in operating profit organically, 27%.</p>
          <p>So the first engine obviously is the sales growth. It was also boosted by a continued improvement of price and mix. Price and mix in Asia for the first half was 10% of the top 14, which is, I think, an astonishing figure. And at the same time, we continued to increase our investment behind our brands, both in A&amp;P and in sales force. And we managed in that region, where again, we are the leader, where we start having critical mass in many markets, we managed to expand our operating margin. As you can see, the ratio was up from 32% to 34.6%.</p>
          <p>The Americas, acceleration of the growth of the operating profit organically, 6%. It was 3% last year. We increased the A&amp;P in line with the sales. We reinforced the route to market in some key markets, in particular, in Brazil in the first half. And U.S. and Brazil have been the key contributors to the growth of the profit during the semester, largely compensating for the negative one-shot impact of the business change that we mentioned in Mexico. And operating margin was stable at a constant ForEx.</p>
          <p>Europe, excluding France, so as we have said, depolarization between a buoyant Eastern Europe and a more difficult Western Europe. But all in all, you can see that we had a growth of 5% of the operating profit in the whole Europe, with a 2% top line gross. On the one hand, growth has accelerated in Eastern Europe as compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Overall, in terms of the A&amp;P in that region, we have really accelerated the growth in Eastern Europe; double-digit growth in Eastern Europe, in particular, in Russia and we have managed to decrease the investment in Western Europe, as we saw before, 5%, with targeted optimization on specific brands in specific countries; in Spain, Italy, Greece, or for instance, the local vodkas in Poland. And we have managed to improve our operating margin by 90 basis points, thanks to the higher growth of the Top 14, a good market mix. We have higher margin in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe, on average, and A&amp;P efficiency.</p>
          <p>France, obviously, the French pre-buying is the main driver of the growth in the first half. It was a positive impact on the operating profit by &#x20AC;64 million. What we can say for the future is that the second half of the current fiscal year will be impacted, first of all, obviously, by the reversal of the French pre-buying. So the positive &#x20AC;64 million in the first half will become negative &#x20AC;64 million in the second half. And we'll start having also the impact of the depressed consumption in France, because most of our clients have decided to increase the retail prices as early as January 2012. They have not waited for the new purchases in four or five months. So it means that we'll start having a negative impact in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our estimation of the impact on our operating profit of the depressed consumption for the full year, for the full calendar year, post [technical] increase, is around minus &#x20AC;25 million. So you can expect maybe around one-third of it impacting the second half of the current fiscal. You have here the split by region and very well balanced, I think. Emerging markets, obviously still very, very strong. Almost 40% of our group sales and profits. 18% growth top line, 22% growth EBIT, so it's a fast growth and, important point, it's a profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the lines below the operating profit, starting with the financial income. We had an improvement in the first half, &#x20AC;10 million, a small improvement in net financing cost. On the one hand, we had the positive impact from the debt reduction, which allow to offset the higher cost of debt in the period of time. And the semester's cost of debt was 4.9%, as compared to 4.7% last year. We also had the &#x20AC;6 million saving linked to the decrease in net financial expenses related to retirement benefits.</p>
          <p>Following, obviously, and we'll come back to that, our accelerated group refinancing in first half, we have now an EBITDA target for the average cost of debt for the full fiscal year, 2011-2012, close to 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was strong, very much in line with what we achieved last year. So on the one hand, we had obviously the positive impact from the growth in our profits. We had an increase in the working capital variation. This variation was higher by &#x20AC;147 million. On the one hand, some increase in strategic inventories variation, &#x20AC;28 million, which is clearly a normal business trend, because we want to sustain the strong whiskey and cognac growth that we've seen.</p>
          <p>We had also an increase in operating working capital variation by &#x20AC;119 million. It was largely due to the strong activity, which indeed, also included some technical factors, like the French pre-buying. That said, as you know, we have done strong efforts on working capital last year and when you have a look at the working capital, the operating working capital, plus factoring in the balance sheet at the end of December, it is actually lower at the end of December, 2011. It's &#x20AC;120 million, as compared to one year before, when it was &#x20AC;195 million. So we have managed to decrease the working capital in that period of time, despite the growth in the activity.</p>
          <p>CapEx grew as compared to last year by &#x20AC;31 million. We have a few important projects going on. Again, accompanying the growth of our strategic brands, storage capacity for Martell and Absolut and we are increasing the distillation capacity for Jameson. This is the start of a three-year investment program for Jameson. So the non-recurring items mainly include payments related to restructuring in some countries and also, some past tax litigation.</p>
          <p>Net debt, so it was down organically by almost &#x20AC;200 million, thanks to the stronger &#x2013; the free cash flow in that period of time. As you know in the first half, we paid the full dividend in the year. We had a negative ForEx impact on the debt for the reason that Pierre mentioned before and we had a strong dollar at the end of December, $1.29, as compared to euro, it was $1.45 at the beginning of the period. And so we had a negative transition impact which, as you will remember, followed almost &#x20AC;1 billion positive impact we had had the year before.</p>
          <p>We keep deleveraging the company. Clearly, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was in sharp decline this period of time from 4.4% to 3.9%, down 0.5. The French buying, because of the EBITDA gross weighted to it, has favored that evolution. Restated from French pre-buying, the ratio would have been 4.1%, down from 4.4%, so still a strong deleveraging in six months.</p>
          <p>A word now on our debt refinancing, because I think that the last six months have been very important. I think that we have delivered, actually, our financial strategy, the one we have been speaking about in the last years. We have deleveraged strongly as a company in the last three years. Following that, we regained investment grade rating by Moody's and S&amp;P in September-October. We have then accelerated our refinancing on the U.S. bond market with the $4 billion for two bond issuances in October and January, with very good financial conditions, taking benefit of historical low rates and leading, obviously, to an improved debt profile.</p>
          <p>Bond debt now represents 77% of gross debt, so it's far beyond our initial objective of 50%. And I think it would be very pragmatic having very good financing conditions, we &#x2013; the peak of the dollar financing, where it was the cheapest. And clearly, we took also into consideration the financial crisis in the euro area in the last summer, and we decided to accelerate our part of debt in bond financing. We have extended strongly the maturity of the debt. It's a bit lower than seven years now, it was a bit more than two years before bond refinancings.</p>
          <p>And the drawn bank debt now that remains to be refinanced before July 2013 is now limited to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. So I think we can say that we've done a definitive step in our refinancing.</p>
          <p>You have here the view of the debt, so you have in purple the &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which is what is left in terms of bank debt, maturity July 2013. This is pro forma of the issuance we did in January, and you can see that the maturity of the debt is very well spread across the years.</p>
          <p>We have not changed our split of debt between dollar and euro. We kept it at around 56% dollar, 46% euro. So a bit more than 100%, because we have some cash in sterling pound, I think. It's because &#x2013; we didn't change it, because it's just consistent with our EBITDA split by currency.</p>
          <p>We have started to increase the proportion of fixed rate debt. As you can see, including collars, this &#x2013; it's up, it's now 79%. We did that because we wanted to secure attractive long-term rates. We have been able to finance the very good conditions, so we wanted to secure banks.</p>
          <p>Tax, our effective corporate tax rates on items from recurring operations was 24.7%. It was slightly higher than last year. We had a technical impact due to seasonal activity, which was investments reinforced by the French pre-buying, and which has itself an impact of around 60 basis points. On non-recurring items, we have a positive impact of &#x20AC;50 million. It's largely linked to tax related to foreign exchange rate movements. For the full year, we estimate the effective corporate income tax on items from recurring operations to be in the range 23%-24%, which is consistent, which is in the range that we have already communicated in the past.</p>
          <p>Net profit from recurring operations up 16%, so higher than the gross of the EBIT, thanks to the savings in financial expenses that have been able to compensate the increase we had in tax rate in the first half. Net earnings per share, the growth was in line with the net profit increase. We had a few non-recurring items, an expense &#x2013; net expense &#x20AC;53 million on other operating income and expenses; on the one hand, &#x20AC;12 million of capital gains on the minor disposals in Canada and a cost of &#x20AC;65 million on restructuring and also non-recurring tax items.</p>
          <p>On the non-recurring financial items, we had a cost of &#x20AC;40 million. It's mainly linked to foreign exchange losses. So as a consequence, net profit after recurring and not-recurring items was up 20%. So I hand over to Pierre for the conclusion and the outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gilles. Yes this result is &#x2013; have some smiles, I think. So the first half, it was mainly the continuation of the business trend which we had in the former fiscal year, 2011 which means strong growth on the emerging market, premiumizations and, of course, the strong dynamism of our Top 14 Strategic Brands. We had an improvement of the operating margin, and as Gilles explained in detail, the significant steps in deleveraging and some refinancing of the group. One element to keep in mind is, obviously, that the pre-buying and to a minor extent, the Chinese New Year, which positively impacted the first half, of course, will have the reverse impact in the second half.</p>
          <p>So having said that, we need to &#x2013; I mean, in order to deliver our guidance, to look at the environment and our views for the, let's say, the macroeconomic environment is the following. We consider that we will view continued strong dynamism from emerging markets, and emerging market doesn't mean only Asia, but also Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa.</p>
          <p>The other good news which I explained at the beginning is the gradual but continuous improvements in the U.S. of the overall economy, but of the spirit market as well. On the contrary, we know that all the subdued growth in Western Europe and certainly, a continued recession in Southern Europe. And more specifically, depressed consumption, and Gilles went through that in detail in France due to the duty hike.</p>
          <p>So that's the environment. That is our scenario. And based on that scenario, that's why we have the current guidance, of course, based on, I would say, the premium portfolio, the global distribution and I really think that's adding our worldwide distribution network, which, entirely wholly owned, is a key assets for Pernod Ricard. We can capture growth wherever it is. So that's the guidance, you know it, close to 8%, close to 3.9.</p>
          <p>So now, the floor is yours for your questions. That's to remember you the date of the next event.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you for pointing that out. We were wondering. Sophie Dargnies from HSBC. I actually have three questions, in French. Could you kindly tell us about the impact of the Chinese New Year on sales? We have it for EBIT, but not for sales. It may not be huge, but it could be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second question. About the Americas, in Q2, there was a slowdown from Q1. Is this due to Mexico only, or are there other factors at play? Could you give us a country breakdown for the Americas? And my third question, could you tell us about the trends in January and February? Are there any changes from Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How about the orders in March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you can? Please, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilles is going to specify the numbers for the Americas. I am going to give you one piece of information. When we presented the Q1 numbers, we said that in the U.S., we had plus 15% in shipments. And that did not reflect the underlying market trend. So, Gilles will give you the explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We even said that the underlying trend in the U.S. in Q1 was 5%. As a matter of fact, for Q1 performance, we have 11% growth. Excluding technical effects in the U.S., it was 9.5%, actually. That's what happened. We had 15% growth in the U.S. in Q1. Technically speaking, due to the time difference between shipments and depletions, Q1 is lower, minus 3%. And the plus 5% we have for the half year, which is good performance in the U.S., reflects the underlying trend.</p>
          <p>So in actual effect, if you make things more general, if you take a look at the whole group, in the second quarter, we had organic top line growth of 11% restated for the French pre-buying, we're at plus 7%. If we restated for the U.S. in fact, we would be at 8%, whereas in Q1 restated the other way around, it would be 9.5%. So you see it's roughly the same thing. The slight dip is due to the fact that Western Europe was stable in Q1 and it's at minus 4% in Q2. So you see, that's probably the only underlying trend where it's somewhat weaker in Q2. But overall, the trend is very good, very strong.</p>
          <p>So, January. What can I say for January? Business as usual. Obviously, there is the impact of French pre-buying. Seems to be about in Western Europe, or interpreted, if I hear the question? The answer now? Pierre Pringuet?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Gilles said, in the Eurozone, there will be a kind of technical recession, which is what economists are saying. And it started in the fall, basically. So, Western Europe has slackened. It started in our second quarter. And I think it's a pretty sensible forecast for the six to nine months to come. And our guidance is based on that scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question in the audience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez from Cheuvreux. I just want to make sure I understood what you said about the scenario, what you're implying for H2. I crunched the numbers with the average of the margin, with the Chinese New Year between 30% and 40%. The underlying top line growth would be 7% for the quarter, 8% minus the Chinese New Year and bottom-line growth, as you said, would be 11%. When I took a look at all the details, you're guiding us to 3% in H2 based on your guidance at 8%, right?</p>
          <p>And I don't quite understand that, because your margin jumped 100 basis points in H1 and yet, you're guiding us to something different. So, it's a game of cat and mouse between you and us. There's a swing in margin between H1 and H2, and I don't quite understand all the reasons.</p>
          <p>And I have another question. It's about Absolut. It's kind of sluggish in the U.S. It's good outside the U.S. When will Absolut be stabilized, as far as you're concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know whether it's cat and mouse. We're the cat, we're ahead of you. That's right. Anyway, guidance, we gave you three items for H2 above and beyond the macroeconomic scenario, we gave you clear trends for that. First of all, we spoke about the impact of the French pre-buying; &#x20AC;64 million in H1. It will be negative in H2, right? Then we spoke about the impact of the Chinese New Year, we said &#x20AC;13 million positive in H1, it will be negative in H2. We -here, it's not a technical impact, it's a business impact. Due to the tax hike in France, consumption will be down in H2. We gave you the impact for the full calendar year, minus &#x20AC;25 million, and there will be part of that in H2.</p>
          <p>If you take all that, put all those numbers, put them in the hopper and your H2 bottom line growth is well above what you said. And for the rest, there may be a few differences, phasing investments from one quarter to the next and so on. But in terms of the underlying trend, there is no change from H1. The main impact is due to the fact that in France, yes, consumption is going to slide in the 12 months to come and Western Europe is going to undergo significant &#x2013; we're minus 2% in December, which is what we achieved last year for the full year. So overall, it's the same kind of story, but the improvement in Q1 did not bear out in Q2.</p>
          <p>Now, moving onto Absolut. Let me begin by telling you a fact. If you take the past six or 12 months, it's our highest historical performance for Absolut. So, Absolut is growing. So, of course, growth in the half year is below what we've been expecting, because we're looking at 2%, 3% in the U.S., double-digit growth in the rest of the world. It's not what we saw in the last quarter, in particular, due to the fact there are some markets such as Spain that have suffered. There's nothing much we can do about that, when the macroeconomic environment is so untoward.</p>
          <p>But the strategy for Absolut is extraordinarily clear. We're not changing our strategy for Absolut at all. It consists in using the DNA of the brand. It's a provocative brand. I can tell you that the new drinks campaign I showed you a teaser of, will not let you down. You'll see that Absolut is indeed provocative. And the artists keep telling me this, but Absolut Blank. It's a bottle of Absolut that's delivered with nothing at all. It's just the bottle, but it demonstrates the strength of the brand. You can tell what the brand is just by looking at the bottle. You don't even have to write Absolut on it, because the world over, everybody knows it's a bottle of Absolut. You don't even have to write Absolut on it.</p>
          <p>So, it lets people be creative and decorate the bottle as they like. We trust you guys, but of course, we used famous artists who have created works of art and that has made the success of Absolut in the '80s, when Absolut was on the pop art scene. Now, we're using today's modern art. So what I'm saying is, it's chock-full of initiatives. Not to mention Elyx. Elyx is one of the fastest product developments we've experienced, because we made the decision and the test markets were initiated. Eight months to nine months took place, elapsed, no more. It's just one specific liquid, right? Because we're using the historical still of Lars Olsson Smith, the creator of the &#x2013; inventor of [Absolut]. We're using that still. The packaging is specific. We've tested it and we're further going to improve it for the launch on 30 or so markets. So as you see, Absolut's strategic roadmap is crystal clear, and...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry, just to come back on the sort of first-second half split on EBIT and your answers, unfortunately, weren't being translated to English, so I may not have fully understood what you said before. But I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is there a sort of change in the leverage? One of the things you have seen in the first half is very strong leverage in the business, A&amp;P rising more in line with underlying sales. Is that something we should expect in the second half? Does that relate to, EBIT guidance looks quite low. Is that just more a comment around there's some top line in Western Europe combined with those technical factors that you've already outlined?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, Ian. Well, we give you guidance, pre-sale guidance for the year. We embed it when we communicate, so I think we gave already a lot of information. So I won't give you a guidance on each single element of the P&amp;L. What I can tell you and maybe to repeat in English what I said a bit earlier, we'll have in the second half some technical factors. The reversal of the French pre-buying, &#x20AC;64 million; the Chinese New Year, &#x20AC;13 million; and we have the start of a depressed consumption in France and we valued the possible &#x2013; the expected impact for the full calendar year.</p>
          <p>So I think that's &#x2013; we said it by both elements, you can have an idea of the growth. The implicit growth for the second half derived from our guidance. I think and for the rest, we may have a slightly different phasing of A&amp;P between first half and second half. I would say that overall for the full year in terms of A&amp;P, should expect the ratio to net sales to be between stability and a modest growth. Hope it answers your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Simon Hales from Barclays Capital. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, please, if I can. Just on Mexico, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about exactly what you're actually doing on the ground there? And I sort of noted that you talked about sort of restructuring your route to market. Did that have a destocking effect perhaps on some of the numbers in the end of Q2 and how should we think about that business developing in the second half? Is there any technical effects there we should be aware of?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, maybe, Gilles, I'm just trying to understand your interest rate coupon guidance for the second half and obviously, the full year coupon now that you're going towards 5.3%. I think from my analysis, I thought you had now less than &#x20AC;2 billion of debt carrying a coupon of more than 5%, I'm just trying to understand why that coupon is stepping up a little bit in the second half. Is this something to do with you taking maybe some issuance fees associated with the bond issues into the coupon rate that you're guiding towards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's okay. I will start with your question on the interest rates. Well, obviously, the accelerated refinancing we did and I think that you all understand why we did that and I think it's a great achievement. We paid a spread on our U.S. bond issuance which was higher than 200 basis points. As you know, this refinancing is used to refund a bank debt on which we have 100 basis points of spread. So very low spread, so there is a differential there.</p>
          <p>On the top of that, as I said before, we have increased our part of debt which is at fixed rates to secure long-term attractive fixed rates, and so there is obviously a differential also between short-term variable rates and longer term fixed rate, so that's a consequence also of having a longer maturity of the debt. So that's why these &#x2013; there is an increase. That said, we'll start having in 2013, in the first half of 2013, some, I would say, five-years-old expensive financing or hedging, that will come to maturity and that will allow to compensate for that increase. So basically, it will be for the second half of next fiscal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should be perhaps thinking that your general 5%, around 5% coupon guidance which you gave historically is more likely the ongoing rate, once we get into fiscal 2013 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't say that. I said that we are at 5.3% this year. It could be a bit higher than that next year, because of the full-year impact of our refinancing and then starting to decrease again, based, obviously, on the current rate. So I would say long-term, based on the current rate, the 5.3% percent is probably a good target. But you could have the small increase in the year of 2012-2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexico, you probably remember that in fact, Mexico is the &#x2013; historically, the former Domecq, which has been acquired by Allied Domecq, by the way. And the company history was based on locally-produced brandy and in general, I would say, local brands. So in fact, the decision which we made is now to refocus the company on the priority brands and its &#x2013; really mean that streamlining the portfolio, by the way, we made a mutual decision with Beam to discontinue the distribution of Sauza from the first of January.</p>
          <p>And really, to give the full focus of the company which on what we believe is the future, it means the scotch whiskeys and definitely with the Chivas and Ballantine's and the vodka with Absolut and that would be the core of the development. And to your question, are there something destocking elements in the performance of the first half? Yes. Definitely, there is. Will there be in the second half? Maybe to a limited extent.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I can tell you that if I look at the performance, the underlying performance of our imported brand, the brand I mentioned and particularly Chivas and Absolut, I'm extremely confident that Mexico will recover the status of a growth country for us. No doubt about this.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi. It's Dirk Van Vlaanderen from Jefferies. A question on a A&amp;P spend and, I guess, more specifically on the digital side, you seem to be saying that that's been going well for you. Can you give an indication, I realize it's obviously competitively sensitive to say how much is digital versus traditional. But could you give an indication of perhaps how much your digital spend has increased? Maybe not in the half, but in general versus maybe the more conventional media spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's clearly a strong double-digit increase, but I won't give you precise number. In terms of part of the total A&amp;P, I cannot give you a precise number, but I know that on some key brands, we start being at levels around 10%, 15%, so which is a &#x2013; which start being high levels. It's a very efficient way of communicating. It turns to be overall cheaper than classical media. Production cost is higher, but then, the use of the media is very cheap. So that's clearly an important trend for us and we are investing more and more in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add one thing, the digital spend cannot be related only to the media expenditure, because it also can replace or, in fact, complement what we do in term of promotions. When we guide you with your iPhone to the promotions, for instance, there is a Jameson application, where can I find my favorite Jamesons in just the immediate surrounding? And of course, this uses the geo-localization. Is that media? Is that consumer promotion? So that's why the &#x2013; it should be unfair to look at digital communications and media, only just media.</p>
          <p>And by the way, I gave this example of Chivas, it would complement each other in the sense that we use traditional media to trail the consumer and then to go to the website and watch the movie and for instance, in the all the other brand which I mentioned and in Absolut, the drinks campaign will be used in traditional media.</p>
          <p>So I don't think one should be opposed to each other. It's a trend. We are there. We'll continue to be there. We will spend more money here in this area, but you will never replace the other communication tools.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikolaas Faes here from Bryan, Garnier. I've got three questions, if I may. First of all, you flagged the decline in Italy of sales by 11%, because of the tighter stocks in the trade. Can you give us an idea of how the underlying demand went in that country?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I would like your sense, your thinking behind further increasing your structure costs in Western Europe at the same moment you do less A&amp;P, and clearly given the apparent &#x2013; the structural decline in demand in some of the countries? And then thirdly, could you give us an idea how much of your Chinese sales is now cognac and whisky and how much are other products? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the bulk of our sales is definitely cognac and whisky. I mean, the rest is relatively tiny in comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much would be cognac? Is that 60%, 70% or &#x2013; roughly? Very roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. We don't go into that sort of detail about that. Regarding Italy, Gilles is just looking at the Nielsen to give you some sense of the underlying trend and if we don't find it, we will communicate it to you. Having said that, there is no mystery. I think this economy is bad and obviously, the spirit market is bad as well, and the same sort of pattern which we saw in Spain. And then coming to your structure cost approach, well, we really consider that Western Europe is a sort of bastion, highly profitable.</p>
          <p>I mean Spain is a highly profitable market. And, of course, we make savings in some A&amp;P, we make also some saving in term of structure cost, but we don't want to disown this market. And in particular, there was a lot of talks about that the consumer is shifting from the on-trade to the off-trade. In Spain, almost two-third of consumption remains in the on-trade and will continue to remain in the on-trade, but it's part of the culture of the company. And we are gaining market share in Spain. So our view, of course, is to be pragmatic in a subdued environment. We make some savings, but long term, we are in Spain. We are in Greece. We are in Italy, and will remain there in order to capture growth whenever it will come back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have the Nielsen on Italy indeed. So for the last six months, value Nielsen off-trade market was down 3% and Pernod Ricard, we were down also 3%, whereas we had a double digit decline in net sales. So it's true that the underlying trend is better than what has appeared in our figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Easily, it is a traditional market. So there is a significant portion of the sale which grew through wholesaler. So that can explain the disconnection between the shipments and the consumer offtake. That's normal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got three questions, actually. If I could ask, first of all, the Chinese New Year, can you give us an idea what the sell-through in terms of consumer demand has been? And my second would be, you mentioned that the price increases of the top 14 brands have been a touch over 2% for the first half. Would you be expecting that to accelerate as the pricing outlook perhaps improves a little bit?</p>
          <p>And can you just comment on how you're optimizing the A&amp;P spend in Western Europe? Are you pulling that away from certain brands that are underperforming or are you moving &#x2013; consolidating some of your agencies, so moving away from non-working marketing spend? A little detail on that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chinese New Year consumer offtake, it's too early to say because as you know, there are no real Nielsen reliable panel in China. We probably would be able to comment about that when we communicate our third quarter sales. Having said that, what we know from our wholesalers and the primary wholesalers is that seemingly, their depletion has been very good, so there's no worry whatsoever. But to be more precise, we still have to wait another six weeks to have the information. Top 14 price mix, yes, we will continue to increase our price whenever we can, whenever and wherever, and by the way, we do price increases overall. You could see that in the first half, that will continue the second half. I missed the last question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was one of the elements behind it but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we don't do. We, for instance, we never go for single agency. To be very matter of fact, when we acquired Allied Domecq, they were with one single agency and they told us we made enormous gain in term of fees. Okay, so get the numbers. They were higher than ours. So I think the &#x2013; it's not a good explanation.</p>
          <p>And we prefer to maintain the competition between the agencies. And for instance, the new campaign, extremely successful, which we had in Chivas, which is the Live with Chivalry and is the campaign I mentioned to you is the further evolution, is the result of the competition between the TBWA, who has the Chivas budget before, and the Euro RSCG, which has been the winner. So we want to maintain the competition between our advertising agency and this is for the benefit of creativity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of numbers? Well, what we can say is that it's really based on analysis of brand market combination potentials. We have a look at the competitive environment and how much is invested in a given category in a given market. And based on that, we make sure that we have sufficient visibility, I would say, to be able to have a good return on our investment on our brands. So typically in the first half, in Western Europe, which is probably the region where we made that optimization, in Greece, we had a reduction, obviously, everybody reducing the investment in Greece, and so it wouldn't make sense for us to increase it.</p>
          <p>Local vodkas in Poland, that's a tough category, where investment is low and so we try to optimize investment there. And in Spain, for instance, we did some optimization on some specific brands where we believe that we could optimize without putting in danger, obviously, our profit pool. On the other hand, as we mentioned, we are putting more money in new facilities, like the launch of Ritual, where we'll have some important investment to be able to be successful in that launch, which means that also in tough declining countries, we can increase investment on some specific initiatives and decrease investment on some other brands where the investment is not so key.</p>
