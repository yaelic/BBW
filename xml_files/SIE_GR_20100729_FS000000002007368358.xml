        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Florian.</p>
          <p>Welcome and good morning, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. And let's get right into the highlights of the quarter. It's pretty clear that the quarter and the year so far have been outstanding in terms of financial and operational results. Our three sectors are executing extremely well and steadily improving their competitive positions. The order intake was up across the board with the shorter cycle businesses and industry coming back strongly against easy comps, and in the third quarter we booked a number of large orders in the energy sector across almost all divisions.</p>
          <p>Our strong and growing position in the emerging markets and our powerful ties into the export driven German economy helped our shorter cycle businesses which in turn supported revenue numbers. Our sectors have become significantly more efficient, and so their higher volumes, particularly in Industry and Healthcare led to really powerful results on the sector profit line. And those profits have again been converted into cash with every sector showing a cash conversion rate above 1.</p>
          <p>Today's announcement of the divestment of electronics assembly is again proof point for our commitment to actively manage our portfolio and to further sharpen our profile.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the numbers. New orders where up by an impressive 16% year on year and showed growth for the first time since more than a year. Revenue came in level with the prior year quarter on a comparable basis and book to bill has come solidly back above 1 in each sector with a total of 1.09. On the profit line and cash flow, you once again can see the results of the fundamental improvements we have made throughout the company. Sector profit is up 40% over the last year and free cash flow surged even more impressively by 100% compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Our backlog has been a source of strength through the past two years, and we continue to expand it. The backlog reached a record high of &#x20AC;89 billion, and it was fueled by strong new bookings, and it was also lifted as a result of positive currency translation effect in the range of &#x20AC;3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The energy sector remains the biggest contributor to the backlog with &#x20AC;54 billion. Be it in Fossil, Transmission or Renewables, all divisions saw significant order wins in Q3. In Fossil we sold our new class of turbines, the six H-class turbines to Florida Power &amp; Light. Renewables won a number of very large offshore windparks, among them 20 more in the UK from RWE, Baltic 2 in Germany from EnBW, and an important step in U.S. was the win of our so far largest onshore project, 150 turbines for the Lower Snake River Windpark.</p>
          <p>And in transmission, we extended our leading position in offshore grid connections through several large contract wins. Among them was the BorWin2 contract from Transpower worth more than &#x20AC;500 million. These wins are clear evidence that our integrated energy offering is a unique competitive strength.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Industry sector, broad based growth pushed the sector's backlog to 29 billion at the end of the third quarter. A very good example for our focus on the emerging markets is the close cooperation of the Mobility division with the Russian railway company RZD, which is resulting in significant orders. Finally, Healthcare signed an innovative 15-year public-private partnership contract in Spain worth &#x20AC;130 million over the life of the agreement.</p>
          <p>Now, let's spend some time on the divisional picture in the quarter. All three sectors posted double-digit order growth with Industry showing the highest momentum. Industry Automation, OSRAM, and the short cycling motion control business of DT all significantly increased their orders, posted revenue growth and achieved excellent profitability due to higher capacity utilization. Industry Automation and Drive Technologies benefited from strong demand in emerging markets and in particularly from the German export driven industries like machines builders and automotive.</p>
          <p>OSRAM's outstanding numbers are fueled by healthy automotive demand and an accelerated shift towards LED, which accounted already for more than 20% of revenue in the third quarter. Our late cycle businesses, Building Technologies and Industry Solutions are still operating in difficult markets, but there are signs of some market stability returning.</p>
          <p>Mobility executed its projects well and showed solid order growth. The sales funnel is looking promising, but of course the timing of further orders is never easy to predict. Sector Energy again showed its excellent execution abilities and achieved 14.3% profit margin in the upper range of the target band. In particular Fossil delivered outstanding profitably supported by diligent project delivery and a favorable revenue mix. As indicated, the broad energy market showed signs of improvement while the speed of recovery varies by division.</p>
          <p>The book to bill ratio reached remarkable 1.25 for the quarter. Main current growth driver is the Renewable division, which is expanding capacities across the globe to work through its rising backlog. We will see further revenue growth in coming quarters and with a margin of 13.5% profitability is a benchmark level.</p>
          <p>Healthcare saw better markets and showed an excellent 10% increase in order intake and 4% revenue growth. Key growth drivers in imaging and IT were emerging markets like China and Brazil. And we still see positive effects from the release of pent up demand in the U.S. after the passing of the healthcare reform early in the year. Imaging and IT maintained the overall lead in profitability through the innovation strength and structural cost savings.</p>
          <p>The encouraging signs for higher growth from Diagnostics did not show through in Q3. But Diagnostics reported a sound underlying profitability of 19.3%.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, also from my side. Since we are just a few yards away from the goal line of Fit for 2010, let me give you an overview on where we stand on the Group targets in our financials. That's page number seven on your handouts. As far as profitability on the upper left is concerned, I mean there is a very high probability, to put it this way, that we are going to be within our sector goal targets which we had put in place 2007. And there is no indication that this should be missed of some sort.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cash conversion, we are currently at 0.93. Year-to-date that should actually come a bit closer to what we expect the growth to be given also now the first signs of growth in our early cycle environments, which of course also will subsequently have some more working capital. I believe this is a satisfactory number. Obviously, how that is going to go forward in the fourth quarter massively depends on also how our billings in excess will develop in terms of our customer prepayments, and the like, and we'll come to that later.</p>
          <p>On the lower left, you will see the capital structure where we had a original goal of 4.8 to 1.0 Industrial adjusted net debt over EBITDA. That obviously has been significantly lower, and we definitely and purposely will miss that goal also for 2010. And there is nothing wrong to sit on a decent amount of cash to keep our flexibility financially as well as strategically.</p>
          <p>Capital efficiency makes kind of a lot of progress here. We have arrived at about 15% which is the mid point of our target margin on ROCE. Indications such as that for the full year we'll likely not going to maintain the 15.1% due to some items below the line on restructuring as well as build up on working capital going forward. But we do believe that we still made significant progress in the capital efficiency, and if you compare numbers from 2007 all the way through 2010, we can clearly see that the transformational efforts we have been putting in place 2008 and '09 are finally paying off. Also in terms of how our ROCEs developed over that period of time.</p>
          <p>Next page, obviously, you know this is where the biggest pile of work for the company is still sitting. It's below the total sector line as we call it. We've made decent progress again in Q3 on several items.</p>
          <p>You may have heard about the latest announcement that we've been able to dispose of our pick-and-place business, which was a heavy drag on the P&amp;L in 2009 and parts of 2010. This reduction, if and when it carries through, what we believe it will, then this will actually then close that chapter for good. There will be some losses associated with the transaction, but the good news is this is considered to be final on the matter. We will dispose the business to a company which is extremely strong and has a long track record on pick-and-place equipment, predominantly in the semiconductor industry. And we feel pretty comfortable about the value creation potential which that new home is offering to the business.</p>
          <p>On both NSN and SIS, which obviously, especially SIS has been a disappointment in terms of profitability development, we have initiated actions in both areas. Structural improvements as well as restructuring efforts. Those efforts will most likely lead to material restructuring charges in the quarters to come. Depending on the result of the negotiations with the local SER representatives, there will be some impact on Q4 in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p> SFS we believe has shown remarkable strengths, which should be more considered to be exceptional than the rule. CNPA. That's basically this pick-and-place matter. There you can see that also in Q3, operationally, progress has been made.</p>
          <p>SRE, which is the real estate function in the company, has contributed 107 million to profitability below the line. That has obviously been positively affected by some disposals of assets. We continue to look into those disposals to strengthen our effectiveness here within the so called REIP, Real Estate Improvement Program. For the next quarter, we do not expect a material number of disposals, so obviously the profitability will be less than Q3. And there will also be some items associated with the deployment of the real estate savings program going forward.</p>
          <p>Tax rate has been quite high, unusually high, as far as we can say from the past quarters. We do expect tax rate to go down a bit in Q4. However, we also have to recognize that due to the fact that profitability in the U.S. has been particularly strong, the tax brackets of the U.S. will play an increasingly higher role on the tax rate going forward.</p>
          <p>Corporate pension and corporate items, the guidance which we have been giving for quite some time now around 400 million should be actually also the pop-out number going forward. Obviously in Q3, we have been benefiting from a positive impact on the re-evaluation of our asset retirement obligation, which was about 60 million. And that obviously is not going to continue in Q4. So that should be considered as we move along.</p>
          <p>As you know, it's been kind of, yeah, as I said careful about the prediction of our free cash flow going forward. Major assumption has been that we were not particularly sure how customer prepayments would develop. You see here that during the course of 2009 and perhaps also beginning of 2010 there was a negative trend on billings in excess plus advance payments. That trend actually has been reversed over the last quarters, which obviously contributes to a positive development in free cash-flow.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx spending, our policy remains in place. We are strict by those who of course who invest into opportunities as we see organic or the intake growing at Siemens. You see that's quite a correlation to the curve. And I would expect the CapEx rate to be just about in the ballpark of the lower end of the target range here.</p>
          <p>As a result of what I just was explaining on prepayment billings in excess and asset management efforts, you see on page number 10 that we've been continuously growing our free cash flow also in Q3. You'll see also the development of last year which ended at 4.9 billion, with the &#x2013; obviously we'd a bit disappointed if we did not reach that mark during fourth quarter of 2010. That pretty much in a nutshell concludes my remarks on the numbers. And, with that I would give it back to Peter in terms of commenting on the guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe.</p>
          <p>In summary, in an improved environment we delivered excellent results in the quarter. Things are moving steadily forward at a good pace. And our key focus is growth, but continually manage to maximize capital return and ensure consistent execution and delivery. Our guidance, we are on track to deliver a total sector profit well above the prior year level of &#x20AC;7.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And with that, Joe and myself are happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Andreas Willi of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions please. The first one on your balance sheet, it's increasingly in good shape, you have an existing buyback mandate. But so far you've indicated you prefer dividends over buybacks. Does this means we should expect just a higher base dividend or maybe a special dividend at some point? And also if you could explain why you no longer seeing the buybacks are a good tool given you have originally had a mandate for a stock buyback?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on your orders in the Fossil, you have &#x2013; there were a number of orders either announced by you or in the press during the quarter. Maybe you could give us as an indication of orders that you have received or are close to receiving but have not booked yet in the Fossil division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Andreas. On the balance sheet, first of all obviously it's a good problem to have to be rich in cash and having a strong balance sheet. I mean we've never said that we do not think that buyback is a decent matter of returning equity to the shareholders. It's often just a matter of priority. And it is true that our position is that dividends would be prioritized over buybacks in the near future. However, how much that will be and how it will happen is something we need to conclude once the fiscal year is finished, and then we'll also of course inform the markets about the outcome of our deliberations.</p>
          <p>On the order book on Fossil, I mean obviously all, everything which we have been announcing in the media together with our customers or which had been announced by our customers where we were obviously favorable party. Eventually, it will also show up in the bookings.</p>
          <p>I think at this point of time it would feel a little deep if we kind of discuss orders which are just about to be finished, but it is fair to say that the order funnel has strengthened a bit in the fossil environment, predominantly of course gas. By the same token, I mean we have to say that there is still a quite a competitive environment and quite a material discussion about pricing with our customers or customers to be. So, while in a nutshell it has been picking up, we still do see some pricing discussion in the business place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Uglow of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Good morning. Two questions, one I guess is a sort of followup to what Andreas was getting at. Just on the Fossil Power Gen, Joe, just so I understand it, are you saying that some of the orders that have been announced have not been booked this quarter? And obviously particularly I was expecting to see some effect in the orders from the H-Frames? So that's question number one. Did any of that go into the current quarter?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on Diagnostics, Peter you mentioned obviously great level of profitability, but the organic growth was back down to 1%. Was that growth down to essentially a lower growth in the market or did you actually concede little bit of market share? Could you just sort of take us through that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm happy to Ben. Hi. I mean on the &#x2013; look on the order intake, as I said everything which has been announced is going to be booked. Which orders now have been booked with what amount, please just bear with us. It's a little too complicated at this time since it goes into extreme detail. On the H-Frames, the order which we have received will be booked over time because it's a more mid-term, long-term aspect to it, and we are very prudent on our rules on how we book orders.</p>
          <p>I mean that the good news is we've had a very strong order intake, and there have been several of those projects which also have of course been announced in the media have been booked. Sometimes also our customers are not, do not appreciate discussing the matters in public. So please bear with us if we respect the will of our customers here.</p>
          <p>So as I said, the good news is we've been booking a lot of orders. The funnel has been becoming more lively than it used to be. The challenge here is that we still do see massive request from pricing from our customers, and this is how we take it from here.</p>
          <p>On the market share, I mean, obviously look if we compare what we believe the market looks like and how it develops to our numbers, and sometimes also if it's is a decent comparison to our competitors, we come to the conclusion that obviously the market grows less than we do. And that obviously would mean that we take market share from others, which as I said also is being supported by some competitive comparisons. But, that's as much as we I think can speculate on that term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And slightly unkind followup, but I saw on Bloomberg there were some comments about the impairment issue. Can you just update us there, Joe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I haven't read Bloomberg yet, but I know what I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's usually the more reliable source of information on the matter. And what I did say is that first of all our Diagnostics division again has delivered a very decent and satisfactory performance on the bottom line, at least to our expectations. We continue to have our challenges on the topline growth where we have seen a like-for-like of about 1 to 2% excluding currency impact. This one is below the expectations which we had at a particular point in time.</p>
          <p>We have a new CEO in place who deserves the time in a generally decent business environment to make his own considerations about how to go to market. There will be a business plan, and as a routine as we do with every asset which carries a material amount of goodwill, we do the testing at yearend and then will take it from there. This is as much and as honestly also as technical as it can be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Peter Reilly of Deutsche Bank has our next question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions please. Firstly, can you tell us what the future is going to be for centrally managed portfolio activities, if you close the sale of the electronic assembly business? Can we assume that that whole sectoral division there ceases to exist in the near future?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I was very pleasantly surprised by the speed of recovery in Drive Technologies. Can you give us a bit more of flavor on what's coming back so strongly and so quickly? Your statement seems to imply that it's both long-cycle and the short-cycle now recovering in Drive Technologies. So, a bit of a color would be appreciated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. On the CNPA, obviously the electronic assembly, the pick-and-place machines, had been the biggest part of the Centrally Managed Portfolio Assets. And there are few minor items in here to which we will give an update on when we close the fiscal year 2010, and the update obviously will be in November. Despite all the work and the efforts on those assets, we believe it has proven well that we put some distressed assets out of the business and fix it and either close or sell it. So, we will see how we deal with it going forward. But you're right, the major portion was the pick-and-place, and this now seems to be sort of if and when everything goes the way we have been agreeing it with the buyer.</p>
          <p>On the Industrial outlook, I believe in the &#x2013; hope you guys agree to it. We've been pretty straight on in terms of predicting the short-cycle development was a little more favorable than we had admitted. But that's actually the preferable outcome.</p>
          <p>On the long cycle, so that's the one thing, on the long-cycle environment as we have heard from the sector in the energy market days end of June. They have already been in a bit more positive about the outlook. This has becoming earlier than we had originally thought. Now the question is, how does this develop, we too believe that in the early cycle, in the short-cycle environment, there has been &#x2013; a material amount of that growth has been, is being attributed to filling up the supply chain all the way from us to the end markets. And I would be extremely careful about predicting those types of growth rates into the near future.</p>
          <p>On the longer-cycle environment, there is obviously good potential in terms of replacement of cold steam versus efficient and environmentally friendly and highly efficient gas, that's a trend. No one really, I guess can deny it. But, there's also the other item that's got to be someone who spends the money on; the same is true with the replacements of the grids, predominately of course in the U.S., but also in other places of the world.</p>
          <p>We increasing investment into Renewables, both predominately wind but in parcels with solar. Definitely we'll also have some ramifications into the grid infrastructure, especially as far as its efficiency is concerned. So those are the areas of encouragement. The challenges are that pricing is still a matter, and that there are new entrants in the lower, in the low performance &#x2013; I would not say low cost, but in the low performance, low technology environment. We see predominately in China who had been strengthened by the recent stimulus encouragement of the economy and then who also now are moving in overseas into adjacent markets. So that's &#x2013; those are the challenges we have to deal with it, and this is how I believe we would want to describe our sector outlook going forward.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Two questions, if I may. The first is more or less a followup to Andreas' question on the cash. Given that the pension deficit is now 6.1 billion, do you think you're going to go back to filling that pension deficit with cash as was done earlier, a couple of years ago?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Healthcare, you made, post the last quarter the announcement that you're reorganizing Healthcare, and I was just wondering, if you could give us an update on how this is progressing? And what kind of charges, if any, may be accruing related to those organizational changes? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, let me start with the Healthcare reorganization. This is really a strategic realignment of our businesses where we on one hand would like to make sure that the high technology businesses are really having the right organizational setup, and then having the right focus behind the, let's call it, the smart or product lines which are clearly driven towards emerging markets. So, this is less a question of restructuring charges and reduction of any type of source. This was more a realignment and the realignment across the organization is going extremely well. All the CEOs are in place, and they are really driving the businesses in a more customer aligned fashion than we used to have it across the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, and on the cash position versus the pension deficit. I mean, in general the pension deficit predominantly came out of the fact that of course we have ongoing service cost, but to largest extent it came from a further reduction of interest rates. And about &#x2013; I think the interest rate reduction compared to Q2 to Q3 was about 30 basis points on a discount rate, and that 30 basis points in a nutshell translated into 700 million increase of pension liabilities. So that set us &#x2013; you see the sensitivity of the matter. That had been about 200 million reduction of assets which obviously are understandable if you just compare the indices like EURO STOXX or DAX or Dow Jones from March 31 to June 30. Those at least, those indices have recovered, and that will also have some impact on the asset evaluation if it stays how it's been staying now.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; if you can clearly see from that volatility and that sensitivity that the question actually is much more related to what will interest rates be going forward, what do we expect and how long do we believe that the current status of interest levels are predominantly due to the monetary policies of governments and monetary unions and whether we see a change on this one. So far the company has the position that the current rates are heavily impacted by a temporary policy of the government in terms of their spending and monetary items and that we do believe interest rates will be going up.</p>
          <p>That is also being supported of course by the massive governmental and public debt which at some point in time needs to be financed. So we would actually expect in the long term interest rates to go up. That much to the philosophy and evaluation of the pension deficit. And that obviously also that development will eventually determine whether or not and, if yes when, we need to make some contribution.</p>
          <p>As far as mandatory contributions are concerned, there is mostly only one country which has a material impact, and this one is the UK. Here we did do a settlement agreement with the trustees last year already, which basically covers the way in the next 10 years. So, there is little to expect here. But then again it depends on how interest rates will develop and how the company maintains its view on interest rate development and its sources.</p>
          <p>I mean the most, the more important topic we are looking into in terms of pension management is actually more inflation hedge in the long term. I should add something which we are currently debating and kicking around with. So you can see we are actually discussing a completely different matter in terms of interest, but that's as much as we can say at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically the dividend or share buyback decision would not be impacted by the current rise in the pension deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously as long as the company maintains its view on interest rate development, your assumption is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now move to Gael de Bray of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. This is Gael de Bray from SocGen. My first question is on the restructuring. I'm surprised to see you quoted this morning talking to the press that you're going to reduce your restructuring effort quite significantly compared to the initial guidance of &#x20AC;500 million you had initially for the full year within the sector profit.</p>
          <p>I'm actually just out of the Legrand conference call, and their strategy is to continue to restructure their operations as long as demand in certain geographies remain weak. And basically their message is that the more you dig into optimization, the more you find. So, I'm just curious on what's your view on this.</p>
          <p>The second question is about corporate items. The corporate items in Q3 were just &#x20AC;266 million. Clearly the run rate on the quarterly basis of the past nine months has been roughly 300, &#x20AC;200 million also so far. So well below your quarterly run rate of &#x20AC;400 million, you're giving us. So what's now your confidence that you have structurally adjusted down what the overhead cost maybe down to &#x20AC;200 million a quarter?</p>
          <p>Maybe one question on the Industry Solutions division to finish with. Orders seem to be stabilize here with a book-to-bill slightly above one times in Q3. So how confident are you that the 5%ish margin you achieved in Q3 is actually the trough for the division, and what could possibly go wrong in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. Thank you, Gael. Quite a bunch of important questions here, and first of all on the restructuring. If you &#x2013; I think you have attended also the quarter update on the energy financial market days, and I'm sure you remember that, at that time I was already guiding the audience that we too expect a lesser amount of restructuring in the sector environment due to the fact that we have been seeing a much quicker recovery of demand. So, it shouldn't actually come as a surprise here.</p>
          <p>And this is not a contradiction to any other competitors and peers in the markets who continue to drive their, and optimize their business in terms of productivity. It was actually in other cost of driving it and doing it is something different, and of course we do agree and continue to optimize our businesses and look for productivity and innovation. So, there is no contradiction at this particular matter and the guidance as I said has been reduced from about 500 to just about what we delivered this time, 250, which actually we view as a positive.</p>
          <p>On the corporate items for Q4, I also said earlier in the press call that the 400 million ballpark number should be a decent number to use in models if there were any. I mean the 266 which you have been quoting on corporate items, you would need to consider that we had a one-time positive on the asset retirement obligation, which is about 60 million. So if you add this one to it, then we definitely are already at about 330, 340, which is not far away from a admittedly more conservative guidance.</p>
          <p>On Q2, you may remember that we had also some positive one-offs, which are not recurring. So if you look at the run rate in Q2, Q3 it's more 330, 340, than 260.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we deliberately are making efforts to beef up our marketing policies. We have just launched a new round of our corporate answers campaign, which we believe is a good thing for the company. So therefore there will be items which we deliberately decide upon on on the board or other levels because we believe it's good for the company.</p>
          <p>On Q4, there is also something you should keep in mind. The carve out cost, which we have in carving out assets which we believe should be dealt different within the future, will be shown under corporate items. I believe we've disclosed that also in the earnings release, so that's something to consider if you make your own view about the 400 million guidance going forward.</p>
          <p>Now in Industry Solutions, I mean that obviously is the division within Industry which is the latest-cycle business there. Obviously, predominantly in Metals, which had one of the deepest dives in 2009, and is slowly but surely recovering, but still far away from peak reached in 2008. So this will take time here to recover. We also do see that the market environment, extremely price sensitive, and there are fewer market participants out there who obviously care less about 7 to 9% target margins than anything else. And that's something we have to deal with it.</p>
          <p>So your assumption is right. Industrial Solution will take time to be back in the ranges which we would like it to be in. But there is also no reason not to believe that they will make their way through that recovery.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Olivier Esnou. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, it's Olivier Esnou from Exane. Three questions, please.</p>
          <p>What are your thoughts on this SG&amp;A investment plan that you mention in H1? Have you started in that direction of reinvesting more into the business, and what that means for the full-year number?</p>
          <p>Second question, you mentioned difficult pricing environment still in Fossil Power. I would like to have your thought on what is the net pricing environment. Because at the same time your cost still potentially going down or, do you see differently from GE here?</p>
          <p>And maybe a third question on the emerging market, I see a &#x2013; I mean the minorities profit are still under pressure. How would you qualify the profitability of Siemens in its JVs in emerging market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Hello, Olivier.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A, I mean obviously if you look at the SG&amp;A numbers in the P&amp;L, which we have attached to the earnings release, it's been catching up predominantly still in due to the fact that that were obviously also exchange rate-related effects here. But we are making some investments. That goes from a sizable marketing campaign all the way to exploring new sales channels and regions.</p>
          <p>So it's been just about the ballpark of last year in Q3, so there's little change. So you can see that we're moving towards our guidance that we will be just a little shy of last year's SG&amp;A levels. The positive is that we have been reducing our, if you want, our ongoing SG&amp;A infrastructure, which is back offices, G&amp;A-related matters, and now deliberately invest the incremental money into the front end of the go-to market environment.</p>
          <p>So that's why we believe this is still on average a positive. By the same token, I'm also very close on the organization, not to give away structural improvements, which we have been making in the past that easily.</p>
          <p>On the pricing environment, as is relates to Fossil, I mean obviously, of course, when we book orders which are significantly higher in price decrease as the current P&amp;L, we also look into productivity. How we can make it up net-net. So far we've been, in that area we've been pretty decent. And there is a positive coming from obviously the satellite chain environment, but predominately from design to cost measures.</p>
          <p>So giving a net-net numbers at this point in time is real premature, but what I can give you just as an orientation, the gross margin on the existing backlog is just about at the levels which we have been seeing in our Q3 P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>On the emerging markets minority investments, I mean obviously this is &#x2013; we don't believe this is a material impact on our profitability overall. So therefore there will be fluctuations here, but it does not really impact the general, broad view on how we believe the business will be developed on a global basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's take the last question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question today comes from Simon Smith of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. I actually had three questions.</p>
          <p>One was, have you seen any impacts from FX in the quarter which would be one-off in nature? We're seeing some volatility through this year. Wondered if it's anything particularly meaningful this quarter.</p>
          <p>Second question would be, in terms of the short-cycle businesses, when &#x2013; I'm sort of talking about Industry Automation. You were implying there that there have been elements of restocking that you'd done, that you were sensing in the market. Obviously, margins have done fantastically well. Is there anything we should be cautious about there with regard to the mix of the type of demand you've seen of late or any sort of guidance you'd give us as to how those margins could trend?</p>
          <p>And I guess coming back to the previous point on the order book for Fossil. You obviously sort of saying there that we've &#x2013; we're seeing a relatively flat outlook for the gross margin in terms of the backlog versus your current run rate, but I guess there were some good orders that were &#x2013; that are still in there from better times. Should I take that to mean that the actual orders that are being added to it, the run rate of the new orders, would be below the current gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Let me maybe start the last one.</p>
          <p>I think if the existing orders have a certain margin, and the new orders do not change it, they should not be significantly lower in margin than the remaining ones were. So obviously I understand the motivation of the question. The answer is we have not seen a material impact on our quality of the backlog, as we can see it today.</p>
          <p>So it remains a matter of solid execution. And then we should actually see the numbers happening over the course of the quarters. So the predominant driving aspects of the margin is solid execution rather than trying to make up some mix impacts which may or may not happen. And this is probably as much as we want to say on the energy orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the third one, please bear with us. I mean we need to execute and then we'll see what all the programs have been worth on driving productivity, but so far, and I hope you can agree with us, since Q2 2008, that execution has been reasonably solid.</p>
          <p>On Industrial Automation, obviously it's very, very valid points. We stand well in Q3 and also in Q2 out of two factors. First, we made good on what we promised, that the margins are up. If and when it goes up again, will be significant. That should be that way because it has been similar when it went down.</p>
          <p>And the second topic is &#x2013; and this is indeed a mix issue. You might have seen that the growth in Germany has been exceptionally high. And usually the German customer base for Industrial Automation is a customer base which has highly complex software and electronic solutions, which obviously also have a certain tribute to the margin. So, there was a positive mix effect in Q3 out of that exceptionally strong German business.</p>
          <p>So on the &#x2013; on our notion that the material part was filling the supply chain. I mean this is definitely due to the assumption that the supply chain has still been empty. If you just think about the automotive industry, which in most parts, was caught completely flat footed on the demand. So we filled up there.</p>
          <p>And going forward, and that's been the notion here, why we are little conservative. We do not expect the growth rates to be similar as to what we have seen in the last two quarters in Industrial Automation due to that assumption.</p>
          <p>FX impact &#x2013; I mean obviously translational impact has been shown in the earnings release bookings. If I'm not mistaken, we're about 600 basis points and the billings just about 400 basis points favorable, given the weak euro in that period.</p>
          <p>Transactional, there has been some impact, which we have already also been guiding on the Healthcare, where the currency impact was not as favorable as it was in Q2 and Q1. But all in all, there was no material transactional impact on the currency.</p>
          <p>And as far as the strategic item is considered it will post some advance or disadvantage going forward. I mean, this is only &#x2013; one could only speculate on that. This is something which we better not do. So all in all, currency in general is positive if you have a weak euro because Siemens is about 10 billion long on the U.S. dollar on average. But it's hard to predict what impact that will make in the marketplace.</p>
