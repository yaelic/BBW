        <plist>
          <p>Hello, all, and welcome to this conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012. With me here today I have our CEO, Hans Vestberg; CFO, Jan Frykhammar; Head of Support Solutions, Per Borgklint; and Head of Networks, Johan Wibergh.</p>
          <p>We will, as always, start with a brief presentation followed by a Q&amp;A. But first, I have to make the usual reminder that we, during the call today, will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this conference call. We encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as in our annual report.</p>
          <p>And with that said, I would like to hand the call over to Hans Vestberg.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Helena, and welcome, everybody. Let me start by going over a little bit of the key developments in the market 2012. I think it's no surprise to you that this was the year, 2012, of mass-market adoption of smartphones. In the fourth quarter, 40% of all phones shipped were smartphones. And this of course very importantly, the indicator as to the pattern of usage of smartphones compared to feature phones is significantly different. Another thing that we already talked in the beginning of 2012 about, was that we envisioned and forecasted that the operator would focus much more on high-performance mobile broadband networks and efficiency and we have seen that through the year. It is really the competitive advantage that many operators are trying to get by handing a much better mobile broadband experience to the consumers. So that's very important.</p>
          <p>We have also seen in 2012 a broad introduction of LTE. Still not that many subscribers worldwide compared to the totality, but we have seen more and more markets deciding for LTE and also getting licenses for LTE. And there are some certain markets that are ahead when it comes to the subscribers, I would say Korea, Japan and the U.S. are in the leader. But we also see now introduction in many other regions. This drives, at the same time, a need for HSPA investment in order to have a performance as well as a consumer experience on the mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>During 2012, there also had macroeconomic and political uncertainties in certain regions. I have to say there's the same regions, markets or macroeconomic challenges we have had through the year, no new ones, and has remained quite the same. And that there also was political uncertainty during the year in markets in Middle East and Africa. So all in all, we haven't seen any worsening, I would say we've see more of a stability when it comes to those two factors. And then we will see going in now to 2013, how it will continue. But so far we don't see any worsenings.</p>
          <p>Remarkable is that we are now passing 1.5 billion mobile broadband subscriptions, which is a 50% increase in one year.</p>
          <p>If I then talk a little bit about the Ericsson, and where we are here, and of course the year ended on a flat sales compared to 2011. However, with some trend shifts within Global Services and Support Solutions had a growth year, strong growth year, while the Networks had a decline in the full year, where of course CDMA played a vital role as that decline with some 40% year-over-year or 2011 versus 2012. That was expected, as we all know, as the investment are moving to LTE for the CDMA operators.</p>
          <p>We can also say we have important LTE events in 2012, with a good and high market share and lately of course a lot of LTE decisions we're taking in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The year also have a lot of critical decisions for the company. We decided for our Support Solutions strategy with the OSS/BSS and media. We also decided for an IPR strategy, which are, we believe, two important pillars for Ericsson going forward. We did acquisitions in areas like OSS with Telcordia and ConceptWave and we also acquired ourself much deeper into media with the Technicolor acquisition and then also BelAir, a good complement to our portfolio with their WiFi solutions. That was some of them. Most definitely a year where we focused more on the base business and then in February, we finally did &#x2013; or finalized the divestment of Sony Ericsson.</p>
          <p>If you look at the net income for full year, that is clearly down compared to 2011, very much impacted by ST-Ericsson. ST-Ericsson, both the write-off that we pre-announced in the fourth quarter but there also were the ongoing carrying losses of ST-E through the year.</p>
          <p>There is, of course, the business mix with higher share of coverage projects than capacity projects and the European modernization, which both hit Networks but also in network rollout. Known facts during the year, which we have been working with to no surprise but definitely weighing our net income. You can also finally say that on the cash conversion we hit our target, above 70%, with well above, reaching 116%. Jan will come back to our cash flow in the fourth quarter. Of course, we always would like to look at cash flow from a full-year perspective as quarters may vary, but definitely a good year of operational cash flow for Ericsson.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter then, a couple of highlights, 5% growth, all segments growing. That's, of course, a little bit of a trend shift as we have had Networks for a couple of quarters having negative growth off a very strong 2011. Five out of ten regions growing and we had the sequential growth of 23%. One thing that will be said is that we had also the five regions growing where of course North America continued to be very strong, with good growth in the fourth quarter. But we also saw a little bit of a pickup on CDMA investments. But we see that as temporary and it will continue to decline.</p>
          <p>Profitability in the fourth quarter, gross margin came up sequentially on year-over-year both on mix and the improvement &#x2013; or share of Services and Networks. Operating margin went up to 7.1%, SEK 4.8 billion, so 17% growth compared to last year. We had an impact of restructuring that was higher this Q4 compared to last Q4. Of course, on the net income we had a big impact on the ST-Ericsson charge of SEK 8 billion.</p>
          <p>Then I leave over to Johan to talk about Networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans. So as was already said then, I mean Networks had a much better Q4 and then earlier in the year it was overall a very challenging year, but it came back somewhat in Q4, up 6% year-over-year, or it becomes 9% organic FX adjusted. It was a high business activity in North America and Japan. I also think it's encouraging to see that six out of 10 market regions had growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>And we see also continued decline of GSM sales in China, of course not a surprise, that was already announced; but it's still a fact.</p>
          <p>Looking on Q4, then, we said it was 31% up quarter-over-quarter. CDMA, strong quarter, an overall strong result for 2012; we are really grateful for that. However, of course, looking at 2013 we know there would be a continued rapid decline of CDMA sales.</p>
          <p>On the Q4 operating margin, 8% compared to year-over-year then 8% in Q4 2011. We had a positive impact from higher sales, also negative impact then from restructuring. And so quarter-over-quarter, the CDMA capacity we're thankful, but not the full answer.</p>
          <p>Moving then the next slide, looking on the business on the underlying drivers, I think there are a couple of things to highlight here. So first of all, on the Packet Core item, SSR, we have talked about that before. And we launched that in the beginning of 2012. I have to say that orders have been above my expectations. It's encouraging to see that we now got 19 new contracts in Q4, summing up to 39 and strong, positive feedback from customers and they're really doing great on that. Now it's important here to remember that this is now to a very large extent then connected to the Mobile side, and in 2013, we will start working more actively on the Fixed side.</p>
          <p>LTE in our product portfolio, it was really good. I think we are &#x2013; we're feeling that we are in a very strong position and we are very much encouraged to see the wins happening in Latin America, where we seem to be approaching 60% market share on those awarded the deals of LTE in Latin America, despite very tough competition and still ending up in acceptable profitability.</p>
          <p>We also saw a comeback of microwave transport during the fourth quarter and it was encouraging.</p>
          <p>Another thing when it comes to LTE is what we announced in December which was the world's first combined LTE network where you have both the two technologies, FDD and TDD that's the two different versions of LTE running on the same base station allowing handovers between these two standards. And that's a first.</p>
          <p>We also see then a continued interest in the market of how we've changed the traditional telephone and the voice calls from the old technology that's called circuit switch, over to the new technology that's called VoIP on LTE networks. That will drive sales of IMS. It's a market that Ericsson has been investing in for a long time. We are the market leader with 60 commercial installations of IMS, and I think this is promising for the future.</p>
          <p>Then, very much the focus we have in Networks is to make sure we continue the very high and good operation performance and focus on profitability. And I have to remind you back on the Investor Day in November; we talked about three items to get back to double-digit operating margins. The first one is commercial excellence, and there's a lot of things regarding pricing here, we are really in an industry where you can't &#x2013; that doesn't totally deliver enough profitability, so it doesn't give much room for price movement. The second one is effectiveness in the internal organization. We have a big focus on lean, overall, in the organization to drive efficiencies. And thirdly, it's overall cost savings. And these things will help us to return to double-digit operating margins.</p>
          <p>And with that, back to you, Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will back in for Magnus today that he is not here. In <mark type="ph" /> Cista (13:31) he is on a business trip for doing business out in <mark type="ph" /> Werd (13:34). So on the Services then, the fourth quarter growth of 4%, both for the whole Global Services and Professional Services. We continue to see good growth in managers and consultants and system integration, and that's very much driven of course by the focus by operators on operation efficiency and to reduce cost. In the fourth quarter we also had 50 new contracts in Managed Services that we signed. Network Rollout only grew 3%, but that's of course from a high level; we have established ourselves on a high level on Network Rollout and the project activity was very high in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full year, a growth of 12%, Professional 14%. We added almost 15 billion SEK in more sales in 2012 in Services. So this was a year compared to 2011 where we had strong growth in Services.</p>
          <p>If we look at probability, remained flat at 6% and decreased a little bit from the third quarter mainly because of the mix as we had more Network Rollout of the totality that moved it down. If we look at Professional Services, the operating margin maintained 15%, which is a high level where we have been for quite a while in that bracket, between some 13% to 16%. Very much fueled of course of efficiency improvements. Rollout, same level of loss as we saw in the fourth quarter last year and sequentially a worsening, and that's of course due to the much higher degree of projects we concluded and worked with in the fourth quarter, which is very usual for fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Full year, margin declined slightly on the percentage point of view but that is more <mark type="ph" /> dreaming (15:38) about Network Rollout. Professional Service improved their operating margin to 14% in the year of 12% growth &#x2013; 14% growth, which is very good.</p>
          <p>So I leave it back to Per for Support Solutions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks you Hans. So hi, everyone. So quarter four sales was up some 6% year-over-year and organic FX adjusted sales was some plus 4% year-over-year. During the year we had &#x2013; in the quarter we added some SEK 0.6 billion sales from the acquired Telcordia. We also had, as you recall, divested IPX and in Q4 2011 IPX was delivering some SEK 0.4 billion sales, which is then of course comparable &#x2013; makes it a bit difficult to compare quarter-over-quarter from 2011. Organic FX adjusted sales grew some 21% quarter-over-quarter and the operating margin ended at 8% in Q4.</p>
          <p>Then we should take into consideration that the fact that in Q3 we had both a gain from the sale of IPX but also restructuring charges in Q4, which means that quarter-over-quarter we had a decline, but of course if you take that into consideration you will see bit of a different picture.</p>
          <p>2012 full year we have moved from losses in 2011 into profitability. We are growing our top line and we are fully steam ahead executing on our strategy and focusing our business further. And we see a continuous good demand for OSS solutions with our customers and BSS and this drives of course is driven from the fact that there is a need for efficiency and adapt to the <mark type="ph" /> nation range of (17:27) mobile broadband networks and the smartphone revolution that Hans was mentioning earlier on. And on top of that, we also see the Media gets more and more focus from our customers where we see clear growth and momentum.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Per. I will be brief on the regions; we have talked a little bit about them. Just mentioning a couple of them, of course North America very strong year-over-year growth, 51% despite the CDMA decline. I mentioned Western Europe and Central Europe, which had a growth in the fourth quarter with 3%, very much driven by Networks. Another region that could be highlighted is Sub-Saharan Africa that ended on a growth for 12% for the full year and 11% in the quarter, very much on the investment levels on 3G in the region happening. India, that has for several quarters now been down for, main part, Networks I will have to say due to the regulatory environment. It came back to growth in the fourth quarter at 5%. China and Northeast Asia had of course a strong Japan. On the other hand the 2G in China continued to go down as they are transitioning into LTE, which made that region going down both full year and in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Maybe just highlighting the others, where we can see that our IPO and Licensing business grew to SEK 6.6 billion compared to SEK 6.2 billion last year, 2011. Here of course in 2011 had some one-off items as well so we see a continuous good recurrent growth on the Licensing business which was the outline in our strategy We also need to note that here that the IPX was divested in the third quarter and is included here for comparison reasons, meaning that that is part of the decline here.</p>
          <p>Very good. I think that leaves me to handing it over to you Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Hans. So then if you commence on the P&amp;L and balance sheet for me. So gross margin we have the usual drivers of our gross margin, which is business mix, modernization projects in Europe and share of the Services business. We had a gross margin of 31.1% in the quarter; that's an improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. If you look at the comparison with the third quarter, the gross margin has improved thanks to somewhat of an increase in the Software business, also a lower Global Services share and this temporary CDMA capacity business.</p>
          <p>If you look at the other important driver, European modernization projects, we continue to gradually then finalize these projects. They will be with us through 2013. But we continue then to foresee that the negative impact will continue to gradually decline during 2013.</p>
          <p>We also then have a comment in the business mix, saying that we believe, with the current visibility we have, that the business mix will shift towards more of capacity business in the second half of 2013.</p>
          <p>If we take the next slide then, which is then going into operating expense, not a lot to say, some seasonality in the operating expense. Also some impact of the increased restructuring charges, all the numbers is in the report. Organic, excluding acquisition and restructuring charges, a reduction by 3% year-over-year. We also say that with the current portfolio we have and the programs we have in place, we believe that the R&amp;D expenses for 2013 will decrease somewhat.</p>
          <p>On the restructuring charges, as anticipated SEK 1.7 billion, quite a big charge in the quarter. This is excluding joint ventures. We have the ongoing redundancy process in Sweden. We will &#x2013; our belief is that we will be able to conclude the negotiations with the unions by end of the first quarter. But as soon as we have done that, we will communicate that to you, and also the level of charge related to the redundancy program.</p>
          <p>If we then look at taxes, which is also an item in this report worthwhile to highlight, we had a high effective tax rate in the quarter. It's related to the non-tax deductible ST-Ericsson charge. But also since we have deferred tax assets, we get a negative impact short-term of the lower corporate income tax in Sweden. And then, as usual, we do business in many markets that have different income tax levels. So there are three main elements to this.</p>
          <p>If we go to ST-Ericsson Q4, I think the most important thing to focus on here is obviously the impact on the balance sheet of all the transactions that we have made here in December. So what we have done is that we have written down our investments or what used to be then a &#x2013; the loan to ST-Ericsson to reflect the fair market value, it's an impact of SEK 4.7 billion. We have also set aside a provision that is then related to the strategic options that we have at hand; all in all SEK 3.3 billion. And in addition, then, the operating loss for ST-Ericsson valued at IFRS of SEK 500 million. So this means that we have, by the end of December 2012, we do not have any remaining ST-Ericsson investments on our balance sheet, nor the group balance sheet, nor the parent company balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our intent is then to, as we start to execute on these strategic options we have at hand, cost and cash related to these strategic options will be booked against these provisions. So if these provisions will be sufficient to cover these options, our expectation is that the JV line there will be zero when it comes to ST Ericsson during 2013. We also continue to have the view that the modern technology that sits in ST-Ericsson has a strategic value to the wireless industry.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, a good end of the year, you see for yourself days of sales outstanding at 86 days, somewhat of an increase in customer financing, nothing dramatic. Inventory, good work by the organization. Also this quarter &#x2013; I should say, Q3, we started to see some improvements and that also continued in the fourth quarter. All of this leading to a good improvement in the cash position, which you have on the next slide.</p>
          <p>So if we then look at the net cash, that's improved by close to SEK 10 billion in the quarter. That's driven by operating cash flow. It's both the income, but the biggest item is the working capital release. Then you, also you SEK 6.2 billion negative there on investing, SEK 5 billion of those is conversion of the short-term loan to equity, which then impacts the investing cash flow. And earlier we had this loan booked as a short-term investment and that did not impact then the net cash position. But now we have that investment and therefore the net cash position is impacted. Nevertheless, we have a good improvement in net cash of close to SEK 10 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'll hand it back to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jan there. Okay. We will summarize it up starting by talking about the proposed dividend. The Board sat down before releasing the fourth quarter report to review the dividend proposal for the AGM. You will have seen the dividend policy that we have. Looking back at the 2012 year's earnings and cash generation as well as looking into the coming year's business plan and expected economical development, that led to that the Board proposed to the AGM a dividend of 2.75 SEK per share, which is an increase with 10% compared to last year. And that would be in a total, if the AGM would approve it, a 9.1 billion SEK dividend.</p>
          <p>Next slide, talking about the performance. Our performance targets are intact. We have two programs rolling right now, the only difference is the growth rate of sales, which is a little bit different from the first program compared to the second program. These are the targets that the Board has given management. You can say on the growth, we are of course &#x2013; have inferior growth this year but we had 12% last year so we have from 2010 growth and we will of course then continue to focus on growth as in the market.</p>
          <p>Operating income, a very challenging target, here given that the ST-Ericsson impact is quite significant, lead to that we have a decline here and we had a decline also in 2011. I remember here in 2010 we excluded restructuring, so we started from that level, which we are comparing to.</p>
          <p>However, strong cash conversion there. We made a target and that's a yearly target. And that remains, we did not make it last year but we made it this year and if you look at the trajectory the years of low &#x2013; where we have lower growth we have always exceeded the 70% and the year of 2011 where we had high growth in Special Networks, we had a little bit tougher with it. But we are committed to see that we, at least convert 70% to cash.</p>
          <p>Finalizing quickly, we are in a phase of <mark type="ph" /> structured (28:24) execution, seeing that our portfolio is as accurate as possible for our customer, seeing that the leverage or investment that we're having, market share that we have done, R&amp;D as well as investment in our product portfolio with acquisition, et cetera. We will continue to be focused on cost and efficiency as Jan has mentioned and as Johan has mentioned and all will be based on that. We should and will focus very much on being the technology and service leader in this industry and keeping our number one position in the segments we're acting will be important for us. So we will continue with that fight and we think we have a good plan for it.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thank you very much. I had a clarification question. You talk about a mix shift towards capacity but I was wondering if you could expand on that and perhaps talk about whether or not you're talking about an absolute dollar increase in capacity revenues or if it's more &#x2013; if that mix shift is primarily driven by a decline in coverage? The reason I ask that is because there's a headline quoting, I think Jan this morning saying that the move towards capacity may reduce the top line. So I was hoping you could perhaps explain that a bit more? And perhaps give us an &#x2013; explain about your visibility into capacity-spending plans given that historically the order-to-delivery timetable on those has been so short. I'd be interested in how you get your visibility into the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Stuart. I will start. It's Jan here. So to start with, when we talk about the business mix, it's obviously the ratios between coverage and capacity. And you're right there, when it comes to &#x2013; if everything else is equal, the capacity sales may not generate as much top line but high-end margin because of the deliverables in the capacity sales are more software and also other type of Professional Services. When it comes to visibility, the way we look at this is obviously we track the fundamentals in the industry, which you do as well, but we also track of course the installed base of RBS 6000 that we have and with the current visibility we have as well on possible expansion on those and so forth. That's how we make these judgments. Hans, do you want to add anything?</p>

          <p>No, I can only add, because I think that's absolutely right and the other portion is of course after several quarters right now, I would estimate five, sixth quarter where we have had higher or high degree of coverage project, we always will have a shift on that. So it's also a degree that that will go down. And of course on the projects that are long term, those we have good visibility on; but as you rightfully mentioned capacity can be ordered very quickly so there is a different visibility. But we have good visibility on the coverage projects, where we are with them, how far we have come to the penetration. And that should be added to Jan's comments.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good quarter guys. Hans, back to the same kind of question maybe from a different angle here. It certainly seems like the mix would decline given all the coverage modernization you have now. But given you've installed quite a bit of new equipment, what gives you confidence that you're going to need big capacity expansion in the near-term versus just say all the coverage and modernization bleeding off?</p>
          <p>And then, Jan, I mean we're finally returning to revenue levels that we saw probably on 2008 but gross margins still remain several hundred basis points lower. Given all that you've accomplished in restructuring, cost savings, cash conversions, should we expect a rebound to at least those level, if not higher than that, given that you're a lot more efficient today than you were say in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start. I think I will &#x2013; or as you just tweaked the question a little bit from a different angle. I think the answer is pretty much the same. But I think you are right that the coverage projects are twofold. And one is of course the European modernization that we talked a lot about, that is part of this, and of course that portion will go down at least as we see it right now and &#x2013; by that you understand that there will be from a share point of view a higher capacity then. But that is the current visibility we have right now. So of course it can change but right now we have the visibility. And we have talked before that the mix will prevail in the previous quarter. This quarter we say that it will prevail in the first half here and we'll see a gradual shift in the second half here. I think that will &#x2013; so it's not the short-term here. Remember we are saying it's the second half of 2013.</p>
          <p>On the gross margins, I can start. I mean if you go back to 2008, we had a different mix then also. We need to remember that gross margin is of course important for every segment. But as a combination of it, it can both go up and down and still we can do more bottom line. So what we are focusing very much in turn is of course the gross margin on the different units and then seeing that we get the bottom line out of it. Because by nature Services has a lower gross margin because they have a lot less of R&amp;D. And Networks and Support Solution has a higher because they have R&amp;D. So I think the gross margin will be a reflection of our mix as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll try to add. I think a couple of important things that you said there, Hans. The word gradual is obviously very important. The second half is another important word. I also think that to add to Hans there on Services share, that's important. We have been quote radio centric in the Networks mix the last two years. If you look back, as far back as 2007 and 2008, we also had back then a big modernization of the circuit-switched core networks that was ongoing globally whereby layered architecture, or core was introduced. And why we in the report now try to track wins and talk about the packet core wins, talk about the voice over LTE and so forth is because it's very important for us if you look mid to long-term to really get also into what we would call the new core revenues so that we can improve margins not only by means of selling more software into the radio installed base but also get into new core related revenues. That's what I wanted to add, Hans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hans, at a high level, does it feel as if the industry has fundamentally changed? The consolidation is showing a more rational behavior? Are vendors fighting less for footprint? Or does it feel as if a new entrants such as Samsung and others might still imply some of your margin improvements may be temporary in nature? Just how you see the big picture of the industry going forward?</p>
          <p>And on the comfort and the confidence to increase your dividend, that implies better cash flow visibility, some of that due to capacity improvements and better margins this second half. Does it also imply that Ericsson may not only be a dividend payer but also increasingly a &#x2013; can the company be a dividend grower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A good question. On the industry fundamentals, of course we have had this quarter right now &#x2013; we had 2012, I mean if you reflect over 2012 of course it was a tough year. We are not happy with our profitability on the full year for sure, so we have more to do. And then if we look into the industry, there are logical developments that can happen in the industry meaning that it's tougher and tougher, but some sort of calming down when it comes to competition. There are of course less of new modernizations coming up. We had the whole European, which was a one-time sort of event, which we don't have right now, it's much more spread out. So I guess we'll wait &#x2013; I haven't seen any change in the competition during the last couple of years. If I make it out it has been pretty much the same.</p>
          <p>But I think also we can manage that. We have been proving that we can manage it, then we will continue to manage it. And then if it comes to some logic in the market that will be a positive effect for us. But right now we are planning for continuing to be efficient, being good in our pricing, and seeing that we have the best product. And that's going to &#x2013; being possible for us to continue to grow our result, which we have the focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the dividend side, to begin with, if you look at page five in the press release, we &#x2013; first and foremost this dividend level is a proposal to our annual assembly, to start with, from the Board. If you look at page five in the press release, there we repeat the dividend policy and the judgments that the Board looks at when they suggest a dividend. And they look both at the performance and balance sheet structure in this case for 2012. And they also look at the best assessment that we have as leaders and the Board and of the coming year's business plans. So this suggested dividend is a reflection of that. It's not at the same time saying that we are going to have a dividend of XYZ going forward. It's a decision that the Board takes each and every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. But the overall view is that the business is more predictable hence your business is more manageable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's of course a Board resolution and proposal. And I would say that I think it reflects of course that we have a fairly good balance sheet, I think that's important of course, and that we have created cash this year and how we look on going forward. But again it's nothing that we change our dividend policy, that will be the same. And this is what the Board have proposed. And this is one of the few things that we, our management of course, are not deciding on, it's a Board decision. I'm a Board member but I'm one of several Board members. So I guess we need to refer that back to the board as they are doing the proposal.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'd just like you to elaborate a little bit on the nature of LTE upgrades in the European footprint you have modernized with single RAM First, how does the software content of these upgrades to LTE compare to your current mix of software versus hardware in networks?</p>
          <p>And secondly, does such an LTE upgrade in modernized single RAM footprint qualify as capacity? And is a progressive ramp in LTE upgrades in Europe a part of your indication that business mix will improve in H2? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so here is Johan Wibergh. Thank you for that easy question. So when it comes to the things you mentioned about, there will be not only now but for the coming years, a big feature growth in LTE. You mentioned LTE advanced, et cetera. I mean every several years now there will be lot of new things coming out, and we release software twice per year and of course there will be also some in the future that will also require hardware modernization because some of the new features that will come out in coming years will require the operators even to change out some of the hardware. On top of that, the operators will add on more frequencies in coming years, because more spectrum will become available and hence they will also invest in more radio equipment.</p>
          <p>Now there's general software that we sell then twice per year that is sold then as a &#x2013; providing features, and that does not relate to that capacity. On top of that then there is capacity growth depending on the amount of usage that is connected, the amount of the users that are using that network at the same time or logging into that network, so that is on top of it. So thus &#x2013; hence, you will have a combination of coverage and capacity in Europe over the coming years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could, just a couple. You had very good growth in intellectual property revenues during the course of the last year, and I just wondered what you expect going forwards from here? Do you expect continued growth, especially given that you had a one off I think in 2011?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just wondered if you could talk a bit more to OpEx, and given the head count reductions that you're seeing domestically what your expectations are both for R&amp;D but actually also SG&amp;A?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I think there's a few issues around CDMA this quarter, had very good sequential growth, could you just elaborate a bit in terms of the nature of that growth. Was it software driven? How sustainable is it going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start with CDMA, as we said, the CDMA had a temporary catch up on capacity in the fourth quarter. We don't envision that CDMA will come back and start growing again. The customers we have, they are moving quickly to LTE with the consumer base. There will of course &#x2013; remember that we have two pieces of CDMA business, one, which is in Services which is technical support and the maintenance and so on. And that continues because there are going to be subscribers on CDMA. Then we have the piece that is reported in the segment Networks, which are related to the equipment. And here, as we said, we clearly believe that that will continue to go down on CDMA. But we saw a catch up here on CDMA in the fourth quarter. Still it's down compared to last year when the whole CDMA business on equipment started to go down.</p>
          <p>On IPR, yes we saw a growth on IPRs and Licensing to SEK 6.6 billion, as we outlined a new strategy last year and we firmly believe we have a very good portfolio and the whole industry builds on standard technology, and I believe also we are taking a larger share of the whole R&amp;D in the industry. We believe of course that cross-licensing going forward will be important especially as we see more electronics companies coming into telecoms, and whoever else wants to enter in when it comes to infrastructure. So of course, as we outlined in new strategy we believe strongly in our portfolio and we are following the <mark type="ph" /> FRAM rules (45:30) anybody that wants to have an access to our Licensing, they will get it on a fairly reasonable and non-discriminatory level. So we will continue with that and for that, we believe it is a good area of growth for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gareth, I will comment a little bit &#x2013; it's Jan here &#x2013; on the operating expense. So on the R&amp;D side, to begin, today, with what we &#x2013; the mood we are into now is to find continuous improvement and continuous improvements in ways of working and efficiencies. At the same time, of course, we intend to continue to invest around the assets we have, which is global scale, services leadership and technology leadership. But we are in the mood of continuous improvement, continuously trying to find efficiencies and so forth. The statement in the report around R&amp;D <mark type="ph" /> expands (46:35) just for instance, is there to put a cap on this band and tell you that our aim is to decrease it somewhat. But we are in that mood of fine tuning, finding the relevant new competencies, transforming competencies and so forth. That goes both for SG&amp;A as well as for R&amp;D.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh great. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter here. I wanted to dig in, I know people have asked a lot about the gross margins. A pretty nice uptick and, of course, your CDMA was up 58% sequential. I guess people are trying to figure that out. But you gave a number for CDMA mix, I think, a couple of quarters ago, SEK 1.5 billion or so. So I don't know if you can tell us how much your CDMA was as a percentage of total? How impactful it was on the gross margins? And would you expect going into the first half of next year and second half of next year that bump in gross margins to fall off in March and June because of the falloff in CDMA?</p>
          <p>That's it. And then the second question was, just to clear up on ST-Ericsson. Just to be clear, are you essentially done putting money into this ST-Ericsson? And maybe you could talk a little bit about what your exit options are there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on ST-Ericsson and then Jan will come back to CDMA. On ST-Ericsson, as Per said, the only clear decision we have taken, that we are not pursuing to buy out the 50% from ST Microelectronics. That leaves a set of different type of options to shareholders, which, as we have a shareholders agreement it has been mutually agreed what type of options we are going for. That we are discussing right now. The options that we have at hand today, those are of the magnitude that we should be able to cover the provisions we have taking for this year inside that. But that's where we are today and we will come back as soon as we know what strategic options we will take and that we have agreed with other shareholders. But today, not more than that I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it's also, I think, on that topic then the SEK 3.3 billion in provision has also a cash flow element of the same amount, just so we are clear on that. On the CDMA, well I think the main thing to mention there is, of course, that if you look at the full year, we had a decline in revenue of 40%. And we have also in the business been working on the cost structures throughout the year. I'm not going to go into commenting exactly how the gross margin looks for CDMA, but the business fundamentally is coming down and we are adjusting our cost structure as a result of that. The big impact in terms of impact on the income has happened during 2012. That's clear.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you give us a geographic view of how things are going at the moment with your clients if you take your main regions, maybe Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Middle East and Africa? What are operators discussing with you at the moment? And how do you see the market playing out qualitatively in 2013 for your main regions? That would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me get &#x2013; to make an attempt on that. And of course, that will reflect more on what we are talking about today, more than any guidance for 2013. But definitely North America it's a lot of technology shift and many of the operators there are going for LTE and the consumer demand up to the end of the year, which that's the only thing I referred to, was good. So, of course, that means that the investments continued during 2012. But very much focused on technology and the shift to LTE.</p>
          <p>If we then look at Latin America, which was a little bit slower in the second half, there of course a lot of new 4G licenses has been awarded and decision has been made by operators on 4G. So that's a little bit of the feeling on the discussions there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the level of activities has been quite high due to the modernization through the year. So we are working here and discussing modernization, getting in new technologies in many markets. So that's happening from an activity point of view. Very much also focus on efficiency, where our Managed Services portfolio is playing a vital role for many of the operators in the region.</p>
          <p>If you take Africa and Middle East, they have sort of rebounded a little bit, flat to growing from of course lower levels. Here, 3G's still the main driver on mobile broadband, but also a lot of discussion of efficiency and also our Support Solutions portfolio when it comes to BSS in this region. As you might remember the mobile payment is with MTN in Africa et cetera. So here is an area of innovation where we are strong in our OSS/BSS portfolio.</p>
          <p>India, here we have had good discussion and work on the Services. We have both built our competence center but also doing business. Networks as we have discussed, has been lower for that and for reasons that are known.</p>
          <p>We had the technology shift in China that we talked a lot about, meaning that the 2G investments are lower in China right now waiting for the 4G decision, that doesn't mean that we don't have activities. 3G we have high activities on in China, but &#x2013; and we have on the large scale <mark type="ph" /> field trials (53:17) at the same time in China, but that's not offsetting any 2G decline.</p>
          <p>Japan has been through the year a lot about mobile broadband, introduction of new LTE devices.</p>
          <p>Southeast Asia there we have a couple of strong markets that have come back in the second half. Lots about mobile broadband but also efficiency in those markets. And there, there was <mark type="ph" /> SBSS (53:37) portfolio.</p>
          <p>So that reflects a little bit where they are. They're all very much in mobile broadband in many markets, efficiency. And we have our stronghold on our OSS/BSS portfolio that's going to be crucial for sort of transforming the data plans or the mobile broadband charging to much more flexible and agile systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Hans. And maybe a quick follow up on Europe, how do you see the transition from like the modernization efforts into rolling out new technology? Do you think it's something on which you have some visibility in terms of timing? Is that something that is going to come through rapidly after the end of modernization projects? Or might there be a gap between the two?</p>
          <p>And then also in Europe, overall investments have been fairly low, if you look at your Network sales. Do you see places where capacity constraints could become a problem in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question on the modernization, when those projects will be finished, there's a little bit different how much capacity have bought from the beginning between our operators. We cannot generalize what will happen. I mean some has bought more capacity from the beginning; some has bought less. So how that will pan out will be a little bit more driven by the consumer demand and the smartphones coming into the market than anything else. So I think that's important.</p>
          <p>It's important when we talk about investment in Europe that the activity level is high. We've been doing a lot of new technology in the region, but from a CapEx point of view, you are right, it's not that high money. But from activity level, rolling out new technologies, it's quite many of the big European markets that are changing technology, going to multi-radio standard, enabling the technology with 4G. So that is happening even though it's not reflecting in money because, as we remember, the European modernization was sort of a footprint that would be established where the competition was at the highest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking me for the last question. Hans, congratulations on the results and all the team, that's very good, especially on the cash, I'm impressed by the cash conversion rate. On that topic, how do you see next year shaping out? Is it something like the usual seasonality with a low cash conversion in H1 and then improving in H2? Or do you see anything different given the guidance you've given on coverage versus capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's Jan here. We have &#x2013; our statement is the same that we have done several times; you need to look at our cash flow on the full year perspective. So there are some seasonality in the operating cash flow generation, that's clear. However, what we are trying to work as a change program in the company is towards an improved or reduced cycle time in all our projects, and that's called order to cash. That's hopefully then going to start to show improvements in these patterns over several years, right, it's a long-term initiative. But if you just ask about 2013 or 2012 or 2011, we have had some seasonality in the cash flow generation, that's clear.</p>
          <p>I think also, before I hand over to Helena, I think it's worthwhile for me just to say one thing and remind all of you when you are looking at sales estimates and all of those great things, please remember that we have a model when we do our net sales that is called averaging on FX, which means that we basically take the closing rates of each month and you add them all together to get to an average exchange rate, which we then use to value our top line, and that's good because it smoothens out FX movements. Then what is important to remember is that when there is a new year, you reset the clock. And right now if you look at dollars versus Swedish krona, average rate, it's disclosed in the report. I think it's some 673 and the spot rate right now is around 650. So please keep that in mind also when you look at modeling.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I'm allowed a last question, maybe I think you're in litigation with Samsung, and apparently they haven't paid much IP royalties to you for the past 18 months. Is it something which was visible in the margins in the past year basically; the fact they didn't pay?</p>

          <p>I can only say we have not had a cross license for the last 18 months meaning that we have not yet any license payment from Samsung. And again, we of course have had a long discussion and negotiation with them. But we came to the conclusion we cannot come to an agreement on the <mark type="ph" /> FRAM (59:30) terms or the licensing. And that's why we launched that litigation by year-end last year. So now we're going to see how that process continues.</p>
