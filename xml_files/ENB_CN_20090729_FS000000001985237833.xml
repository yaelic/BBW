          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Enbridge Incorporated 2009 Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Vern Yu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome to Enbridge Inc.'s 2009 Q2 earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; Steve Letwin, Executive Vice President, Gas Transportations; and Colin Gruending, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we may refer to forward-looking information during the call. By its nature, this information applies certain assumptions and expectations about future outcomes. So we remind you that it's subject to risks and uncertainties affecting every business including ours. Our slides includes a summary of the more significant factors and risks that may affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fully in our public disclosure filing available on both SEDAR and EDGAR.</p>
          <p>This call is webcast and I encourage anyone listening by phone to view the supporting web slides on our website at www.enbridge.com/investor. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter. Q&amp;A format will be the same as we've done most recently. The initial Q&amp;A is restricted to the analyst community and once we're done with the analyst community, we'll open the call up to the media.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind everyone that Pat Murray and I will be available for follow-up calls after this call.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat Daniel.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much, Vern. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter review. I'm very pleased to report today adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2009 of $195 million, which is $0.54 per common share. This represents a 30% increase over 2008. Year-to-date, we are 19% above the prior year, which situates us very well to meet our 2009 guidance range. In fact, we now believe that we will finish the year in the upper half of that guidance range that we provided back at the beginning of the year. This will represent a more than 20% increase in year-over-year EPS growth rate, the strongest one-year growth rate in Enbridge's history.</p>
          <p>Once again, we're witnessing improved performance from all segments, which further validates our diversified liquids, gas, and green energy asset base approach. Our superior growth this year is led by our Liquids Pipeline assets, which have delivered a 27% year increase over the prior year and we're also pleased to see stronger performance from our Gas Pipeline and Sponsored Investments, as well as Gas Distribution and Energy Services assets.</p>
          <p>Richard Bird, of course, will review the quarterly financial results in more detail shortly. But before he does, I'd like to take just a few moments and update you on our portfolio of growth projects and our anticipated medium-term and long-term earnings per share growth projections.</p>
          <p>If you'll recall, in the first quarter, we brought into service the final phase of the Southern Access Expansion, the Spearhead Pipeline Expansion, The Line 4 Extension, the first phase of the Hardisty Tankage project, and our 190-megawatt Ontario Wind Farm. Now I'd like to underscore that all were placed into service on time or slightly ahead of schedule and were on budget relative to the budgets that we established in 2007.</p>
          <p>Over the next year-and-a-half, we will place into service our two largest commercially secured growth projects, Alberta Clipper and Southern Lights. It was just last week that we announced that Enbridge would be funding not only 100% of the Canadian portion of Alberta Clipper, but that we would also be funding 67% of the U.S. portion of that project. That funding agreement, of course, is the most economical way to ensure that this 450,000 barrel per day mainline expansion proceeds in a way that's beneficial not only to Enbridge and to Enbridge Energy Partners, but also to our shippers, by ensuring that the financing costs for Alberta Clipper are reasonable. Alberta Clipper is still on track to be on service by mid-2010 and is on budget, if not slightly below budget.</p>
          <p>Enbridge Southern Lights line, which will ship 180,000 barrels a day of diluents from Chicago back up to Western Canada, is also on time and on revised budget. In fact, we've already started to see the cash flow impact on the company as a result of placing the LSr line into service during the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>In late 2012, we anticipate bringing into service the first phase of the transportation infrastructure for Kearl Lake, a 140-kilometre pipeline from the Kearl mine site to Enbridge's Cheecham Terminal. From Cheecham, the first phase bitumen from Kearl will then be sent down our existing Waupisoo line to Edmonton. And we're very pleased to have been chosen by Imperial Oil to build and operate this infrastructure and look forward to working with them to develop subsequent phases in concert with their development of the Kearl facilities.</p>
          <p>We were delighted this morning to announce the addition of yet another significant project to our portfolio of commercially secured opportunities, that being the U.S. $500 million Walker Ridge Gathering System, which is an extension of our central Gulf offshore gas pipeline system.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure you're all aware, there have been a number of significant discoveries by major oil and gas companies, such as Chevron in the ultra deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, which are large enough to justify continued development even in the current gas price environment. We're the biggest operator in the space with existing infrastructure, which positions us well to capture these opportunities. The Walker Ridge project is the first of these opportunities to come to fruition for us. It will not only push additional volumes into our existing offshore pipelines, but it will further reinforce our competitive position to capture further ultra deepwater opportunities.</p>
          <p>The Walker Ridge project is also notable in that we've been able to establish a new commercial model for the offshore business, one with comparable risk and return characteristics to our normal model at Enbridge. In particular, we will carry no volume risk on our base return, including with respect to upstream or downstream force majeure events. And we will carry no capital cost risk with respect to third-party materials and services. So on a 60% debt-capital structure, our base return on equity will be roughly 10% with upside to the mid-teens based on volume incentive. Under this structure, we were able to provide acceptable tools for shippers while securing an attractive investment opportunity for Enbridge. And we hope that will establish a precedent for our future and further offshore opportunities.</p>
          <p>In terms of other gas infrastructure opportunities, we announced in the second quarter of this year the completion of a successful non-binding open season on our proposed LaCrosse Pipeline. We believe that we've got a strategic solution that addresses the long-term supply fundamentals for the Eastern portion of the Barnett and Haynesville Shale plays.</p>
          <p>While most other pipeline solutions are focused on moving gas into the Northeast, we believe that the market &#x2013; that that market already has numerous options open to it in close proximity including the emerging Marcellus Shale plays. So to that end, we've chosen to focus on the Southeast market as a better outlet for Haynesville gas. And we're currently working with those shippers that expressed interest during the non-binding open season and hope to have binding contracts in place by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>The last project I'd like to touch base on is a longer-term project, one but &#x2013; though it is longer term, it has the potential to not only create numerous infrastructure opportunities for Enbridge, but also to change the footprint of the energy sector as a whole. We believe that carbon capture and sequestration may be one of the best ways for Canada to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p>As you're likely aware, the Genesee power generation facility, which is a &#x2013; the project associated with that is the joint submission by Enbridge at the Enbridge-led Alberta Saline Aquifer Project and Epcor and has been chosen as one of three consortiums to negotiate with the Alberta government for a portion of the $2 billion Carbon Sequestration Fund.</p>
          <p>The last subject that I'll cover is what all this means for growth in earnings per share. We have just completed our five-year strategic plan update, which confirms an average annual growth rate of 10% plus now through 2013. And we also expect to be able to sustain an average growth rate near 10% for several years beyond that.</p>
          <p>Commercially secured opportunities that will contribute to post 2013 growth include Kearl Phase II, Fort Hills, and the Walker Ridge opportunities. Numerous other opportunities on liquids, gas, and renewables are also under development. So despite a continuing tough global economic climate, Enbridge remains very well positioned to deliver superior value to our shareholders through our focus on sustained and visible growth, a low-risk business model, and steady distributions of income.</p>
          <p>So at this point, I'll pass it off to Richard Bird to review the quarterly financial results in more detail and then we'll be back later for Q&amp;A. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Pat and good morning, everyone. As Pat mentioned, we released our second quarter results earlier this morning. Year-to-date reported net income was $951 million or $2.62 per share, a slight increase from the 2008 earnings of 909 million or $2.53 per share. 2008, of course, included a large one-time gain on the sale of our investments in CLH. The 2009 results include the gain on the sale of our OCENSA investment, plus large mark-to-market gains on derivative instruments used to lock in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange, as well as improved operating performance throughout the company.</p>
          <p>Excluding one-time and non-operating factors, our adjusted earnings for the first half and second quarter increased by 19% and 30% respectively, which places us ahead of what we had expected at this point of the year. As a result of the strong first half and anticipated performance of the assets for the rest of the year, we are now guiding to the upper half of our guidance range.</p>
          <p>Once again, we're pleased to report that adjusted earnings increased in each of our segments. Liquids Pipelines adjusted earnings rose $42 million to 194 million for the first six months of 2009 and increased from 76 million to 97 million in the second quarter, that being a 28% increase.</p>
          <p>Most of the increase was due to recognition of allowance for equity funds used during construction from Alberta Clipper and from the Southern Lights Project. In addition, Southern Lights earnings do include contributions from the light sour line component of that project, which was placed into service in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Second quarter Athabasca segment earnings reflect the full year's contribution from the Waupisoo Pipeline, which was placed into service in the second quarter of last year. These positive impacts were partially offset on a year-to-date basis by higher operating costs in the first quarter within the Enbridge system, including pipeline integrity spend and increased business development costs. During the second quarter, these costs were back in line with the prior year.</p>
          <p>Gas Pipelines results are higher than 2008 both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. A stronger U.S. dollar, which we hedged late last year, boosted the earnings from assets within this segment. We also received a $3.8 million payment in the second quarter for business interruption insurance related to the impact that Hurricane Ike had on our offshore assets in 2008. These proceeds relate to lost revenues and operating costs and as such, we did not adjust this insurance payment from our quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Sponsored Investments also had a very strong quarter. Enbridge Energy Partners nearly doubled its contribution in the second quarter when compared to the prior year, as adjusted earnings increased $12 million in the quarter and $19 million year-to-date. The strong performance was primarily due to our increased ownership of EEP as a result of the $500 million U.S. capital injection made in the fourth quarter of 2008. That was further compounded by a stronger U.S. dollar and higher general partner incentive income.</p>
          <p>Results within EEP were &#x2013; itself were actually fairly consistent year-over-year, with increased earnings within the liquids side offset by lower results within the natural gas segment. Enbridge Income Fund's contribution continued to increase, as a result of the two distribution increases announced by the fund in 2008 and the corresponding increase in our equity pickup and our incentive from that vehicle.</p>
          <p>Moving to Gas Distribution and Services, adjusted earnings increased seven million in the quarter and 16 million year-to-date. Both periods experienced stronger performance from our Energy Services business, which was able to realize higher margins and volumes from a contango oil market and low-risk transportation arbitrage opportunities.</p>
          <p>These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings within Enbridge Gas Distribution as a result of a change in our customer billing practice, for a larger portion of the customers' bill will be a fixed component and a lesser amount will be variable. This is simply a redistribution of earnings from the colder winter months to the warmer summer months and will have no impact on full-year earnings; in other words, we will catch up the shortfall in the first half in the second half.</p>
          <p>In fact, with further cost savings under our incentive regulation program, we expect full-year earnings in 2009 for Gas Distribution to exceed 2008 earnings and to exceed the 100 basis points of ROE premium, above the benchmark regulated rates that we had established with a target for this year.</p>
          <p>And finally, corporate costs are significantly lower than the prior year, as a result of large interest savings, some favorable foreign exchange realized gains, and to a lesser extent the timing of operating costs. We do expect that the corporate segment will return to a more normal run rate of 10 to $20 million of cost in the last two months &#x2013; last two quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>So that's a review of the earnings drivers. I'll now just spend a moment updating our financing outlook. We did lay out our updated five-year capital expenditure forecast and our improved operating cash flows on the recent conference call for the Alberta Clipper joint funding agreement. So I won't repeat those details on this call.</p>
          <p>Just overlaying the Walker Ridge investment on that picture and referring in particular here to slide 13, Walker Ridge will add about $0.5 billion to our capital expenditure plans, that's in U.S. dollars; about $600 million in Canadian dollars. It will soak up about $100 million of our equity surplus, leaving us with about 1.4 billion of available equity capacity. So we are very strong financially with ample capacity to accommodate the additional opportunities, which we have under development, which Pat referenced earlier.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll turn it back to Pat for his concluding comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Richard. So to just very quickly summarize, firstly, this has been the best six months our company has ever had from an adjusted EPS view, and we've got a very strong visibility to our more than 20% increase in EPS this year, we're very confident of that.</p>
          <p>We're also very confident that we can push our 10% plus growth guidance to 2013 and that we can continue to grow the company at about 10% for the foreseeable future and beyond 2013. Our current expansions are on time, they are on budget and we placed a large number of assets into service in the first half of the year, that are already generating additional earnings and cash flow.</p>
          <p>And finally, we're well financed, we've got large surplus of equity that we will utilize to fund additional organic and/or acquisition opportunities as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So I think on that note, we can now move forward to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now conduct a Q&amp;A session in two parts. First, we will take questions from analysts followed by the media. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We respectfully request in the interest of time that you limit your question to one and return to the queue for a follow-up question. Questions will be taken as time permits. And your first question comes from the line of Linda Ezergailis with TD Newcrest. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on the Walker Ridge Gathering System timing. What sort of approvals are still required, either by Boards or regulators or etcetera? And what sort of steps must be taken or what events is it dependent on to firm up the agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Linda, I'll ask Steve Letwin to respond to those questions. Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning, Linda. We have Letters of Intent signed with Chevron and all the partners involved in the venture. Our expectation would be that we'll move rather quickly now to finish off the agreements and hope to hand this over to our major construction project group, which is headed up by Al Monaco. So we'll have completion of this particular base by 2014. So everything is lined up very well, as you might expect with a company like Chevron, all the Ts and Is pretty well have to be dotted and crossed before we get in press release and we've done a lot of work to make that happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, it would be in service by 2014 fully or in phases or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, when would construction start for a 2014 in-service service date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about a two to three-year process. So we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get things rolling in a major way in 2010-2011.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets (sic) [RBC Dominion Securities] . You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Just in terms of the corporate, can you break down what some of the variance is on the FX gains versus the interest and other costs? And also maybe can you frame that against the Q1 '09 corporate cost that will make for the 11.5 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Corporate costs, Colin, do you -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Robert. As Richard mentioned, I think you've laid them out in the variances &#x2013; the favorable variances, probably into the May quarter and largely interest savings on the short-term debt and a little bit higher mix of short-term floating debt. So both the other smaller parts and there is a whole variety of them here, but we just mentioned a couple. Our FX is between 3 and $4 million in the quarter and O&amp;A is a little bit smaller than that. So we expect to come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Colin, it's roughly a $20 million kind of quarter-over-quarter variance and then a little bit more if you're talking about &#x2013; or about the same if you're talking about doing that 10 to 20 cost going into the back half of the year. So kind of what happened in Q2? Was there closing out of hedge positions, kind of more one-time gains in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've broken out all of the one-time stuff, but go ahead Bird.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Fairbanks with Bank of America &#x2013; Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to ask with the success with Chevron and Walker Ridge, if you see other pipeline opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and I guess in addition to gas, I'm thinking do you know that there'll be any opportunities to acquire some oil export infrastructure in Gulf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, absolutely. And as I mentioned in my remarks, not only is this a very good stand-alone project, but it will extend our infrastructure out into the ultra deep part of the Gulf and put us in a very good position to serve some of the other new discoveries and also some of the oil opportunities. So this definitely increases our influence and we are working in other parts of the Gulf with the three main corridors that we provide service to to tie in both oil and gas.</p>
          <p>So things have really started to pick up in the Gulf and I think you'll recall that we anticipated that realizing that after the major hurricanes of a few years ago, it took a while to get facilities back robust and ready to go before capital was redirected to new exploration and development. And we're now starting to see the benefits of that. So yeah, we do think this really does improve our positioning and there are a number of other opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And I guess even longer term as you build up your expertise of all the technical issues around deep-water oil and gas transport, could you see exporting that ability to other basins around the world? I mean you have the confidence of &#x2013; say like the Chevron and BP in the Gulf, Shell &#x2013; do you see longer-term opportunities where you might move international again and should opportunities arise, provide deep-water infrastructure off West Africa, or Brazil or elsewhere?</p>

          <p>Yeah, we do. And Andrew, now, we've always said that with international for Enbridge, we take a little bit different approach. We look for good investment opportunities. And if they happen to be international or comfortable with the risk profile associated with the country and the business model, then we're prepared to be there. And we mentioned out when we exited both Spain and Colombia that, that didn't necessarily mean that we are exiting international. We never were out to just build an international presence, we were simply out to gain good investment opportunities for Enbridge. So to be able to use that expertise around the world if we found the right risk profile and the right business model, absolutely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody. And congratulations on the &#x2013; as far as the goal of kind of getting the new business model there, that's great. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe the one just on the LaCrosse Pipeline, we touched on potentially having &#x2013; or the hope of having some binding commitments possibly by the end of the year. I know there are a lot of proposals out there from the Haynesville certainly enterprises looking around as well. Do we see any consolidation or possible joint ventures or is the hope that we've got enough indications of interest that this could still be sort of an Enbridge stand-alone project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly, on many occasions over the years have joint ventured and if the right opportunity presented itself, Carl, we would do that. We do happen to think that this proposal with the interconnects proposed in the market that it's intended to serve is going to be very well received, it was in the non-binding round of open season. I will note though that in this day and age of very low natural gas prices, it's a challenging time for producers to make long-term commitments to pipelines and that will probably be the biggest challenge that we faced over the next few months, but maybe let me ask Steve Letwin, if he's got anything to add to that in light of his positioning on Haynesville and the potential for joint ventures, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And Pat summed it up very well, Carl, and as you know, our linking of the Sonat system gives us a very good advantage, our competition stops well short of being able to feed that part of the market. We are getting a lot of calls about joint-venture opportunities and a lot of people interested in the solution we've put forward. Pat's very right in saying that our major challenge is getting some of the commitments given the environment right now. But we remain very bullish on &#x2013; we have a very strong team working on this, the commercial interest is extremely strong. So we're going to keep plugging away on it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. And just as a general comment, congratulations. But I'd also like to get the explanation on the corporate breakdown if you can comment later, Vern. Speaking of the deep-water stuff, I was interested in, you've had difficulty offshore in terms of hitting the returns you had expected. You were trying to change the business model. It sounds like you are being successful on that. I noticed that despite you going to ultra-high depth in water that you think that there is no additional risk. So I'm wondering if there is &#x2013; if you passed on some of the risk and hurricane risk and maybe some of the construction risk off to the producers or how do you handle that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we have mentioned along the way, Bob, that we felt we needed to change the risk profile of our Gulf of Mexico investments to be more in line with the average Enbridge investments and as I indicated in my remarks, that we feel we've done that. We've been able to establish a level of return with ship or pay commitments that is adequate to Enbridge and hence don't carry just the reserves dedication concept we now have ship or pay commitments to provide a certain level of return. And we've also been able to secure a project where we don't carry the capital cost risk and feel that that's going to put us in a much better position going forward. So we're quite comfortable with this model and it works very well for our producers as well to all of which we're able to bring forward for them. So I think it's a win-win all-around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd like to add to that, Pat. Bob, one of the biggest issues we've had with the hurricanes, as you know, is our proximity to short and with the surges that come with the hurricanes, 90% of the damage that's done and it's done close to shore, this being...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...so far out and one of the natural pluses of risk management is the fact that we will not see the surges out of that part of the Gulf and we expect that even though we have a very significant protection that Pat's talking about, we also expect a natural protection where we're a lot further out from the shore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, great. And while I realize it's early to talk about this, accounting rules now are focusing in on asset retirements and how you account for that. So I'm just kind of wondering who takes the risk on that, would it be the oil producers or what?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I wanted to chat a little bit about the insurance policy decisions on offshore and just get your thoughts on &#x2013; or perhaps a little bit more detail on the cost benefit that went into that decision. What is the potential magnitude of the savings there? And what is the potential, I guess, downside in terms of cash flow and earnings that if there is a significant hurricane in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let &#x2013; I'm going to ask Vern Yu to respond to that to Matthew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, the insurance market this year saw &#x2013; was pricing in hurricane insurance that was extremely expensive. The first thing is that the insurers are no longer &#x2013; for this year were not willing to offer business interruption or contingent business interruption insurance. And the deductibles required for property, plant, and equipment insurance were very, very significant. So when we did our cost benefit analysis, we needed to see physical damage well in excess of the physical damage that we've seen from last two sets of hurricanes for us to actually get any dollars from the insurance. So based on that analysis, we decided that self-insurance was more economically beneficial to us than trying to purchase any insurance from the funding market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you guys have or the &#x2013; I don't know if you disclosed a total sort of cash cost that you would have borne from the last &#x2013; from Katrina, both in terms of PP&amp;E damage and forgone or lost earnings?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Matthew, for Ike, we suffered about $32 million of property, plant, and equipment and about $7 million of business interruption and contingent business interruption. So total damage in the order of about almost $40 million. And with that insurance policy, we had a reasonable deductible, the deductible that you see today if we had purchased insurance would have been several orders of magnitude higher.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, we are doing that, Matthew, that's an excellent question. We've had some success in getting surcharges on those pipes to reflect the risk that we've incurred around the hurricanes. And we continue to do that negotiation and move that forward. So that's exactly what we're doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. You've got a pretty full slate of projects over the next couple of years, but when you look around your peer group and really your relative cost of capital advantage, when you start thinking beyond 2012, where will the bias of growth come from? Will it be from greenfield developments or will you really start to think a lot more about acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's fair to say, Andrew, that this company has always put a very strong emphasis on lower-risk organic growth versus acquisition growth, and that would continue to be the emphasis going forward. We've got such strong asset positioning, whether it's on the crude oil side in that corridor from Fort McMurray down to Edmonton, or in the mainline system or with alternatives like gateway to the West Coast or moving synthetic crude to the East Coast, we expect to continue to be able to grow organically that business.</p>
          <p>And we've now established a very strong competitive position in the Gulf of Mexico. Hence, we think we'll be able to continue to grow there. We're one of the biggest players in the shale plays in the U.S. So we're really exposed to all of the major energy developments in the oil and gas business in North America and hence, we see the organic growth continuing to be very good. That doesn't mean to say that we won't decide to supplement that out in the later years of the plan depending on how the portfolio looks, supplement it with some acquisitions along the way that provide us with incremental growth and very good further strengthening of our map. But I think it's fair to say that we will continue to be largely an organic growth driven company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Pat, just on the point of your platforms, you mentioned in your initial comments there you sort of divide your platforms into three groups, liquids, gas and then green energy. You really don't have a tremendous number of assets in that green energy or renewable platform at this stage in time. So what will be your focus within building out that platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, you're right. It is definitely the skinny third leg on the stool at this point in time. But it's one that is going through very rapid growth in North America and where we're seeing adequate returns in the investment opportunities that we're looking at. So in addition to continuing to grow our wind power business and as you know, we operate four wind power &#x2013; wind farms; we'll continue to look at wind opportunities. We also are considering some solar energy development opportunities and of course, this big CO2 sequestration opportunity that we've got, actually one in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan. So those will probably be the main areas of growth and each one of them looks quite promising in terms of the overall requirements in North America over the next while, Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steven, it's a little hard to say at this point because we're in &#x2013; it's such an early stage of development and as you know, we are currently working with provincial government to secure funding on the project, but we have generally worked under the assumption that we would be able to realize returns on the pipeline and the sequestration segments of the project, which would be our main areas of expertise, earn returns that are comparable to those that we earn in our pipeline business and that's our target going in and with comparable capital structure, but it's too early to say that with &#x2013; definitively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just you used to call it Wave Two, Pat, and we're all fishing for how things look post 2013 now. I'm just wondering if you could put into some kind of generalities, oil price sensitivity is huge and it comes to the oil sands and I don't know how many billions are deferred, delayed right now, 100 billion, 150 billion. At different prices, of course, that'll unleash, unlock subject to politics of having an orderly expansion of them. Do you have a view of what that sensitivity may be in qualitative terms, like if we were at $60, it's x, $80 is y, $100 is z in some fashion? And you would obviously want to chase those down first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the latter part of it, yes. We still &#x2013; the obviously huge competitive advantage we've got because of our positioning in the oil sands business. So those are projects that we chase down first. I can't tell you that if crude oil is at $50, it will generate x amount of business for Enbridge or $60 or $70, Sam. I think it's fair to say that even in the rather rocky environment that we've come through over the last year, we've been able to go out and secure the Kearl Lake business. We continued to work with Suncor, Petro-Can with regard to Fort Hills, we see opportunities like Husky's Sunrise where our positioning should be very good.</p>
          <p>But all of those projects are dependent on the producers' timing and when they go ahead. It's not only a matter of crude oil pricing, but it's a matter of labor availability, productivity and cost. As you know, that was as much the issue with regard to the slowdown in oil sands project as it was crude oil pricing. So I think it's fair to say that we will see a slower development in the oil sands that we'd anticipated back a couple of years ago or even as recently as a year ago. But we are absolutely convinced that it will be developed if that resource is badly needed for security supply reasons. And we're very well positioned to participate when it does get developed.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Pat. And kind of a much narrower question, I guess, Rich, maybe you can help, maybe not. Energy Services, your qualitative observations were on why you had a positive year-over-year improvement where increased volumes, you also mentioned margins, some you had I guess fixed, some you hadn't, you provide a little bit of color there between those buckets or components if any?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that at my fingertips and that's probably getting a little further granularity in that segment than we would want to do, I think, Sam. The first half has been great, we had the benefit of strong contango, we also had some very good transportation arbitrage plays going on and as we do pretty well all of our commercial opportunities in that business. Those were largely hedged in so that there was very little risk associated with them, but I think beyond that color, that's about as much as we've got for now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point, to answer the latter part of that, first, Robert, we don't anticipate any further significant asset sales. We're very happy with the portfolio that we've got. And as you know, in the case of the two assets &#x2013; the two major assets that we sold, we were very, very pleased with the performance and it was the case of redeploying that capital into higher-return, lower-risk projects here. And that's why we went that route.</p>
          <p>So in &#x2013; sitting in the equity surplus position that we've got, we don't anticipate any significant dispositions. Realize that we have now as we have indicated that we would, we've really moved into the sweet spot in terms of a very significant growth in free cash flow in the company over the next several years as a result of projects that are coming on stream. So we're able to very adequately fund the requirements of the company through that 2013 timeframe. And in fact as Richard was indicating, even post Walker Ridge, we've got about a 1.4 billion equity surplus over that period of time.</p>
          <p>So we'll look for good and further investment opportunities, we're already growing the company at a remarkable rate when you look at 10% plus rate of growth in this business and the low-risk nature of that. We look for further opportunities with a similar signature but it's not a bad time to be sitting on an equity surplus, I guess. Is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I guess just a question on &#x2013; and more so as you kind of fill out with new projects and start to chew through the equity surplus, would you be hesitant to take on additional projects that you could not finance out of cash flow and off of the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not if they were good, high-return projects, we wouldn't, no. And it &#x2013; you referred to chewing through the surplus, realize the surplus is going to be building faster than chewable to a certain extent when you go to 10% plus growth rate and you still are building an equity surplus, that puts us in a very strong position, but if we find good return projects, we certainly have the capability and the capacity within the company to take them on.</p>

          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, Pat.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Pierre Lacroix with Desjardins. You may proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Just coming back on the equity surplus, would you change your view or your strategy with regard to shareholders' initiative with a share buyback or your strategy with the dividend increase year-over-year given the excellent equity position you have now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say that we will stick with the previously stated policies and our intent generally would be to grow dividends commensurate with EPS growth and that is part of the plan that Richard referred to earlier on. And at this point, we don't anticipate any share buyback. As you know, we're able to generate a lot of excellent growth opportunities on this asset base that we've got and we're not in a position where we would anticipate share buyback.</p>

          <p>And next, we will be taking media questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And again we do respectfully request in the interest of time that you limit your question to one and return to the queue for a follow-up question. And your questions will be taken as time permits. And you do have a follow-up question from the line of Steven Paget with First Energy. You may proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. And just a question on solar. It's &#x2013; you're one of several management teams to comment on the great solar opportunity and I'm just wondering what that might look like? Is it in solar technology? Is it &#x2013; could it come from the feed-in tariff that's working its way through the process in Ontario or somewhere perhaps in the U.S. where there is lots of fund and lots of air conditioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably of the three alternatives, the one that you mentioned in the middle fits best for Enbridge. We're not into the solar technology development, we are into owning and operating asset. So to own and operate a solar power farm would fit very well for us and if it is near existing operations, i.e. the Ontario franchise, that would probably fit the model best for us, Steven. So, we're looking at a number of opportunities and most likely to be an operator and hopefully in close proximity to existing operations that we've got.</p>
