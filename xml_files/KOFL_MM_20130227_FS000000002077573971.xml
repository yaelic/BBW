        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us as always. Building on a strong third quarter and in line with our expectations for the second half of 2012, our operators delivered solid double-digit top and bottom line growth and margin expansion in both divisions for the fourth quarter, compensating for a fast start to the year and producing full year EBITDA margin expansion.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter of 2012, we continue to integrate the results of Grupo CIMSA and FOQUE in our Mexican operations, as Grupo Tampico's results are now fully comparable. Their performance contributed positively to our Mexico &amp; Central America division and our consolidated results.</p>
          <p>Organically, the main drivers of our performance for the year were our operators' ability to leverage our new commercial model, execute at the point-of-sale and implement selective price increases to capture our industry's value potential as well as the strength of our multi-category beverage portfolio enhanced by the continued popularity of brand Coca-Cola and innovation in our still beverage and water categories.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our reported consolidated revenues were close to MXN 40 billion, up 10% from last year, despite negative translation effects resulting from the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso in combination with a stronger Mexican peso. Organically, excluding the non-comparable effect of Grupo CIMSA and FOQUE in Mexico, our consolidated total revenues grew 6% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On a currency neutral basis and excluding the non-comparable effect of the new franchises in Mexico, total revenues grew 14%, driven by top line growth in every country of our balanced portfolio. This currency neutral revenue growth was driven by volume growth in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and Central America and average price per unit case growth in almost every operation.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated sales volume grew 11%. Organically, excluding the non-comparable effects of the new franchises in Mexico, our volumes grew 4%. On the same basis, our sparkling beverage portfolio grew 3%, driven by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola highlighted by 17% growth in Venezuela and 4% growth in Mexico and Colombia.</p>
          <p>As in previous quarters, our innovative orangeade categories contribute considerably to the 14% volume growth of the still beverage category, complemented by Powerade and the recent roll-out of Fuze Tea. Specifically in Mexico, Valle Frut generated 12% growth while Powerade grew 31% and Fuze Tea continued to grow significantly over the previous brand of tea.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, the Valle Fresh orangeade grew 150% and contributes more than half of the incremental total volume of that country.</p>
          <p>In addition, our single-serve water portfolio grew 22%, reflecting volume growth in every country. This increase was supported mainly by the performance of Brisa in Colombia, the launch of Bonaqua in Argentina and the incremental volume growth of Ciel in Mexico and Crystal in Brazil, as these increases compensated for our volume decline in our bottled water portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, lower PET prices and sugar cost in most of our territories more than compensated for the average depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material costs. Consequently, our consolidated gross margin expanded 160 basis points to 47.2%</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating income grew 30% to MXN 7.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Organically, our operating income grew 26%. We continue to experience higher labor costs in Venezuela and Brazil, combined with the increased labor and freight costs in Argentina.</p>
          <p>In Mexico and Colombia, we continue to invest in the marketplace as in previous quarters. We continue to register expenses related to the development of information systems and commercial capabilities in connection with the implementation of our commercial models and the development of new lines of business and categories.</p>
          <p>Our operating income margin expanded 260 basis points. And more importantly, our organic operating income margin expanded 290 basis points. For the quarter, our consolidated net controlling interest income grew 35%, reaching MXN 4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, I will elaborate on the performance of each division. In the fourth quarter, our Mexico &amp; Central America division reported volume growth of 16%, reaching 476 million unit cases. As reported, our Mexican franchises volume grew 17%, including the non-comparable effect of 51 million unit cases from Grupo CIMSA and FOQUE. Organically, our volume in Mexico grew 4%, successfully building on a 4% organic volume growth during the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our increased volume was led by 4% growth of brand Coca-Cola, in which our 500 milliliter returnable glass presentation grew more than 50%, contributing significantly to an improvement in returnable single-serve consumption.</p>
          <p>Our flavored sparkling beverage category continued to yield positive results, growing 2%, once again led by the Sidral Mundet brand and the rest of our core flavored sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>The still beverage category grew 11%, mainly driven by the 12% growth of Valle Frut orangeade which is now our third largest brand in Mexico, selling close to 50 million unit cases a year in all of our territories across the country.</p>
          <p>In addition, Powerade grew 31% and Fuze Tea continued to deliver incremental volume growth, growing 20% over the previous brand, thanks to consumer preference and the portfolio of 15 different presentations in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Our water portfolio, excluding bulk water, grew 6%. This increase is compensated for a 4% volume decline in our bulk water portfolio as we continued to work to increase the profitability and efficiency of our jug water business.</p>
          <p>In Central America, our volume grew 5%, building on a 6% growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was driven mainly by 4% growth in our sparkling beverage category, led by a 3% improvement in Coca-Cola &#x2013; in brand Coca-Cola and a 5% increase in flavored sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>The still beverage category grew 14%, supported by the inclusion of the Del Prado in our portfolio and the continued success of Fuze Tea and Powerade which grew 60% and 23%, respectively.  Our water portfolio grew 15%.</p>
          <p>Our division's reported total revenues grew 19%, reaching MXN 17 billion. Organically, the division's total revenues grew 7%. On the same basis, our average price per unit case increased 4% during the quarter. Selective price increases implemented in our territories over the past several months more than offset a negative translation effect resulting from a stronger Mexican peso.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, our profitability benefited from lower sweetener and PET prices, coupled with the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the Mexican peso. As a result, our reported gross margin gained 360 basis points to 49.1%, while our organic gross margin expanded 390 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our operating income increased 33% to MXN 3.2 billion. During the quarter, we continued to book certain restructuring charges related to the integration of the new franchises in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Organically, our operating expenses increased as a result of continued investments in the marketplace to reinforce our point-of-sale execution and, as in previous quarter, investment related to the development of information system and commercial capabilities to support our commercial models and investments related to the development of new lines of business and categories. Nevertheless, our reported operating margin expanded 200 basis points and our organic operating margin expanded 260 basis points.</p>
          <p>In our Mexico &amp; Central American division, our operators delivered strong results to close the year. In the final two quarters, the division may off for a soft start of the year despite the expenses related to the integration of our new franchises in Mexico. Our benchmark commercial model, which we have already rolled out in our new territories, our passion for market execution and innovation, and our talented team of operators were the key drivers of these results.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we take a positive view of 2013. Our operators' ability to selectively increase prices across our portfolio should allow us to grow our average price per unit case in line with inflation. Our portfolio initiatives, particularly our focus on returnability and single-serve consumption, as simplified by the recent launch of Sidral Mundet in a 2.5 liter returnable presentations and the extended coverage of the 500 milliliter returnable glass water for brand Coca-Cola, will certainly contribute to our volume growth.</p>
          <p>We anticipate a benign sweetener prices scenario going into the year. Through our participation in PIASA and contracts with suppliers, we have locked in most of our sweetener consumption mix for the year.</p>
          <p>PET prices are expected to remain flat during the year. Furthermore, the synergies from our mergers in Mexico will start contributing to increased profitability. All together, these factors should allow our Mexico &amp; Central America division to generate margin expansion in 2013.</p>
          <p>As for the recently announced merger agreement with Grupo Yoli, we are making progress on the confirmatory due diligence process and we are confident that we will close the transaction during the second quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about our South America division. Our South American division's total sales volume grew 4%, reaching 334 million unit cases in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by volume growth in Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil, which compensated for a 2% volume decline in Argentina.</p>
          <p>In our Colombian franchise territories, volume was up 10%, building on a 3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. Sparkling beverages grew 8% as a result of a 20% increase in flavored sparkling beverages and 4% growth in brand Coca-Cola.</p>
          <p>The positive performance of our flavored sparkling beverage portfolio resulted from the successful launch of Fanta in three different flavors and a variety of presentations during the third quarter and the performance of Quatro which grew 42% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to brand Coca-Cola, our two-fold strategy to reinforce single-serve consumption and to increase affordable returnable presentations yield positive results, with our entry-level 250 milliliter one-way presentation selling almost 4 times more than last year and our 1.25 liter returnable glass package is growing 22%.</p>
          <p>Our Brisa water brand drove a 20% increase in its category, including bulk water. Together, del Valle Fresh orangeade which grew 9% and Fuze Tea which grew 37% over the previous tea brand drove 11% growth in the still beverages category.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, we delivered 7% volume growth in the quarter. Brand Coca-Cola delivered very positive results, growing 17% supported by the recent launch of a 355 milliliter and 1 liter package and consumers' preference for this brand. This increase compensated for a decline in flavored sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>Driven by innovation, our still beverage category accounted for a significant part of this operations' incremental volume growth. The success of our del Valle Fresh orangeade among consumers led the brand to grow 150%. Fuze Tea also contributed to this category, growing 12% on top of the previous brand. Our water category grew 28% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The initial roll-out of our value-driven commercial model in Venezuela had yielded very encouraging results. By reinforcing our marketplace execution and especially our cooler coverage through the placement of 20,000 additional new coolers during 2012, we have driven significant top line growth from our clients.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, our volume grew 2% as compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. Our sparkling beverage category grew 2%. This increase was supported by 12% growth in Fanta, a 27% increased in Schweppes and incremental growth of Kuat, all of which enabled our local operations to achieve leadership of the flavored sparkling beverage categories.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we recorded a 2% growth in brand Coca-Cola. Our water portfolio volume grew 12%, driven by the Crystal brand. In still beverage categories, our volume grew 4% driven by the Jugos del Valle line of business.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, on top of 10% volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, we experienced a very tough weather conditions for most of the quarter. Consequently, our volumes in this country declined 2%. During the quarter, we launched the Bonaqua water brand with very good results, reaching almost 1 million unit cases in less than two months.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our South America division reported total revenues grew 5% to MXN 22.7 million. This increase resulted from revenue growth in area operation despite a negative translation effect resulting from the devaluation of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso.</p>
          <p>On a currency neutral basis, our division's total revenues grew 18%, mainly supported by selective price increases implemented over the past several months across our franchise territories.</p>
          <p>Lower sugar and PET cost across the division more than offset the average devaluation of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material cost. This resulted in a 20 basis point expansion of our gross margin, reaching 45.8% for the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Before discussing our division's operating income, I would like to remind you that during the fourth quarter of 2011, we registered a write-off of certain number of the assets including production equipment, coolers, forklifts and returnable bottles and cases. At the time, our results were reported under Mexican Financial Reporting Standards and this write-off was booked below operating income in the other expenses net line. As a result of our migration to International Financial Reporting Standards, this write-off of operating items is registered above operating income as part of the other operating expenses net line.</p>
          <p>Our South American division's operating income grew 27%, reaching MXN 4 billion. Operating expenses were affected by higher labor cost in Venezuela and Brazil and the higher labor and freight cost in Argentina. Our South American division's operating margin expanded 310 basis points, reaching 17.8%.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on single-serve consumption and affordability through returnable presentations to foster our sparkling beverage growth. Innovation has proven to be a very valuable tool to drive growth in the still beverage category and will continue to yield positive results, building on Jugos del Valle platform.</p>
          <p>As we face 2013, we are confident that our operators will continue to take advantage of our value-driven commercial model to capture pricing opportunities and a richer volume mix. The implementation of this model has allowed us to identify opportunities to increase per capita consumption of our beverage in each franchise territory, and our seasoned operators have already laid the groundwork with which to capture these opportunities.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we are refining our brand price package segmentation per channel. In Colombia, we continue to work on our portfolio to offer to our consumers affordable presentations. In Argentina, we are launching a strong competitive water brand and expanding single-serve presentations for our sparkling beverages. And in Venezuela, we have introduced affordable presentations for sparkling beverages and expect continuous success from our still beverage platform.</p>
          <p>For the year, we think the national sugar price is remaining flat. Our Brazilian and Colombian operations have hedged the majority of their sugar consumption needs for the year. Additionally, PET prices will also remain stable for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>As many of you may know, on February 13 of this year, the Venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the Bolivar. The exchange rate moved from VEF 4.30 per $1 to VEF 6.30 per $1. This devaluation would have an effect on our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material and our results for this operations when translated into Mexican pesos for consolidation purposes. However, we will continue to adapt our operations to the dynamics of the market in order to achieve our planned results in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>In every country of our geographically balanced portfolio, we continue to concentrate on our value-driven commercial model and the focus that our operators place on point-of-sale execution, fostering single-serve consumption, extending the coverage of affordable returnable packages and betting an innovation.</p>
          <p>With regard to our Philippines operation, we recently announced the successful closing of the transaction with our partner, The Coca-Cola Company, at the end of January. Our company is confident that the skills and capabilities that we shall develop in Latin America will allow us to capture top line opportunities and achieve important efficiencies over a mid to long-term horizon.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, our board of directors agreed to propose a dividend of MXN 5,950 million to our shareholder. This proposed amount represents a dividend of approximately MXN 2.90 per share and will be paid in two installments during May and November of this year.</p>
          <p>This proposed amount represents a dividend per share of approximately MXN 1.45 for the first installment computed in the basis of 2,030 million shares and a dividend per share of approximately MXN 1.45 for the second installment computed on the basis of 2,073 million shares, which include the 42.4 million shares to be issued to the shareholders of Grupo Yoli assuming the merger is approved by the authorities.</p>
          <p>Thank you, as always, for your continued trust and support. And now, I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. My question is a bit more strategic in nature. Coke FEMSA's encountered a lot of changes just over the last two or three years with respect to consolidating the bottlers in Mexico and now entering the Philippines. So H&#xE9;ctor, I was just hoping you could just talk a bit about your bench strengths directing investment spend, how should we think about how you'll be spending time and money, I guess, developing these markets. It seems like there's a lot to be done particularly in the Philippines but also with respect to consolidating Mexico. What's the timeline &#x2013; once again, how are thinking about spending levels? I don't know if The Coca-Cola Company obviously comes into that discussion too, but if you could just round that out a bit, that'd be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lauren. Let me start with Mexico. I think that one of the, I'd say, amazing events for the last &#x2013; for this past year, for 2012, is that our operations in Mexico have been able to integrate three different operations and we are looking to do the fourth on when we close Yoli without any problem. We separated the Northeast territory with one <mark type="ph" /> manager that we sell (28:28) in the Southeast because of the distances and the logistics and all of that. And both CIMSA and Queretano were basically integrated to the same operating zones that we have.</p>
          <p>We have been able to reduce the head count of operations importantly. And I think that the most important fact here in Mexico is that we have been able to integrate those operations without any union issue, without any problem in terms of the operations of these new territories. We are, little by little, improving the profitability to the levels that we were anticipating in our evaluation. We have been able to relocate some production lines to better work with the supply chain in terms of distribution centers.</p>
          <p>So I think that in Mexico, as you might imagine, before this integration, we were close to 50% of the volume of Mexico. Then, we use of word "digesting these new territories", was not a problem. And I'm sure that, doing the same with Grupo Yoli, will be done very easily.</p>
          <p>The Philippines obviously is a different story. There is a different time zone. The distance is complex. We are finding out that &#x2013; we know that we are realizing more in our expenses, that traveling to the Philippines is complicated in time and in the cost of travel expenses.</p>
          <p>We are basically &#x2013; you know that we sent four people since August of last year to be there. A part of this, because of the &#x2013; starting to understand the market, but also very importantly because of the family-related things like schools and things like that. So these four guys, one that is the Head of the Philippines, one that is in charge of planning and finance, one that is in charge of the human resources and transformation of the Philippines to the culture and the integration of the two cultures, and one that is the expert on commercial practice.</p>
          <p>Those four guys are now being helped by approximately 30 guys that are on the field that are assigned on a part-time basis in what we call training cells, which basically the first two, our most talented professionals, in some of the areas. And you know that the three pillars of the &#x2013; our strategy in Philippines is portfolio, route-to-market and supply chain. So on those three areas, we have these 30 experts training people in the Philippines. And in the next two weeks, we'll have &#x2013; I still don't know the amount of people, but I suspect that's somewhere a number similar to 20 or 30 Filipinos coming into Mexico to be trained for a period of three to six months.</p>
          <p>The idea with this training cell is to cross-fertilize the capabilities of world organizations, understand what are they doing very well in the Philippines, and if we are doing something better in terms of the capabilities in Latin America, to train our Filipino workers with these new capabilities and for them to go back to the operation and start replicating these processes in Philippines.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we have never faced a similar transformation in the past, integrating probably Panamco because of the size, in 2003, was similar in the challenge. But in this case, the culture, the time zone and the travelling and the expenses, the travelling time. But we are confident that working on these three pillars, again, portfolio, route-to-market and supply chain, that we'll find opportunities to improve the operations.</p>
          <p>No question about it, Lauren, it's going to be a challenge transformation or challenging change from what the Philippines represents, but we feel confident that we have the talent and strength.</p>
          <p>One factor that I also like to mention is that for several years now, our board of directors has approved a budget in the level basically around &#x2013; let me say, around $10 million a year in training people and having some excess bench strength, precisely in preparation for these opportunities. When I say they have approved this $10 million is that those $10 million that are reflected in our P&amp;L for purposes of compensating the executives is like a waiver from the results, so that it will not affect the performance metric for executives. So we have had several years of that budget being approved precisely in terms of preparing this bench strength. So I don't know if I...</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. And I guess I wanted to ask a couple of things. Let me start in Venezuela. H&#xE9;ctor, a couple of questions. I mean, if you could give us any sense of what your returnable mix is in Venezuela. And with the new efforts you're making, kind of how you're seeing that or how you're hoping to see that mix evolve. And if you can help us think through sort of how to think about what this means for the operation. In 2010, you guys did a really good job despite the turmoil in Venezuela, with a lot of pricing and I think you had some raw materials at the old exchange rates, some &#x2013; if we think forward to this time, do you have any raw materials at the old exchange rate? Do you see any risk that you'll be able to kind of contain or continue to be in the kind of pricing environment in Venezuela that you've been in? That would be my first question.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Lore. Yes, let me talk &#x2013; I think that obviously, our focus is to try to resolve in similar to 2010. Obviously, our management's been focused in what can we do with pricing and what can we do with this returnability for us. Some of the facts that I think are very important for you to know is, and probably you have read in the press, there is some scarcity of raw materials in Venezuela. So moving to &#x2013; we've done our presentations in glass, also helped us in that front, because as you can expect when &#x2013; some of this consequence, you have limitation on the availability of dollars, importing some other raw materials have caused some problems in the past and there have been some scarcity.</p>
          <p>So far, we haven't stopped our production or our sales effort because of that, but a few months ago, there was very little CO2 available in the country but we were able to work around that. But we will find some shortages in sugar or high fructose. We are starting to use high fructose because precisely some of the scarcity of sugar, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The idea here, Lore, if you ask me in a net shell, is the devaluation is for around 46%, it's basically the impact that we will have. That impact on our cost of goods sold or everything that is dollarized, has that impact. Our challenge is how can we improve our top line in bolivars at a pace close to that 46%. As you saw, the returnables, right now, represent around 8%. It's very difficult from me to give you a number of where that is going reach, but we like to see that growing because of the affordability, and as I said, because returnable platforms keep some pressure out of the PET or cans which are dollarized raw materials and with all the logistic problems related to that. So we'd like to increase that.</p>
          <p>Right now, basically, most of that returnable presentations are single-serve. We probably would like to do something in multi-serves also. So, you will see more strategies focusing in that direction? Where that number is going to reach, it's very difficult for me to predict right now but we will supply everything that is demanded on that front.</p>
          <p>If we are able to increase, let's say, mid-single digits our volumes or high-single digits, and we are able to price similar to the inflation, I think that we will be very close to have a top line growing around 35%, 40%, 42%. And that, I think, the challenge that our team has in Venezuela; how to be able to pass some of the effects that we'll have on the costs to revenues.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do your operators see any risks to being able to put through the kind of pricing that you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not so far, Lore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, there is no regulation with respect to that. There is a lot of volatility in the marketplace right now, because as soon as the country announces a depreciation of their currency, you may actually start seeing a lot of price movements even in raw materials, Lore, and obviously we need to try to cope with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just moving to Brazil for a second. Can you give us any outlook there in terms of how you see your raw materials? I mean, Ambev this morning was talking about high-teens pressure in COGS. Now, I mean, they have a different hedging strategy. But is there anything you could tell us? I mean you're facing a very good environment in most &#x2013; well, I think most of your markets, right? Is there any &#x2013; expect for Venezuela, obviously. Is there anything you're seeing in Brazil that would suggest that you're seeing that kind of pressure that Ambev was talking about this morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that from our perspective, I think that probably one of the differences have to do with aluminum. For us, as you know very well, sweeteners and PET are very important raw materials. We have &#x2013; we are &#x2013; we have expressed the fact that we do some hedgings, especially in Brazil and Colombia where sweeteners are very closely correlated to international crisis. What we have done is to hedge those prices when our operators feel comfortable with the price of the raw material and the cost of the raw material.</p>
          <p>In general, say that what we have been is &#x2013; and this is a very simple strategy, Lore. And maybe you'll &#x2013; you can argue that we are leaving some money on the table because the prices right now are lower than &#x2013; the spot prices are lower than the hedges that we have. But as long as we can hedge our cost of raw materials below what we have the previous year, in a way, we are avoiding having to move the prices of our products to the consumer. I don't know if I'm explaining myself.</p>
          <p>So when you have raw materials that are as important as sugar and PET and you already have a price structure in the marketplace and you can hedge those prices below what it cost the previous year, you would not have to increase prices to compensate for the volatility of those raw materials.</p>
          <p>So basically, that's where we have been moving. As I said, spot prices on sugar are lower today of what we have in our contracts for Brazil and Colombia. But we feel confident in the sense that obviously we don't know the future of the prices of sweeteners the rest of the year but we are certain that we have hedged below the cost of what we have on 2012. And I think that that give us &#x2013; when we have the price gap differentials of our approach versus our competitors, the fact that we can have those hedges give us some comfort that at least we don't have the pressure to move our prices because of the volatility of raw materials.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of Ambev, I think that they are pretty much affected by aluminum can &#x2013; aluminum, that in our case is not that important but I'm not that familiar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, no, no, that's fine. And just last question quickly, I mean in the press release, you've talked about how much in Mexico or in Central America came from price versus volume and it seem like less came from price this quarter, a lot less than what happened in the third quarter. I just wanted to confirm it &#x2013; maybe it's just rounding in the numbers but are you seeing any change in the pricing environment in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore. Your appreciation is correct. I think that during the fourth quarter, we are lapping important increases over the previous year. And this quarter, volume was an important element. As always, we continue to look for opportunities to do some price segmentation and continue to increase prices. You know that we have always been on top of the pricing formulas and we'll continue to look for opportunities. But this quarter, we benefited from volume performance rather than pricing, especially in those territories.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the Alexandre Miguel. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, H&#xE9;ctor. So my question is related &#x2013; just a follow-up on the raw material trend. You mentioned that you've hedged your needs for Brazil and Colombia. And just to make sure, you had already all you needs for the full year, was that the case? And then, you indicated cost to be below last year, is that the case or you're still somewhat exposed to the spot market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Alex. For Brazil and Colombia, I would say that basically we are &#x2013; we have catered on three-quarters, 75%, probably a little bit more than that, around &#x2013; between 75% and 80% of our needs for 2013. So we still have some exposure, say, between 20% and 25% of our needs in Brazil and Colombia.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we do have some &#x2013; these are not &#x2013; in Mexico, as you know, the prices are not correlated to the financial market. So we have agreed with some the suppliers that the number is much lower because we do like &#x2013; for the next three months, we have agreed on some pricing on sugar. In the case of high fructose, which are international suppliers, we have an amount <mark type="ph" /> that is plainly valid (47:04).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in Mexico, can you comment a bit on the trend for the sugar price? Do you think we could see the same declines we are seeing in the spot markets internationally for the Mexican market, or you think the decline will be softer because the market is more controlled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, my expectation is that it's going to be softer because it's a market that is more controlled. And it usually lasts a little bit, the decline that you see in the international markets. But certainly, the prices have been coming down in Mexico as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And about synergies, your target of MXN 900 million, can you comment on how much you have achieved by the end of 2012, just for us to have a sense of what's left for 2013 and onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex. So far, the synergies &#x2013; I mean, we have the same number, MXN 900 million. We are basically &#x2013; I'd say that for this year, we are around MXN 300 million of those MXN 900 million. I'll expect most of that to come on in the following year.  In the following meaning 2013, sorry, I was discussing 2012. Yes, so for 2012, around MXN 300 million. And then, I expect the next &#x2013; around MXN 600 million, to be achieved &#x2013; additional MXN 600 million to be achieved in 2013. And then, we have to have the Yoli synergies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We announced around MXN 140 million, and we are &#x2013; as you know, we are &#x2013; the Yoli process was a little bit different in a sense that we are finalizing a more profound diligence process as we speak. And once we finalize that, we can share with you that synergy, so if the number is the correct one or we should increase or decrease a little bit that number. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, perfect. Just to clarify a bit on the expenses that you said was related to the restructuring of the companies acquired, do you expect that expenses, some of that or all of that, to continue in the following quarters or that, I think, around too much, MXN 200 million of expenses that should be phased out going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that &#x2013; I don't remember what exactly the number. What I remember is that we have reduced the head count by around 1,500 employees. Severance payment during 2012, I don't know exactly the number, but Pepe can share that with you, but it's the most important element of this one-time expense. We will have some still during 2013. And especially once we finalize the integration of Yoli, we'll certainly reveal that number. But of all the one-time expenses, there are some related to the fees that were paid to bankers and lawyers, something like that. But the most important element has to do with severance of &#x2013; in the restructuring.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Karla Miranda. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the call. H&#xE9;ctor, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color of what should we expect in terms of margins for the South America division. I know that you're going to be working in Venezuela in order to offset the negative impact of the devaluation and all the efforts that you've been doing in Venezuela, even Colombia and Brazil, what should be looking for the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Karla, in general, I'll say that the environment for South America for next year will call for more deduction in margins. What are the main elements there? We have an aggressive plan in Colombia to foster affordability of the products. We believe that we owe to all of our shareholders to have a better performance in Colombia. And for that, we need to increase per capita consumption in Colombia. We have to solve this during several conferences.</p>
          <p>So we have a specific plan where we are spending in marketing, we are launching new presentations, we are launching returnable presentations to bring affordability. And that &#x2013; the whole mix of that you, heard me in the previous conference call saying that 2013 for Colombia is going to be a transformation year. We will spend some in the marketplace, with the idea and the hope that in the following years we have better per capita.</p>
          <p>We have the impact of Venezuela, that as you correctly pointed out, we are counting on our operators to compensate for the additional cost of raw materials that are dollarized and the impact of some of the cost of raw materials and salaries and everything.</p>
          <p>Argentina, I think that Argentina should have a good year. So far, during the beginning of the year, the weather has not been interrupting with volumes in Argentina. We reflected &#x2013; it was reflected also in the fourth quarter. But the pricing equation, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:32), Bonaqua, the water line that we have, a lot of freight, it's &#x2013; and I think they are important element for you to know there, is that these are coordinated effort with The Coca-Cola Company and Andina to work in that presentation and in that specific type &#x2013; in that specific brand. So Argentina should have good performance.</p>
          <p>Brazil, it would be also &#x2013; if we don't do anything with prices, we'll certainly be negatively impacted. We need to work on that. What are the main elements in Brazil? We have change on taxes in Brazil, similar to excise taxes, that the impact during 2013 &#x2013; if we don't do anything, I mean if everything is staying similar in terms of pricing and cost and et cetera, we'll have &#x2013; that sole impact on taxes will be between $60 million to $70 million in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Obviously, similar to Venezuela, where operators have all the challenge to reverse that trend, we have issues like the drivers or the so-called <mark type="ph" /> leigo motoristas (54:49), the hours of operation of the transportation in S&#xE3;o Paulo are pretty much limited so that would call for additional costs. So in general, I'd say that Brazil should have flat margins or to slightly negative margins.</p>
          <p>All in all, I think that South America will have a small contraction. I think that Mexico will have some expansion of margin. So on a consolidated basis, I'm expecting to see flat margins.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just answer that question, please, operator. And then, we'll go this, with the follow-up.</p>
          <p>CapEx for 2013, I'm looking at somewhere around $800 million. I'll say that's slightly above the number that we presented on the future numbers for 2013 &#x2013; 2012, excuse me, that were around $750 million, mainly because of the two production plants, one in Brazil and one in Colombia, that which &#x2013; we had started the one in Brazil, we'd like to finish that by end of the year. Colombia's a little bit behind schedule because some authorization paperwork, but we are expecting that to be done.</p>
          <p>In the Philippines, we mentioned that the CapEx for this year should be somewhere around $100 million to $120 million. That's in addition to this $800 million that I mentioned. Obviously, as I said in the previous question, that is &#x2013; the split &#x2013; the idea is to be funded by the Philippines operation alone, and in case somebody should [h] nominate to (57:00) contribute to the Philippines is going to be done in the 51/49 ownership that we share with The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Operator, we can follow up with the next question please.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question. I just had a question on the Philippines operation, if we can expect some contribution already this year, in 2013, on the equity income line or you expect that mostly towards 2014 and beyond? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's still too early to know, but I'll expect that this year will be more neutral and then to expect some positive numbers for 2014. I mean we just closed the transaction basically a month and one day ago. And even though we have some of the guys working there since August, we are starting with some of the strategies promising on these three fronts that I mentioned; portfolio, route-to-market and supply chain. The idea is to start collecting some of the so-called low-hanging fruits as soon as possible. That early will have to be done more on the supply chain, the other two, route-to-market and portfolio, are more transformative. Volumes in January were quite low, and I would think that have to go with a lot of inventory buildup before the closing in December. February is looking better, with flat numbers compared to volume versus last year. But in terms of profitability, it's still very difficult to predict something, Fernando. But my expectation is that this year, we want to be more neutral, and then 2014 we should be expecting some contribution to our numbers.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from Alex Robarts. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I guess for my question, I'd like to go back to Mexico on the volume, kind of price outlook for this year. Just you basically had more price than volume last year. Do you think that as you look out into this year, that kind of ratio will continue? How are you seeing the volume trends right now, still versus sparkling?</p>
          <p>And related to this, the jug water, if I understood the press release, in Mexico, it is in a decreasing year-on-year mode. I assume if that's true, that that's related to some of this restructuring that you're doing with the new territories. Could you give us a sense of when you might start to complete that process or where jug volumes, which is about almost 20% of your volume in Mexico, when that segment starts to get some positive growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex. Volume and pricing, I think that in general, Mexico, we will continue to have in total &#x2013; and I'll go in a second, into segmentation by categories. But in total, growing mid-single digits volume and keeping prices with the inflation should be our target for this year.</p>
          <p>When you look at sparkling drinks, in general, my expectation is that volumes should be growing to low- to mid-single digits. Non-carbonated drinks, in excess of 10%, double-digits but more in the 10% to 12% range. And jug water in single-serve presentations, it's a difficult market, very competitive. We have good quarters then, we have bad quarters. But in general aspect, we have mid-single digits to low-double digits in water in single-serve presentations.</p>
          <p>Jug water, this is the fifth quarter that we have a decrease in volume and that has to do with the strategy of converting that jug water business into a more profitable unit for us. Right now, we've got prices for a jug of water in Mexican pesos of around MXN 28 to MXN 30. When some of the refillers that are quite informal but that are present in the marketplace are selling at MXN 10 to MXN 12, so we have a tremendous price gap. But that price gap has been built little by little on purpose because we have to have a profitable jug water business, that remember a lot of that is distributed to the home or to the offices.</p>
          <p>I think that the positive trend on jug water is that as we are visiting households and offices, we are able also to bring new products into the scene. Before, these routes were 100% dedicated to jug waters, now we are offering soft drinks, we are offering juices. And at some point in time, if everything goes fine, I think that we will be able to sell some value-added dairies also on top of that. So it's important that these routes are profitable in their operation.</p>
          <p>In the past, not long ago, we were selling jugs of water at MXN 20, so we have increased probably close to 50% the price of our jug of water of Ciel brand. And that's the main cause, Alex, of why jug water have had five quarters of consecutive decline in volumes. It's totally on purpose to convert that business into a more profitable unit for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so, the mid-single to low-single kind of guidance for jug water this year, that's a full year number, right? I mean that's what you expect to book for the year or that's just a rate that you expect to reach or achieve at some point this year?</p>

          <p>Yes, Alex, I think that on the total portfolio basis, to look for, on an organic basis, to have a low to mid-single digit number volume growth is a good number for Mexico for 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, H&#xE9;ctor, this Alan Alanis. Sambuddha is here with me. A quick question on the competitive environment. I mean we've seen this &#x2013; the Pepsi system starting to operate as a single entity very recently. Have you seen any change in that competitive environment in Mexico, and what do you &#x2013; what do you anticipate? And let me tell you where the question is coming from. I think that the Pepsi system is going to focus a lot on &#x2013; other than the Pepsi brands but also on the non-carbonated where they have some leading brands. Is there a risk, H&#xE9;ctor, that you might have to accelerate SG&amp;A in the next year or next few years in order to contain these changes in the competitive environment, particularly for non-carbonated soft drinks? That will be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alan, yes, you're referring to Mexico obviously and, yes, they have been a bit more active in the marketplace, especially in key accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whoever visits Mexico City has seen the Chapultepec Park now with a big Pepsi sign, that for many years it was a Coca-Cola property. Some cinemas are also being moved. Some restaurants and things like that.</p>
          <p>Honestly, at the end of the day, we haven't seen any movement on the market share and the numbers, a slight reduction on the very dominant position that we have in market share in colas but very, very slight. I think that in the traditional play, we have continued to see our operators working very well. They are starting to do some activities in an operational sense but not important so far. I think that the point to highlight is that they are doing a lot of restructuring in the organization still.</p>
          <p>We have increased very importantly our market share in isotonics, where they have a very dominant brand and where they've extract a lot of their profits for the Pepsi system. And in there, we are doing tremendously inroads on isotonics. The last reading that I have is that we  have kept 35% share on isotonics, that means Powerade versus Gatorade, 35% share in our territories in Mexico from basically low-teens  before.</p>
          <p>So I think that, obviously, it's a very competitive market and we are very watchful of this strategy they are following. Sometimes, it's kind of mind boggling how they are going get a return for the prices they are paying for these properties, but I assume that it's part of their marketing expenses. The tough dollars they are paying for these things is going to be difficult to get a return on that. But I understand their strategy; they are building little by little all the brand.</p>
          <p>I don't see an increase on our marketing expenses. You know that somewhere around 3.5%, 4% of our revenues is a good number. Last year, on a full year, it was around 3.5% for Mexico. But at the beginning of the year, we've mentioned that we increased some of our marketing expenses, mainly in returnability and cooler placement that have to do with the preparation to their integration. And I think that, in general, I'd say that the market share numbers, as I mentioned, a slight reduction in a very dominant position that we have in colas, a very important inroad that we have done in our isotonic with Powerade. In flavors, we are increasing slightly market shares also, so nothing to worry so far on this front</p>

          <p>Got it. And changing completely, going to Brazil &#x2013; this is my last question and it's more of a strategic question, I guess. Coca-Cola reconfirmed last Friday that these three bottlers in the North of Brazil are merging; Norsa, Renosa, and Guararapes. Any chance that you would be interested in participating in that &#x2013; in the creation of that in Brazil? Or how would you &#x2013; how are you thinking about the consolidation in Brazil, both in terms of those three particular bottlers and potentially the rest of the bottlers in Brazil? What would that trigger in &#x2013; that you can share with us, of course? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I think that &#x2013; basically, that's not Northeast integration. It's basically the whole North of Brazil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:09:59).</p>

          <p>It's &#x2013; I think that they have been &#x2013; they have commented on that for many months or years. I think that it's positive for the system, that they're doing that integration. It's very early to know, Alan, if that will create a similar effect to what happened in Mexico, that once...</p>

          <p>Arca and Contal merged, then everyone was looking for &#x2013; to reviewing their own strategy. I think that in Brazil, given the size of the country, it's important that you &#x2013; that we focus on the areas that are more synergetic in terms of the logistics and production capacity and distribution centers because the country is huge in the area. But that's basically what I think what I can say.</p>
          <p>I mean we certainly are open towards the possibilities that &#x2013; with respect to the first question, I mean can we do something? Whether or not, I think that I can't hardly envision us joining forces with them and having a very small participation there. I think that our DNA and our...</p>

          <p>Alan, I think, calls for us managing the operations, which in some point in time, we can do something with them in the future. As I mentioned, we are far in distance, we're far away. But depending on how the consolidation on Brazil is happening, if that happens in the future, maybe at some point in time we'll be closer to that area in terms of distance.</p>

          <p>Good morning, H&#xE9;ctor, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give more color about the great performance in the working capital figure at the end of the last year. In particular, we see that the suppliers figures importantly. Could you give more details about this? That will be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marco. I think that in general, that the moment that you are seeing has to do more with integration of some other known territories, that we are seeing the supplier number going up. We always are very watchful of our cash flow mix and our working capital. But once we've had the integrations fully done, we shouldn't be seeing that kind of changes in the working capital.</p>
