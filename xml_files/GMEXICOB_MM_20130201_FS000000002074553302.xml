        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is my team <mark type="ph" /> of our finance (01:20) directors of all our major subsidiaries and other executives of the group.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I'll first briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I'll comment on our Mining Division's most relevant results, our Infrastructure Division's results, and our Transportation Division results.</p>
          <p>And regarding global economic concerns, we saw copper prices ranging between $3.28 per pound of copper to $3.97 during the year. The key events during the quarter and pretty much the year was the change of government in China, the fiscal cliff, and the U.S. presidential elections, and the relative tranquility on the European markets.</p>
          <p>Metal markets are still positive in China. It remains such an important driver for our business. China shows promise of renewed growth as ongoing expectations that they will continue to spend on infrastructure and take steps to recover their economic growth. The designation of the new Chinese president has been well received by the market. China expects growth about 8% compared to 7.7% in 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.S., although the electoral uncertainty is over, fiscal uncertainty remains. The U.S. government will have to agree on fiscal targets to apply tax decreases and cut expenditures. The incumbent political debate is likely to produce market volatility on the short term, we believe.</p>
          <p>Regarding the European markets, the delay in start of <mark type="ph" /> Basel III (02:55) has given the European financial system a little bit of breathing space.</p>
          <p>We believe solid growth will persist in 2013 supported by copper demand in China. According to estimates by CRU, demand is forecast to rise 6% in 2013 and 5% in 2014. We believe this will at least sustain current copper prices.</p>
          <p>For the United States, increased domestic automotive production and construction sector activity will be key to pushing up demand. Copper demand is expected to increase 3% in 2013 in the U.S. While many new mine projects could enter production over the next few years, rising development cost, infrastructure challenges, permittings, sovereign risk, ongoing competition actually for labor, will continue to constrain project development. We believe world major economies have been responding well to the new stimulus. The impact of these measures will help copper demand. We remain constructed on copper. This is the fourth straight year of deficit. Our long-term view of copper prices isn't changed which is &#x2013; was very positive.</p>
          <p>This year was marked by challenges caused by a lower price environment of all our products. Nevertheless, I'm pleased to report that Grupo M&#xE9;xico has performed very strongly in 2012, particularly if you look at some of the issues our peers dealt with.</p>
          <p>This has been a very significant year for us with record production and profitability. We produced 826,209 tons of copper, a substantial increase of 64% as we announced our aggressive investment plan on September 2010. This resulted in record-high net earnings of $2.7 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This has allowed for an attractive and consistent return to our shareholders. We also reached a record number in CapEx. This was $2.1 billion, 74% higher than our previous record number in 2011. We expect these investments will result in higher production and even lower costs in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Consolidated revenues for 2012 were $10.1 billion, only 2% below year-over-year, and this was in spite significant drop in metal prices. Copper dropped 10%, molybdenum 18%, silver 11% and Zinc 11%. These results were driven by increased production of copper and by products compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of our underlying core strength is our leading position as one of the world's lowest cost producers. Cost of sales for 2012 were $4.9 billion, 2% lower than the previous year, this was in spite inflationary pressures from our main inputs. Our Transportation Division also reduced cost of 5% year-over-year despite a strong increase in fuel prices of 11%.</p>
          <p>Since a very significant investment from the mining industry and general economic recovery anticipated to put particular pressure on energy costs, we've decided to cover most of the power needs on the Mining Division and the Transportation Division including our expansion to the construction of two combined cycle power plants in Sonora. This plant will produce 500 megawatts and we also are building a wind power plant in Oaxaca that would produce 74 megawatts. These projects will significantly reduce our power costs. Our power costs currently account for 23% of the Mining Division and 32% in our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>The year's accumulated EBITDA was $5 billion. This is equivalent to 49% of sales. We are aggressively working on focusing our investment decision from the highest quality projects which will deliver cash returns under any probable economic condition.</p>
          <p>As was recently announced, Grupo M&#xE9;xico's 2013 capital expenditure program of $3.5 billion was approved by the board. $2 billion will be invested in the Mining Division, nearly $1 billion in the Infrastructure Division, and $531 million in our Transportation Division. The Mining Division has an investment program of $2 billion for 2013, out of which, 63% will be invested in Mexico, 28% in Peru and 9% in the U.S.</p>
          <p>As a result of strong capital expenditures made in recent years, the Transportation Division has consolidated into a world-class asset, reporting an EBITDA margin of 33%. This reflects higher sales, increases in average speed and improvement in fuel consumption, while at the same time we reduce costs.</p>
          <p>During the year, the Transportation Division invested $259 million. These investments were used mostly to improve the railroad infrastructure so as to increase speed, improve client service and achieve cost efficiencies as I've mentioned. Our board approved CapEx of $531 million for 2013 for our Transportation Division.</p>
          <p>The Infrastructure Division invested a record high of $631 million in 2012, out of which almost 60% were spent in the acquisition of the platforms and modulars and 35% in the construction of the power plant in Sonora, the rest in the Salamanca-Leon toll road, another minor investment.</p>
          <p>As we talked about for the previous quarters, Grupo M&#xE9;xico's board is positive about the global outlook for Mexico, especially, the future of the energy sector in this country has exceptional opportunities, we feel will be created with the recent change in government. With this transaction, we believe that we will be creating a larger, more diverse company, adding shareholder value over the mid and long term.</p>
          <p>As we announced, we have acquired two new platforms totaling $493 million. With this acquisition, over the last 12 months, La Perforadora M&#xE9;xico has committed so far investments for over $1 billion. We have created a fleet of five platforms and two modular units, which will significantly contribute to company revenues.</p>
          <p>We expect the Infrastructure Division's EBITDA to reach over $200 million this year, 2013; $400 million in 2014; and $500 million by 2015. We expect cash flow generation from this business to become the main source of fund for future capital expenditures in this division as a standalone basis and will create opportunities for stronger returns.</p>
          <p>For 2013, our board approved a CapEx budget of $995 million as I've mentioned. This $995 million will be divided, $546 million for La Perforadora M&#xE9;xico; $258 million for the construction of the power plant, and $190 million for the Leon-Salamanca toll road.</p>
          <p>Now discussing the main developments of our Mining Division, which as you know comprises our subsidiaries Southern Copper Corporation and Asarco. It is really gratifying to see have we have executed our efforts to grow our production. Our results reflect our strong operating performance across all units, as a result of the state-of-the-art technology equipment that has been acquired and helping this reach optimum operating efficiencies and minimizing the effects of lower metal price.</p>
          <p>Copper production for 2012 again reached a new record high, an increase of 7% year-over-year. This was mainly the result of increased production at Buenavista, Cuajone and Ray. Buenavista is expected &#x2013; exceeded to 180,000 tons previous record. It produced 200,070 tons of copper during the year. This is 11% above our production estimate. This production was a result of strong investments made in this year. We believe we can make Buenavista the third largest mine in the world in terms of production.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum sales for the year decreased 2% to 18,220 tons. This compares to 2011. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:14) to expected lower <mark type="ph" /> ore grade at our (11:17) Toquepala mine.</p>
          <p>Production in 2012 was a new record of La Caridad mine. Caridad produced a little bit south of 11,000 tons. This represents 60% of the total molybdenum produced in 2012, as we gained access to higher grade material in these mines. With global molybdenum production anticipated to decrease, our recovering demand and stronger than expected economic growth in China, we expect that in 2013, the balance between supply and demand would lower current market <mark type="ph" /> surplus (11:50), thereby, improving the market prices in the near future.</p>
          <p>As you know earlier today, Southern Copper had its conference call and we went over details project by project. I would like to comment on the Mission expansion of Asarco. The project will expand the concentrator with two new mills, which will increase annual copper production by 2,000 tons of copper. We've invested $41 million out of the $60 million budgeted, which reports 66% completion and is expected to start the new production in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, the engineering has been completed and refurbishing works are in progress to re-open Asarco's molybdenum plant in Mission. This plant will have an additional 544 tons of molybdenum per year and is expected to be in operation the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>We entered the year in a very strong financial position. Our total consolidated debt was $5.6 billion and our consolidated cash was $3.6 billion. During this quarter, we prepaid what was outstanding $450 million of the loan we obtained to get Asarco out of Chapter 11. We also prepaid a $2.1 billion syndicated loan Americas Mining's team to settle and pay the decision of Judge Leo Strine of the Delaware Court. Our financial policy still continues to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and investing in our growth projects.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on November 7, we paid a dividend of $0.26 pesos per share outstanding. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company's board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.26 pesos per share outstanding. This will be paid on February 28 and represents <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:46) of approximately $160 million. The cash cost per pound of copper, net of byproducts, was $1 per pound cumulative for 2012. This is for the whole Mining Division. This includes some copper in Asarco as well. And this compares to $0.81 per pound of copper in 2011. This increase is due mainly to increased labor costs and lower contribution from byproducts. The cash cost excluding byproducts was $1.91 per pound of copper. This is pretty much in line with the $1.98 (sic) [$1.88] (14:19) reported for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to our Transportation Division, I would like to comment on the main developments of the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Regarding those volumes, we transported during 2012, 51.3 billion net tons/km. This was pretty much similar to the 52.2 billion net tons/km transported in 2011.</p>
          <p>The 2012 volumes were mainly affected by the 22% decrease in volume transported of agricultural <mark type="ph" /> products (14:49). As you know, it is our most important segment. And it was affected during the year by droughts in the U.S. and Mexico, the avian flu, and increases of international crop prices, but was compensated positively by an increase of 40% in Intermodal segment, which raised import and export volumes moved throughout the Port of Manzanillo.</p>
          <p>For the year 2013, ITM expects to move 54.3 billion net tons/km and 1.2 million railcars. This represents a growth of 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively, compared to 2012. Such growth is expected to be driven by recovery and growth of the Agricultural segment, approximately 6%, and also a growth of 8% in Intermodal, 15% in the Metals industry and 9% in the Mineral segment, metals mainly iron.</p>
          <p>ITM, that's our holding company subsidiary sales, for 2012 were $1.7 billion, an increase of 2.8% compared with the same period 2011. This was mainly due to more favorable mix of rates and traffic. The segments showing the best performance in dollar terms were intermodal traffic, which rose 10%, energy 10%, industrials <mark type="ph" /> 12% (16:13), and automotive 4%.</p>
          <p>The operating cost for the year was $1 billion, a decrease of 5% compared with the same period of 2011. We were able to obtain this due to better control in consumption of diesel, lower labor costs, maintenance and materials. The EBITDA for 2012 was $559 million. This is an important 20% above the $464 million of 2011. For 2013, we are estimating net sales to be north of $1.9 billion and EBITDA approximately $660 billion.</p>
          <p>The railroad division invested in the year a total of $259 million, 27% above the previous year. The capital investments were mainly allocated to improve railroad infrastructure, construction of new sidings, and no additional locomotives were acquired during this year. The approved CapEx for 2013 is $530 million. This will be invested principally in railroad infrastructure and construction of sidings and yards to improve and expand operating volumes and increase safety.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Infrastructure Division real quick, we've seen that this division has been collecting benefits of the important investments made in previous years. During 2012, consolidated sales were $223 million, in line with the sales of 2011. However, it is important to note that due to the high profitability of the new projects, the EBITDA increased 64%. We expect to receive the full benefits of the operation of the new platforms in 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition, the first power plant of 250 megawatt will kick in as well in 2013, and we're estimating an EBITDA of over $200 million for 2013. By 2014, the second 400 feet platform will start operation. The Salamanca-Leon Highway will be completed, as well as the other power plant. As a result, the EBITDA for 2015 is expected to be over $500 million.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, the Division will continue to focus its effort on power production, construction, civil and industrial engineering, oil and water drilling. And I mean we &#x2013; demand for these infrastructure projects <mark type="ph" /> are in the area (18:40) above 20%, and we'll continue to do so for the future project that we are currently analyzing.</p>
          <p>With this, we conclude our comments to the earnings results and we can open, please, the forum for questions.</p>

          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Rodolfo Angele from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello, everyone. Let me start by saying, we were glad to see more details on the Infrastructure segment in terms of disclosure. And with that, we'll also ask more questions and this is where I start. If you could detail a little bit more CapEx ahead of this year, how much more are you seeing to &#x2013; for the next five years or so? I would also like, if possible, to hear the same type of figures on the railroad CapEx, exactly what you expect there for the next few years?</p>
          <p>And my final question is on Asarco. I wanted to ask if you could give us an update what to expect for next year in terms of copper grades? Is there anything substantially different from what we're seeing more recently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much for the question. I mean, first question regarding CapEx with Infrastructure. I mean, we've detailed the $1 billion for this year. Actually, it's $993 million. And we're currently forecasting for 2014, $172 million. This, of course, is for the projects that I've highlighted in the call, which are the only projects that we have signed and have moved forward with. So that's why it's an important drop there.</p>
          <p>Regarding Ferromex, I'll pass on the call to Isaac Franklin to give you a little bit more of light regarding going forward. He's the Finance Director of our Transportation Division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Hi, everybody. Regarding the CapEx, for Ferromex, we're expecting is $530 million mainly in infrastructures. There are no locomotives contract was over there. It's in order to increase our capacity, building new double lines in the most &#x2013; with the most traffic in our lines. And for the next years, we're expecting more or less the same amount. These are very aggressive CapEx for the next five years in order to increase our capacity in our lines due to all the <mark type="ph" /> new shorting (22:00) and the new plants that are coming to Mexico besides the growth in some other of our segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess I'd like to add to that that &#x2013; I mean, just in a broader and bigger picture scheme. As you know, we've been investing heavily in locomotive in the previous years and in infrastructure. So this has allowed us to decongest our network, which has tremendously improved efficiency, speed, et cetera. So we are very happy with the operating results of our Division.</p>
          <p>And we are working in a five-year program. Just as we do in our Mining Division, we have a five-year program that we'll give you more details on and once it's fully completed. But we believe that it's a time to invest and really push the gas on more growth so that our Transportation Division will become a more success story than it has been. And &#x2013; sorry, regarding Asarco, Oscar Gonzales is the Finance Director of Asarco. Oscar, do you want to comment on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. With regards to the copper grade, it's going to be 0.49% next year for all our mines. It's going to drop slightly from the 0.56% of this year. And we're going to make up some of that lost production with higher recovery due to the investments we have been doing on our concentrators, on instrumentation, and new flotation cells, and also with the more milling due to our expansion at Mission mine.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:01) and congratulation. This is a good set of result. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:05) my question also relates to that. Could you give more color as to how do you expect to get to the $500 million EBITDA in 2015? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, first of all, these investments are fully contracted, you enter into contracts that are signed. For instance, in the La Perforadora M&#xE9;xico Company, you have a tariff. So that is already in place. So the same &#x2013; I mean, we have not experienced in the Power Division, if you like, any delays whatsoever. Actually, 100% almost is completed for the first plant, and then we will start testing and it will be up and running this year.</p>
          <p>And regarding the Leon-Salamanca's toll road, as you know, I mean that's the contracts already we've got the concession, its fully financed. So it's ready to go and it's being built. So just &#x2013; that is the operational contractual <mark type="ph" /> kind of (25:01). And that secures an EBITDA for this year of $210 million, for 2014 of $428 million, 2015 $502 million, Santiago.</p>

I don't know if you can comment a little bit about the interest income of $267 million you show on your income statement, since we cannot track them through the subsidiaries. And also, if you can comment on Asarco again, on implied silver sales, they are showing very sharp contractions quarter-over-quarter. If you expect them to improve gradually, what we should expect for the next quarters? And lastly, could you comment on your strategy for the Transport Division? What could we expect from the GAP issue?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Well first of all, the increase in the financial statements that you're referring to have to do with our investment actually in GAP, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac&#xED;fico which, as all you've seen, the share price has moved from MXN 47 to MXN 72 looking at this number. The second question regarding, I mean, silver for Asarco, Oscar, do you want to answer that please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. They did drop. But I think that we moved out of a high silver section of some of our mines, but I think they're going to stay where they are currently. The other slight effect that happened was that we have, as a group, decided to send our slimes &#x2013; instead of processing them in our Amarillo plant, we are sending them to the La Caridad plant to operate one plant at a higher percentage of utilization. And that has affected a little bit the sales and the production of Asarco.</p>

          <p>Let us get that number for you. And let me just answer the strategy on ITM. I mean, the strategy has not changed. As you know, we have two different partners at two different levels, i.e. Union Pacific at our Ferromex subsidiary, and Sinca Inbursa at our ITM holding company subsidiary.</p>
          <p>So we've been working together, the three of us, to try to achieve the best corporate and capital structure going forward. As we've mentioned to the market in several forums, we've been analyzing and looking at the market in order to decide whether IPO, spinoff, what have you, at some point. So fortunately, as you can see, there's a very important tailwinds in the equity market. So we've kind of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:20) but nothing to report at this time. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:24).</p>

          <p>Well, as you know, we have a little bit south of 30% participation of the equity capital of Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac&#xED;fico. We are happy with the return that our investment has yielded. There's probably a lot of noise regarding legal issues and the status still the same.</p>
          <p>I mean, we're waiting to hear from the courts whether the by-laws &#x2013; in the second instance, because in first instance, the by-laws were declared null and void, the particular clause referring to shareholders above 10%. We're waiting to hear in the second instance. And I mean that's about it. There's been news in the media and newspapers regarding legal details which I don't want to bore you with, but that's pretty much it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Hi, there. I have just a couple of question. The first one is on the view you can have on the copper market in 2013. There's some competitors saying that it could turn into a surplus by year-end. So, just to know, how you see the prices going from now? As well as, for your hedging policy, in the past last year you haven't done any, just to know about it? And as well as for the CapEx, you're going to invest $3.5 billion this year in CapEx. And just to know next year, if we broadly go down, since most of the project will be in final stage, but just to know if they are going back to normal levels or just slightly down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you so much. Let me try to break down the questions. First of all, as you know, we are positive on the copper outlook. I mean, we ourselves are one of the companies with more projects and more growth in the pipeline. And we &#x2013; as you've seen and we've commented on Southern Copper's conference call, we are struggling with permitting, environmental, local community, particularly in <mark type="ph" /> Tia Maria (32:06) and in the expansion of Toquepala, <mark type="ph" /> if you will (32:08). So we believe that most of the market expecting additional production to come into 2013, we really &#x2013; don't really &#x2013; I mean, I guess it's very hard to see additional production that will turn this into a surplus. That's pretty much our thoughts.</p>
          <p>In terms of hedging, we haven't hedged at all and, basically, because that's consistent with our view of positive outlook in the copper prices. As you know, we don't have a policy. We do it and analyze it in a quarter-by-quarter basis at a board level, which gives us a guideline on the macro environment and fundamentals of the copper industry. And, I'm sorry, can you repeat the last question a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about the CapEx in &#x2013; not this year, but the next year, we should see the CapEx going down strongly from $3.5 billion you're going to invest this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually this is a CapEx for 2014, $3.6 billion. And you can break that down in $3 billion for Mining Division, $528 million for our Transportation Division and &#x2013; Mining <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:32) &#x2013; and the difference is for the Infrastructure Division. $172 million for the Infrastructure Division, as I explained earlier today in the call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Thanks for the call. Two questions. First question, just to confirm, the new power plants in Sonora, they will supply power to Southern Copper at a market price? I guess that's the first question. Will it be at &#x2013; the power be priced to Southern Copper at market rate or below market rate?</p>
          <p>And then a second question, just to clarify on the infrastructure, the EBITDA, basically, the $500 million goal three years from now. To clarify your earlier comment, you mentioned that almost all of the revenues and, I guess, the tariffs are contracted at this point. So should we consider this $500 million EBITDA almost sort of guaranteed to happen, assuming that there are no kind of delays with the projects, and that really the only risk here would be cost overruns? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, first of all, the question regarding the electricity. The 250 mega will come in production this year. And that will supply the current needs of Buenavista and Caridad and our metallurgical complex. As you know, we have in the state of Sonora, where we're building the power plant, our two mines or two open pit mines of Mexico, which is La Caridad and Buenavista, and between those two mines is our metallurgical complex. So we're feeding that. The additional 250 megawatts will come in line as the increase of production of Buenavista will come in line.</p>
          <p>So actually, yes, I mean, the 500 megawatts will be used by our Mexican operations in the northern part of Mexico. The tariff that Minera M&#xE9;xico will pay for this electricity will be a discounted tariff to the CFE. And that is the arrangement we've entered into with &#x2013; between M&#xE9;xico Generadora de Energ&#xED;a and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:14).</p>
          <p>So the difference, if the electricity is lower, if you like, will go to M&#xE9;xico Generadora de Energ&#xED;a. And that is already accounted for in the number that I gave you of the Infrastructure Division's EBITDA. As you know, the life of the plant is 30 years and this energy supply agreement for a long term as well. And we've secured the gas, supply the molecule for up to 20 years as well. Regarding the EBITDAs of the whole Infrastructure Division, I can tell you that most of these contracts have a life of three years and some of seven years.</p>
          <p>So this is how it works. I mean, of course, things can go wrong, what have you, but these are the contracts that have been entered into, but &#x2013; with Pemex, particularly. And so we feel very confident that we can achieve these objectives and the results.</p>
          <p>Thank you for the question.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my call. First of all, congratulations on those 826,000 tons of copper. That was really something. And also, I just have a few questions. I'd like to know that &#x2013; dig a little bit further on the CapEx. On 2011 and 2010, your CapEx as a percentage of your net sales was a little bit smaller than it is now. Now it's around 20%. So I would like to know if there's a guidance that you could give us of how much of your net sales you're willing to use in CapEx in the future, in the coming years? And also, if you could give us a guidance on the behavior of your collection period and receivables, or perhaps in day sales outstanding in inventories, how are you seeing that behavior in the coming quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Armando. Well, let me start off with saying that, well, the reason you didn't see a lot of CapEx earlier was because Buenavista, as you know, have labor issues and we have not. We had everything ready to start developing this mine. As you know, this is the largest mine in terms of reserves in the world. So I mean, the strength of Grupo M&#xE9;xico are that we have the largest reserves of copper in the world and probably, if not the most efficient in terms of cost copper producer.</p>
          <p>So the reason you are seeing this acceleration in CapEx is because we've turned around completely, not only the mine, but also the community around the mine was invested heavily, not only money, but resources to secure a very safe environment in order to be able to expand our production there. That's, if you like, the most important project that we have in this 2013, 2015 going forward.</p>
          <p>The way we look at projects for mining expansion is not really let's just set up benchmark, as a percentage of sales. We do analyze what's doable by basic engineering and then diesel engineering budgeting and then go ahead and working on the projects. So, you might see differences year-by-year, but the idea this kind of project when you start them, you cannot just stop them. So really, we're committed. And that's why we went to the market to take advantage of the low interest rates out there and to secure and that's why we &#x2013; as opposed to some of our peers, we are mostly 30 year, I mean our bond offering.</p>
          <p>So, we want to make sure that regardless of what might happen, we are able to complete these projects. And I mean, these projects, as you know, will have better or the same kind of cash costs, depends on which one we're talking about. So, that's really the idea here. In terms of receivables and accounts collectible --</p>

          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much. I had a just one more question. On the copper &#x2013; on the pricing outlook for 2013, is there any insights that you could maybe share with us, what you're seeing on your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, as I mentioned, we are positive and we feel that it's hard to get additional production out there. I mean we, of course, are not in the business of forecasting, I mean, probably, I mean, we look at the &#x2013; on you guys and your research departments on what they're seeing. But I guess, as I commented, we are positive and we don't believe that substantial amount of production might come to the market, to be honest, in a way to create really a surplus. So, I mean, we &#x2013; that's really our position here. And again, that's consistent with our hedging strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. Hey. Just one quick question regarding the power plant, I was wondering how much is your projected electricity demand in Mexico and Peru, because it seems to me that with a projected capacity of nearly 600 megawatts in Mexico, based in Mexico, you will be producing around 50% more than your needs in Mexico. So, what will be your plans for the rest of the energy or your projected demand in Mexico for the Mining Division, because all these investments in the power plants seem like a big &#x2013; that you will have a big production of energy, like 50% more, of your needs? So, do you have that number in mind? Maybe I'm wrong, but according to my numbers, you will be producing 50% more energy than you will need it, even considering your expansion. So, maybe I'm wrong, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodrigo. I'm glad you asked that because maybe the rest of the market is also confused. I mean, we are currently not consuming 500 megawatts. The idea of building <mark type="ph" /> 500 megawatt (45:08) facility is to &#x2013; I mean, to provide also the expansion of Buenavista. So, this is really going to be a match. So, I mean, if we have any production for any reason that there is a less demand, we can sell that of course at a very attractive price. But the idea and the plan are to match our needs with our production. And remember that the 74 megawatts of the windmill in Oaxaca.</p>

And also, we have these in our Transportation Division. So, the idea is that we really, I mean, match production and consumption. Today, we consume 260 megawatts.</p>

          <p>Well, depends upon what in the price of the byproducts, that's a little bit harder to &#x2013; I mean, to point out to. I mean, I can tell you they will be pretty much in line, based on our &#x2013; I mean, our budget.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Rodolfo Angele from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks again. I was just wondering following up on two things. If you could let us know what is the copper price that you use to do your budget and also if you could comment on target leverage for the company in terms of net debt to EBITDA? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, we've done and, of course, again it's very important to do this disclaimer, if you like, adapt. I mean, we are not <mark type="ph" /> anymore (48:51) trying to predict copper prices. For purposes of this year and as we are pretty much producing the same as 2012, we've left the same copper price as 2012. So, that's what we &#x2013; the same average, we've left there just in our budget. So, that's the answer there. In terms of leverage, as I pointed out, there was a lot of activity in the financing of this year, basically based on the Delaware decision, which of course it's over and we've moved forward to it. And now, you're looking at &#x2013; if you look at it as a group &#x2013; if you look at as a group, we have a 1.2 times debt-to-EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So, I'll say, I mean, we've &#x2013; I mean, this is probably the most levered we'd been and we took advantage of the lower &#x2013; lowest &#x2013; historic lowest interest rates out there and we issue $1.5 billion at Southern Copper additionally. That was an opportunistic issuance. We were able to price within our curve and, at the same time, have a very comfortable, if you will, amortization schedule. If you look at amortization schedule, really, I mean, all the way to 2020, we only have $500 million. And from there, you go all the way to 2025 for $1 billion.</p>
          <p>So, although, it is a 1.2 times debt-to-EBITDA, the amortization schedule is very, very comfortable. And if you compare us to the rest of the mining industry, it is very different in terms of average tenure. And I'll say around 1 is where we like to be. I mean, now we're 1.2. The EBITDA is going to grow, et cetera. But I'll <mark type="ph" /> see that (50:39).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And if I may just &#x2013; hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just wanted to follow-up on, back on the CapEx for the Transportation Division, beyond 2014, is there &#x2013; how do you see that? Can you just tell us when and what would be like a normalized level just to &#x2013; this is a sharp increase versus a fast, just wondering, <mark type="ph" /> I was just &#x2013; (51:14) try to get a little bit more understanding on the long term, perhaps, for that division specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. I mean, first of all, again, kind of a disclaimer. I mean this is, as I commented, a five-year plan that we're working on and that means we're currently working on. We've kind of, like, presented it to the board. The board <mark type="ph" /> know (51:32) that the plan is fully completed, but &#x2013; and the numbers that I gave you is just like, I mean, ballpark figures that we're looking out for this five-year growth plan. But I mean, I'd be happy to let Isaac just comment again on the numbers and give you a little bit more of color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the CapEx for the next years, what we're thinking is we're going to be around this $500 million in order to increase our capacity. And probably in some of those years, we would need to buy some more motive power, so we'll buy some locomotives. And depending how the market will grow and &#x2013; well, the big scope is that the market will grow. Some of the commodities we're moving, we're going &#x2013; are growing. Some of the manufactured products are growing; automotive, intermodal. So, we expect a big growth and this is only ballpark figures. We need to go to the Board and detail all the projects we're having in our pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to complement and give you kind of like a benchmark, remember when we acquired or when the railroads were privatized in Mexico, only 8% of the cargo in Mexico was transported through this industry. Now, we've gotten all the way to 27.5%. And we think that that will even increase &#x2013; I mean, probably not to the levels of Canada and the U.S. but I mean it will keep on increasing. So, that's just to give you an idea of how this is expected to grow.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I'm sorry, perhaps, you have already mentioned, but I didn't get it okay. I understand that you mentioned $3.5 billion, lots of CapEx for this year and $3.6 billion of CapEx for 2014. And I just want to clarify that and know if you are including in this CapEx the Tia Maria project? How much of this CapEx is &#x2013; comes from the Tia Maria project guidance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me just give you the big picture CapEx for 2013. It's a little bit south of $2 billion for the Mining Division, $530 million for the Transportation Division, and $994 million, which is almost $1 billion, for the Infrastructure Division, Eugenia. And I'll let Raul comment on Tia Maria, probably just to give you, I mean, the status of the project for the benefit of everyone. But I believe there is no CapEx included for 2013 for Tia Maria. But go ahead, Raul. Jacob <mark type="ph" /> Raul (54:26) --</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much, Daniel. For 2013, we're including a small amount of the total expense that we believe should have Tia Maria. It's a $46 million. That is <mark type="ph" /> continuing (54:45) of having all the approvals through the year and being able to move forward with the project after that. The total budget of the project is close to $1 billion now. That's what the board approved. We will update that number as we move on in time and we get the approvals for the project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. For the Mining and Transportation segments, can you provide us levels of sustaining or ongoing CapEx for those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I will say the way we look at sustaining CapEx for the Mining Division, it includes, of course, replacement of equipment, pretty much in line with our depreciation and it's around $300 million. For the Infrastructure Division, I'll let Isaac comment on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Transportation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Transportation, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For the CapEx, as I said before, it mostly will be on constructions, on enlarging our existing sidings, building new yards, double tracks in some of the most-congested places, and <mark type="ph" /> no (56:24) motive power for this. Besides that, we're investing around $60 million in commercial projects, which are to support all the new manufacturing automotive plants that are coming into Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But I guess, Isaac, what he's asking is what would be just like a normalized kind of a sustained CapEx, excluding like this growth projects that we have. Just like &#x2013; kind of like the maintenance and sustainability of what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That should be around $150 million. The thing that we must not &#x2013; we must take a very good look is that most of the infrastructure we received 15 years ago from the railroad has been declining and the freight costs increasing year-by-year. So, we need to upgrade the infrastructures. Conditions have changed since 15 years ago and we need a very aggressive five-year program in order to put everything at the level required. After that, once we have all our network on modernized and with the capacity, with $150 million, we're going to be stabilizing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you also provide a little bit more detail on the rise in the interest income in the quarter? It looked like it was a much greater increase than the growth in the cash balance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And as I've mentioned earlier today that is just really the difference of the share price of Grupo Aeroportuario <mark type="ph" /> del (58:02) Pacifico, which during the periods that you're looking at went from MXN 47 per share to MXN 72.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks again. I have two more questions. The one is regarding the railroad business, which is &#x2013; which are the risks you're seeing ahead in terms of competition given the high concentration in the industry and government's initiatives to regulate some strategic sectors? And the last question would be regarding the <mark type="ph" /> jack-ups (58:52), which is the average free cash flow conversion of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, and regarding this concentration you're asking about, it's already been settled and we were you able to operate both companies. The network has been set since the privatization and we touch very different places. We go and we serve some of the ports and some of the terminals, some of the border crossings, and it's kind of complete different to the other companies that they provide a railroad service in Mexico. And this, <mark type="ph" /> as we said (59:35), early on since the privatization was set. So, we don't get to see. These were the rules that were set during the privatization and this was the real model. If you refer that some of the train the government has been announcing now probably &#x2013; they are only talking about passenger trains, which is a completely different. Our concessions are only to move freight by railroad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was referring more like if some players could enter the cargo railroad business in Mexico <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:15) --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that it will be very, very expensive, because we are in a concession and all the right of way was &#x2013; it's a concession and we're operating on a government-owned right of way. So, for a new company to come in and try to compete, he will have to buy a lot of land to compensate the 9,000 kilometers we're having in our network. So, we don't get to see new players coming into freight railroads by their own. All the railroad network have been concessioned by the government and have been operating for more than 15 years like that.</p>
