          <p>So good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for being here. We are happy to welcome you at AXA for this 1H '09 Earnings Release. Presenting today will be Henri de Castries, Denis Duverne, Kip Condron, and G&#xE9;rald Harlin. A Q&amp;A session will follow the presentation as usual.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Happy to be with you this morning, looks slightly better than in March, well &#x2013; or in February. You've seen the press release. The earnings for this first half are very solid, I think, and are showing the resilience of the model both on the revenue side, on the earning side, but also on the balance sheet side and we'll go further into more details.</p>
          <p>Four points which are important ones. First, recovery when compared with the second half of last year. Of course, if you compare the earnings with the first half of last year, they are declining, but it was a sort of different world. If you compare them with the second half of last year, you will see that there is a very strong recovery in underlying earnings, in adjusted, and also in net income.</p>
          <p>Second point, confirmation of the financial strengths of AXA. We know, we've seen, we've read that some of you had doubts about that. I think we've told you that we were confident. I think we are showing that we had good reasons to be confident. The balance sheet is strong, the debt is reasonable, and the solvency ratios are up.</p>
          <p>More important, customer base, there are a lot of companies out there in this turmoil, who because they've had some trouble, are losing their clients. It's not our case. The client base is stable or growing, you will see that. And we think that the attraction of AXA is stronger than ever, because we have been also doing some very active things to adapt to the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>And this is the last point. We have not stayed inactive. The reasons for which things are getting better is not only the fact that some of you may think that the worst is over for the world in general and the economy in particular, it's also because, as we've always done at AXA, because it's part of the DNA of the company, we've been reactive when confronted to issues.</p>
          <p>One of the illustrations of that is the U.S. situation, where we've had at the end of last year, some issues as we all know with the cost of the guarantees in variable annuities. You will see from the numbers today that it's now something which is under control. And by the way on that point, I'd like to say that the variable annuities are products which are offering good guarantees to the clients and those who were unconvinced will have seen that through this turmoil, the guarantees are helpful to the clients.</p>
          <p>Two years ago, we were flooded with articles explaining that these were not interesting products for the clients. I think they know &#x2013; they now know that this was wrong. So these are the four key points.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the earnings. Well, underlying earnings are at 2.1 billion, very significantly up when compared with the second half of last year, declining more than 20% when compared with the first half of last year. The recovery when compared to the second half, and Denis will explain that, is largely due to the fact that there is a very strong recovery in the Life business. Asset Management and P&amp;C, being slightly declining for P&amp;C and declining more significantly for Asset Management because of the level of the asset basis.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings are down when compared with the first half of last year, but significantly up when compared with the second. This is coming from the fact that we still had impairments, but to a lower level than before or than in the previous half.</p>
          <p>The net income is up very significantly, down when compared with the first half always. Where does this come from? It comes from the credit spread tightening, which &#x2013; I mean the enlargement of the spreads was, as you know, a problem at the end of last year. The retraction of the spreads is now working in our favor.</p>
          <p>Second point, financial strength, three elements: solvency, one, up six points, which means that the surplus we have over the regulatory minimum is now seven million. Second point, shareholders' equity increasing to 38.8 billion, this is mainly the reflection of the net income. Last but not least, that gearing moving down from 35 to 31%, some of it is seasonal, but not all of it. The financial debt is down to two billion overall.</p>
          <p>Customer base, revenues are slightly declining. They are still progressing in Property Casualty. They are declining in Life where the APEs are down. But you will see that the cash flows have remained very strong, because the redemptions have been going down significantly. In Property Casualty, even if the growth is lower than what it was last year, we continue to increase the number of our clients and we will discuss later the pricing situation which is uneven, but where we'll see some interesting developments.</p>
          <p>If you look at the inflows, 5.6 billion of positive cash flows in Life and Savings, 700,000 new clients in Property Casualty. There is one area where we have, I would say, less assets or less clients, it's Asset Management because of the outflows at AllianceBernstein mainly, where we have significant outflows on the institutional side. When we look at it, the feeling we have is that on the retail and on the private client side, it's stabilizing. On the institutional side, we think that &#x2013; and we hope that this will be stabilized towards the end of this year.</p>
          <p>One point I would like to add is Banking, plus 1.4 billion. This is not to tell you that we are entering into the famous world of bank assurance. No it's just the efforts we've been doing to develop a very simple banking proposition for our clients to pump in their money before transforming it into long-term life insurance deposits.</p>
          <p>It's a strategy which is working, because when clients are risk averse and when we have this proposition where you can offer them, let's say, short term deposits, it's a way to capture the money before transforming it into long-term products. This is working as we see for the first half, especially in Belgium and in France.</p>
          <p>Overall, if you look at the assets under management, still slightly declining, but starting to benefit from the relative improvement in the markets and if markets stay stable, we think that this is something we should, I would say, benefit from it.</p>
          <p>Next point, we have not stayed inactive. As I said, it's not just because the markets are slightly recovering and because the economy is probably or has probably avoided the worst that we are in better shape. We've been pretty active over the last semester. We have focused on profitability. We have taken some very strong actions to re-price and redesign some of the products. It's a case for variable annuities where the U.S. products have been re-priced and where the new generation of products is currently under development.</p>
          <p>We've been also re-pricing in P&amp;C, notably in the motor business where we see markets where the price increases are starting to flow through, like the U.K. There are other markets were the situation is slightly more uncertain, but we think overall it's going to go in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Second point; productivity efforts, they have not been negligible. If you look at the expense ratios they are down point &#x2013; two points in Property Casualty. They are stable in Life and Savings despite the fact that the volume of the business &#x2013; of the new business has gone down which means that we have been able to decrease costs accordingly.</p>
          <p>To give you some figures, in Life and Savings, 200 million of savings, essentially in the U.K. and in the U.S. In Asset Management, essentially at AllianceBernstein, approximately 100 million and we are, of course, going on with the program we have on the Property Casualty side on claims management, where we are saving approximately 300 million. So overall, quite active on the productivity efforts.</p>
          <p>Last but not least; risk management actions, which have been quite robust this &#x2013; for this half. So capital situation in the U.S. has been stabilized and we have, as you will see in the numbers, which are going to be detailed by Denis, repositioned the variable annuity funds and the cost of the hedging, which was a significant issue last year because of the basis risk and because of the volubility, is now an issue which is pretty well under control.</p>
          <p>So, what does this all tell us? Of course, neither AXA nor the insurance sector have been immune to the market environment. But I think we have demonstrated, if I may say, I think once more, because it was also the case in 2002, 2003, the capacity of AXA because of its business model to act quickly and to take the necessary actions, all this based on a very solid and resilient business model.</p>
          <p>We have preserved a very solid balance sheet. You can look at it from a solvency standpoint. You can look at it from an asset quality standpoint. I think we've been able to manage the business quite efficiently. Look at the actions we have taken to adjust the product range. Look at the expense management initiatives.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from the trust of the customers, which in these periods, is very important. The brand is not only undamaged, I think, the brand is stronger than two years ago and is reflected by the customer satisfaction index. It's also reflected to a certain extent by the positive inflows.</p>
          <p>If we look forward, I think we are well positioned whatever happens. I think we have demonstrated our capacity to resist the storm. If the storm were to happen again, we are comfortable. Nobody knows what the second half is going to be. I mean there could be some further uncertainty on the economic front. If it's the case, we are prepared and we are safe.</p>
          <p>If the economy starts to rebound, we are prepared too. Meaning, we have a combination of defensive and offensive characteristics, which I think make us quite attractive. This is due to the business mix, because property casualty, protection, health are defensive businesses with very solid margins. Investments and savings, and asset management are offensive businesses, having a very significant capacity to rebound when things will go better.</p>
          <p>So, I think we are well positioned and if you look at the long-term prospects of the sector, I don't think they've changed. I don't think this industry is going to be a declining industry. We are in a world where nearly everybody, both in major and in emerging countries, will have to save more, will be looking for guarantees, and will be looking for protection for assets. This is not a world we dislike. This is a world which is going to be attractive to us.</p>
          <p>So overall, solid numbers even if you still can see the impact of the turmoil, and Denis will detail more on the various elements of the business. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning to everyone. I will go through the key elements of our earnings and balance sheet. So on slide 13, you see that our earnings have come down 26% compared to the first half of last year. This is due to basically all segments of the activity. But they rebounded very sharply from the second half of '08 and this is largely due to rebounds in the Life and Savings segment.</p>
          <p>I will just comment here on two segments that I will not come back on later. International insurance, a decrease of the earnings which is largely due to the non-repeat of a tax one-off in our discontinued P&amp;C business. The AXA Corporate Solutions business, the ongoing business is work &#x2013; is running, has a good performance. It was hit by the crash of the Air France flight, but the cost of that was 20 million because we have usually a fairly low retention on major catastrophes.</p>
          <p>And on the holding segment, you see a deterioration of the position which is largely due to the increase in financing costs coming from the three acquisitions we made in '08: Mexico, Russia, and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Going now to the Life and Savings segments, our Life and Savings earnings came down 16% year-on-year. The three main drivers of that are the margin on assets which came down 22% or roughly 600 million. This is due both to the unit-linked parts, because of lower average assets under management by 18%, and to &#x2013; also to the general accounts parts largely due to the fact that on the equity piece, we had lower dividends because all the companies reduced their dividends, so there is a slight margin squeeze in the general account which we believe is temporary.</p>
          <p>Technical margin went up 85%, so it's an increase of 500 million and there are three pieces there, the performance on the hedging in the U.S. which gave us 200 million, a one-off from the U.K. annuity company which gave us 200 million, and other &#x2013; I mean, good guys &#x2013; good developments on mortality/morbidity and other especially in France for the rest.</p>
          <p>Expenses went up 6%, which is a bit counterintuitive. Admin expenses went up only 2%, which is more what you would expect. Acquisition expenses went up 10% essentially due to higher DAC amortization, which offsets the technical margin gains to some extent, and tax was a positive 100 million, so in total a negative 200 million in the underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>On P&amp;C, earnings came down 12%, compared to the first half of last year. The combined ratio went up 1.7 points to 98%. This is slightly less than the natural events, which represented 2.1 points. The main natural event was the cloud storm which hit the south of France and the north of Spain, but there were also a number of smaller weather events in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our current year loss ratio increased by 1.6 points, because of &#x2013; I mean the fact that prices have been under pressure. We had the slight increase in the frequency and a few other elements, and prior reserve developments gave us a positive two points. Although the reserve ratio, reserve to premium ratio was flat at 198%, which means that we didn't in any significant way reduce the strength of our reserving position in P&amp;C.</p>
          <p>Our expense ratio went down 0.2 points. This does not translate into euros because our premium amounts went up, and tax and other was a positive 100 million, so in total, reduction of slightly more than &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>On Asset Management, this is where the big drop came, a drop of 42% to &#x2013; I mean which is largely a result of the market effects. Asset Management revenue is down 34%, because of lower average assets under management by 26% and also lower fees because of unfavorable business mix with equities representing only 38% against 48% in the first half of last year only due to market effect.</p>
          <p>Expenses were driven down quite substantially by expense reduction programs in our two asset managers. Expenses went down 20%, but not enough to mitigate the impact of lower revenues. We have a positive tax impact on the AllianceBernstein side, and so the net negative is slightly more than 100 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings went down 50% compared to last year &#x2013; first half of last year and went up quite sharply. What happened on the adjusted earnings, first, our realized capital gains came down substantially because, as you saw, our annualized capital gains at year-end were quite low.</p>
          <p>Our impairments were close to what they were in the first half, but obviously much smaller than they were in the second half at 691 million. Of that, roughly half is equities. So much less than what we had in the backlog at year-end because of the rebound of the BNP Paribas shares, and we had also a few other impairments: on the bond side, the biggest one is CIT for roughly 50 million. We had also private equity and real estate impairments to add up to a total of 691.</p>
          <p>The hedging of our equity portfolio gave us a little &#x2013; a small positive element of 71 million, which is &#x2013; could be expected because markets were relatively flat. We unwound many of our hedges close to the trough of the markets, a bit ahead of that, so we still have a positive element for the equity &#x2013; for the hedging of the equity portfolio and this leads to the 1.7 billion of adjusted.</p>
          <p>Net income went down 38%, a sharp recovery as Henri indicated against the second half of last year. The three key or three main elements I want to comment on are the positive impact of the tightening of credit spreads, as expected, which gives us 309 million. We have a negative coming from the private equity portfolio, which came down, I think, 17% roughly in value negative &#x2013; sorry, 13 &#x2013; sorry, 13% negative of 290 million. And we also have the impact of the hedging of the statutory balance sheet in the U.S., for lack of a better word, for 220 million, so in total, that's gives us the 1.3 billion that I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Solvency now. Our solvency gained six points. This is probably what you should have expected because the earnings contribution was ten points. We had indicated that on the run rate of last year we would have gained 18, so we are gaining 10 in the first half, offset by financial market impacts for four points, so that gives us 133. And on the Solvency II, on the basis of the QIS4, we also gained to 155% of solvency on a Solvency II basis, but as you know, QIS4 is not the final parameters for the Solvency II calculation.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity went up 1.4 billion to 38.8. The unrealized capital gains on the balance sheet have moved from a negative of 0.4 to a positive of 0.6. Off-balance sheet, our unrealized capital gains on real estate went down, so the off-balance sheet element is down 900 million. So all in all, it's almost a wash between what's on the balance sheet and what's off balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our debts came down 2.1 billion compared to year-end '08. This allowed us to reduce our commercial paper program. As you saw, we also issued one billion of senior debts close to the end of June. Our debt gearing has come down to 31%. Our interest cover has also slightly come down. This decrease of debt is in part seasonal, because of taxes. We receive taxes from our operating subsidiaries before we pay taxes to the treasury. But we are &#x2013; I think, we're quite comfortable with this, the way we &#x2013; our debt is managed.</p>
          <p>Now moving quickly to the asset portfolio, our general account portfolio is fairly stable overall, with a little bit of positive cash flow and slight decline in the market values overall. Fixed income was increased by 10 million at 310 million.</p>
          <p>We invested in govies, in fact, by reducing the amount of CDS positions by six billion. We had sale of listed equities for about &#x20AC;1 billion, lower cash because of collateral and the hedging of the VA program.</p>
          <p>The corporate bond values have come up a little bit. The asset-based securities values have come down a little bit from 69% of par to 66% of par. And real estate &#x2013; and private equity was down 13% as mentioned earlier and real estate down 6% overall, essentially concentrated on the French portfolio as you can see in the appendices.</p>
          <p>As you know, we don't give an embedded value update at the half year. We believe that if we had calculated it, it would have been up. However, we do give an update on the new business value and the margin. Our margin eroded a little bit from 14% to 13.7%.</p>
          <p>The main factors are positive element on business mix due to the repricing actions that we have taken, slightly offset on the French side by the fact that the proportion of unit-linked is coming down. We had the negative impact of expenses because our new business came down hence we didn't fully offset that by reduction of expenses. Market conditions are negative, 1.3 points because interest rates were lower than the first half of '08. And forex and other give us a positive 0.6 points.</p>
          <p>I hand &#x2013; now hand over to Kip Condron. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. Good morning. Underlying earnings in the U.S. improved substantially particularly from the fourth quarter although down from the first half of last year. Most of the change is due to the effects of the hedging program, and just to take you back to the fourth quarter to look at what happened there, first of all from a basis standpoint, we were offering at the time about 63 funds, the whole collection of money managers, almost all of whom underperformed their benchmark, many by as much as 1000 basis points. So our basis risk costs in the fourth quarter were dramatic.</p>
          <p>In order to mitigate that, we repositioned over $30 billion worth of funds much of which into index and enhanced index. It took a better part of the fourth quarter and the early part of the first quarter to accomplish that because we had to get Fund Board approvals to implement that, but today, all of those assets are repositioned, and as a result, the basis performance in the first half of the year, as you can see was very strong, particularly relative to the performance in the first quarter where January and February &#x2013; February and March actually look very much like the fourth quarter in terms of market performance.</p>
          <p>So the actions we've taken on basis, for our modeling, if 2008 were to occur all over again, we would have eliminated about two-thirds of the total basis cost through the actions that we've taken.</p>
          <p>The second key painful event was the reaction of volatility in the fourth quarter. We priced a product at the ninety-fifth percentile for volatility, historically which is around 23%. In October, volatility was 80% and in November it was 75%. Obviously, volatility has come down substantially and today it's very close to where we'd originally priced the product.</p>
          <p>So, and then the final thing was that we repositioned the interest rate hedging to U.S. Treasury futures, which also was helpful from a hedging standpoint. So, we're much more comfortable today that all of the actions that we've taken particularly on the existing book of business, create an environment that allows our hedging program to be managed very effectively even under a stress scenario.</p>
          <p>From a margin standpoint, one of the difficulties in the U.S. is you got 50 states that have to approve any changes you make to products. So getting product changes made quickly is very challenging. We were much more aggressive then the rest of the market. Starting back in November, we reduced our roll-up rate from 6.5 to 6%, we took the guaranteed withdrawal benefit product off the market, we increased pricing, and we were lowered the annuitization rate. That was the first action that we took.</p>
          <p>By the time we were able to implement that, it was clear that we had to take further actions and so, in February, we reintroduced the product with a 5% roll-up rate and we limited substantially the fund lineup, mostly with a focus on asset allocation funds that were mostly indexed.</p>
          <p>And then in June, we introduced the accumulator '09 where we have a 5% roll-up rate. We have put predominantly allocation funds in what we're calling guided open architecture, which basically means that on more actively managed funds, we have a limited selection and we limit the amount that you can put into any one fund or any one category, all of which forces the balance to be at least, or I should say, no more than 70% equities.</p>
          <p>On a new business value standpoint, again moving products is pretty difficult in the U.S. We had a lapse protection rider guarantee on our life protection products and basically because of interest rates, we removed that product from the marketplace in January. It took a while to get it off the market. That created the negative new business value stream in the first quarter, and today, all the products that we have in the marketplace have good new business value characteristics.</p>
          <p>From a capital standpoint, '08 was the perfect storm. We have a substantial position in AllianceBernstein stock. The stock went from $75 to $20 during the course of the year, actually dipped lower in the fourth quarter, which created a $3 billion reduction in our capital position in the U.S. Additionally, the increase in variable annuity reserves net of hedging created a need for $1 billion of capital.</p>
          <p>So the Group, as you know, contributed $3 billion of capital to the U.S, but it was split $1 billion to AXA Equitable and $2 billion to Bermuda where we moved a large number of the GMxB product, I guess you can say; we moved a lot of the GMxB product to Bermuda. That transaction by the way was something we anticipated doing in '07, to complete in '08. It really wasn't driven at all by market conditions, but rather in order to create efficient reserving balance between our U.S requirements and Bermuda requirements, and to ease the transition to VA carvum which we're in a very good position for &#x2013; in '09 and into '10.</p>
          <p>And so, our year end capital risk based capital was 332%, mid year '09 directionally in the same position. We put a lot of actions in place on the capital side. We put downside protection in place on the market. So, we have a substantial amount of comfort if the market should decline substantially.</p>
          <p>We have lower sensitivity to AllianceBernstein because we moved or sold a fair amount of those shares to other entities in the Group, and the share price obviously has stabilized. So we don't anticipate any capital needs this year and as we look forward to 2010 based upon our modeling, we don't anticipate needing capital then either.</p>
          <p>From a sales and distribution standpoint, first of all in the U.S., '09 is a very funny year. First of all, on the variable annuity side, you've got products coming off the market, being replaced by products that are less attractive. So as the product comes off the market, you end up with a fire sale, no matter who the carrier is. And so, market share numbers quarter-to-quarter are all over the place on the variable annuity side.</p>
          <p>On the Life side, Life sales in the first quarter in the U.S. were down about 27% for the first time ever. And so, from a variable annuity standpoint, we &#x2013; our sales have been down, but I think fairly consistent. We have new product on the marketplace that's been out for a month. These take time to ramp up, but we're increasing our sales in the product every single day. And on the Life side, our Life suite of products were very competitive particularly in the term area, and sales of that product are very, very strong.</p>
          <p>From a retail standpoint, one of the great assets that we have at AXA Equitable is our retail sales force of 6,000 captive agents. And their production tends to be much more consistent than third-party salespeople tend to be. So, for example in the first half of the year, variable annuity sales in the U.S. were down 25%. In our retail sector, they were only down 17%, and that's the kind of consistency that we've had consistently with that business.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have a very strong 403(b) business which basically is a business of selling tax-sheltered annuities to teachers. We have 1,000 of those 6,000 agents that are dedicated to that business. It's a great growth opportunity for us. It's been a great solid business for us.</p>
          <p>Sales are actually up about four or 5% year-to-date and that's because basically you have a lot of wounded competitors in the U.S., particularly VALIC, part of AIG and ING's business, both of which have been opportunities for us to grow our market share. So that's a great business for us, and one that we anticipate growing substantially as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Looking at the future, variable annuities, Henri mentioned the fact that we are convinced that variable annuities are viable and guarantees are needed. I think that most of the information on the slide you already know, but we've reaffirmed our research. The clients now, more than ever, want guarantees. They're really more risk averse than ever. They're scared because of what they've been through in the markets recently. And they're starting to get worried about inflation.</p>
          <p>So, we're in the process of developing a new suite of products in the variable annuity sector which we would have &#x2013; begin to have in the marketplace towards the end of the year or very early in '10. And basically what we're looking at is thinking about clients' needs, thinking about the fact that people are worried about inflation. We're going to structure an adjustable rate rollup product which will have a floor and a ceiling, but basically if inflation rises and interest rates rise, clients will be able to get a better rollup rate and ultimately a better withdrawal rate.</p>
          <p>From our perspective, it's a much more efficient product from a hedging standpoint and one that new business value would be quite strong on. So, we are very optimistic about that. This product as we've designed it, from an investment standpoint, has two sides to it. One is a non-guaranteed side, which would have very aggressive money managers offered option to grow assets in the tax sheltered annuity side of the product, and then clients could move assets over to the guaranteed side which would have a lesser, probably more like a 60/40 equity position and guarantees going out into the future. So we think the product has very strong characteristics and great opportunities.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's a great opportunity for the business of variable annuities in the U.S., we're &#x2013; we are in the process of wondering when taxes are going to be raised, personal income taxes are going to be raised. And when taxes do go up, the tax sheltered feature variable annuities again will be very attractive for the first time in probably 10 or 15 years, because today dividends are only taxed at 15% and capital gains are only taxed at 15%, but if they go up to ordinary income rates which most people anticipate, the tax sheltered feature; or think of it this way, a mutual fund in a tax wrapper; is going to become a business again that will be very attractive. So we are designing products to meet that need.</p>
          <p>Finally on AllianceBernstein, Henri mentioned that from a &#x2013; from a fund decline basis, we're feeling a lot more comfortable about the retail withdrawals. We're feeling much more comfortable about the private client, both of those we think will turn neutral to positive probably in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Institutional withdrawals continue, but they seem to be slowing a little bit, predominately because performance has improved dramatically, particularly in value and in fixed income and even growth has begun to show some significant improvements. All of that's happening under our new CEO Peter Kraus, we've begun to add other sources of revenues. We've been very successful and aggressive with the U.S. government with TALF money and PPIP money. We are also introducing a real estate investment trust in September, all of which will generate incremental revenues from alternative sources at the same time that we're building the core business. So I think that that's moving along in a very &#x2013; in a very positive way. Expenses are under aggressive management there and I would say that we are very pleased with the way things are going.</p>
          <p>I'll stop there and turn things back over to Henri.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. This is Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Some questions for Kip really on the VA business. Firstly, on numbers, you're targeting this 20% plus new business margin on the new product. Does &#x2013; I just want to understand how that comes through into earnings? Does lower realized volatility right now mean that you get a better, quicker payback into IFRS earnings of that? That's question number -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Volatility is a very &#x2013; it is a part of the intrinsic value calculation and we basically take the actual new business value on any product as it's booked, actual volatility at the time is part of the calculation. At the time that we estimate, we're basically estimating volatility. One thing I forgot to mention, with the new products that we have out in the marketplace, we put a volatility management tool inside the product where basically as volatility starts to increase, we'll be raising cash in the portfolios. I think there is two outcomes to that. One, clients will get a better risk adjusted return, and secondly we will substantially reduce our exposure to volatility expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a sort of follow-on from that. I mean, how quickly will we see the margins in IFRS earnings improving from your re-pricing action?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're already improving. They've improved in the second quarter as you can see from the slides and they'll continue to improve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you need to take into account the fact that we write our new business, but we have a significant in-force book. So the translation into our underlying earnings of this re-pricing on the new products will come over several periods because of the relative size of new business versus the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, to get on to my second question. How realistic is it to assume that the competitive landscape sort of remains attractive? We've seen from the U.S. life insurance reporting that some are just really retreating operationally and some are still getting great flows coming in and competing and seeing opportunities. How long is that going to last and when do you think your flows will start ramping up, if ever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got a very intriguing changing landscape. In 2007, the top 10 players in variable annuities represented 72% of all sales. Five of those top 10 players have had some major adjustments, two have taken TALP money in the U.S., one has taken Dutch government money. You've got Pacific who has basically priced themselves out of the market, and you've got Manulife who basically have said that they're going to play in annuities, but they're not quite sure how, or at least they haven't announced how.</p>
          <p>So, five of the top 10 players are a very big question mark about how they're playing in the marketplace. So, you have a lot change going on in the marketplace. We're a little in front of the market in terms of our risk management, have been during all of '09. But I think that the thing you have to keep in mind is that the demand for the products is higher now than it's ever been and the capacity is finite. And so even though there may be competitors in the marketplace that have &#x2013; have better offers and are viewing risk management differently than we are, they can't take all the business. And so, we're fairly confident that as markets stabilize through, hopefully, the last half of this year, you'll see more consistent returns.</p>

          <p>Nick Holmes at Nomura. I wanted to ask about P&amp;C. There's quite a lot of interesting stuff going on here, I wondered if you could talk us through why the current year loss ratio rose by 1.6%? And what the outlook is going forward?</p>
          <p>Also, wondered if you could talk us through the outlook for reserve releases. When I say this is interesting, I don't mean it's bad, by the way. I'm just interested in your outlook for P&amp;C. And with reserve releases, if you can talk us through where you think we are in the cycle and what's going to happen going forward?</p>
          <p>Then, second question just following-up from what Farooq was asking about VAs, how worried are you about the fairly aggressive behavior of MetLife and Lincoln in the VA market at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Denis, do you want to take the P&amp;C and Kip the other one please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I will take the P&amp;C question, Nick. So in our current year loss ratio, we had, as I said, a combination of natural events for 2.1 points, and I mean basically deterioration of performance for 1.6 points other than natural events. So this is clearly something that drew our attention. I believe that's the &#x2013; this is coming from two, I mean, not talking about natural events, but the other deterioration. It's coming from two elements, first, as we were expecting price increases and they didn't come through. They came through in &#x2013; to some extent in the U.K., certainly in Ireland and Canada. But in the rest of Europe, they didn't come through as we expected, and particularly in Spain and in Germany and to some extent in Italy, we saw prices decline.</p>
          <p>We expect prices &#x2013; the price situation to improve somewhat in the second half, but we are &#x2013; but there is clearly a recession impact here and we are not completely sure that we'll be able to see that coming through as early as the second half. So &#x2013; I mean, clearly a little bit of disappointment on the current year performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of prior year positive developments, I would say two things. First we have always told you and we show you again this time that we reserve the currency on a conservative basis and you should be used to seeing AXA having positive prior reserve developments, and this is again the case this year. So that's a fact.</p>
          <p>However, as we told you already, I think, six months ago, we &#x2013; I mean, there is a cycle effect to that which is that as the prices come down as they have in the past two or three years, this proportion of prior reserve development should, at some point, level off and we expect those prior reserve developments to probably decrease in '10 compared to '09. So the outlook is &#x2013; remains positive for '09 but could be less positive for '10, and we hope that price increases will compensate that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So where we are in the cycle? I think I have largely addressed that. Some positive signs in some territories and signs that are &#x2013; I mean we probably will be slightly ahead of the market in increasing prices, and we see good signs coming in some of the territories that I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>Clearly Italy, the situation was quite bad in the first half, and price &#x2013; we have increased prices already twice this first half. Germany, and France also, we are putting up our price &#x2013; we're putting our prices up, in Switzerland as well, in Belgium as well. Germany is a little bit &#x2013; Germany and Spain are probably the two territories where we are not quite sure that we are going to be able to increase prices in the second half, but the market will have eventually to adjust.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, how worried are we about aggressive behaviors in competitors in the variable annuity space in the U.S? I guess the first comment I'd make is that all business isn't good business, and so you can get all the market share you want if you want to price aggressively. We think that we're priced appropriately, and we're comfortable with where our product is positioned. We're starting to see sales ramp up. The product has only been in the marketplace for a month.</p>
          <p>Short answer, from time to time, you see aberrant behavior in all markets and ultimately these things don't last, and sometimes it feels a little uncomfortable when you're watching the market share numbers, but if you remind yourself that all business isn't good business, you get a little more comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a very, very quick follow-up to Denis' answer &#x2013; with P&amp;C pricing and this claims inflation that we're getting, is it, do you think, due to the mutuals in France and Germany that we're seeing pricing lag? I mean, we're seeing &#x2013; this is an industry phenomenon. It's certainly not just you. What &#x2013; where would you say it's coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly, there is a big element which is the recession, which &#x2013; I mean, the recession has an impact on commercial lines because the sums to be insured are coming down. And it's an &#x2013; it has an impact on the claims patterns because we have more &#x2013; I mean, there is a bigger risk of having house on fire of companies that are close to going under, all those kinds of things. But you are right to point out that there are in a number of countries in Europe, you have large &#x2013; I mean, reasonably well-run mutuals which have a very low expense ratio like HUK-Coburg in Germany or Macfrey in Spain, that are able to maintain their prices relatively low without suffering from a combined ratio perspective. So it creates an additional pressure on us to get our &#x2013; I mean, to get our cost of claims down and to be more and more effective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Garner from HSBC. First question, again for Kip. How can you or do you intend to reduce your exposure to the U.S. regulatory ratchet? Here I am talking about VA products and the fact that it can take anywhere between six to nine months to modify prices and products features on products that are suddenly uneconomic?</p>
          <p>The second question, a little bit left field here, but how feasible is it for you to offer simple VA style guarantees for profit with an existing 401(k) Plan asset, you know, the fact that there is three trillion of assets, vast majority are naked equity exposure surely if the demand for guarantees is on the up then there may be an opportunity here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the first part, if I understood the question on how can we be responsive to the market when it takes so long to change products? That really inhibited us during 2008 and early 2009. Today we are very comfortable with the product we have in the marketplace. Don't anticipate. We have flexibility to change the pricing on the roll up rate in the product without having to re-file the product because of the way that we did it. So it makes it a lot easier for us if rates change up or down.</p>
          <p>The other factor is that the product that we anticipate bringing out at year-end will have an adjustable rate that will, as we see it, allow that product to sit in the marketplace where we can change the product without having to re-file it. So we've gotten a lot more thoughtful about how to do that.</p>
          <p>In terms of 401(k) market, it's a huge market. We're very intrigued with it. We've being doing an awful lot of work particularly together with AllianceBernstein to determine how to enter that market with some form of guarantee. We've been working on it for probably year and a half. We think we are very close to having a model that will work for the client, work for us, work for the asset manager and so I would just say stay tuned on that score.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Johnny Vona from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of quick questions. Just in terms of dividends, can you give us any sort of view on dividend guidance? And just a question in terms of the U.S. business. The reinsurance arrangement that you have in Bermuda, would we assume that's designed for AG 43 and therefore we won't have any impact on reserving towards the end of the year for 2009?</p>
          <p>And the second thing is in terms of the markets going up, do we expect both the capital and reserves to be released and therefore some flexibility in dividends from U.S. subsidiaries back to the holding company? Thanks.</p>

          <p>The dividend prospect for the Group. We are not, I would say, making forecasts. I mean we have stated the policy in the past. The second half of last year has told us that this is something where you need to remain cautious. Having said that, we are comfortable with the business. So we'll see what it gives at the end of the year but I'm not going to be more precise on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we again &#x2013; we don't, as Henri said, we don't forecast or don't give forecast for that. We said that, I think in the presentation, that we didn't need to increase the capital this year. I mean we don't want to be a hostage to fortune and we'll not make forecasts for 2010.</p>

          <p>Andreas de Groot Van Embden, Cazenove. Just coming back to your capital structure in the U.S. Given your large exposure to AllianceBernstein, I just wondered whether in the current environment you think this capital structure makes sense, and if so why, what are the benefits of this capital structure? And you mentioned on your slide 27 that you are starting to partially reallocate your AllianceBernstein stake within AXA? I just wondered whether this is just a Bermuda stake that has move to AXA investment management or whether you've also moved stake &#x2013; your stake within AXA Equitable Life within the Group and how is that being funded? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; the question of whether it makes sense or not is a bit moot because that's how it was built from the outside because, as you know, AllianceBernstein and Alliance Capital initially was a spin-off of DLJ and grew under the umbrella of the insurance company in the U.S. and somehow what happened in the first part of this decade was that the run up in the share price of AllianceBernstein was a benefit to AXA Equitable and to AXA in that it funded all the capital requirements that allowed us to both increase the business tremendously during between 2000 and 2008 and paid dividend to the holding company.</p>
          <p>We have the flip side of that in 2008 with the share price of AllianceBernstein moving from 80 to $20. And we have realized, I mean, we were conscious of that but it was a benefit and we probably didn't care enough. We are conscious of that situation and we've started to reallocate the shares to other parts of the Group.</p>
          <p>There are some limitations to that which are taxes because we have a very low tax basis for the AllianceBernstein shares and we've tried to do that while &#x2013; minimizing the tax impact of that. And this is something that we will manage over time and we will not give you a detailed map of where all the different parts of the subsidiaries are located within the Group. But it's an issue that we have benefited from until '07, suffered from in '08 and we're managing that through going forward.</p>

          <p>Hello, it's Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. Three areas that I wanted to explore. Firstly that you've made very few comments on the return on investment on your acquisitions from last year. I was wondering how they're going? Secondly, developments on Solvency II, where does AXA see the debate about liquidity premiums or using the government bond yield to reference risk freeze. And thirdly, what is AXA's approach to your Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 bank debt? Are you actively looking to pull out of that area and accept offers from banks looking to buy back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first one. Denis will take the second one. G&#xE9;rald will take the third one. Comment on the acquisitions of last year, let's say so far so good. The two significant acquisitions of last year where Russia and Mexico; well you could add to that Ukraine which is much smaller but nevertheless significant. The three countries have been affected by the recession but from what we see in the operations we are very satisfied with what we have.</p>
          <p>In Russia, the company's very well run company technically. I have been there for a couple of days, a few weeks ago. They are clearly benefiting from the fact that their assets were sound ones which is not the case for each and every company in Russia as you may imagine. Of course, the new business is not what it used to be given the fact that you have less new cars being sold in the Russian market but we are very comfortable with the fact that this was the right pick. Not necessarily at the best moment in terms of timing and pricing given the fact that we did just before the turmoil. But long-term from a technical standpoint, it's a very sound company. We're very happy with the stake we have in it.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, the team we have there is doing a very good job to improve the company. Very clearly P&amp;C was not the favorite business of ING. It's probably the reason for which it's sold to us. And from what we see, we are at least very well aligned with what was the initial plan. So, it's fine.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Ukraine, which is an interesting case because it's a country which lot of people are discounting, we are now &#x2013; I mean it's &#x2013; as you know, it's a venture with BNP which puts us in a very significant position in the Ukrainian market and we have a very decisive competitive advantage for two reasons. First, I would say the financial strength which is not the case of every player. Second the fact that we pay claims which in Ukraine is a decisive competitive advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add &#x2013; if I may to add to that, yes, two things first. The three big acquisitions were as Henri said Mexico and Russia plus Turkey. In Turkey we are number one in P&amp;C and we are &#x2013; we represent between 80 and 120% of the profits of the P&amp;C market in Turkey. But to go back to your precise question, Andrew, those acquisitions in the emerging markets were done at prices where the return on investment initially is lower.</p>
          <p>Mexico was money losing when we bought it. We made a small profit in '08 which was unexpected. We are going to make a slightly bigger profit in '09 but I don't believe that will have a return on investments in line with our overall return on investment before 2012. So &#x2013; and we are ahead of our plan but this &#x2013; for those acquisitions in emerging markets you have necessarily a turnaround to execute and this is what we are &#x2013; this is what we are doing.</p>
          <p>On Solvency II &#x2013; so those acquisitions will be dilutive as expected. On Solvency II, we &#x2013; I mean I think the industry is fairly well aligned on the issue. CEIOPS has advised the European Commission that the discount rates to be used should be the government's bond rate.</p>
          <p>The industry is a quite well-aligned now in both CFO Forum and CRO Forum and the CEA to suggest &#x2013; recommend strongly to the Commissiona  that liquidity premium should be &#x2013; net equity premium should be adjusted &#x2013; added to the discount rate. It's going to be a decision made by the European Commission not by CEIOPS because this is going to be part of the Level II implementation measures. At this stage, we are not sure that we will prevail on that one but we are &#x2013; we've made our case quite strongly and we are going to make it in writing I believe in September when the comments are due.</p>

          <p>Good morning .Duncan Russell from J.P. Morgan. First question is could you just comment a bit further on your comments about the debt being seasonal, the reduction in debt? And it looks specifically like the commercial paper program fell by about 3.5 billion. So can you just talk about that program, what it's used for?</p>
          <p>And second question is the Solvency I ratio: on my numbers it looks like you &#x2013; either the pension contribution or the admissible assets, locally admissible assets increased by about 4.5 billion, is that correct? And if so, what was it? And that was it actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the first question and maybe we need more explanation in the second, because I didn't understand what it was...</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have the seasonality effect on our debt as we mentioned. We &#x2013; roughly speaking our debt dropped by two billion and with some of our &#x2013; some of the seasonality effect, seasonality effect is due to the tax, that means that we have tax which is paid by our subsidiaries; they reimbursed some tax and at the same time we have, we will have to pay tax later in the year.</p>
          <p>So that's most of the &#x2013; that's the explanation. And there are some seasonality effects that &#x2013; so we can expect the debt to be lower at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on your second question, Duncan, I believe what I understood and you will correct me, if I am wrong, is that, you said that we benefited from the admissibility of assets that were not considered admissible at year end, that's &#x2013; this is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is correct. Okay. And what were the assets...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What were the &#x2013; could you provide some color on the assets, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, for example, Zinmur reserves. Question at the back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Andrew Ritchie from Citadel. Sort of linked to that, actually I just wanted a bit more color behind the cash flow statement in the appendix? It looks like &#x2013; just clarify, there is a large increase in consolidated solvency requirements of two billion, but there's a capital optimization more than offsetting that of three billion. Could you just do color behind that? I am quite surprised at the size of both of those numbers in the half year particularly relative to the experience of last year? I think it's page 23 of the appendix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, I believe your question relates to the minus two billion in first half relative to the increase in consolidation solvency and the capital optimization of 3.1. So, as far as the minus two increase in solvency requirements are concerned, it corresponds to the '08 capital requirements and in '08 maybe you remember that we mentioned to use that end of Solvency I framework as a capital requirement for VAs went up from one to 4%. So that's back of the 2%, minus two billion '08 capital requirement.</p>
          <p>As far as the capital optimization is concerned, it's two reasons, first one corresponds to the tax delay and the lag effect on the tax as I explained before, and the second corresponding to the loans from some of our subsidiaries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. So &#x2013; of the three billion, how much &#x2013; both sound quite temporary then.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so tax corresponds roughly to 0.5 billion</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, that's something we don't plan to unwind it in the second part of the year. We will see, it will depend on the capacity of the Group to realize some additional &#x2013; some cash flows and it will depend. So we can not answer for the time being. Our capacity is exactly the same question as before when somebody, some of you asked about the capacity of the U.S. to pay dividend? So, it is the same. So we will see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be clear Duncan, we didn't say that all of the reduction in the debt was due to seasonality, we said partly due to seasonality. This is to manage your expectation and not be tied to a number that can move slightly up or down depending on many factors. But there is an element of seasonality, not all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just wanted to clear &#x2013; so just to be clear of the two billion, part of that is sort of lag timing effect from increased capital requirements during 2008, is that &#x2013; how we should understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The timing effect corresponds to the 3.1. So the timing effect, out of the 3.1 of timing effects, we have &#x2013; of capital optimization, we have 0.5 corresponding to the tax. This tax corresponding to a timing effect and also some internal loans corresponding to 2.5 billion. And as far as the minus two are concerned which is a previous line, there is no seasonality effects, that's due to the '08 increase of requirement coming from the U.S due to the fact that the capital requirement moved up from 1.5 &#x2013; from 1% to 4%</p>

          <p>Thanks, thanks very much. Blair Stewart from Bank of America -Merrill Lynch. Two questions, the first is just on the impact of the average asset levels. I think you've given sensitivity in the slides and you've talked about it before, but can you comment or give any indication where you think the average level of assets is now relative to the average in the first half of the year and what impact that might have on earnings going into the second half?</p>
          <p>And second question is just the guidance on the adjusted earnings line, what to expect in between the underlying and adjusted earnings in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And I'll throw in a third one, which is just going back to the dividend guidance, I'm assuming that the decision not to pay 40% of adjusted earnings as a minimum last year should be regarded as exceptional.</p>

          <p>If you compare the equity level &#x2013; the equity markets level at the end of &#x2013; at the end of June and today, it's roughly 10%. So you can make the &#x2013; you can make your own math.

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds a simple question, but it's quite difficult because you need to know the sort of daily averaging of your own assets over the first half of the year and how that evolves in the second half of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&gt;: Average assets for the first half of the year were lower than the assets at the end of the first half. So I think you have those two data points. So then you can do your maths based on that.</p>
          <p>On the adjusted earnings, the only comment that I would make is that, as I said in the presentation, the impairments in the first half on the equity side were lower than the lag that we had at your end because of the improvement in the BNP Paribas shares. We still have a lag effect at the end of the first half of roughly &#x20AC;200 million. So if markets were to stay at the level of the end of the first half, we would still have &#x20AC;200 million of equity impairments in the second half. And I don't think I can give you any further guidance on the adjusted earnings than that. On the dividend guidance...</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Rob Haines, JPMorgan. Can you just comment a bit more on the 165 million one-off gain on the U.K. annuity portfolio? What exactly that is? It's an internal gain, I gather. Can more of these internal gains be achieved or does an external player &#x2013; can an external player help you achieve these. In other words, can you sell the back book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you buying it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, I will take a part of the question and maybe my U.K. colleagues can add if I'm going in the wrong direction. This all comes out of the SLAS, which is a Sun Life Assurance Society &#x2013; With Profits portfolio, which is a portfolio where we've stopped writing new business in 2002, other than increments and &#x2013; and so we had a situation in this portfolio where there was a mismatch between this annuity book of &#xA3;5 billion and the rest of the With Profits. And we had to take this out of the With Profits funds. We have a With Profits committee which is made of independent directors.</p>
          <p>And they decided to tender that portfolio to reinsure &#x2013; to tender the reinsurance of that portfolio out of the With Profits funds. And AXA was one of the bidders for that portfolio so this was a nonsense transaction.</p>
          <p>AXA decided that it was happy with the asset risk and not comfortable with the longevity risk. We reinsured 95% of the longevity risk out and the one-off gain that you see is the contraction of negative expense, of an expense for the reinsurance of the longevity of that portfolio and the unlocking of the liabilities, assuming a certain probability of defaults on the corporate bond portfolio which matches the annuities.</p>
          <p>So that's the one-off gain, which is an application of IFRS. So, we moved the asset from the With Profits to the shareholder accounts through a reinsurance transaction, offloading the longevity risk and keeping the asset risk for us. And that's led to this one-off gain.</p>
          <p>Any additional comment from the U.K.? And on the back book issue, I would say only that we are &#x2013; we have done a transaction on the management of this back book with Capita. So from an administration standpoint we are now immune to the issue of having a shrinking book with a strong infrastructure to manage it. So this is now in the hands of Capita, which manages a number of one-off portfolios for U.K. players both in the U.K. and in India.</p>
          <p>So we've eliminated basically the drag on the expenses and as the rest of our business portfolio we'll manage it opportunistically, taking into account the prices that can be obtained in the market and the fluid market situation that exists now. I mean we &#x2013; when you look at what we did with the sale of our Dutch business. We had concerns with this Dutch business in 2003, we sold it in 2007. When you look at our reinsurance business we had concern in 2001 and we sold it in 2005. So, that's all I can say about this.</p>

          <p>Hi. Mitchell Todd, T. Rowe Price. Can you just give some broad color on how your new business strain has evolved through H1 '09 in comparison to prior year and just talk about the sustainability of any net benefit year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a broad life question on new business strain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We &#x2013; the new business strain will be very much a function of the type of business that we write across the book. We have a significant business strain on the protection business as expected. But this is also the most profitable segment in our portfolio. And on the savings part of the portfolio, savings and pension part of the portfolio, we see more and more situation where, as in the U.K., we move to upfront commissions to a fee-based commission, and we reduce the new business strain. We have done that in the U.K. with the corporate pensions where we moved from upfront commissions to fee-based.</p>
          <p>And I think this is &#x2013; with a retail distribution review we will see that coming also on the bond side. So, if anything on the savings part of the portfolio, we are trying to reduce the new business strain, whereas on the protection which is a part of the portfolio which we expect to grow, there will be a continuation of new business strain, which is the flip side of high margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possibly just more simplistically than that, to say H1 '08, H2 '08 new business strain was X millions, H1 '09 business strain is X millions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The new business strain is something that you can get on the &#x2013; as far as '08 is concerned, on the report, on EV. So that's available in the pack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we don't split it first half, second half and you won't, I mean, you will be able to compare the new business strain '09 versus '08 in our EV report at the end of the year. But since we don't give an EV report for the first half, you won't have that breakdown between first half and second half.</p>

          <p>Marc Thiele from UBS. Two questions if I may. The first one on these cost reductions, the 600 million that you mentioned. How much precisely is in the first half, how much should we expect to come through in the second half?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is regarding the Japanese business. In the Ambition 2012 plan that was on a rich note target of becoming top three play on bank assurance. I am just wondering if there has been any thought of transferring these new U.S. variable annuities into the Japanese market or should we think about Japan as being a traditional health insurance driven business or what's really the strategy there?</p>

          <p>G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the expense question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost reduction. How much was in the first half, I believe that in the first half we have probably something like 100 million net cost reduction on the insurance. I mean taking both insurance and asset management combined.</p>
          <p>On Japan, I would say several things. First we were almost absent from the VA markets between 2002, 2003 when the VA market opened to banks and 2008, because 93% of VA sold during that period were GMABs and there was no way you could sell GMABs and hedge them profitably.</p>
          <p>So, we looked at that market and we decided that &#x2013; not to go into the GMAB market in Japan because it was not hedgeable at the financial conditions the products were offered. We stayed in the GMIB area which represented 7% of the market, and GMAB was selling like pancakes because the selling process was very quick, 20 minutes on average, whereas GMIB you need to go through a pension gap analysis, and it was at least an hour set process and we didn't sell a lot.</p>
          <p>What happened in the last six to nine months in Japan or the last year in Japan is that gradually everybody went out of the GMAB market, all the American players. And most of the Japanese players between, I would say October of last year and September of this year, have gone or are going to go out of that market, and we are getting lots more attention from the mega banks, I visited them three weeks ago &#x2013; of the mega banks for our continued presence in the VA markets in Japan and the fact that we've been rational on pricing all along.</p>
          <p>So, I mean clearly we have not given up on our appetite for VA sales in Japan, but we do it in a reasonable, rationale way, hedging our risk and only bringing to market at this stage GMIB product which was profitable, with changing market conditions we had to re-price it slightly at the end of the first half but the banks are happy to take our product at this stage.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the bulk of our activity in Japan is protection and we continue to see a great potential for protection sales in Japan because the market has an appetite for that. We see pockets of the market which are underexploited and which we will continue to address. And so we will try to probably, we will have probably a slightly more balanced book, say in five years from now but the majority will still be protection.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer your first question relative to the cost savings. So Denis told you that it was right, so that means that we have a cost reduction of 160 million for the first half. We can expect to have something of the same magnitude in the second half of the year. And we had some restructuring costs, 70 million in the first half.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Farooq Hanif again for Morgan Stanley. Hope you don't mind just going back on that internal loan question, just one &#x2013; just two questions. Number one, I just want to understand, you have basically taken an internal loan and used that to help sort of pay off external debt. And if and when you are able to pay a dividend internally from within the group to up to holding, you might use that to repay that internal loan, that's my understanding, is that correct? And second question is &#x2013; the reason why I find that a bit confusing is that when I've looked at your internal debt, it looks like it hasn't changed end of 2008 to 1H '09, is that just a timing effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a lag impact because most of the loans we had on last year. So, in the cash flow statement, we project &#x2013; we take free cash flows from last year from the operations and then we see what's going up into the holding. And actually part of the loan arrangements made partly to refinance the U.S. needs, for instance were made last year. This is why you have no change in the holding debt this year. But to understand the dynamics of which kind of amount of &#x2013; what sort of cash does float into the holding, you have this one year lag effect, which is difficult to understand but this is the way it works.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes of Nomura again. Just wanted to ask a general question about the sector and financial reporting and your views as to whether this dreadful opacity and inconsistency that we have in Europe between companies, whether there is any light at the end of the tunnel that you think in resolving this? I mean is it SOLVENCY II? Is it IFRS Phase II? Where do you think we should be looking for a resolution to this problem which are &#x2013; I think investors are finding very difficult to cope with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Nick that sometimes when you see light at the end of the tunnel, it's just a train coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to illustrate Henri's metaphor, I have to say that we have a number of trains coming. The first one is IAS 39. As you know there is a risk that IAS 39 comes before Phase II. So I don't know what the final outcome will be for IAS 39. But if IAS 39 is adopted as currently drafted, we would have a substantial portion of our bond portfolio coming back to amortized costs. All of our equities, all of our securitization except some of the AAA tranches, private equity and all that's moving to mark-to-market through the P&amp;L and the disappearance of the AFS OCI category, so additional volatility.</p>
          <p>When eventually Phase II comes, which is probably not before 2013 or 2014, you should expect some more alignment because the &#x2013; we would expect that the insurance reserves would be determined the same way across Europe. And Solvency II will also add a lot of transparency on the solvency calculation which should be relatively comparable across the universal fronts. Taking into account the fact that some of them will be using internal models and some others will be on a standard formula, and probably all the big ones on internal models. The smaller ones on the standard formula and there will be some discrepancies between the two. So there is hope at the end of the tunnel but it's not any time soon.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what we are doing is that we are using, as you know, the Solvency II framework and the short-term economy capital in order to price our products. So that means that we are using &#x2013; we are taking into account the cost of capital that is needed not only for the liability side, but also for the asset side. So that we are taking into account as such, the implicit price of default corresponding to the 99.5 security factor.</p>
          <p>For the future, we will see. For the time being, as you know, what we are using is our &#x2013; it's our own models, our own models are depending on the present level of volatility of the different products and the present level of the CDS and so on. So it could move going forward, but for the time being what you are using is exact &#x2013; the exact pricing of the products.</p>

          <p>Yes to annuity, for annuities. Yes, for annuity companies I'm taking the example of a product with an average duration of seven years.

        <plist>
          <p>Tony Silverman, Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Just looking at the appendix slide 14, which is on the technical margin under life and savings and the VA hedging, which is &#x2013; congratulations, has performed obviously a lot better. There is a plus 300 million from interest rates, credit spreads and other. Just on that &#x2013; so you can see it's on plus 301 million on slide 14 of the appendix.</p>
          <p>And I was just wondering is that sustainable going forward? Is that a result of the level of interest rates over the period or is it a result of the movement in credit spreads over the period and therefore may not be repeated? I'm just wondering how we should look at that number? And the second question was just, again if I may, to return to the 2.5 billion of internal loans. Is that from P&amp;C subsidiaries, is that a fair assumption? Or I don't know if you can expand on where it's from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the first question relative to page 14. So your question relates to the interest rates of plus 301. Yes, it's non-recurring. It's non-recurring because of &#x2013; due to the fact that we moved from &#x2013; mostly we moved from the swap curve to the treasury curve and this created a one-off gain. So going forward, we cannot expect &#x2013; we can have some gains but not to such a large extent. Concerning your second question, which is on &#x2013; which is on the &#x2013; on who is lending money to the holding company. It can be both Life or non-Life company so long as when we have an internal loan, it's on an arm's-length basis. It's done at the market conditions so that we consider that lending to the holding of the group is a good risk just like buying a bond which is a A or AA bond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And going back to the hedging margin, clearly, the interest rates and credit spreads a good number is non-recurring. We also expect that the volatility, negative trends in '10 will be not be recurring to the same tune. In other words, the anomaly in the market is coming from the fact that the treasuries have been above the swap rates for some time. It was created by exceptional market conditions. And volatility was also an exceptional market condition on the equity side and on an interest side. So, we may still incur some losses from volatility. But I don't except that we would have similar losses as the ones that we had in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Polit again. Just two very general questions. Firstly, can you comment on how cash flow is being invested in the Group at the moment, new cash? And secondly, and more generally &#x2013; the &#x2013; given the recovery you've seen in markets certainly over the last few weeks, has there been a recovery in your risk propensity as a Group, both organically and perhaps strategically through acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go on the cash flows G&#xE9;rald.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the cash flows we are mostly investing in fixed income, roughly 50% in govies, 50% in corporate bonds. We have &#x2013; there is still a lot of value in corporate bonds. At the same time, in the first half we have been investing in govies, plus in negative basis rates. And there are still opportunities in negative base rates. So it's mostly in fixed income, as you can notice, we slightly decreased our exposure in equity. So it's not our intention to increase our exposure in equities, neither in real estate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On risk appetite and risk propensity, we are not going to change the strategic view we have on acquisitions just because the markets go up or down by 10%. This would be meaningless. I mean we've told you even at the worst moment of the turmoil that we were confident in the fact that the business model was solid. AXA is a combination of ability to, I would say, improve the management of the existing businesses and acquire on an opportunistic basis, things which are available. Provided they are within the core business, we are going to continue to do that.</p>
          <p>If I may add something, I think that the focus of the teams now should be in attracting new clients from distressed companies. There are a number of distressed companies out there, having benefited, for some of them, from state money. There is downside to that, which is that some of them are behaving irrationally, which is disturbing the level playing field. But there is an upside to that, which is that many of them are very significantly losing market share because the clients don't have the confidence anymore. And this should be the first way to benefit from the situation because it's less expensive to attract the clients than to pay for the balance sheet. Having said that, I mean today where there are the opportunities, we will react the way we've always reacted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question is about the U.K. and the restructuring plan you announced. How much is linked to the Capita deal and how much could be exported to other countries? And my second question is related to the French market, when we look at the new business margin and also the underlying profit, there is obviously a profitability issue on the Life side. We've seen that you have been quite active on the U.S. market to restore profitability, what do you intend to do on the French side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, will you take on the question on the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the U.K. the plans we've announced today are in addition to the savings we'll realize from the outsourcing to Capita, they relate really to an acceleration of our strategies to reshape the Life business in the U.K. to face into the market that will emerge post-RDR which will be quite a different landscape I think. And we think we'll be a lower cost <mark type="inaudible" /> business. So the extent to which they are exportable elsewhere in the group, I can't directly comment, but.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; I mean the question on the French business, the good news on the French business on the Life side is that APs are positive. The bad news is that the product mix is not what we would like to see given the fact that the proportion of unit-linked has decreased to something which is around 11%, showing the risk aversion of the clients. What we need to do is very simple, it's to move clients more towards unit-linked and what we've sold is &#x2013; I would say products where if their risk appetite is growing, they can move to unit-linked, so moving to unit-linked is important.</p>
          <p>Second point, selling variable annuities in France is also an important element. I think I should add to that also the fact that AXA Banque has been quite successful in attracting some money as short-term deposits which over time will have to be converted into long-term Life products, but clearly it's the product mix and the ability to sell variable annuities which are key. What would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the French side, nothing, other than the fact that we also have protection sales that are going quite well, And we still believe that we have, on the protection and health, substantial potential to continue to improve our profitability and our sales volumes. And going back to the first question of exportability of the U.K. restructuring plans, I believe that we are &#x2013; we have to restructure our business every time our expense ratio is not in line or better than the competition, and so we have plans in different geographies when our expense ratios are not in line or better than the competition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a couple of little question if I may. My first question is on yield of &#x2013; yielding of the assets, how you look at P&amp;C globally, you have stable financial revenue, providing an investment yield of 4.6%. So &#x2013; and that is the opposite on the Life side because I find out that there is a strong decline which is logic &#x2013; more logic I would say, from 5.8 to 3.6 on an annualized basis. So could you comment on this and especially on the P&amp;C side, what can we focus on H2?</p>
          <p>And on this question I would like to link a little add-up on the slide 28 of the appendix, there is a focus on the corporate bonds, not CDS, which is quite interesting and I would like to have a comment, is the market value divided by the CDS book is increasing while in the same time &#x2013; from 2.4% to 3.3%, while in the same time spread has come down, so this is not logic. So this is on yield on the assets.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; I have a second question on VA business. A lot have been said on the U.S., but you're apparently resizing your strategy out of the U.S. So if we could have some flavor also there?</p>
          <p>I have a third little question on the embedded value. Obviously it's too early, but as I understand you did some early calculation. And since end of '08 situation has changed dramatically in some field, it was a negative 104 &#x2013; it was a negative adjustment of more than 20 billion end of last year. So could we have a first idea of &#x2013; given a market consistent approach where we could stand today given the fall of the volatility and the spread in particular and the recovery of the equity market also?</p>
          <p>And last question is for Henri maybe. You're very well positioned to rebound from where we are, to bridge a link with 2003 now you have only 1% invested assets in equities. So how can you benefit from the recovery of markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Navin, I will start with the last part of your question and then we'll take the other one. You should read the appendixes more carefully because we don't have 1% of equities, I mean we have more than that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And second point, the exposure to the upside is not only through the equities we have on the balance sheet. May I remind you that the unit-linked business and the asset management, are businesses where you benefit from the upside much more strongly than through the exposure you have on the balance sheet itself through the commissions we are taking.</p>
          <p>As I've taken the last question, I will take the question. I don't understand why you say that we are resizing our strategy on VAs. We are redesigning the products, re-pricing some of them, but I don't see what has changed other than that. And I'll let my friends and colleagues answer the other ones in the order they want.</p>

          <p>For the first question in fact in P&amp;C the &#x2013; we have an underlying investment yield in the first half of 4.3%, which was slightly down 0.2%. In Life we were around 4.2%, down 0.5%. So, where does it come from? It comes mainly from the fact that normally in the past years, you had higher investment yield in the first half due to the dividends and dividends were significantly lower. At the same time, we have been investing, you remember during the course of the first half, at interest rates which were much lower than they are today.</p>
          <p>As far as your second question is concerned on the CDS, you know most of the CDS that we have been using, you remember we explained in the &#x2013; at the end of last year that CDS was an alternative for us to invest in corporate bonds. We are investing in &#x2013; and mostly in Japan. So we have JGB's and we invest in &#x2013; we sold CDS in order to create entity corporate bonds. But pay attention, since we have three months &#x2013; we closed the books at the end of March in Japan. So that means that all the recovery from the CDS market which &#x2013; with the quick tightening of the spread, is not in the books yet.</p>
