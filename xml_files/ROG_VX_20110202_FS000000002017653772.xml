        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Christina. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for joining our conference call. Here with me are Pascal Soriot, the COO of Pharma; Dan O'Day, the COO of Diagnostics; Karl Mahler, the Head of Investor Relations and many other members of my team. Our explanations will be based on the presentation you were able to download at 7 o'clock this morning on the web.</p>
          <p>If I go to the part which this afternoon will be presented by our CEO, Severin Schwan, I go to chart number five. So, all together as you may have seen in the short time between having a look at the results and now, we have fully met the financial guidance for last years and I can also tell you that the Operational Excellence program is fully on track.</p>
          <p>Most of the employees concerned are really already informed about the situation and we are going into operations mode there. Good news also that step-by-step, personalized healthcare comes from vision into actions.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart number six, impressive growth in local currencies for the Diagnostics division. I think Dan will be very pleased to inform you that he has gained further market shares, but also excellent growth of the Pharmaceutical division above many of our peers, excluding Tamiflu where Pascal Soriot will give you the details.</p>
          <p>If you go to chart number seven, you see that 2010 was really a very, very challenging year. Many of these headwinds which developed during 2010, we of course saw at the beginning, but some of them really turned much more severe than we had thought.</p>
          <p>I mean the Tamiflu sales, you can really see we lost year-on-year comparison CHF2.3 billion. We also had already a strong impact on Avastin in breast cancer in the U.S. with CHF125 million. And if you add up all the healthcare reform impacts in the United States, of course, but also Europe and Japan, we have identified a impact in the range of CHF774 million.</p>
          <p>We are pleased, if you go to chart number eight, that our growth dynamic has not slowed down and that specially also the fourth quarter was absolutely up to our expectations.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart number nine, you see as I indicated at the beginning, we have achieved a core EPS, as we always guided instead of all these headwinds, of plus 10% in local currencies. And if you go to chart number 10, this group all together has an industry-leading operating margin already and was still able to improve the situation.</p>
          <p>Our Chairman had given a clear commitment on chart 11 three years ago on the increasing the payout ratio, and I think the proposed dividends of CHF6.60, which will be submit to the annual shareholders meeting in March, shows you that we fully live up to this commitment. And since we have changed to this core reporting concept, we give you the pay-out ratio in the old format and in the new format just to show you that in both formats, we fully are in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>So if you go to the summary chart on page 12, you'd see also the year was extremely challenging. We ended all our commitments with a green light and our traffic system means always green is okay, let's go on with this. And this leads us in to the priorities of 2010 on chart 13. It's definitely clear that Operational Excellence now has to deliver, but as I said, everything is initiated and already fully active in most parts of the organization.</p>
          <p>And not to be forgotten, I mean the Genentech integration synergies developed exactly according to plan, with the 800 million delivered in 2010. But there is still another 200 million to be delivered in 2011, where we are totally confident that we will achieve this.</p>
          <p>Now to focus on the future, Roche's future is based on innovation and we have a very attractive late-stage pipeline and now product-by-product will also come under registration and into the market. Pascal will give you the details, but also in Dan's area we really have a full pipeline of products. If we go to chart number 14, we still think that we have an industry-leading late-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>Chart 15, now we have the figures. I know this was also for us not easy to just have arrows in our charts and not having exact figures. And I went through many, many interactions with many of you, where from all angles you tried to get the figures, but now you have them. So what you can see &#x2013; we see, if we start the line is actually &#x2013; the thin line is the operating profit achieved in 2010. And now the red arrows is what the challenges will come, and I think you see the EU and U.S. healthcare reform impacts we see a CHF500 million delta.</p>
          <p>We again &#x2013; I mean Tamiflu was still well above a seasonal flu in average year, so we consider the 2011 sales to go down a further CHF600 million year-on-year, because there is some flu, but never in the ranges of the former years.</p>
          <p>And then Avastin, breast cancer &#x2013; and Pascal will again give you all the details here &#x2013; but we see another CHF800 million sales at risk and we still have some Boniva sales at patent expiries. So there is a range of challenges and now you understand also why we acted very promptly and strictly with our Operational Excellence program.</p>
          <p>So if we go to the positive side of all these elements, I mean the underlying business, Diagnostics and Pharma is very strong, so we will have organic growth. Operational Excellence, we are fully convinced that we can deliver the CHF1.8 billion we have committed to you in November.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned the Genentech synergies will add another CHF200 million and not to be forgotten and I respect that there is a lot of focus on Avastin in metastatic breast cancer. But we should never forget this is the most successful cancer drug in history up to now and it is absolutely working in five indication areas where it still has strong growth and you will see in Pascal's charts how especially the international regions, where many of you were concerned would you ever be able to bring this product into these markets, is doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>What you don't have on this chart is the outcome of the CATT trial, but I can tell you we do not speculate about the outcome of the CATT trial here, but in the overall situation of the group, I mean Lucentis makes less than 3% of our total group sales. So our guidance accommodates any outcome of the Lucentis CATT trial and this brings me to the outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>We see &#x2013; on the sales side we see low single-digit growth for the group in Pharma and again the star will be Diagnostics, which has a path still ahead of all the competitors, significantly above the market. Genentech synergies, 200 million will be delivered. Operational Excellence, the 1.8 billion will be delivered, and the core EPS growth in local currencies, it goes into high single-digits.</p>
          <p>And you will see in my part which I take later that we have even advanced the debt repayment by calling another billion of a bond early in December. So we are absolutely convinced that we are able to match our ambition to return to a net cash position.</p>
          <p>And with this three-year commitment of our Chairman three years ago to bring the payout ratio up, we're now in comparison with all our peers in a very attractive payout ratio range. So of course we want to absolutely remain attractive for our value investors. We have not given a three-year bandwidth, because I think we're now in an attractive bandwidth, but there is a clear commitment to grow the dividend in the range of core EPS growth.</p>
          <p>And with this, I hand over to Pascal Soriot for the Pharmaceutical division.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Erich. Good morning everybody. A pleasure to present annual summary results to you this morning. And I'm also very pleased to welcome Hal Barron, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Development, who is joining us from San Francisco.</p>
          <p>So if I start on slide 18, there is one message I'd like to leave you there is that as Erich mentioned earlier, we grew in 2010 by 5% excluding Tamiflu and at a constant exchange rate. This is a very strong growth rate in comparison to our peers.</p>
          <p>I know that IMS is reporting 4% to 5% market growth rate. But many of you will know that IMS underestimates the rebates that are granted by the industry to the U.S. market in particular and we rely on pharma evaluates to assess the market growth. At constant rate, pharma evaluate reports 1% growth rate. So with 5%, we're certainly well ahead of the market in 2010. And as Erich said a constant &#x2013; a very regular growth rate quarter-to-quarter until quarter four.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, a reminder of the headwinds that we suddenly had to deal with in 2010. First of all, a very, very substantial decline of Tamiflu, which was totally expected, of course, as the flu pandemic subsided on a global basis. We also had to deal with unexpected healthcare reforms around the world and price cuts in Europe, in particular in Japan, which costs us about close to 800 million on the top line, but also falling straight down to the bottom line. If you recalibrate our sales to consider those factors, in fact, our growth rate for the underlying portfolio was 7%, which we believe is certainly a nice growth rate.</p>
          <p>And on slide 20, you can see product-by-product where growth came from. And I guess what is really interesting to note here is that in blue, the international region is actually driving the growth of our major products, Avastin, MabThera, Herceptin, and certainly we are able to penetrate those emerging countries very successfully with our Specialty Care products.</p>
          <p>You see also that Avastin didn't go in the United States and clearly we had to deal with this breast cancer issue there, which impacted our sales. We also had to deal with the decline of CellCept linked to the expiry of the patent in the United States.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would point out the strong growth of Lucentis and the continued successful launch of Actemra in particular in Europe. In the other countries international in particular, we are only getting reimbursement progressively. So 2011 should be a year where we see growth in the United States for Actemra and also in the international region, still of course in Europe.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, shows you how despite severe headwinds on our &#x2013; with our top line, we actually managed to deliver an operating profit growth, thanks to very proactive cost management throughout the year, but also starting this in the second half, through the Operational Excellence program which will deliver savings in 2011-2012, but started of course, very, very initial savings in 2010 and helped us deliver this profit growth.</p>
          <p>On page 22, you see a very substantial operating profit margin improvement as Erich already highlighted to you earlier for the group. But it's only reflected in the Pharma members as well going from 38% to 39.9% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a product review, the slide down, slide 23. You can see here that each of our major products Avastin, MabThera, Herceptin grew very substantially, between 7% and 9%. Of course, Avastin, as I said before, was impacted in the United States, but we had substantial growth with MabThera/Rituxan, thanks to the uptake in CLL and also using NHL in the international region and the maintenance indications starting to have an impact. Herceptin is growing around the world. The gastric cancer launch certainly helped fuel that growth, so, good growth across our oncology portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, I guess the message here is that suddenly these breast cancer discussions with the FDA had an impact on our sales in the United States in 2010. And the patient share, which was historically close to 60% in breast cancer, declined to about 35% as we estimated in the last part of the year, and we expect further decline in 2011, which is the reason why Erich showed you a bit earlier, we expect a substantial decline in breast cancer sales for Avastin in 2011.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we saw a good result in colorectal cancer, some increase in lung cancer, and so far stable share in breast cancer, but we also expect some impact in Europe in 2011. Even though we manage to maintain the label for breast cancer in Europe, certainly, we expect pressure and an impact on our sales in Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we've summarized here the opportunities we see for Avastin to grow over the next two to three years. And the main challenge is very well known, of course, it's the label, breast cancer label, but certainly there are reasons to believe Avastin can keep growing over the next several years.</p>
          <p>First of all, we can still grow our market share in colorectal cancer and lung cancer, and in particular, in Europe, but also in the international region. We see very substantial growth in colorectal cancer around the world and we believe it can continue. We've announced in China in colorectal cancer with good success so far, and our Japanese sales now also developing very nicely.</p>
          <p>A good growth driver, very strong growth driver, should be the treatment duration, in particular on colorectal cancer, and the TML results will certainly help us drive this. We are expecting the results pretty soon now, but certainly this should be a factor to drive growth. And finally the ovarian indications for which we are filing in the United States this year, and filed late last year should also be a growth driver. So certainly challenges, but also opportunities. We have revived our estimated peak sales to about 7 billion on a global basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 26, Lucentis, as I mentioned before, nice growth 27% in 2010. The launch of the RVO indication is very encouraging so far. We're making steady progress there. And we're expecting results in the DME indication in the next couple of months. Finally, we are also waiting for the results of the custody, and we expect those results to come out in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, Actemra shows very encouraging results so far. You can see the quarterly sales are developing very nicely. I'd like to remind you that in 2010, we didn't have a J code in United States, or reimbursement code. We obtained it in January, and it's already started. It usually takes about a year to get a J code. So of course, U.S. sales were impacted by the lack of reimbursement code. But despite this, we have so far very good results in the United States, we believe, with 60% of rheumatologists having prescribed Actemra.</p>
          <p>We also filed for the juvenile arthritis indication and we expect priority review and a fast approval for Actemra in the indications. The clinical results are absolutely outstanding. And we also achieved a label extension for the inhibition, slowing of structural joint damage in the United States.</p>
          <p>On page 28, I'd like to highlight again the strong growth we experienced in the international region. Those are mostly emerging markets. And importantly you see here that Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera, those are specialty care products, are growing very, very nicely and representing a pretty substantial share of our total sales in this international region. The second point I'd like to highlight is that this region is now almost as big as Europe for Roche and growing by 10% plus on double-digit on an annual basis, so certainly a very important region for us in the next few years.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to drive a couple of points, which I know have been on your minds over the last few weeks and months. First of all, the treatment duration for Herceptin on slide 29, you all know that there are a number of studies that are ongoing looking at shorter treatment duration for Herceptin. Many of those studies are going to read out in 2013, 2014 and later and also they tend to be  smaller studies most of them.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our HERA 2 study which is comparing two-year Herceptin treatment with one-year treatment, will, we believe read out in 2012. Of course, it's events driven, but our estimate is that we should get the results in 2012. So those results will coincide or precede actually the read out of the shorter treatment duration studies. So that's for the treatment duration with Herceptin and we're looking forward to those results. We believe there is strong reason to believe that two years Herceptin will yield better clinical benefit than one year.</p>
          <p>Another question which we know has been on your mind over the last few months is biosimilars. So I'd like to first of all start by telling you that as far as the biosimilars, our first and foremost priority is to keep doing what our strategy is all about, i.e. innovate. And on slide 30, you see here illustrated for breast cancer, HER2 positive breast cancer, our efforts to move forward the standard of care in HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>
          <p>First of all, we are developing T-DM1 in second line and first line, and in combination with pertuzumab in first line and you can see that over the next few years by 2012 and '13 T-DM1 should certainly play an important role in later lines of breast cancer treatment. Pertuzumab, we believe is a very important product that will help improve the standard of care in breast cancer and benefit patients and also help us manage this HER2 franchise as we combine Pertuzumab with Herceptin, where the clinical benefits will increase and leave little room for Herceptin monotherapy treatment past 2012, 2013.</p>
          <p>And over time also in adjuvant breast cancer, we intend to introduce the sub-q formulation in adjuvant as well as metastatic of course. And in the longer horizon, Pertuzumab in combination with Herceptin we also play an important role in the adjuvant breast cancer. So you can see that over time, in between the sub-q formulation, the combination of Herceptin and Pertuzumab and finally T-DM1 either in monotherapy or in combination with Pertuzumab, certainly have many ways to influence the way breast cancer patients are treated and reduce the place for monotherapy Herceptin.</p>
          <p>Now the second key message is that in Europe and the international markets, where we will lose patent protection for products like Herceptin or MabThera earlier than in the United States, we believe biosimilars of course will have an impact, on both Herceptin and MabThera. But we also believe is this impact will have nothing to &#x2013; will not compare at all to what will happen to a small molecule after patent expiry. We've highlighted here for you two examples, the EPO market and G-CSF market, those are averages across Europe and of course in some markets, the decline of the originating product might be more pronounced, but on an average basis, you can see here that the impact of those biosimilars both in volume and value is certainly manageable.</p>
          <p>So, again, I am not trying to imply that they will not have impact. They will have an impact. I'm only trying to highlight the fact that this will have nothing to do with what happens to a small molecule and we believe we can manage that impact in those countries.</p>
          <p>And on slide 32, we also believe biosimilars will basically lead to a re-think of the way we actually market our drugs. And there is enormous potential in the emerging countries with these developing economies allowing those countries to now pay higher prices. There is enormous potential for us to increase access and bring Herceptin and MabThera to the thousands of patients who actually do not have access. And certainly we will be proactive managing pricing in those countries. And implementing access programs that will help us increase the penetration of Herceptin, MabThera in those countries.</p>
          <p>You can see here two examples in China and Russia. In China, for instance, the penetration of Herceptin is only 7% at this point, so enormous potential. As the economy in China develops, the payers become more able to pay and we become more proactive in managing pricing.</p>
          <p>Finally, on page 33, a kind of a wrap-up of how we intend to address this biosimilar issue. First of all, a reminder for you that we are patent protected with all our products in the United States until 2018 and then beyond.</p>
          <p>So really we're talking about Western Europe and the rest of the world in the mid-term. The first message I'd like to leave you with is that in Western Europe for Roche, and in the rest of the world and in the U.S. for that matter, our number one priority will be to move the standard of care with new targeted products, which is point three on that slide.</p>
          <p>Second is we will increase the penetration in the international market. And thirdly, as I mentioned, we believe that the impact of biosimilars will be manageable. So when you combined all of this together, we believe that the impact on the global &#x2013; on our global franchises, HER2 and anti-CD20, should actually be quite manageable and in fact we expect growth of the &#x2013; of those franchise if you consider new product launches.</p>
          <p>On page 34, just like to highlight some of our clinical programs here. I won't go through each of those, because as you can see, they are so many. And we're very proud and very happy with this portfolio that is strengthening by the day.</p>
          <p>I'd just like to highlight a few that will potentially lead to a filing in 2011. One is BRAF in melanoma. We've already got the results from BRIM3 and we will be presenting those later this year. But we certainly met the co-primary endpoints of overall survival and PFA. So we are looking forward to a filing this year.</p>
          <p>The second one is Pertuzumab in combination with Herceptin, the CLEOPATRA study, that could also potentially lead to a filing this year. And the final one is Hedgehog in basal cell carcinoma. It's a Phase II pivotal study that could also potentially lead to a filing this year. So there are many others.</p>
          <p>Let me just comment on Actemra. We have this head-to-head study versus Humira, which we think potentially will change the way Rheumatoid arthritis is changed in term of the cycling that takes place with anti-TNF and could really increase the place for Actemra in the treatment of RA.</p>
          <p>Slide 35, a few words on melanoma and our BRAF inhibitors. As I mentioned a minute ago, the BRIM3 study reached its endpoint. We actually stopped the study and allowed patients in the control arm to crossover and receive BRAF and we expect to file this year. Slide 36, our hedgehog Phase II data will read out soon and we expect also potentially to file this year. And slide 37, reflects here the results of NEOSPHERE trial, which we presented in San Antonio late last year.</p>
          <p>Those were very encouraging results in the treatment of metastatic HER2 breast cancer and -- neoadjuvant &#x2013; sorry, HER2 breast cancer. And certainly we're looking forward to the CLEOPATRA results, which could also lead to filing in 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, and in conclusion on slide 38, I'd like to highlight to you what our focus in 2011 will be. Essentially, we really have to focus on our long-term growth and keep progressing our pipeline, and certainly manage our short-term situation with a few headwinds linked to patent expiries, but also the decline of Tamiflu and that's again why we launched this Operational Excellence program. So we'll be preparing for the potential launch of the BRAF, Pertuzumab and the hedgehog inhibitor.</p>
          <p>We keep investing in the emerging markets and we will keep fueling this double-digit growth we've been experiencing so far, continue investing in the late-stage pipeline. As you see &#x2013; as you saw a minute ago, it's a very rich pipeline and it needs to be supported. And finally, we'll implement the Operational Excellence program that will deliver savings over the next two years, this year and next year.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I will now hand over to Dan.</p>

          <p>So, good morning everybody. It's a pleasure to review the Diagnostics division results for 2010. A key message is very, very strong performance. Despite some challenging healthcare environment issues out there that we also faced and some pretty severe competitive pressures in the environment, we were successfully growing again significantly above the market growth rate.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 40, you can see that overall, the Diagnostics division grew at 8% in the market that was growing around 4% to 5%. And you can see each one of our businesses within the Diagnostics division contributing significantly to that overall growth.</p>
          <p>When you look at it regionally on slide 41, you can see the breakdown by region, and two key points here. One is that each region respectively is growing faster than the marketplace within their particular regions. And you can see the significant growth in the emerging markets, in particular, when we break down the E7 markets, they now account for 13% of the overall revenue of the Diagnostics division and growing at 21%.</p>
          <p>China alone last year grew close to 38%, almost 40%, on a sustainable basis. So, we really have strong growth across all of our regions, and as Pascal pointed out, also the emerging markets in Diagnostics making a significant contribution.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to slide 42 and this is something I want to spend a little bit of time on, because the &#x2013; you've had some questions about this in the past. I'm particularly impressed at how we've been able to move the profitability over this past year, a 30% growth in profitability to now a core operating profit margin of 21.1%.</p>
          <p>And that was done with, of course, the strong sales growth above market. It was done by product mix. And product mix is something that it's also sustainable moving forward. I'll show you one example of that. But essentially the products that are driving that 8% growth are our newer products, products that enjoy higher gross margins that fall to the bottom -line and I think that's what you're seeing in terms of the margin improvement significantly on the 30%.</p>
          <p>In addition, as you know, at the beginning of last year, we instituted some changes within the division, focused on improving our portfolio performance and portfolio management and also on leveraging our economies of scale across our five businesses. In particular, we put a manufacturing organization in to place that covers our five businesses now. And I think you're starting to see that fall now in to the P&amp;L here by looking, for instance, at our cost of sales line.</p>
          <p>In the recent past, we have had our cost of sales line growing faster than sales for many years and now you can see it's growing significantly slower than sales and we have fundamental programs in place to continue in that trend. We have also managed the other cost lines, I think, prudently, but also in a position to be able to invest from a market leader position.</p>
          <p>So, overall that's 21.1% core operating profit margin. I've said in the past, we are the world's leader in terms of market share with 20%, the next company being at 12%. We're clearly the world leader in terms of sales growth and now we're in a very strong range in terms of profitability, which I believe is something that needs to be taken more into account by the external world in terms of the evaluation of Roche from a valuation perspective, moving forward at this margin.</p>
          <p>And if you turn to slide 43, you can see that translates to a 3.6% improvement in core operating profit margin over the course of this past year, which translated directly to the operating free cash flow that you see also in that slide.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 44, just a little bit more color to what I was speaking about in terms of the sustainability of these margins. We have programs in place &#x2013; we'll continue to have programs in place that focus on our economies of scale, directed towards our manufacturing cost of goods, directed towards how we manage our service organization throughout the global and regional units and also making sure from our active portfolio management that we're getting products on time to the marketplace with good margins.</p>
          <p>We also took an opportunity to further streamline some of our sites within our Roche Diagnostics networks, both from a strategic perspective which is by consolidating some of our businesses on our main sites. We have better system integration, better ability to develop those products in the future for faster on-market times, but we also took advantage of the cost perspectives of leveraging our existing capacities and reducing our infrastructure costs.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 45, you can see the breakdown of what's driving this growth across the division. On largest business, Professional Diagnostics growing at 11%, strong instrument placements with significant competitive barriers to entry within our customer base. In Diabetes Care, you can see the growth predominantly driven by EMEA last year, above market, because the Diabetes Care business overall is growing around 1% to 2% for the 4% growth. But as you'll see from a later slide, the new products that are introduced in Europe now need to be introduced in to the other regions and should be able to continue our share gain in that important sector.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics, strong growth across the different regions. We're now in a position to also enter into some of the higher growth areas. This year will be our year where we will launch HPV in the United States, with a truly differentiated product and as you'll see from the companion diagnostics, several new oncology products coming to market in Molecular Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Applied Science had good underlying growth, particularly in our sequencing business. But you can also see that we had an impact 2009 to 2010 on some one-time H1N1 sales that occurred in 2009.</p>
          <p>And finally Tissue Diagnostics, 17% growth. Almost 15% growth in the United States, where we enjoy close to an 80% market share, shows you the power of the new products we're rolling out there and really building and forming the market in pathology. And also we see greater than 20% growth ex-U.S. where we're just beginning to implement our programs throughout the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>To give you two examples and a little bit more detail, if you turn to slide 46, this shows you, I think, two key points. One is the value of a large installed base of instrumentation out there, our Clinical Chemistry and Immunoassay business, and the continued instrument placements. But it also shows you our business model where once we have those instruments in place, we're able to put a innovative new menu on those that is sustainable. So over the past 10 years &#x2013; this is just one aspect of our Professional Diagnostics business, the Immunoassay business &#x2013; we have had double-digit growth over the past 10 years. Last year alone we had a 17% growth in our immunoassay business. And again, this is the future, this is &#x2013; these are key products that drive medical decision making, and these are also products with gross margins that support our continued trend on our profitability side.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 47, our second largest business, Diabetes Care, in a market that saw 4% growth, you can see a disproportionate growth over the past several years of our new meters, our innovative meters. Again predominantly in EMEA right now and we intend to roll those out in the other regions beginning this year.</p>
          <p>Turning our attention to our R&amp;D portfolio and also some of the data we developed this year that will drive our business also in the future. If you turn to slide 48, our strategy is firmly grounded on testing efficiency on the one hand for our lab customers and medical value on the other hand for the physicians, for the patients, for the healthcare community. We had three very significant study results in 2010 that are just beginning to be implemented.</p>
          <p>The ATHENA trial, which is the largest ever trial done in clinical diagnostics, with a 47,000-woman, prospective trial on HPV was &#x2013; had the first of its results released in July in Montreal. And some pretty astonishing results to demonstrate that with our test, specifically looking at genotypes 16 and 18, it was shown statistically that compared to the routine method of determining pre-cervical cancer in many countries, the PAP test, it demonstrated that you're missing one out of 10 women if you use the PAP test alone.</p>
          <p>We have, I believe, strong clinical data here. A good clinically differentiated overall program and a good system to launch in the United States this year to make a difference for women with cervical cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer in women. And we know that when we are able to identify this disease early, it can be treated and the incidence of mortality significantly reduced.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in our Professional Diagnostics, we had results of our PROTECT study, which was a study that looks at our marker NT-proBNP in heart failure therapy. This study was also presented this year to show that NT-proBNP levels can be used in an emerging setting to guide heart failure therapy and the outcomes of this were to look at reducing total cardiovascular events in heart failure patients and also hospitalization. And there were significant results there that will allow clinicians with our test to take a differentiated decision making for the benefit of patients and the healthcare community.</p>
          <p>And finally in our Diabetes Care business, we published the STeP study, which looks at structured glucose testing over several days, which allows a patient with diabetes to be able to &#x2013; and a physician to be able to cater diabetic therapy more specifically to that patient, and have a better HbA1c and glycemic control, which has a better management of the disease and of course reduced side effects.</p>
          <p>So these studies are just a few of the many that we're investing in within Roche and I think a key differentiator to Roche versus other diagnostic businesses. The ability to do these studies, the ability to leverage the know-how and also the expense that we have within the Roche Group on our investment in clinical trials is significant and gives us a competitive advantage in these areas. And it is the core cornerstone of why I believe we're growing also faster than the marketplace, by having differentiated assays on our system that allow us to continue to grow faster than the competition.</p>
          <p>Turning the attention to slide 49, we have been focused on PHC for quite a few years in Roche. 2010 was a bit of a banner year in terms of results. The pipeline that Pascal presented of the 12 late-stage NMEs within the Roche portfolio, six of them have PHC programs associated with them. And all six are connected with diagnostics that come from the Roche diagnostics program. That's significant, because we know that it is not easy in many markets to get companion diagnostics approved, launched onto a large install base. And so the fact that we can leverage the diagnostics and the pharma expertise and strength of both businesses is significant.</p>
          <p>As you see on slide 49, three of these six come from our Ventana Tissue Diagnostics business, the HER2s and the Mets, two from our Roche Molecular Diagnostics business, the BRAF and the HCV, and the last one, the Periostin from the Professional Diagnostics. The importance there is that the breadth of our business allows us to follow the science and make sure that we have the right assay for the right program within pharma that allows both pharma to be successful, but also diagnostics with these differentiated programs on our platform, to differentiate our offerings.</p>
          <p>The last thing I would say is that you may see many of these assays with different diagnostic companies, but I have to put a caution here, not all diagnostic assays are the same. We have results to demonstrate that many diagnostics out there miss anywhere from 10% to 20% to 30% of the potential patients that could benefit from a particularly mutation range of therapy. And that has big impacts upon patients first most, but also upon the healthcare system. So the ability to have a high quality, reproducible assay should not be underestimated here.</p>
          <p>Then if we go to slide 50, you can see that in addition to our own internal R&amp;D innovation, we complement it from the outside, many key acquisitions and collaborations. I've spoken before about our Medingo collaboration, our patch pump business and our diabetes care business that will revolutionize the way that insulin is delivered in a convenient way for patients.</p>
          <p>Bioimaging, which allows us to even strengthen our tissue diagnostics offerings further, with slide capture and automated algorithms in the pathology business. We had several significant research and technology collaborations in our sequencing business, HPV and Diabetes Care. And we have freedom to operate on several of our key companion diagnostics, including EGFR, Pl3 kinase and p63.</p>
          <p>So in summary on 51, we feel we have a very strong portfolio to roll out in 2011, too, that will differentiate our business with our customer base. We have guided that we will significantly grow above the market again in 2011 and I'm confident that the margin improvement that we saw this year will continue to be sustained and we'll continue to drive that forward in the future as well.</p>
          <p>So with that, thank you very much and I turn it over to Erich to cover the financial part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. So moving on to chart number 55, you have an overview of the figures of 2010. And for those who are not so familiar with Roche yet, you will see &#x2013; if you go into the financial report and into the annual report, you will see two sets of figures. You will have a fully compatible IFRS set of figures, but we have decided this year then to build a very transparent bridge into what we call the underlying business reporting and this is all under core reporting.</p>
          <p>All the details have been announced at November conference call. And also this afternoon in London or on Friday in New York, Ian Bishop will be most willing and helpful to explain any issues about these two concepts &#x2013; this concept in his accounting workshop. So if we look at these overall figures, I think a lot of it has already been explained.</p>
          <p>There may be two questions immediately coming up and all of you know that I'm very much focused on cash flow. So the question may come up, oh there's operating free cash flow. Is this a negative trend in and the free cash flow, is this a negative trend. So just to make it very clear, these occur really year-on-year of the FX.</p>
          <p>If we go on to the operating free cash flow situation, we had two major effects here. You know that Tamiflu was developed together with a strategic partner who gets an appropriate royalty out of this business. And whereas these royalties are always accounting-wise treated in the quarter or in the months we do the sale, cash out is a little bit late. So if you now realize that in 2009, the fourth quarter was a huge Tamiflu sales quarter, we then had always relevant cash-out in January of 2010.</p>
          <p>And the other element, some of you may recall that during the Genentech transaction, we had a retention program for all the key Genentech employees and it was paid out in two tranches and one &#x2013; the last tranche actually was paid out in 2010. So, if you go for these factors, if you adjust the 2009-2010, you actually have a very nice development also of operating free cash flow. And the free cash flow all together, again these bonds launched in 2009. Many of them have a one-year coupon, so, of course accounting-wise the interest expenses for these bonds were accounted already in 2009, but the cash-out was then for many of them was just the first time in 2010. So, nothing you should be worried about over the cash situation. It is under control.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart 56, you see bringing a very strong Diagnostics P&amp;L to the operating profit together with the strong Pharma operating profit. This gives a picture where we were not helped by the sales at the customer end, where we had to really perform internally and here without the 800 million out of the Genentech integration, I think it would have been difficult to achieve these excellent results. And this brings me to chart 57 on the margin increase, where you now can see that both divisions have industry-leading performances to the operating profit level.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart 58, this is just one example how we want to build very transparently the bridge between the IFRS statements and the core statements. I won't go into the details, but you find all the elements, how much of operational excellence was already charged in 2010. If we go below the operating profit line, we come to the financial results. And here we have one element which is actually good news, but might have surprised you.</p>
          <p>You know we had a very clear roadmap to pay down the debt of the Genentech transaction very quickly. And then all this planning, financial planning, was of course done, without taking any Tamiflu, swine flu, into calculation. And the excellent Tamiflu, swine flu sales, with the 3 billion, gave some extra cash into our box and this of course was used to pay down bonds.</p>
          <p>So we informed you at the first half year results of 2010 that we had called a $2.5 billion bond -dollar bond, which only would have matured in March 2012. And we had enough capacity left by the end of 2010 to call another $1 billion of the 2014 bonds. And of course if you call such a bond, you have a one time charge at the moment you call the bond, but of course this will give a nice relief in the financial expenses in the future years against the original maturity schedule.</p>
          <p>If we come to the ForEx results, it is reflecting a little bit of volatility of many of the currencies. You have seen on the one hand it's of course great to have strong international sales, but some of these currencies are just a little bit volatile, and to hedge them gives a certain expense. A major part of this ForEx result was also influenced by Venezuela, where you know that you'll find nobody in this world who hedges this currency. And where just by decree, it was &#x2013; the exchange rate was changed towards the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>All the other elements I think are in line. You might be surprised that the interest expense was still a little bit higher, since we already had paid down a lot of debt in 2009 &#x2013; '10. But you might remember that actually the bonds only started to hit our P&amp;L in the &#x2013; at the first of April after the closing of Genentech transaction in 2009. So it was a year-on-year comparison that we had an additional quarter of interest expenses. So I personally think this should be the lowest financial result here and from now on it should be better.</p>
          <p>If we go into the group cash flow, I have explained year-on-year the development of the operating free cash flow. But I still think with CHF14.1 billion in operating free cash flow, this company is rock solid and one of the leading companies all around the world. And also the free cash flow, if you'll put it in comparison to the remaining net debt, so you'd see there this is a not a mission impossible to achieve our promise that we will get back to a net cash position by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>On page 61, you have seen &#x2013; you can see how we have already paid down the debt, but maybe chart 62 is even a little bit better to see that the maturity profile is actually extremely attractive now. Yes, there is a major debt burden, which has to be repaid in 2013. But I think things are developing exactly along our expectations that maybe even interest rates go slightly up and these remaining maturities are very attractive.</p>
          <p>Maybe just as a leaning back and a little bit enjoy, I decided to put in this chart of the five years credit default swaps. You see, when we started to finance the Genentech transaction, we were amazed that also Roche was in a huge net cash position actually. Our CDS rates were extremely high. You see this at the beginning of the first of September, 2008. So we had almost no debt outstanding and a very bad interim situation for our debt.</p>
          <p>And at this time &#x2013; and I have taken a benchmark, forgive me for taking Germany, but at the moment German Government bonds seem to be a certain gold standard in Europe, so I compare it with the gold standard. And of course as you would expect, when we then raised the Genentech financing, our CDS swap shot up. This was in the midst of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>But it is with a certain pleasure that I now show this chart and maybe it's a good moment to stop the chart here. But it should only get better. But that at the moment, the Roche bonds are &#x2013; seem safer than the German government bonds, I think is a good reference and this leads to chart number 64 with the situation of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now chart 65 &#x2013; and you can be assured that we are in full contact with all of you and our Investor Relations team constantly also during the call gets all these questions. So if we look into the outlook, of course, one question comes up again and again, what does high single-digit mean? But here I would invite you not to waste any time of the very short moment of Q&amp;A. I think this interpretation is definitely a privilege of our CEO.</p>
          <p>So, you will have Severin available this afternoon at 3 O'clock in London. You can ask him &#x2013; we have much longer Q&amp;A time in London. So we should not try to take into this issue what does exactly high single-digit core EPS growth in local currency mean for 2011.</p>
          <p>Another question which comes up around the table here as my team is flagging me is the situation of currencies. Yes, we have a reporting currency, which is the Swiss Franc and yes, at the moment it seems to be currency people like around the world and therefore it's relatively strong.</p>
          <p>If we go into the sales situation, we do not care too much in which currency we report, because what we look &#x2013; and that's why we always give the sales development in local currencies. I think this is the right yardstick how Roche is competitive all around the world.</p>
          <p>If we come to the profit situation, of course, currencies matter, but here you know that we have a very strict natural hedge concept so &#x2013; which means we hope that, or we steer the strategic business development in a sense that the local sales in one currency can actually cover the costs in this currency. So that altogether we do not have any currency transactions effect. So this works extremely well with the U.S. dollar. This works also very well with the Japanese Yen and many of the other currencies.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have one situation now which is that we have a much higher profit potential in the Euro area, because we have excellent sales in this area and not so much cost structures. And on the other hand, we have significant cost structures in Switzerland and also we have brilliant market shares. It's just by absolute size not possible to cover the cost. So the Euro-Swiss franc relationship has, of course, an impact on our Swiss francs' profitability.</p>
          <p>But altogether, we are not worried and we have received many questions so, how will the currencies develop, how will this impact the sales development? And I tell you frankly, if we would be confident in predicting the currencies, we would be much better off. So we are like all of you. We do not know how currencies develop.</p>
          <p>So with this, I would open the Q&amp;A session. And as I mentioned, please forgive us, this will be a relatively short session here, because Pascal, Dan and myself have to join the media conference, where Severin is already engaged at the moment. But we will have now 10 to 15 minutes for some few questions, and as promised, we will have an extensive session this afternoon in London and also in New York on Friday. So we &#x2013; and you can always pass on your questions to our Investor Relations team, so that maybe during the morning we can already bundle them and proactively start to answer them in our London presentation.</p>
          <p>So with this, ladies and gentlemen, we open the Q&amp;A session. May I have the first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] The first question is from Mrs. Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, several questions. Erich, you mentioned that the guidance &#x2013; sorry if I asked about the guidance &#x2013; accommodates all outcomes for CATT. And I was wondering whether you could give us any color on what possibly the worst-case outcome could be on Lucentis sales from CATT that is baked into this guidance. Second question, actually related to FX, the Avastin peak sales guidance was lowered from &#x2013; to CHF7 billion from the last figure we had that was CHF8 billion to CHF9 billion. Can you just tell us how much of that is really underlying, as in less breast cancer sales, and to which extents currency has had an impact hereon?</p>
          <p>And the third question is touching the same thing, when we look at your guidance, some of it is given in Swiss francs. That's the Genentech synergies and of course the Operational Excellence savings. How should we think about that? Are these always going to be the Swiss franc amounts which you're going to deliver or should we go back to the exchange rate at the time of the announcements and then figure out that that is what you're going to &#x2013; that that is more like an adjusted Swiss francs, again, which you're going to deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alexandra. I would pass on the two questions on CATT and Avastin to Pascal, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, thanks, Alexandra for this question. CATT &#x2013; first of all, our guidance accommodates what we believe will be potentially the outcome of the CATT study and we could manage within this. We decided we don't want to speculate around what the CATT results could be. Of course, this study is looking for non-inferiority between Avastin and Lucentis. More dramatic scenarios could play out, like Lucentis is fully superior or Avastin shows superiority. Those are much less likely scenario. The more likely, of course, is non-inferiority, but then you also have the safety question to consider.</p>
          <p>So in the end, we don't want to speculate around the outcome of that study and therefore it is difficult to answer your question. The only thing we can say is that the guidance enables us to accommodate the outcome of CATT as we see it. And remember that Lucentis represents 3% of our global sales, Roche Group sales. So certainly we can manage that.</p>
          <p>As far as Avastin, we revised the peak sales essentially because of the downside we see in the breast cancer indication, as I talked about a bit earlier today. The exchange rate effect is a little bit less than CHF500 million, I would say CHF400 million to CHF500 million, and everything else is essentially underlying, very much driven by what we see the downside could look like for breast cancer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to go back to Lucentis, you said it's only 3% of sales. But your guidance for the Pharma top line is obviously low single-digit. So, I'm just wondering whether the guidance includes the substantial decline &#x2013; or the possibility of a substantial decline of Lucentis. Or is that not included?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Alexandra, we stick to what we say. Our guidance will survive any outcome of Lucentis. That's what we want to say here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind for 2011 actually, Alexandra, that the results are not out yet. So, we expect the CATT study to read out and be published in the first half of 2011. Then the results have to come out. Then the consequences have to play out in term of what the payers decide, et cetera. So the impact on 2011 is not the impact of a full year, as you can imagine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Alexandra, for your third question, a very important question about the currency impact on Operational Excellence. I mean if you go back to the November presentation you received, you received actually a very, very detailed also geographic distribution of these measures. So you can actually calculate quite well where the impacts are, in which currencies they are. And what you will see is this is a very global program in the U.S. and also in Europe and other areas. And it is quite nicely naturally hedged.</p>
          <p>So, we stick to the amounts in Swiss francs as you have them in our outlook chart. And again you know, ladies and gentlemen, you find in the financial review on pages 20 and 21, you'll find the currency sensitivities as well for the sales impact for the major currencies, but also on the profit impact. Maybe you have to ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that was not hands-on enough for me. Sorry if I'm a bit slow, but Genentech synergies are much easier. This was a billion &#x2013; at the time it was announced, a CHF1 billion. In dollars, it was a much smaller figure. So have these numbers increased now? Is this &#x2013; or have the dollar numbers increased, so it's still CHF1 billion in 2011, or have they not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they &#x2013; we are absolutely on track that we are delivering these figures in Swiss francs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Next question, Mrs. Luisa Hector, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a follow-up on Avastin, so just to confirm, the reduction in the peak sales estimate that you now have is really due to the breast cancer or is there any changes in your expectation on ovarian? And with regard to ovarian, it's filed in Europe, but the U.S. filing is this year. Is that because you're waiting for more data to support that filing package?</p>
          <p>And then could you comment a bit further on the impact from healthcare reform? You said CHF500 million effect in 2011, how does that split between U.S. and ex-U.S.? And is there any particular exposure to say Egypt or Tunisia that we should be aware of it at this stage? And then a quick one on Diagnostics, just what is the expected market growth for 2011, please?</p>

          <p>Yeah, so the answer to the Avastin question is, I already mentioned the currency effect and the rest of concern is essentially breast cancer, the impact on the breast cancer indication. As far as ovarian, the filing in the U.S. is delayed indeed because the FDA requested us to submit additional data, additional analysis. So we will be doing this later this year.</p>
          <p>As far as healthcare reform, the CHF500 million impact is essentially the continuation of this &#x2013; the rebate to hospitals and Medicaid. So with &#x2013; that had an impact in 2010 and it will have a further impact in 2011. We estimate an additional CHF130 million or so in 2011 on top of 2010.</p>
          <p>Then there is the excise tax, if you'll remember, which by the way will not affect our sales. But it will affect our expenses. And then we have further &#x2013; sorry the excise tax is CHF150 million, as you probably remember. We mentioned that before. And then there is a further impact in Europe of a little bit more than CHF200. So, the total is about CHF500 million additional to what we experienced in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the market growth, the data we have so far for Diagnostics goes through the third quarter of 2010 and it demonstrates between a 4% and 5% growth globally. So, we would expect that trend to continue through 2011. It could be one percentages point up or down, but in that same range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just to add to Avastin, I mean, I understand your focus on metastatic breast cancer, but if you look at the other indications, also some of our competitors have thrown in the towel, because their promise, competitive products are not working. So, I think, Avastin has, as we point out, a lot of growth potential still without metastatic breast cancer.</p>
          <p>So if we can have the next question please. Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question Mr. Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a few questions. The first is on your guidance. In 2010, you gave specific R&amp;D spend guidance. I don't see that for 2011 and I'm wondering if at some point, we might be able to get that. Because while you've given Operational Excellence figures, it's hard to assess how you might be delivering on goals without having specific line item guidance on things like R&amp;D or SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Second question is on comments you made on emerging markets. In Herceptin, if I understand it right, you're suggesting you would price lower to gain volume in certain markets, which I think would be a departure from how you've thought about pricing in emerging markets in the past. So I'm wondering if you can just talk about how you think about other cancer drugs and maybe clarify if I'm wrong on the Herceptin comments you made. And then last question is on dalcetrapib, is dal-PLAQUE I likely to be presented at ACC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, emerging markets and dalcetrapib, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you so much for the question. The emerging markets, what I actually meant to say for both Herceptin and MabThera and my comments relating to those two products in particular, is that not that we will reduce our price on a broad-based basis. Certainly I didn't mean to imply this. What I meant to say is that we certainly will be flexible and we're looking to implement creative pricing solutions and agreements with payers around the world and, in fact, with some early success in some countries already. So we will indeed be flexible on the pricing. I can't tell you much more in term of how we want to go about this. But I certainly didn't imply a broad-based price reduction.</p>
          <p>On the dal-PLAQUE comment we &#x2013; the scenario for that, we are working to analyze the results and might make it to the ACC. I cannot confirm this today, but certainly our plan is to publish those results &#x2013; present those results at an important congress this year, possibly the ACC indeed, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to the R&amp;D guidance, I think that's another question I invite you to ask to our CEO in the afternoon. But it's very obvious, Roche is a science company and we do not apologize to be an innovation leader. Of course, as you have seen in the operational excellence program, we have also made considerable efforts and will be doing in the development field, but even in the research field. So overall, we will remain a leader, I think, in innovation, but we also are bringing efficiency into this line.</p>
          <p>With regards to the other line items, if you look into what we have delivered in 2010, you see very clearly that the Genentech integration, as we had promised by bringing two U.S. headquarters together, has delivered quite strongly on the G&amp;A line.</p>
          <p>And if you go into the November presentation of Operational Excellence, which still is available on the Internet, you see very clearly that additional elements of the admin, like finance, IT, we'll deliver improvements there. So you can see that we have the ambition to constantly improve each element of the P&amp;L and continue to deliver industry-leading operating profit margins in both divisions.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this leaves us for the time for one more question in the call, but as I mentioned, many more this afternoon in London. So last question, please.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The last question for this conference call comes from Mr. Keyur Parekh at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and I have two, one for Erich specifically and second for Pascal. Erich, in the sense of the dividends, isn't it slightly unfair to think about Roche relative to the rest of your peer group, given that you can't return cash to shareholders through stock buyback? So why shouldn't the Roche dividend be higher than the rest of your peer group from a payout perspective?</p>
          <p>And secondly, and I'm sorry for going back to this. But if I think about Avastin in 2010, really through 2011, so CHF6.4 billion in revenues in 2010, expected negative impact of CHF300 million next year net, brings me to CHF6.1 billion in 2011. Given that you've still got seven years of patent life on that product, are we coming &#x2013; I mean, why does &#x2013; doesn't the CHF7 billion peak sales number sound slightly confusing in that sense? Or are we coming to a penetration level for Avastin across emerging markets, Japan, China, where growth is likely to be fairly minimal? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, do you want to go ahead with Avastin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Keyur, thanks for the question. It's a very good question. It's a difficult one to answer, I have to say, because you will appreciate that there is still a lot of volatility in the breast cancer forecast of course. And the CHF7 billion, I have to admit might reflect the fact that we're taking a view that is relatively conservative with Avastin considering the environment as you see it.</p>
          <p>We see &#x2013; I have to say, we see still a lot of growth potential in colorectal cancer in the emerging markets. We're only starting with colorectal cancer there, only starting. Then we have ovarian in Europe, U.S. and the rest of the world of course. That should really be a substantial growth driver.</p>
          <p>Then if the TML study reads out the way we believe it will, we hope it will, then there is substantial upside coming out of treatment duration in colorectal cancer, in particular. So, we have factored in a substantial negative effect of breast cancer. You have to remember, our breast cancer sales are pretty large. So we'll have a substantial downside in the U.S. We believe, there will be some impact in Europe and the rest of the world as well, at the payer level essentially. And so we have factored all of that in. But I have to admit, it may well be that at this point in time, we're taking a little bit of a conservative view to the potential for Avastin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you may have &#x2013; if you followed development of peak sales guidance, we usually had to revise them up, but I think we also want to calm down the situation around Avastin and start from a very realistic platform and to build the product into what it deserves.</p>
          <p>With regard to the dividend, you see, we are very much focused on total shareholder return. And if you look at what we have delivered over the last four or five years &#x2013; yes, I respect last year the share price performance was not good. We have to respect this, but, if you look at dividend yields and long-term perspective, and I think we are totally competitive, but we listen to investors. We will do just another investor survey in the first quarter of this year to learn where the priorities are in today's environment. And we will have an open ear. But with this guidance, I think what we have seen with all our peers, we should continue to be competitive.</p>
