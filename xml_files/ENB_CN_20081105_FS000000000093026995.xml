          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enbridge Third Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Vern Yu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Enbridge's Q3 2008 earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; Steve Wuori, Executive Vice President,  Liquids Pipelines; and Colin Gruending, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I should advise you during this conference call we may refer to certain information that constitutes forward-looking information. Please take note of the legally required forward-looking information disclaimer in our slide, which generally states that you should not place undue reliance on the statements about the future since we necessarily apply certain assumptions to reach these conclusions about our future outcomes and future outcomes are always subject to risks and uncertainties affecting our business which include regulatory parameters, weather, economic conditions, exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.</p>
          <p>A more fulsome disclosure of these risks and uncertainties is available in our securities file. This webcast &#x2013; this call is webcast and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides which are available on our website. A replay of the call will be available later today and a transcript will be posted shortly thereafter. The Q&amp;A format will be the same as with the past few calls. The initial Q&amp;A session will be restricted to the analyst community. And once that's been completed, we invite calls from the media. I will also remind you that Colin, Pat Murray and myself will be available for follow-up questions after the call.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Vern, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. As you know, earlier today, we reported year-to-date adjusted earnings of $474 million, which is 8% higher than last year, and we reported third quarter adjusted earnings of $86 million, which were 9% higher than Q3 last year. This increase in earnings is primarily due to the progress that we've made on our first wave of liquids pipeline projects. We've now placed into service Waupisoo Pipeline and Phase I of our Southern Access expansion, and we continue to make excellent progress on building Alberta Clipper, Southern Lights, and the balance of the Wave 1 projects.</p>
          <p>The earnings contributions from these projects and the strength of the existing business allows us to be highly confident that we will realize earnings in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2008 and will allow us to grow earnings per share at 10 plus percent per year from 2007 through 2012, and Richard is going to provide the detailed review of the quarter in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Since we've just seen most of you at our recent Investor Day sessions in Toronto and New York, I'm going to try to keep my opening remarks quite brief today. But if you didn't get a chance to attend either one of those Enbridge Day events, I would encourage you to review a replay of the webcast on our website. And there you're going to find our take on the supply and demand fundamentals of North American natural gas and crude oil markets, also detailed updates on all of our Wave 1 and Wave 2 growth projects, an update on our financial projections and financing plans and, of course, a description of what we consider to be the safe haven nature of an investment in Enbridge. So all of that available online.</p>
          <p>At Enbridge Day, we focused on how Enbridge is a unique combination of safety, income and growth, and we've described it as an investment triangle. This has allowed us to significantly outperform the broader equity market and our peers in these very turbulent times. Since the start of the credit crisis in the summer of 2007, Enbridge has generated a 16-month total shareholder return of 22.5% on the TSX and 7.5% on the NYSE. The weaker performance on the NYSE is wholly due to the recent weakening of the Canadian dollar, where we have moved from close to par to about an 87 cent dollar in a month. So, excellent performance over a period of uncertainty. We believe that this superior stock performance in these very trying times is the direct result of the low risk nature of the business. And what I'd like to do is run through those risks, starting with capital cost risk, which we think is probably the most relevant today.</p>
          <p>We limit the capital cost risk by negotiating our new construction projects that limit our exposure to the capital cost, and generally what we tend to do is target a 12% return on equity with a plus or minus bracket of 2% on our return depending on how we manage costs. We've also, on top of that, established a major project business unit and that was done at the beginning of this year to ensure that our construction projects are now centrally controlled and managed.</p>
          <p>Secondly with regard to risks, we have little or no volume risk on the system. Over 80% of our earnings are from cost of service or take-or-pay contracts, and over 95% of Enbridge earnings are from regulated businesses. So once again, very low risk.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, with regard to commodity FX and interest rate risk, we've got a very wholesome hedging policy and we limit our exposure to market price to be less than 5% of adjusted earnings. So, when you see the price of crude oil falling off sharply as we have recently, you don't need to be concerned about your Enbridge investment. While, our second wave of growth is somewhat tied to long-term commodity prices, you will not see our day-to-day earnings impacted by commodity price.</p>
          <p>And lastly with regard to credit risk, almost 95% of our business is done with very large reputable energy and industrial companies. So, our contracts are with the large multi-national energy companies of the world, companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell, EnCana, Suncor. We do not have any appreciable exposure to the financial counter parties, and when we work with companies of a lesser credit quality, we ensure that we've got proper collateral in place.</p>
          <p>The current state of the capital markets, of course, is a concern for all companies, and especially a concern for those companies with significant growth plans. While our capital program is significant, we took early and appropriate actions to successfully finance wave 1. So, after you take into account our free cash flow, the sale of our Spanish asset CLH, our dividend reinvestment plan, and the recently completed $1.5 billion project financing for Southern Lights, our $12 billion capital requirement has been reduced to a debt requirement of roughly $2 billion and an equity need of only $600 million, and that's over the next four years. The aggregate of this funding requirement is less than the 3 billion of excess bank liquidity that we currently have in place. And this ensures that for the next few years we'll have a great deal of financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the impact that falling oil prices may have on our expansion projects. The first point is that our wave 1 projects, as I mentioned, are commercially secured and under construction, and this drop in crude prices will in no way affect their in service states or the earnings profile once they are placed into service. The only exception to this, of course, is the Fort Hills project, and over the last few weeks, you've probably read varying comments on the current plans for the project. We have been and will continue to work very closely with the Fort Hills partnership and have provided the partners with a number of different design scenarios to accommodate shipping either upgraded synthetic crude or raw bitumen.</p>
          <p>We expect a decision on the project in December and we continue to work towards the mid-2011 in-service date for the pipeline. The impact on the wave 2 projects is probably too early to know at this point and we believe that most, if not all, of these projects will still be required for a number of reasons. Firstly, these projects are further out in the 2012 plus timeline, and although oil prices have dropped in the last few weeks, long-term crude oil price forecast has not fallen as dramatically. And just as producers didn't use the $150 per barrel as a planning benchmark during the price run up earlier this year, they're probably not going to be using $65 per barrel crude oil long-term.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the bulk of the wave 2 projects are designed to extend the market, whether it's in the eastern PAD II, whether it's in the PAD I, the U.S. Gulf Coast, off the West Coast of Canada, and they're extending for Canadian producers to tie new oil sands production into the Edmonton and Hardisty pipeline hubs. These projects will ensure that Western Canadian producers get the best possible net backs, which would be even more important in a lower price environment. So in a lot of ways these longer-term projects make even more sense. And, of course, the Enbridge economies of scale will serve our customers very well in this environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, we believe that our phased approach to extending into these new markets is even more attractive in this financial environment as it requires less of a financial commitment by our shippers, and in some cases, no commitment at all, if it can be built into the mainline tolling structure.</p>
          <p>So that really concludes my prepared introductory remarks. Richard is now going to go through our financial and operating highlights for the quarter, and I'll come back again. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As released this morning, reported net income for the third quarter was 148 million compared to 78 million in 2007. And adjusting for non-operating items, third quarter earnings were 86 million or $0.24 per share, up from third quarter 2007 earnings of 79 million or $0.22 per share. So with the number of adverse external developments in Enbridge's business environment in the third quarter, you are seeing a live stress test of the low risk, safe haven aspect of our investor value proposition which Pat just spoke about.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we experienced another hurricane and a decline in commodity prices, which far exceeded the level of volatility anyone would plan for. Despite this, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 for the nine months held at a 7% lift over the $1.23 figure from last year. For sure, we were expecting a little stronger quarter and these external events will continue to affect us in the fourth quarter as well, taking a little of the icing off the cake for 2008. But we remain on track to hit our guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95, and our prospects beyond 2008 remain very strong, as Pat indicated.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through a quick summary of each operating segment, highlighting the major points for the quarter. Liquids Pipelines increased both in the quarter and the year-to-date as a result of AEDC being accrued for Southern Lights, and within the Enbridge System on Alberta Clipper and Southern Access expansion.</p>
          <p>In additional, we are seeing the impact of the Waupisoo Pipeline and other additional contract terminal infrastructure, which has been placed into service throughout 2008. This was somewhat offset within the third quarter as a result of wave 2 business development costs. The earnings contribution from our gas pipeline segment was down slightly for the quarter, continuing the pattern from the first half of the year. For the most part, this is as expected due to gradual rate base depreciation and foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>However, the performance of offshore was adversely affected by Ike to the tune of $4 million offsetting improving fundamental performance from Neptune and Atlantis. And we expect to see another 7 to $8 million impact from repair costs and lost revenue from Ike in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Sponsored Investments segment continued to perform well in the third quarter. The Liquids Pipelines segment within Enbridge Energy Partners was a strong contributor, largely offsetting the hurricane impact on the gas segment. And we received an increased amount through the GP incentive distribution mechanism. Likewise, the Liquids Pipelines segment within the Enbridge Income Fund is driving growth in earnings and cash flow for the Fund, supporting a 12% increase in the monthly distribution rate for 2009, which will further enhance our incentive distributions from Sponsored Investments.</p>
          <p>It's also notable that the fund has received shipper support for a further $100 million expansion of the Saskatchewan system to accommodate increasing oil production from the Bakken shale play. This is the same shale formation which is driving a similar expansion of Enbridge Energy Partners' North Dakota system. The potential from the Bakken is quite extraordinary.</p>
          <p>Gas distribution and services also performed better within the quarter and year-to-date due to strong performance within Enbridge gas distribution under the new incentive regulation regime. This performance was augmented by improved results at Aux Sable due to stronger margins, which have been locked in.</p>
          <p>Energy services was a drag for the quarter, taking back most, but not all of the favorable year-over-year pickup achieved in the first six months. This is where we felt the impact of commodity price declines, though well within our earnings at risk parameters and more than offset, on an overall basis, by the other positives within the segment.</p>
          <p>International results, of course, reflect the sale of CLH in the second quarter of this year and lastly, corporate costs are also lower due to the decrease in interest expense as a result of lower average rates year-over-year and the payback of debt from the proceeds received from the sale of CLH.</p>
          <p>Finally, we get a lot of questions on the road with respect to the impact of the current financial market turbulence on both the cost and availability of funding to us, so I'll update you on that. Pat has already discussed our funding requirements and the flexibility provided by our liquidity position to pick our timing on capital markets funding. However, as an investment grade credit, we continue to receive indications that we could issue term debt even in the current market.</p>
          <p>Spreads would be wider than previously planned, but all in rates not a great deal higher. We have the liquidity to wait for spreads to improve, but we won't wait too long to issue debt, because we prefer to maintain our liquidity cushion and not encroach on it very much.</p>
          <p>With respect to the inner debt costs on our earnings, there would be some, but not much. For nearly all of our $12 billion of commercially secured projects, financing costs are a pass through into tolls, and this applies to both construction financing and permanent financing. The only impact on our bottom line would be from the portion of our corporate debt, which isn't allocated to a specific project, but is leveraged against the overall portfolio. This is an impact which we are taking into consideration in assessing our growth outlook, but it is a small impact.</p>
          <p>So in summary, despite hurricanes, commodity price volatility, and financial market disruptions, we remain on track, both to meet our full year guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 per share, and to achieve our 10% plus average annual growth trajectory through 2012.</p>
          <p>That completes my remarks. So over to you, Pat, for concluding comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Richard. So to reiterate, despite a volatile third quarter in terms of financial markets and commodity markets, Enbridge remains on target for not only this year, but for the foreseeable future, while we continue to make very significant progress in constructing our wave 1 expansion projects.</p>
          <p>Finally, I think it's fair to say that Enbridge's unique combination of safety, income and growth, has allowed our stock to significantly outperform the broader Canadian and U.S. equity markets and all of our peers, both Canadian and U.S. peers, and we're very proud of that.</p>
          <p>So on that note, we can move on to the Q&amp;A. Vern?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Linda with TD Newcrest. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'm wondering if you can quantify the amount of business development expenses for Wave 2 projects in Q3 and what your expectation of a run rate going forward for I guess the balance of the year as well as 2009 and 2010 would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard or Colin, can you take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll take it. Q3 business development cost, I think ran us at a couple of million dollars higher than the corresponding quarter in the prior year. And I'm not sure that's indicative of what our running rate is going to be on a go-forward basis because I think we are looking at &#x2013; starting to manage those down to a certain degree. So, it's probably a little bit more of one-time blip than we would expect to see on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And if you can just clarify your revolving credit agreement with EEP of 500 million, would you expect that the magnitude of that agreement to grow? And for how long is that agreement in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a three-year term facility and when we display Enbridge's available liquidity, we lop that among off the top, because that is set aside for EEP. At the moment, there's no plans to extend additional liquidity to EEP over and above that. We believe what it has in place will be sufficient but we do have the ability do so if that were necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, Pat. I'm just curious as we see potentially the mix of oil sands projects move more to raw bitumen from synthetic crude oil. How would that affect your capacity plans going forward and the overall systems ability to deliver volumes to where they it has to be used by you guys' reclining system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just in general terms first of all, Andrew, if all of the projects went as scheduled but stopped at the bitumen phase, that would result in the need for more pipeline capacity ex-Alberta, because of course, you're transporting bitumen diluted say one-third, two-thirds for condensate, and hence it takes more pipeline capacity than if we were taking through to the upgraded stage. So, potentially stopping at that bitumen phase could be beneficial for pipeline capacity. And, of course, that's one of the beauties to the Enbridge System. As you know, we transport over 100 different types of crudes from refined products right through to heavy. So we were able to accommodate, no matter what the market does, whether it's upgraded crude, whether it's refined product, whether it's bitumen, we're able to move it.</p>

          <p>And your next question will come from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody. Pat, you'd mentioned in your comments that you're working with the shippers in the Fort Hills perhaps under different, different designs. Do any of those varying designs, do they radically change the scope of the $2 billion proposed projects or should we think of that right now with more sort of tweaks to the design change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there are various different alternatives that we've been looking at depending on whether the project proceeds as originally designed, whether it kind of stops at Phase I. And I guess, either Steve Wuori &#x2013; Steve why don't you take that, because you've been most closely involved. And we can't tell you everything at this point, Carl, because we're looking &#x2013; working in confidence with them. As you know, we've been selected as their pipeline provider and are working in confidence with them -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; I'll have to wait for their December announcement, but Steve can tell you some of the things that we've looked at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As you know, the discussion in the market has been whether or not the upgrader will get built in conjunction with the Fort Hills project on the same timeline that it was regionally planned for. And really all that would do is, is change the design of the system at the southern end where the upgrader will be &#x2013; would be sooner if they move ahead on the original timeline. And so the base design of the project to move diluted bitumen south from the mine site down to the Edmonton area and condensate moving back for diluent is really unchanged. It's really just a matter of the plumbing in the Edmonton and north of Edmonton in the Sturgeon County area that would change</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously, ENB terrifically positioned here from a liquidity standpoint. EEP needs a little bit more equity near term. Can you update us as far as perhaps what the status of that is? And here is the MLP market has recovered somewhat from pretty dismal lows. Is this something where if need be, ENB might look to take additional units from EEP if necessary? Can you just sort of give us a status update of what you're thinking here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That's one of the &#x2013; one of our considerations, Carl. But I'll let Richard just speak to the various alternatives that we've looked at on EEP liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess first of all, EEP does have an adequate liquidity position itself, maybe not quite as robust as Enbridge does but certainly between their facilities, the cash that they have got in hand and the facility they have with us, they've got a reasonable amount of room to run. They will &#x2013; as you've indicated need to raise equity at some point, to carry on with the capital expansion program that they've got, which is a very attractive and favorable capital program. EEP is looking at a number of alternatives to fund that program including asset sales and asset monetizations in addition to issuing equity. So we're &#x2013; our preference would be through some combination of those actions that it would be successful in achieving the level of equity that it requires. Enbridge could, as it has in the past, put additional equity into EEP, wouldn't rule that out but neither would I say that that's our preference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I &#x2013; understandable. Should we still think of that as roughly something that may occur by or around year-end?</p>

          <p>&#x2013; something to address the credit rating agencies' concerns whether it happens to be a small asset monetization or a combination of things.

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in aggregate we picked up &#x2013; relative to our expectations, let's measure it that way, about a $4 million bulb between the inventory adjustment and just lower operating performance in the environment which removed some of the opportunities there otherwise would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that $4 million was &#x2013; so I guess it was evenly split between the inventory and the just lower operating performance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions. One is on Aux Sable. There was a unrealized derivative fair value gain fact spread moved around a lot. Can you please just explain how that gain comes about and what your hedges look like, just relative to this year going into next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We pretty much have our Aux Sable earnings expectation built into our guidance locked in at this point for the year. So, it's really just a question of when that's recognized over the course of the year and we got a little bit more upside potential at this point, if things were to improve significantly in the next couple of months. But, we're pretty well locked for the year. In terms of rolling into next year, we would be already well along in our hedging program for next year and so as we role into guidance for 2009 will reflect what our expectations are there, but we've captured substantial amount of upside for 2009 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you book an unrealized derivative fair value gain in the quarter, Richard, is that because the hedges going forward through '09 are in the money relative to where the mark was?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Just of the 6.2 billion of the credit facilities, can you give a breakdown of the maturity scheduled by amount and year?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we follow-up with you on that, Robert? I should have had that handy, but I don't. It's a mixture of 364 day with one-year term outs, some three and some four-year facilities. But Vern will get back to you with the details on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That's great. My other question relates to the funding table that you have on slide eight. The first part, does that include Alberta Clipper as the estimated as spent costs versus the 2007 costs? And then secondly, when you look at just the timing, especially given the free cash flow is a little back-end loaded, do you &#x2013; when would you expect to address the residual equity needed based on your interim credit metrics, and then that free cash flow profile that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, with regard to the Clipper, it's the estimated as spent, so it's expected Clipper up-to-date. Richard, can you address the timing on the overall 600 million of equity over that four-year time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, I think we have a lot of flexibility on that in the near-term. But, you're right, the standing profile is front-end weighted and so the bulk of that 600 million, we will require in the next 18 to 24 months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. I'm just wondering to the extent that you've really started to think about potentially much different credit metrics have into the future. And then just drawing a contrast to the time that all the industries credit standards really tightened in the wake of the collapse of Enron back in 2001, early 2002?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. What's the question around that, Andrew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's just &#x2013; have you really thought about credit metrics changing dramatically to the point that say we had to have another 5 to 10% of equity in your capital structure and that's what the debt raters were really asking for &#x2013; for your lending specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And you're right. Sure, we have because your comparison back to the Enron days is very accurate. We saw some tightening in the actions that we took at that time. But I'm going to let Richard to speak more specifically to it because it has been an area of consideration to his job.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically in our go-forward plans, we have &#x2013; I wouldn't say we have made a quantum change in our capital structure but we have, for the reasons you just identified Andrew, we have notched up our equity capitalization versus debt capitalization by a little bit; hopefully sufficiently to reflect the concerns you have.</p>
          <p>We do obviously remain in pretty constant dialogue with the rating agencies, and at the moment at least, we're not seeing any indication on their part of a significant shift in expectations for our industry sector. They have pretty well established guidelines on those kinds of things for our industry sector and at the moment we are not seeing any indication that they will be looking for more than they have historically. But we have nevertheless, in our own plans gone a snick more conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think Andrew, just adding kind of a general comment to that, I think that we have proven again, as we did through the Enron era, and now this concern around credit, that companies that own and manage hard assets do well, and probably deserve better credit considerations than many that deal in financial instruments or other ways of booking earnings.</p>
          <p>And I looked back on it and felt that probably we were a little unduly pressured by the rating agencies post-Enron considering the fact that we were never in that business. And I think therefore we would expect the rating agencies to look through to the hard assets and not dramatically change the metrics for our industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may ask a somewhat related question. Just as it relates to your earnings at risk metrics internally, with the volatility we've seen in the last few months, has that caused you to rethink and revisit a lot of the parameters around your own risk metrics internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll comment generally and then Vern has put his hand up because he wants to respond to that as well Andrew. But I think as we indicated this has been a tremendous stress test of our EaR and look that we've come through the quarter, through the three quarters just right on target, right on budget, right on guidance. So I think it's working exactly the way we want to work. It's part of the Enbridge investment proposition and we're quite comfortable.</p>
          <p>This has been as dramatic a swing in commodity prices as we will see, or at least I hope. And we've come through it, I think, with shining colors. So I don't think we will dramatically change that. Vern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew I &#x2013; the earnings at risk metric is designed to look at how much the earnings would be impacted by two standard deviations, moving market crisis. What we saw was well beyond two standard deviations and when we go forward and measure earnings risk on a go-forward basis, we'll look at how volatility has changed over the last period of time and we will reflect higher volatility as we move forward, because of what's happened here. So, if we've just seen a very modest impact in our energy services division, you can see that our earnings, our actual Earnings at Risk are well below that 5%, that limit that we have for the corporation.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question on the International Financial Reporting Standards. And I'm wondering how far down the road is Enbridge in adopting these standards? What is the estimated total cost?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, has Enbridge tested how some historical results, for example, for 2007 would have fared under Canadian GAAP versus the International Financial Reporting Standards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure I'll &#x2013; Richard is going to respond to that Winfried. We are well into our planning towards movement to IFRS, as a matter of fact, they [had a] very thorough &#x2013; very through review with our AF&amp;R Committee yesterday and I'll let Richard tell you specifically where we are and where we think we are going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess I should say first of all that we haven't made a decision at this point, as to whether we will go with IFRS or whether we will elect for US GAAP which is an option that's available to us. We are weighing the pros and cons of both alternatives. The benefit of US GAAP, of course, being that our financials wouldn't really be materially different looking under US GAAP than they are at the moment.</p>
          <p>In fact we do a US GAAP note and you can see there is really not much difference. So, that's a decision that we are weighing. We're going to have to make that decision relatively quickly to maintain on track for implementation of either a conversion to US GAAP or a conversion to IFRS.</p>
          <p>Feedback we have from our external advisors with respect to our state of readiness and the preparatory work that we've done to go in either direction, is that we are a bit ahead of the pack, at least, consistent with peers and the rest of the industries or a bit ahead. So I think we are in good shape as we move ahead. There will for sure be some costs, there will be some costs really on either choice, conversion to IFRS or to US GAAP. Don't think we are in a position to specifically quantify those at the moment. I don't think that they will be material in the big picture, but there will be another little bit of cost along with SOX and various other regulatory costs that are current world imposes on us.</p>
          <p>And if I've missed anything Winfried, maybe you can just remind me of whether there was another question in there?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yes. That's right. We would intend to maintain that 51% interest. And you're right, we have indicated that we would be prepared to make up to 49% of the equity available to our partners, producers, refiners and First Nations and aboriginal groups.</p>

          <p>Hi, Linda. Those are transactions that hedged future sales of the commodity, and you would see that reverse over Q4 and Q1 of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so that was commodities that were owned by Enbridge or that are owned by three &#x2013; third parties and your fees are tied to commodity prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our marketing affiliate, Tidal Energy, does often purchase crude oil and sell crude oil on a forward basis, and the vast majority of the time, both the purchase and the sale are hedged, so the economics are known. So that's why when you see the adjusted earnings, you'll see very modest earnings numbers.</p>
          <p>But on a GAAP earnings basis, you'll see the full change in the fair value of the derivative, but not the full change in the fair value of the underlying crude oil. So the GAAP earnings show the change in the value of the derivative which is going up substantially, but not the change in the fair value of physical commodity, so there is a mismatch in the accounting of what's actually happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that will reverse when the transaction settles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you said Q4 and Q1 of next year, so that's &#x2013; Q4 '09 and Q1...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Q4 of this year and Q1 of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, clean-up question, can you breakdown the amount of AEDC in the quarter and how much was related to Clipper versus Southern Access expansion, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We've got, in total, about $15 million of the AEDC, about half of that is Southern Light and the rest of it is spread more or less evenly amongst the other projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other projects are just Clipper and Southern Access expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also Line 4 and other work that would be going on just in the normal course within the Enbridge system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, evenly between Clipper, Southern Access expansion, Line 4 and Mainline system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In round numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just &#x2013; just for clarification, Linda, on your earlier question on the unrealized gains &#x2013; hopefully, it was clear. But as those unrealized gains are realized, you're not going to see a sudden jump up in our earnings, because they are offsetting the other side of the transaction which is the physical side. So, the derivative gains will, in effect, hedge out or offset what will turn out to be physical losses on those transactions.</p>
          <p>It could have gone the other way where we would have had gains on the physical transactions and losses on the derivatives. The whole purpose there is to neutralize the impact of commodity prices on that type of business and just preserve the original plan margin that was built into those transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question will come from the line of Sam Kanes with Scotia Capital. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just curious on EGD, how are your tracking relative to your PBR expectations and what amount, if any, was in Q3 of consequence that could be broken out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I can break out a specific amount that's attributable to that. But I think our overall performance on EGD under &#x2013; our overall operating performance is a bit ahead of what we were expecting and, of course, with the incentive regime, we get to keep the first 100 basis points of that. So it's working out a little better than expected at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we would probably expect, Sam, that we would realize that 100 basis point upside that we forecast that we should.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that would be better than your guidance I presume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Switching, thank you for that. Your policy, or latest policy, if there is policy, on your ownership interest in Enbridge Energy Partners; you've over the years taken dilution gains by not participating, sometimes fully participating, this latest year, you did not fully participate. There is an Enbridge Energy Partners equity deal coming here down the road. Is there a methodology, is it happenstance, how do you look at this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there is a methodology. It's pretty much the economics of the transactions, Sam. And, as you know, we started out, I think, when we IPO'd, we held about a 20% interest and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gradually diluted that down to 9 or 10%, because effectively, as the taxable entity, the economics of investing are &#x2013; were best in the hands of retail investors. However, with the unit price where it is today, those dynamics changed a little bit. So that's something that we constantly evaluate as we go along and the opportunity comes to participate or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's strictly economics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it is &#x2013; well, it's &#x2013; I shouldn't say it's strictly economics because there is, the overriding issue that we know that investors want to see strong support from the sponsoring company, they are sponsoring Sea Corp.</p>
          <p>So when we dropped down around 9 or 10% we felt that that was as low as we wanted to go and you saw us turn around with the case and reinvest, in part, because we wanted to show strong support from Enbridge's sponsors. So, there is a limit as to how low we would go.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will now take questions from the media. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Haggett. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. I'm just wondering, you say you can still issue debt, so can you give me some sort of sense if possible on how much you would look to tap the market this year and next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I don't know whether you have the visuals in front of you from our website, Scott, but basically what we're indicating over our five-year planning horizon is we're going to need to access capital markets for about $2 billion of debt. Again, that will tend to be more in the front end than it will be in the back-end to that five-year period of time.</p>
          <p>And we do have sufficient liquidity on our bank lines that there's no pressing need to do that really for a considerable period of time to come. We've got over $3 billion of liquidity on our bank line. So I don't think we are driven to a particular timetable but as I mentioned, our objective would be not to eat in too far into that liquidity cushion if we could see a reasonable opportunity in the market. So, we'll sit and wait until we see an opportunity to issue at what we feel are attractive spreads, they may not be as good spreads as would have been possible a year ago but, we'll wait till we see something a little bit better than what we're seeing at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one of the &#x2013; Scott, that's one of the advantages of having the liquidity that we do, we're able to time our entry into the market to suit us and to get the best rate possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question, if I could. Have you found replacements for Lehman &#x2013; complete replacements for Lehman in your banking group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We haven't done that at this point. We did have one bank come in a little earlier for a piece of the Lehman obligation but we haven't moved ahead at this point to replace them. That's a relatively small amount, in our Enbridge facility, it's about 40 million out of that 6.2 billion. So it's less than 1%.</p>
