          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AmBev's 2Q 2010 Results Conference Call. Today with us, we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for AmBev; and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer session. At that time, further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of AmBev's management and on the information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operating factors could also affect the future results of AmBev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Jamel, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Bejay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2010 second quarter results.</p>
          <p>Before I start, I would just like to remind you that as usual the percentage of change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items. Any special items are either income or expense, which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT, and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter. And then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-Ex, Quinsa, and Canada. I'll close by providing more specifics regarding the second quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the second quarter, our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$2.42 billion, which represents a 4.7% organic increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009, while our margins contracted 270 basis points to 42.7.</p>
          <p>Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 11.7% in the quarter, supported by a 12.6% volume growth and by a 5.2% revenue-per-hectoliter growth with EBITDA margin decreasing by 270 basis points to 45.1%, driven by higher cost of goods sold in the period as anticipated mainly due to currency and packaging costs and higher SG&amp;A due to market investments to support our brand.</p>
          <p>In HILA-Ex, we delivered a negative EBITDA of R$3.4 million in the quarter and registered an organic decline of R$28.9 million versus the same period last year mainly due to the worst performance of the Venezuelan operation.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations delivered a 7.3% EBITDA growth during the quarter, thanks to a 15.3% EBITDA growth in the beer business. This volume is up 5.4% while soft drinks volumes were down 2.2% and EBITDA 30% down due to higher input costs, mainly sugar as well as SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In Canada, domestic volumes decreased by 5.5% in the quarter due to both industry decline and market share loss while our EBITDA declined by 11.1% of margin decline in 230 basis points.</p>
          <p>Normalized profit reached to R$1.5 billion in the quarter, which was 9.6% higher than last year. Normalized earnings per share increased by 9.1% in the quarter. I'll comment further on profit at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as he starts to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Starting with the industry trends, we saw a better performance across most markets in which we operate, except for Canada and Venezuela. And consolidated beer volumes delivered solid growth of 8.3% in the period, mainly driven once again by our Brazilian operation.</p>
          <p>Going deeper into Brazil, the positive macroeconomic environment continues to support the good performance of the industry, and our focus on innovation and brand equity continue to deliver very good top-line results. Specifically regarding Beer Brazil, the positive trends we saw in the first quarter continued and we reached a market share of 70.6 for the quarter, 220 basis points higher than last year.</p>
          <p>As a result of the combination between market share gains and industry growth, Brazil Beer's volumes grew 13.7 in the quarter also benefiting from the World Cup event in June. Talking about innovation, Antarctica Sub Zero brand continued delivering important results along with the one-liter returnable glass bottle rollout while Brahma Fresh growth remains strong in the Northeast.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had the first quarter of our new line extension, our Skol 360&#xB0; and recently the new visual identity for Brahma as part of our innovation and renovation efforts, which have been and should continue to be very important contributors to our results this year.</p>
          <p>All this innovations combined with the relevant and differentiated brand position for our three main brands Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica as well as the strong World Cup activation for Brahma and Skol are also driving brand equity.</p>
          <p>For example, while Brahma activated the events through the official sponsor angle, Skol did it bringing to the market, the Talking Can consumer promotion were two of the big hits here in Brazil. As a result even in a very noisy and immediate scenario, both brands were in the top three ranking of the most recalled World Cup related advertising, which is very good news.</p>
          <p>Our Beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil increased by 5.2% this quarter, as a result of increasing beer and beer prices last year before the summer season. Our price increase during the period were slightly offset by packaging mix, while excise tax remains flat versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about our COGS or cost of goods sold in Beer Brazil. The cost per hectoliter was up 15.2% in the quarter as we were negatively affected by higher packaging costs including the impact of imported can and the currency hedges as previously stated in the previous quarter. For the remainder of the year currency hedges will have a neutral impact on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization grew by 14.8% in the year as a result of volume growth, general inflation, incremental investments to support our innovation facing of expenses prior to the World Cup as well as higher logistics costs as a result of the change in sales mix towards the North and Northeast as we also mentioned in the Q1.</p>
          <p>From our last year EBITDA finished the quarter with growth of 16.5% versus same period last year and EBITDA margin declined by 130 basis points. Our soft drinks volumes in Brazil delivered a 9.3% growth in the quarter as a result of improved macroeconomic and industry conditions, while we kept our market share flat, standing at 17.7 as an average for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew 2.9 organically in the quarter as we continue to be impacted by price increasing, <mark type="inaudible" /> inflation from last year, partially offset by product mix and promotion activities in isotonics. Cost per hectoliter increased organically by 36.7 as a result of our currency and sugar hedge impact revenue.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization decreased by 5.3 and is viewed as a result of marketing phasing and lower bonus accrual partially offset by general inflation, volume growth and logistics cost. Our EBITDA posted in the quarter a negative growth of 7.6, with a margin contraction of 940 basis points. Year-to-date EBITDA is 1%, down versus last year, but will go back to the growth path for the balance of the year. The worse is behind.</p>
          <p>Turning to the HILA-Ex, volumes increased by 1.5 in the period as a result of a better industry evolution in most of the countries where we operate, except for Venezuela. HILA-Ex EBITDA decreased by 28.9 million, posting our first negative growth in four quarters, mainly driven by performance in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Moving onto our operations in the South of Latin America, we achieved a 7.3% EBITDA growth supported by our beer business, which posted higher volumes as a result of a better industry performance in the region and market share is stable or above last year in every country. This beer growth was partially offset by poor soft drink results, where we have already put in place the necessary action plans aiming at improving revenues and recovering profitability.</p>
          <p>We're heavily supporting our mainstream and premium brands in all of the countries. We develop strong campaigns and innovation and an increasing communication, renewing visual identities and gaining presences in all of our markets. We used soccer World Cup throughout the zone through sponsorship and campaigns, also developed winter campaigns and increased our time on air with great content to communicate our brand attributes.</p>
          <p>In the premium segment, we continue to achieve positive results with Stella Artois and the local premiums. Stella keeps gaining sharing in its segment and further developing the category. Our efforts at reducing costs and expense compensated the negative impacts of higher labor and transportation cost. We're benefiting from effective hedges in aluminum and currencies while suffering increases in soft drink <mark type="inaudible" /> and sugar.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, our soft drinks operation is showing a strong EBITDA contraction. Even though we recognized some difficulties to maintain the profitability we drive, this particular quarter is being affected by the phasing of price increases, marketing investments to defend our share, and increasing raw materials. We are confident that we will achieve better results soon as the industry begins to recover and revenue management initiatives are in place to recover margins.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada, the Labatt second quarter was characterized by top-line decline and a higher commercial expenses due to phasing of our marketing investments which drove an 11% EBITDA drop versus the prior year despite positive cost per hectoliter evolution. Volumes were down 5.5% versus the second quarter of 2009. It was mainly due to domestic sales, which were impacted by an estimated industry decline of 2.1, and a domestic market share loss of 1.8 share points. 80% of the share loss impact on our domestic volume was on the core embedded segments, while we grew or kept stable our market share on the light and import specialty segments, which were the ones growing in the Canadian market.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our net sales per hectoliter declined 0.8%. The domestic business improved slightly versus prior year despite the tough comparison. In the second quarter last year, we had increase of 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2008. However, a 15% appreciation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar ratio drove a decline in the export net sales per hectoliter and the overall measure.</p>
          <p>We have launched a refreshed promotional grid across the country to ensure we are competitive in all of our markets and appropriately leveraging our strong national brands. Cost per hectoliter declined by 5.8% in the second quarter as lower commodity hedges significantly increased improvements in the lower fixed cost base all combined to direct cost lower versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation increased by 4.9% in the quarter entirely due to incremental market investment spacing whereas distribution and <mark type="inaudible" /> expenses actually declined as a result of lower volume and reduced overall overhead expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving into the back half of the year, our priority is actually to improve the market share and profitability in a balanced way and to leverage the strength of our brands and commercial products combined with tight cost management in order to deliver top-line improvement and bottom-line growth.</p>
          <p>Going back to the overall AmBev's business, I wanted to wrap up by saying we are confident to be in the right direction. Although we had a softer EBITDA growth in the second quarter due to anticipated cost pressures and market investments in Brazil as well as services in other markets, we outlined the necessary action plans to address all in each of our main challenges and opportunities. And the same time, we see easier comparisons from many regions, including Canada and Latin America South.</p>
          <p>Particularly in Brazil, we see continuous benefiting from a positive momentum in terms of industry and share and we will have a favorable currency hedge behind us, while we're moving steadily with our capacity expansion projects. As a result, our consolidated year-over-year organic EBITDA growth should be higher than the one delivered on the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to our cost connect win approach and we will continue investing behind our brand and focusing our innovation to deliver sustainable and profitable results.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to say and I'm confident that we will succeed in our plans, thanks to the quality of our people, for the major assets of our company.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to go back to Nelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final session, I'd like to guide you through the main items that lies between normalized EBIT of R$2 billion and normalized profit of R$1.5 billion is disclosed on page three of our release. Our net financial results reached R$105.5 million, which is 57.7% lower than last year. This is explained by lower net interest expense as a result of our lower debt and interest rate, which were offset by loss on derivative instruments relating to the results of our ongoing hedge policy as well as loss related to currency effects over trade payables mainly Venezuela and Labatt.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the period increased to 22.2% compared to 21.6% last year. The main reason for this increase is a higher EBIT, earnings before tax, which is taxable at the full rate. Cash generated from operations in the second quarter added up to R$2.5 billion, which is 8.9% better than the second quarter of 2009 adding up to R$4.97 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Our net debt liquidity was R$857 million at the end of June compared to R$3.2 billion at the end of December 2009 while year-to-date dividends and interest on capital payments were close to R$1 billion. On July 30, we submitted a request for registration of a simplified product offering in Brazil due to our subscribers' shares during the period from April 30 to May 31 in connection with the capital increase approved at the shareholders meeting held on April 28, 2010.</p>
          <p>We announced that following the conclusion of this offer, estimated to be completed until September, a Board meeting will deliberate with respect to the proposal of the company's management for a payment of dividend and interest on capital of approximately R$2 billion.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to the operator and open up for questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, everyone. You mentioned that you're working towards a performance improvement in Argentina and Canada. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about the initiatives that you have in place in those markets? It seems like you have been pressured by market issues and competitive issues. So I was curious if you see some of that subsiding a bit or it's as a result of some of the initiatives that you put in place that you think those markets, I guess, at a sequential basis should improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren. This is Jo&#xE3;o. I think this question fetches a lot of points of the quarter where we were under pressure somewhat in both markets. I would say that the difference &#x2013; there is a big difference between both markets. I would say that Argentina, I would start by with Argentina. I think Argentina in the short-term had more an issue of phasing, both on net revenues as well as marketing expenditures, okay. So I think given the scenario, we suffer inflation, I think the cost results for Argentina was good. And it continues to be good or better, okay. And the phasing of pricing should help us going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of planning places, I would also differentiate in Argentina two situations, okay. That's not true for the whole Latin America side, but given that Argentina is 50% of the results. Let's talk a little bit more about Argentina. I think there is a big difference between beer and soft drinks. I just saw the beer results for the zone and I'd say that reflects Argentina, grew 15%, while soft drinks declined by 30%.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, it's a big difference. I think in beer, therefore, everything that we did behind the Quinsa, brand and everything that we're doing behind also the Stella brand are paying off. Stella is on a run, I mean it already has 5% point of market share as a price positioning 50% above Quinsa taking share, continue taking preference. We made great results on that.</p>
          <p>Quilmes is of course our main brand. We are bringing a lot of new drinks into the brand. They are already in the marketplace and we have some more news that I cannot get into a lot of details. They will continue to come as the year progresses. But even the current results I think is a very positive one. It will only get better from here on, okay, for the reason I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Regarding soft drinks, soft drinks has been under much more pressure in Argentina for two reasons. I think one is the same pressure that you see in the Brazilian results, which is cost, mainly sugar, but to a certain extend also PET, but let's say the elasticity of soft drinks, which is usually higher than beer, reached a very strong impact in Argentina with some trading down to water sometimes, to power juices sometimes, with something that we see in the Latin American markets from time to time.</p>
          <p>This is currently happening or it happened for the past, like, three or four quarters already in Argentina. But we are seeing the market recover somewhat both in terms of volume. There is volatile but also in terms of profitability. I think part of the industry had pressure recover, some of them off the volume and to a little bit more aggressive than I think unit price. I think that is receding a little bit on phasing, but I think a little bit on attitude as well. So I see one-for-one strides being strong, but getting better, which is a  real one. I see the other one not as strong, but getting better in both the, let's say, the marketing phasing standpoint, the pricing activity and then the volume growth, I would say out of the three that I just mentioned, volume is the one that I think will be slower than the rest, but more than enough to have a brighter second half.</p>
          <p>Now, talking a little bit more on Canada, I think Canada, we are, not that we're satisfied with the Latin American stock results, I would say that we are less satisfied with the Canada results. I'm definitely not happy with this. We have seen since the second half of last year, a much more intense price activity in the marketplace. We thought this was going to be less so on this quarter, but was really not the case. We continue to be committed to balancing market share growth and profitability, okay? So I mean we actually have been doing this in the past years. We had a view that the second quarter was going to be somewhat different, it wasn't. I mean, you saw our net revenues per hectoliter, which in the domestic, was much more stable than the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>If we need to be a little bit more aggressive in the short term, we will not forget profitability here. We do not look to gain share. At any cost we will remain rationale, but we will answer, if things continue to be the way they were.</p>
          <p>What we also saw in this last quarter or last half or so, you see us supporting our brands and programs, okay. There is some failure, but there is also us supporting the programs. We may do so &#x2013; continue to do so more in the back.</p>
          <p>But also I would like to highlight that two things, I mean, I think both, we continue to have very good SG&amp;A control and results and we are launching new programs to continue to find working money to reinvest &#x2013; non-working money to reinvest in marketing and sales without needing to increase or to substantially increase the SG&amp;A. Also the cost of goods sold, which had a good result and going forward we think we continue to have that. If we continue to have that in such <mark type="inaudible" />, the net revenue issue, I think we're going to do better.</p>
          <p>In order to do that, we're going to have to deal with the complexity of this market, which we know. And our challenge in the short term, I would say is to design an effective approach on a province-by-province basis, understanding what are the opportunities that will yield the best results to our activities. This is what really happens in Canada, different responses in different markets, one thing that we've been doing for the past year or so successfully and now competition is quietly following through with innovation.</p>
          <p>I mean about a year ago, we came out with Bud Light Lime, it was a big hit. Now we are lapping the launch of Bud Light Lime of last year, so tougher comps. We mentioned the launch of Bud 4 last quarter and that's starting to yield some results also. The consequence of some of those things is that we have gained share on the Light segment, which we have one of our lowest participation together with import, which are probably bulk up the areas where we have opportunities going forward in some of the locations that we are bringing. We will be direct that &#x2013; those segments, while we see competition gaining share from all of value segments in the short term. That's why we feel that in both cases, the worst is behind us in terms of &#x2013; in the first half and we look to a brighter second half for both operations for the reason I just stated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a quick follow-up on Canada, I know you mentioned pricing may be a little bit in flux there, but in response to what your competitor is doing, do you think there is a need to really readjust your strategy for the second half or you could just keep doing what you've been doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will depend a lot on the very short term. What I mean by that? What we see competition doing and actually also saying is that they felt they need to readjust the base. If the readjustment of the base that they plan to do is done, then I think there will be little to be done. If they are not done, it will be different. So it will depend on just readjusting the base, it's over or not over. If I have to give you my impression, I think this was done, and therefore there is less pressure than more pressure going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you and good day, everybody. Jo&#xE3;o, a question with respect to the cash. It's piling on for &#x2013; within the next few months, it looks like you could be net debt negative, right, so you'd be cash positive. And I was curious, would you be willing to buy a non-controlling stake in a major Latin American brand asset? And absent a transaction, what do you think is the right capital structure for AmBev and what do you think is the best use of your free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. It's Nelson here. Let me pick up your question. I think we guided the cash that is piling up as you said. I think first of all, we are very proud of the cash flow generation we have in the sense that not only the EBITDA growth is also helping us to generate cash, but also our working capital management has been clearly quite significant, because it can fully benefit from this great momentum in terms of EBITDA. I mean for us to have an idea, we generated so far R$5.1 billion in terms of EBITDA and given the fact that even stepping up the CapEx investments this year, we were still able to generate R$3.5 billion of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>So that was only possible because we are keeping, for instance, a negative working capital, our working capital is minus R$1.2 billion, which have been evolving over time and continue to manage it proactively. So that said, indeed we start to have a good problem. And as we always said, what we do with the cash, we constantly assess the alternatives we have, you mentioned &#x2013; of course, we are going to speculate for any possible acquisitions. So talking about the use of cash, what we have been doing is to look into the alternatives we are investing into, as I said, higher &#x2013; we had a higher CapEx <mark type="inaudible" /> plant in Brazil.</p>
          <p>If you look at our free cash flow year-to-date, plus also our active or proactive capital structure management, we use it out of the 3.5 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> where I take out 1 billion as interest on capital and through dividends. We already proposed it to the Board or we have taken to the Board a proposal of additional 2 billion that is just at this stage depending on the conclusion of the offer, as we announced it. So 2 billion with 1 billion we'll have pretty much margin rate of free cash flow of 3.5 billion with a definitive estimate.</p>
          <p>So in the end of the day, we have always and reportedly assessing this cash at this stage prioritizing to increase our capital and dividends, and we always prioritize it just on capital, that's the historical reason why our leverage is so low. So we can fully benefit from the fiscal advantages that we get today through some capital payment, and that's how we are going to move along.</p>
          <p>Every recommendation we took to the Board in the last two years, we've got the capital to do what's expected. So my point is that the Board usually accepts our recommendation and then so far, we are recommending 3 billion &#x2013; we recommended 3 billion payout out of a 3.5 billion free cash flow generation in the first semester.</p>

          <p>And then just lastly with respect to the possibility of a non-controlling stake in any brewer, right, in the region. Is this something that you entertain if the price is right or is it something you kind of rollout back to control?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I think it's more of a speculation, Bob, than anything else. In the past we have only taken non-controlling when we see some sort of a path to control later on, okay. So &#x2013; but again, it depends on a case-by-case, I'd rather not speculate on that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Lore Serra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah. I wanted to follow-on with the same line of thought. If the cash flow generation stays at the current pace I think you'll get to something like R$7 billion for the full year. Should we expect to see &#x2013; I mean, in the absence of an acquisition, should we expect to see R$7 billion of dividend or interest on capital or does it get to be &#x2013; the numbers get to be too inefficient and you can't do it efficiently?</p>
          <p>And I guess related to that, is there a point in time when instead of kind of each half year we see kind of what you did with the cash you'll actually sort of have a more regular dividend policy? Because I guess the other thing is even if you dividend all your cash flow, you still have an awful lot of spare debt capacity if something strategic does come about. So why not just kind of state a policy of dividending out all the cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lore, this &#x2013; well, again following up on this question, as I said, these are kind of problem right as we said, is a good problem, but is a problem. Just said, that we have this important amount of cash that we are going to deal with the same way we did for the first half. My point is, we're going to attract opportunity. We cannot speculate, let's say, on future Board decisions or future management recommendations to the Board because we're may be a little bit too early on that. I mean, for the second semester you have to look at the consensus, we could really get you to 7 billion, at least that's the average of the report, the analysis that the company provides. But there is no &#x2013; can give no assurance that the same way we look at the first 3.5 billion in the first semester and proposes pretty much to paid out. There is no assurance we can give. For the balance of the year we think that the Board will take the decision in due time.</p>
          <p>Looking again at the debt level that we have, even if you would be cash in all the free &#x2013; the entire free cash flow, it's lower, it's below the average of the industry. But as I said we always work it below these average, given that it better updates you some capital payment in Brazil that's pretty much the key reason why we do that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I think on Canada maybe a little more color if we could ask for both the context that was given by your major competitor there for the second quarter suggested that weather in BC was particularly bad. And I am assuming you don't have that, the rest of the year you don't have such a bad spell. One would like to think that that would be a tailwind. And in fact, the other comment that was made on their conference call was that volumes so far this quarter are benefiting industry-wide and unlike nationally from much better weather, a very good weather, I should say, in July. Is that something that you've experienced as well or is that may be unique to them, I'm talking about the better weather now in July and August? And also, if you agree that the BC issue was something that might have hit you a little bit harder given your strength out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Celso this is Jo&#xE3;o. We are not going to give any comments regarding July or August so far. I mean, what we do expect is maybe better volumes going forward, but again, it's very early to say. We saw some of the job creations in Canada, even better than in the U.S. or it seem that the economy is reacting somewhat. That combination and the comps of last year gives us some expectations again that the volume could be better going forward. But still, I mean, it has been volatile enough that is difficult for us to forecast and to give a better indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to finish up on Canada. One of the &#x2013; you talked about better second half as well. Obviously, there was a bit of a margin deficit in the first half of the year. Is it unreasonable to assume that in spite of the fact that you mentioned perhaps slightly increasing marketing expenses, if I heard you right, that margins could be flattish with last year, i.e. profitability, structurally or, excuse me, cyclically doesn't deviate that much on a year-to-year basis? Or is the marketing spend that you're contemplating potentially something that might weigh on margins more in the second half than it might have been in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think my point there, Celso, were &#x2013; I mean, first, when we look at the things we control, I think the results of the first half were good in terms of cost of goods sold. And our view is that they will continue to do so potentially even better going forward. So, that helped us in any way, shape or form. The same thing is true for SG&amp;A. I think overall a good result, I think it can continue to be good, controlled, but with enough power to fight in the marketplace to support investment behind our brands. So I think those two things, but the comps will certainly help us on the second half. Also through that share-wise there is some potential comps there. But I would say that the things that I just mentioned are stronger and explain more why we feel that the second half will be a better one, a much better one than the first one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nelson here. Sure, the statement is still valid. We're not pursuing a net cash position and, as I said, we remain committed to looking into the best investment alternative possibilities can be CapEx to grow organically our business in the different markets where we are. I think we have a great opportunity in the Brazil and we're continually investing behind our assets in Brazil, also outside the Brazil in the countries where we are present. So we've always continued to look into good opportunities &#x2013; good decent opportunities, that's our business, right? But of course, in the end of the day, if we're getting even more cash than we need or the opportunity with much debt are available for the investment in the short term, we will give the prioritization to the cash instead of moving it from our net cash position. That's not the goal at all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And the operating question I have had to do with the gross margin in Brazil in the year. How much of the contraction is due to the hedges and how much &#x2013; are we seeing some change in trend in the consumer towards more non-returnable presentation to ROI, in the sense that I mean part of the issue had to do with &#x2013; do you have to buy extraordinary amount of cans. And I'm wondering if you're seeing some permanent rather than cyclical change in term of consumption in Brazil moving more towards can and non-returnable presentations that have a lower gross margin?</p>

          <p>Yes, even versus last year. So, I think in the very short term, I think, the decline was even worse than anyone could have anticipated. We continue to look for different alternatives. I think that's as much as we can say. I mean, I would say that at this point we are considering several alternatives to have that situation soft. I mean, that's as much as we can say. Actually we've been saying this for a few quarters now, but any sort of exit strategy to change the landscape of what we have there, it's not the one that is overnight. So we continue to build the track to find a solution, but I don't have a statement to tell you that within the next six months or in a year or so this will be soft. But I would not say neither that we are not looking, considering different strategic alternatives regarding Venezuela.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking in my calls and let me ask my question. I don't know if you could give us some color on the expansion on beer on Brazil and the timing of the plant, and if there that could mean the material impact or improvement in the logistics cost in the short term. Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luis. Well, first, when we mentioned at the end of last year, beginning of this year, about the new capacity expansion, I mean they were &#x2013; we were saying they were starting simultaneously. So a lot of the new capacity is coming now. Okay. So as you see, our CapEx and also in our reported statement, you see it happening as we speak. If you come and visit some of the plants, you'd be amazed by how much activity is going on. So those are good news. In terms of what we see going forward and its impact on logistics cost, of course, you're also right. I mean, given that we are expanding some of those plants in the North and Northeast, as those plants coming to fruition for the end of the year, but also for 2011, we will definitely benefit on the logistics cost for the end of the year, but for the most part, for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. If I could just follow-up with the question on the market share, of the 220 basis points you mentioned on a year-over-year growth, is there any specific region you are gaining share or is this overall due to the rollout of the new presentation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are gaining share in pretty much the whole country, for the most part, and it's a combination of the new presentations, be it either liquid or package. So, different regions will respond differently for the different initiatives. We also have new market programs in place that are also helping us. But we are gaining different amounts for the different regions and, of course, we also started to rollout for the most part last year in the South and in the Southeast. And towards the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, we started launching towards the North and the Northeast, which offers continuity to this much higher growth in the North and Northeast, we still have some light areas. The new CapEx that is coming to fruition now will also help us in the next month or so, whether third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter next year, to continue to roll out the initiatives that are already working in some other areas, but also regarding some of the new, new innovations that we just launched, in some cases, as pilot, in other cases, as full implementation. And I mentioned in my initial speech, the <mark type="inaudible" />.  This is all in one state, it's working well, we are analyzing it so that when you roll out, we do the best rollout possible. So we still have some tricks in the tool box as things move forward.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nelson and Jo&#xE3;o. A quick question, the problems of imported cans, is that finished now and as we go into Q3 should we expect that to go away or are you still having to import cans for Q3 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Trevor. This is Jo&#xE3;o. No, it hasn't got any better in any way shape or form. In which sense? I mean when we &#x2013; I think the &#x2013; actually think the imported can I will &#x2013; I'm actually selling you is a good thing. Let me explain why. I think earlier on in the beginning or the end of last year, we noticed that there was a potential demand for this and earlier on we started contacting suppliers abroad to import cans to Brazil. This growth continues to be in place, time to fruition or for investment in cans for it to be running around one year. It could be 10 months to 16, 18 months. So there is a lot of new can lines from our suppliers, starting to work on first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>So this problem will really go away only in the beginning of 2011, because they only noticed this late last year, therefore they made the investment late last year and these investments are going to start, have their startup in the beginning of 2011. So for Q3 and Q4 we still have an important impact, but remember the biggest impact on COGS was more the unfavorable currency hedges and not the imported can. So the unfavorable currency hedge will not be there, but imported cans will be there for the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood that. And a follow-up question Jo&#xE3;o, if you look at momentum and rate of momentum and Q2 versus Q3. Clearly Q2 benefited from the World Cup and perhaps through some element of overhang of stock after the relatively early exit of Brazil. Does that mean that we should expect slightly slow momentum in Q3 than in Q2. Just because the World Cup isn't there and there might be a little bit of excess stock in trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, first, disappointed with the early exit of Brazil. It's sad that you had to remind me about that. But we're also, I mean, I would like to take <mark type="inaudible" /> to say that we're very excited about the prospect of the Brazilian business going forward, okay. Specifically talking about the impact of the early exit on the very end of June, I don't think this will make a huge difference to be quite honest. What I think makes a difference, when you look at our growth is that in 2009, first half, we grew 7% more or less on average. And we grew around 12% on the second half, so second half of 2010 has harder comps if you want for us to face.</p>
          <p>So the growth of the compound is maintained, will be a lower one for the second half. But again, we're still excited with the status of the macro economy in Brazil, with its impact on the Brazilian beer business and especially with the different things that we're doing in the marketplace that we certainly think are helping the per capita consumption in Brazil increase as well as helping us to gain some share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jo&#xE3;o and Nelson. How are you? The first question is on your CapEx plans, because your volumes in Brazil, beer and soft drinks there, probably a little bit ahead of a consensus and they're very strong. Could you please remind us of your CapEx plans for 2010 and whether you see any incremental upside risk to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Nelson speaking. Our plans regarding CapEx, we have since the beginning of the year &#x2013; kind of stipulated that range, while we started talking about &#x2013; if you really go back two or three quarters ago, we're talking initially between 1.3 and R$1.5 billion in Brazil. But as soon as we saw a possibility of a higher growth, especially if tax would move, we started to review the number. And the new range became 1.5 to 2 billion, which would enable us to increase capacity from 10 to 15% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Right now, we are definitely going to the upper end of this range, we actually are going to the 2 billion and I think what was great was our fast reaction. I think we have been able to really review and react &#x2013; we could estimate and react fast and so we are going to definitely get the upper end of this range. We should have around R$2 billion only Brazil of course, when you look at AmBev as a whole, we should be reaching 2.4 billion CapEx in 2010 with an important increase versus last year. But again, as I said, even with these incremental investments we are steadily in a strong region, I think, free cash flow growth this year as well.</p>

          <p>No, not at this stage and once you started to discuss right now, you should <mark type="inaudible" /> because given that let's say time it takes to get the brands up and running between 8 and 10 months, we're already looking into 2011 to get those type of orders, we're going to start support with our suppliers, but at this stage, not able to affect 2010 number.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a follow-up on the logistics costs, you mentioned that your COGS are essentially, probably are at the worst part in this, reached the worst level in the second quarter, but they should improve going forward. Do you expect material improvements already in the logistics cost or only in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding the logistic cost, the improvement should come a little bit later than at the COGS level, right. As I said the plants should be really up and running in the fourth quarter. So we should start benefiting from this additional capacity and a more optimized footprint let's say on the last of Q4 and then the full benefit we should be seeing in the course of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I have a last question, if I may, on your innovations and also on your plans for the Budweiser. First on the innovation, do you think that the growing volume is being driven more by the one liter bottles gaining share in the returnable presentation or from the new liquids and other innovations that you're launching. And also if you could give us an update if you're still on to the launch the Budweiser &#x2013; the re-launch of the Budweiser in Brazil in 2010 or if that's going to be in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Gustavo, I think first, regarding the breakdown, I would not like to go into too much details of the strategy on who is helping us more, I mean, it's really the combo. As I said before on a previous question I said, depending on the markets, depending on the region, depending on the city, one thing will be helping us more than the other, so the full combination is giving us different ways to connect with different consumers. So this is really what is making this is the whole combination and because we're still not in the whole country, with everything that we have, I think we still have some upside from the things we have launched last year and now we have new things that we are launching this year that hopefully will help us for the second half, but also help us in maintaining momentum in 2011.</p>
          <p>Regarding Bud, I think we will be ready with Bud as we have mentioned within a few months we'll have &#x2013; we'll be ready in terms of the positioning, about the different execution that we'll have for the brand. Real excited with what we're hearing from consumers and from different findings that we had, I don't want to get too much on the insight, but we think we have something strong in our hands. The timing of the launch will depend in different things. I would say that it will definitely happen in the next 6 to 12 months. The reason for potentially not doing this year and postponing it for some time in the next year using the 6 to 12 month range is that we have a lot in our plate and we're putting a lot of things in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And given the great work being done by the sales and the marketing teams, the response for the things we're putting in the marketplace has been very good. So finding the right timing for a launch is very important. I don't want to just &#x2013; we don't want to throw Budweiser or any new launch in the market just like that. So because we have a strong pipeline of things that are actually happening as we speak, we may take Bud for some time next year. Mostly because of the timing of the launch and given all the things that we're doing that you know, thanks to you everything we mentioned, has been very positive.</p>

          <p>Hi. There has been some talks here with your potential tax changes that would affect distribution companies. I want to know if you think it's actually going to happen and if there's any impact on your distribution? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Juliana, hi, it's Nelson here. We saw that this new tax regulation going on, but there is no impact to our business as we already paid those tax based on consumer prices. Of course, it's going to be different for other segments in the economy that have a different taxable base today, but there is no impact on our beer, neither soft drink business. So, yeah, no impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And from your knowledge, would that in any way affect some of your competitors or everybody already working on the same tax system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in the industry, they're already working on the same tax system, it's not going to be affected by this change in legislation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks. And as a follow-up, on the issue of packaging, always we've been hearing from a lot of companies in different sectors that they have an issue of packaging, of getting supply of packaging. Does that in any way makes you wonder in any specific sub-segments that you would verticalize and maybe do some more of your own packaging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you would consider verticalizing and producing in, cans, or in anyway, I mean investing in glasses or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think getting into too many details here would open sort of our strategy on the supply side. I think I'd rather remind ourselves about some of this facts, okay? I mean, if you look back ten years, five years or three years, we had no malting plants and now we have most of our malt in-house and we made a lot of money by following that strategy because we learned how to run and we're able to run it better than the previous companies that were supplying to us. Sometime we do it for that reason, sometimes we do it to break a certain situation, it could be a monopoly, duopoly, whatever in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Or for synergies reasons, I mean, we have also opened a glass plant, okay? We have, in Bolivia we have can lines, in Argentina, we have some hops production. There is different strategies for different markets. That just shows that when we find an opportunity that has a return in margins, but also on the easier, so that you also return on the capital employed, we will always consider. So I think that's as much, as far as I can go with the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just &#x2013; thank you for taking the follow-up. I just want to ask a question about the Brazilian operations, which continued to perform just so extremely well. I wanted to understand a little bit more about the revenue-per-hectoliter in the second quarter. We saw sequentially a decline. The same thing happened last year and at the time you talked about how there higher state taxes that sort of caught up and caused the second quarter '09 revenue-per-hectoliter to decline. I wondered if it was the same factor this year? And I guess more generally, if you could give us any update on what we should expect for excise taxes, whether you think there might be an increase in '010 or whether that's really pushed that into '11. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Lore, this is Jo&#xE3;o. I'm assuming you're talking about the 168 to the 164.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think this is much more in line exactly with &#x2013; you had the question but also in a way the answer. We don't let the state <mark type="inaudible" /> catch up, right. You have a price increase, then you have the survey and the survey will come in the quarter after. And so there is a catch up. This has been going on for a long time. So if you go back usually in Q2, and Q3 you'll have some of that. So I'll say that for the great, great majority, the explanation here is the delay on the ICMS tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And any thoughts on federal excise taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the federal excise taxes, no much news, I think the only good news, what we're seeing happening in the marketplace is that we mentioned in the beginning of the year that a lot of jobs were going to be created, that happened. Tax collateral is going to be higher given the volume, it also happened. So taxes were flat, prices were in line with the inflation as we mentioned. So I think only good news, I think because of that the IPI was maintained flat and apparently, this will go on for a good portion of the remainder of the year. So I think mostly good news, of course, at the point in time, whether it's the very end of the year or the beginning of next year, maybe something will happen again.</p>
