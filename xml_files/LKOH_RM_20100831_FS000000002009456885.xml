        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the briefing to discuss the Financial Results of LUKOIL for the First Half of 2010. We regularly see each other. We regularly discuss these numbers.</p>
          <p>There was a meeting of the Board of Directors earlier today. The Board of Directors also looked into the financial results of the company for the first 6 months of 2010. We also discussed the matters related to utilization of associated gas. So, we keep discussing these matters.</p>
          <p>May we see the next slide, please?</p>
          <p>Again, all the forward-looking statements are on the page. Please remember that all the numbers in this presentation are subject to all these provisions. You can see all the financial highlights now on the screen. The most important factor is that the oil price was higher than the pessimistic forecasts that we heard in the past. The average price keeps around $76.1 per barrel, which is approximately 50% growth on the first half of 2009. So, subject to that, our sales also grew together with EBITDA and net income.</p>
          <p>Of course, direct correlation between net income and sales just does not exist because you know that the Russian taxation system is organized in such a way that the most benefit of the price growth goes to the federal budget. But please pay attention to the fact that free cash flow, the main indicator for the company, reached 3 million &#x2013; US$3.127 billion, which is an increase of 145 million to the first half 2009. That was one of the major parameters for the company. For this year, if you remember, we made this promise in the beginning of the year and we keep our promise.</p>
          <p>Now, as to the macroeconomic and taxation environments, as I have already mentioned, all the key products grew and quite significantly, except for the diesel fuel price, which is an excessive product for the Russian Federation; mostly diesel fuel is exported. As you can see that if the oil price grew by 49%, the export duty grew by 122%, mineral extraction tax went up 72%, the real ruble appreciation was 17%. So, from the perspective of taxation, the oil industry remains the milking cow of the federal budgets.</p>
          <p>The system is extremely profitable for the budget, but that system considerably limits the economic potential for development for the companies inside Russia. So, all the ideas and the discussions that we've had in the beginning of the year related to the potential improvement and the changes in the tax environments unfortunately run into the budget deficits. So as &#x2013; it should have been expected more real suggestions that might forcibly improve the overall situation for the industry and reduce the tax burden.</p>
          <p>Now, going forward, I don't think that such changes can be expected in the coming years. We may only rely on that if the oil production declines significantly.</p>
          <p>In our main operating results, oil production went down and marketable gas production went up 25%. This is due to the fact that the winter was very cold and consumers wanted gas. Overall marketable hydrocarbon production went up 1.9%. Oil refining fell slightly. This is due to the decline of refining margins in Europe and we cut our refining in Western Europe. Exports of crude oil and petroleum products also was curbed.</p>
          <p>We looked at the situation with the expert carries. So, in real terms and day terms, if you look at absolute numbers and tons, our export parameters are quite stable. Retail sales of petroleum products, again, went down a little bit, mostly due to American and European market. In Russia, this market is on the rise.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the marketable hydrocarbons production per day, we went from 2.21 million barrels per day to 2.26 million boe per day.</p>
          <p>Now, to the refining and marketing segment results. Overall, we saw a considerable increase, mainly due to our Rotterdam Refinery. We also managed to increase throughputs at the Perm Refinery through upgrade of the capacity. Other refineries, including Sicily refining went down slightly. LUKOIL remains one of the leaders in refining. The overall investment into that segment was cut and we do not have plans to increase investments at the moment into refining.</p>
          <p>Main financial results that I already mentioned, our sales went up 42.7%. Operating expenses, up 22.3%, given of 17.3% inflation. Taxes, plus 71.1%. Income from operating activities, plus 17.9%. Income before tax &#x2013; net income, I'm sorry, 23.9% and EBITDA, plus 13.8%, which in our perspective &#x2013; from our perspective is quite a good result for the first 6 months of the year.</p>
          <p>Sales, sales breakdown, the main source of revenue for the company is sales of petrochemicals. The company is more and more focused today on limiting our sales of crude oil and we want to concentrate on sales of products with high-value added. So, we are progressing quite fast in that direction. This is our strategic goal and we will achieve that goal, of course, correlating our efforts with the markets. Today the market is quite favorable for acquisitions, but it's not at all favorable for investments, because the margin, especially, abroad is very low and in Russia the situation is not very clear.</p>
          <p>As you know, there are ideas &#x2013; there are ideas flying around to shorten the difference between crude oil and the petroleum products. The companies that want to stay the source of raw materials for their country, they are not interested at all into making investments into the refining sector. We believe on the other hand that the government should support all the efforts to modernize and upgrade the refining segments of the economy.</p>
          <p>There is yet another idea to unify export duties on oil, petroleum products. We believe that, in that respect, there are certain positive import sales that will encourage upgrade of the industry. Because if the duties are uniform, then this will create additional income for such companies as ours that have already invested into its refining capacities.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, main operating expenses went up mainly due to greater volumes of refining or the other factor was inflation and ruble appreciation of more than 17%. And please notice if you look at the quarterly breakdown of all the costs, excepting power and petrochemistry are within the same range.</p>
          <p>The increase in petrochemical expenses for instance are due to the fact that our activity in that sector is much more intensive these days. Operating expenses are very much at the level of the fourth quarter of 2009. Again, all the changes are due to ruble appreciation. There is a slight increase in operating expenses that we attribute to the financial indicators, that is to say, refining throughputs went up and also started producing at peak in some of our gas fields.</p>
          <p>So, despite the fact that in some areas there are now worse geological conditions and the water-cut levels in certain areas are very high, we keep all operating costs under control, again mainly due to introduction of knowledge intensive technologies, state-of-the-art methods of oil production.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Transportation, sales, general, administrative costs are too in correlation with the increase in its areas of natural monopolies. As you can see, transportation expenses by &#x2013; really for instance, went up 31%. The only thing is that the tanker shipments, since there is no monopoly in this industry, these costs are under control. These numbers of 31% &#x2013; 27%, again they tell us that any monopoly, be it seasoned or another kind of monopoly, the first thing it does is raises the prices.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation is given on that slide. You can see that our revenues were immediately matched by the taxes. And there is number that you can see, other 311, that's other costs that are not included into the previous items. Most of that figure is costs related to terminating the wells. The costs of that are recorded in accordance with accounting standards.</p>
          <p>Cash flow reconciliation, please notice the free cash flow increased from 145 million to $3.127 billion. Again, this is the goal of the company to increase its cash flow and to prepare the company for potential large investment projects. I will discuss that a bit late, as you'll again also understand that part of the free cash flow went into purchase buyback of our own shares from ConocoPhillips, so we didn't need to raise long-term debt for it.</p>
          <p>CapEx breakdown looks as follows. Please notice the increase in international exploration and productions costs. This is something that you will continue seeing in the future. The explanation is that, right now, we are able to make highly profitable investments abroad, today, at the same time, investments into refining and marketing. If you look at the first half of 2009 and 2010, you will see that this went down by 12.4% and international projects in that area went down by 42%. So the concerns that the analysts had about our international expansion were broken down by these numbers.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL implemented all the projects abroad so that we deemed necessary for the benefit of the shareholders and for the company. We are done with this project, so you can see a decline in our investments and to refine the marketing growth. You can also see the petrochemicals numbers and power generation numbers already from 2011. Large investments into power generation will no longer exist.</p>
          <p>Company's key projects; this is what we saw in the first part of 2010. Dynamic development of growth projects in the Caspian region and Uzbekistan, you know that we got first oil in the Korchagin field. We are very grateful to the Chairman of the government, Prime Minister, Putin, for visiting our platform. We've started working very actively in Iraq and in West Africa. International projects today and in the future will be drivers of the company's growth. Today, the company has a well-balanced large portfolio of projects. Our portfolio of international projects is probably the best among Russian companies.</p>
          <p>And Qurna-2, there we've already established the project's office together with our partners from Norway. And we've already identified the first stage for years 2011, beginning of 2013. In early 2013, we have planned to reach the production of 400,000 barrels per day, about 20 million tons per year. For this, we will need to drill 67 wells. And to establish all the necessary infrastructure for the development, including construction of an export pipeline, starting from that time the projects will pay for itself. And out of this 400,000 barrels per day, approximately one half will be spent to set off the costs that we carried in relation to these projects' operating costs and capital costs.</p>
          <p>In the first 6 months of the year, we had a major discovery in Uzbekistan, together with our consortium partners. You know the consortium consists of 5 oil companies, we hold equal shares in that projects. The first exploration well showed very good prospect of hydrocarbons, primarily gas. We think that maybe there will be also liquid components in &#x2013; from this stance, so we are very optimistic about our future in Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>In the subsequent months, we expect to sign agreements on transportation of Uzbekistan gas, which will open up new possibilities for us in that region.</p>
          <p>West Africa; it has always been and it still is one of regions in the world that has the best potential for our company. Our program there has been already improved. Right now, we are in the center for drilling. We expect to drill 11 or maybe more wells, because we are looking at acquisition of additional blocks.</p>
          <p>Today, LUKOIL has probably the largest exploration portfolio in 5 countries of West Africa. And tentatively, we estimate resources of these blocks as being several times greater than the ones that the company has in Russia. We did the first drilling and this drilling confirmed very high expectations of production of hydrocarbons in this region. Already in 2011, you will be hearing, we hope, very much positive news from that region. We expect LUKOIL to become &#x2013; again, to regain its position as the leader in terms of reserves growth once we are done with the first exploration activities in that region.</p>
          <p>Again, from the beginning of the year, we also managed to settle rather old corporate dispute that existed with CNPC. I will not go into details, but we reached an amicable agreement. CNPC will pay us $438 million. So, ownership structure remains unchanged. Partners hold equal 50% stake, and hopefully we'll also be able to regain our share of dividends. And again, this opens up new possibilities for cooperation with CNPC in other regions. This is a very good example of the correct way of keeping good productive relationship with partners.</p>
          <p>Please notice that the company's net debt decreased by more than 33.5%. Also, I'd like to send my regards to a well-known information agency that wrote that our debt was $19 billion. The day before they wrote that our President is leaving the company, today they wrote that we are bankrupt. So, I'll like that company to read more attentively all our financial results and reports and not to confuse us with another Russian oil company. LUKOIL fuels itself very well. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>And the last slide, the traditional slide, the company plans to develop dynamically. The promises that we made to the shareholders are being kept. The company has very good potential for growth. When all our programs are implemented, LUKOIL once again confirm its prime position in the Russian and international market.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. We are open to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Was there any decision about the option buyback of the shares that Conoco still has? How much money you will invest into it? And the other question: will your company participate in the auction for the Trebs and Titov field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, answering your first question, we will not use that option to the full extent that Conoco offers to us it's &#x2013; right now, and they're out of the money position. Now whether the situation will change by end of September I don't know, but we will not invest heavily into that, particularly &#x2013; maybe partially, but not fully. The company does not intend to raise co-financing. We expect when we get the money from Turgai Petroleum, already in the second part of this year, we will reduce our debt further.</p>
          <p>As to Trebs and Titov field, of course this asset is very interesting to us. The data was published. We hope that the tender, the auction, will be fair and open. If one of the state companies wins, we hope that the terms and conditions will not be changed, that no duties, export duties will be lifted or anything like it. So, again, we expect that the competition will be fair and just &#x2013; and LUKOIL will participate in that auction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are different options. A small part can be used to pay out bonuses, remuneration, but a small part. Another part might be used in case of large acquisitions. Today, LUKOIL considers these shares as its financial reserve. Maybe we will look into the matter of gradual redemption of the shares.</p>
          <p>There is this provision in the Russian legislation, but as to the procedure of redeeming their shares and how to record that kind of transaction in Russian accounts, it's not clear. There are no rules about that. So this matter requires a lot of attention and a lot of talks with the supervisory authorities, with the taxation authorities. We have this idea, but to say that we will use it very soon, well, I can't say that. I think that these shares must be kept as a financial reserve of the company.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />, my name is Fedun, right. Please do not confuse me with anybody else. I have nothing to say about the Minister of Energy. I do not have the authority to appoint a new person that position. I will never pass any judgments on the positions, on the higher-ups in the governments. I don't think it's not very smart people who actually discuss their managers.</p>

          <p>Well, I think it's a provocation. It's a very &#x2013; well, that's my personal opinion. I have lived a long life. I remember the 1990s and the information wars at that time. So I feel like the same just blew yesterdays. Who did it? We don't know and we are investigating this matter right now.</p>

          <p>Yoga Krinner. Could you please tell us about the dividends policy, if there is anything that you can add possibly in particular? Do you think that buying Conoco's shares will impact your ability to pay dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our dividend policy is very stable. We announced it, and most of the dividends for this year have been already paid out. The only dividends that have not yet been paid out are the ones distributed through our custody. It's a special procedure related to reconciling the exchange rates, because the ADR holders &#x2013; foreign holders of ADRs are supposed to get these dividends.</p>
          <p>As to ConocoPhillips' shares, I've already answered that question. No, we do not plan to buy, again, a lot of our shares from them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet. When we have anything to tell you about, we will inform you about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bank Nomura Nomura Bank. The first question about the Caspian. Why did you postpone the start of commercial production from the fields, and did the company revisit its targets for production from that field for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That program that was approved at the end of 2009 is being implemented this year. There are no deviations &#x2013; major deviations from this program. There are certain technical things that exist in any activity, but they have no impact on the overall production program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When can we expect first oil -- commercial &#x2013; well, first oil &#x2013; what do you think happens to this first oil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is marketed. It also goes into the sales system and has been sold. You can't drill &#x2013; get a lot from one well, because we need additional wells that will be connected to the gas-gathering system and the injection system. So it's a very complicated technical system, but we already got first oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Fedun, unfortunately this production is not seen in the statistics of the Ministry of Energy. If you look at their statistics, they do not give any data for the Korchagin field, so, probably it's because they don't have the field for the Korchagin field. They don't have this line. That's my only assumption.</p>
          <p>The other question about ERG and ISAB Refinery, Sicily, in October, ERG will have the put option for 0.5 billion &#x2013; for $1.5 billion. Have you have already heard from your colleagues? Are they going to extend put option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The price formula is trusted in such a way, if you remember, it only includes the selling, the high cap. At current price, ERG will not use the put option. What you're quoting now 1.4, that's the maximum price setdown in the contract and the minimum price depends on the economic situation on the production facility.</p>
          <p>You know what happens now with refineries. In Western Europe, we are in negotiations and right now, we have a feeling that they will not use that option, because it will not be profitable for them. ERG in their presentations, they are showing floor and cap, &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Well, I am here speaking on behalf of LUKOIL. I cannot possibly comment on what our partners for this production facility are doing. From our perspective that's how things stand.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Tom Wallin, Energy Intelligence. I've got a question about Kazakhstan. I heard some time ago that the Karachaganak projects and partners already agreed to reduce their shares, so that the Kazakhstan party will &#x2013; would be able to join the project. Would you be ready to reduce your share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our position is we are a minority participant in those projects. There are 2 major participants of the projects and it's up to them to negotiate that possibility with the government of Kazakhstan and next round of negotiations will be held very soon. After I have the news, I will be able to give you some comments.</p>

          <p>Yes, we are in contact with the Ministry of National Resources of Russia and we expect that by the end of the year, there will be no longer any unsolved matters.</p>
          <p>And yes, we have some participants in the teleconference. So if we have any questions, ladies and gentlemen, you can ask these questions now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And we do have a question from Mark Henderson with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much, gentlemen, for your presentation today. I guess quite a few questions have already been asked that I would have intend to ask myself, but I'm interested in any kind of update you might have on how appraisal work is progressing, particularly offshore Ghana. I know that Tullow Oil held a Capital Markets Day recently. And they suggested that your prospect, the vast one prospect, might be gas. So I'd be interested in any feedback on that.</p>
          <p>And clearly, in the first half you have delivered what you had suggested in terms of the strong free cash flow generation. That is to be applauded and much of that as well due to restraint on CapEx. But I am &#x2013; I'd be interested in any indication of whether this might lead you to be a bit more aggressive in terms of potential dividends, whether they are ordinary or special going forward. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much for your kind words. Unfortunately, as there are non-ordinary shares, so we can't really be aggressive with non-ordinary shares, privileged shares. But as to the dividend policy, I have already touched upon that. We are in favor of a stable growth of income of our shareholders. So the more free cash flow, the more aggressive we are in our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>As to the Ghana situation, we already got all approvals. There are no more restrictions on operations in this country and it's not a gas field. It is a major field with liquid hydrocarbons. I think that we should better speak about this field once all drilling program is fulfilled. We are looking now at 11 and maybe even 15 wells that we will need to drill within a very short period of time. Right now, we are organizing a tender for two drilling vessels that will be working in that region.</p>
          <p>Another question please, from the teleconference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vyacheslav Shylin with Deutsche Bank.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone. Couple of questions, please. How much has the LUKOIL borrowed since the close of first half of 2010? And also how much of your debt is due to be redeemed by the end of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our presentation, we made an indication that the net debt of the company is today slightly in excess of 6 billion, so was &#x2013; the only borrowings that we did was for one purpose, for restructuring of current debt of the company. Right now we are focused on borrowing inside the country, in Russia, because today these borrowings are quite inexpensive. If you remember shares, again we're placed now in Russian Stock Exchange. So there are no major borrowings and our net debt actually declined over that period of time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And if there are no more questions, then I would like to thank everyone. We are still in August and yet you managed to find time to join this conference. I will be very happy to see all of you again at the next press conference for the results of the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
