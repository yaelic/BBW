        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and welcome to Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's 2Q '09 Conference Call. My name is Andr&#xE9;s Coello and I am telecom and media analyst with BBVA Bancomer, Mexico's largest financial institution. I am glad to introduce you today to Mr. Daniel Hajj and Mr. Carlos Garcia Moreno, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Carlos, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andr&#xE9;s, and as always it's, thank you for being in the call. Carlos Garcia Moreno is going to make a small summary of the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Andr&#xE9;s, for hosting the call. As was the case in the first quarter, the second quarter was characterized by a fairly sharp economic contraction in both the U.S. and Mexico. But this time the general outlook for the main economies in South America, it seemed to improve throughout the period. Overall, the combination in most operations of strong data growth, the deceleration of subscriber growth, and good cost controls contributed to an improvement of EBITDA margins. Our past and present investments in our networks continue to allow us to offer more and better quality services to our client, which has helped our retention efforts, which means lower churn rates and has even helped acquire these results.</p>
          <p>In both Mexico and Brazil, we have had net subscriber gains from number portability. We added 3.7 million subscribers in the quarter inline with our guidance on subscriber growth for 2009. 900,000 were obtained in Brazil, 730,000 in the U.S, through our subsidiary Tracfone, 548,000 in Mexico and 367,000 in Argentina. Tracfone and some other operations most notably in the Caribbean gained more subs than in the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our focus on postpaid subs has yielded faster postpaid growth in several important markets including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Peru. In Mexico, our share of the postpaid market 47% will likely continue to increase. Revenue support of 94 billion pesos, were 11.2% higher than in the year earlier quarter. Service revenues were up 15.9% but equipment revenues declined by 17.3% partly on account of the lower pace of subscriber growth. The expansion of service revenues was underpinned by the surge in data revenue. The median of local currency expansion in data revenues was 56% excluding Central America. They provided good support to ARPUs practically across the board.</p>
          <p>In substantially all our operations, our average price per minute of voice kept on coming down. 16.4% in Mexico, 17% in Argentina, 18% in Colombia, Peru and the U.S. are at over 30% year-on-year and nearly 30% in the Caribbean. Our EBITDA rose 13.4% from the previous year to 39 billion pesos helped by a good top line and lower subscriber acquisition cost. EBITDA margins rose in most operations, exceptions include Tracfone in the U.S. and our Caribbean operations, which as we told before, have been increasing the cost of their subscriber base. Our consolidated EBITDA margin was up nearly 1% this point to 41.8%. We obtained a comprehensive financing income of 2.4 billion pesos mostly on account of foreign exchange gains resulting mainly from the appreciation of the Mexican peso with respect to the U.S. dollar has more than doubled our overall financial expense.</p>
          <p>All together, our operation generated 22.5 billion pesos in net profit, 27.5% more than a year before. Through June, our net profits totaled nearly 40 billion pesos. Our cash flow has enabled us to reduce by 25.5 &#x2013; 5.8 (sic) [25.9] billion peso our net debt so far this year and to fund share buybacks in the amount of 10.4 billion pesos, of which 4.4 billion took place in the second quarter. We remain financially strong with a net debt that represents only 0.65 times EBITDA and a comfortable maturity profile resulting from an average life of our debt of nearly 10 years. Our capital expenditures totaled 18.6 billion pesos through June, very much inline with our full projected amount for the year.</p>
          <p>I think this summarizes the schedule of the results in the quarter. Andr&#xE9;s, maybe we can open up the floor for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Carlos, first I would like to congratulate you for the strong results shown in the quarter particularly in the light of the difficult economic conditions that you, that already is taking. I have two questions. First question, do you think that the swine flu crisis was the main reason behind the 8.2% growth in minutes of use in Mexico or can we expect them to continue to grow at the high pace that we saw in 2Q for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;s, I think the swine what happens with the swine flu is that &#x2013; it hit us lots more in the sales of the equipment and sales of the handset. I think that's mainly people does not go out in the streets, a lot of stores closed, but I think the usage has been very good. Crisis has been coming down and that's really what is driving more up so that's really what is happening in Mexico. Where as you are seeing in Mexico we are being very good on postpaid and postpaid give us more minutes of use so with less low price and more and more postpaid subscribers is what is driving the minutes of use higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and second question can you give us the latest update on the coming spectrum auctions in Mexico? How much money do you expect to spend and is that estimate already your CapEx guidance for 2009 or 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's still we haven't had the latest news on the auctions. I think what I am hearing is that they are going to auction 1900 megahertz of spectrum and two point &#x2013; 1.7 and 2.1 extra for 3G and maybe for LTE, a spectrum in Mexico. What they are saying is that they are going to allow to participate everybody, what also they are saying is that they are going or what they are looking is to give some, some of these spectrum to our a competitor is what they are thinking to do or what they want to do and the auctions hype we don't know exactly the rules, if we are going to pay is the some money up front or we have to pay like a rent per year. So there is still a lot of things that we, that we're going to solve later in this maybe month or the next month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Operator, please open for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Vera Rossi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have two questions, one on Brazil and the other one on Tracfone. In Brazil, what caused the decreasing market share of net additions during the quarter? And on Tracfone, do you expect to launch the Straight Talk on a nationwide basis in the U.S. and if you expect to continue to have this level of net additions in the U.S. going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Vera. On Brazil, I think what we are looking at, you saw in the numbers is that we're looking for postpaid customers or good customers. We don't, we're not get in the naked scene &#x2013; sales, so we feel that they are not very good subscribers. We are going to see all these subscribers that just add in the second quarter in Brazil are going to have consumption and they are going to, they'll give a revenues. It's very important for everybody to know also for us, know if that's a good market or not.</p>
          <p>But what we're looking and what we're seeing is that we are very strong in postpaid in Brazil, we have a very good network, we have very good quality and I think we are in good position in Brazil to still gain market share. We need to really understand what's going be the promotions in SIM, as they told me that some competitors are giving two SIMs free if you contract or a &#x2013; so it's, I think it's a little bit of irrational those SIM cards but let's see these are going to consume in the next months.</p>
          <p>In Tracfone first of all we have to make a &#x2013; we made a mistake in the report, we report 103 minutes of use and the number is 75 minutes of use. I'm sorry about that mistake, I am pleased to correct that, but what we are doing right now we have a new product that is the Straight Talk we call them a Straight Talk product that it's all you can eat for X amount of money and I think it's $45 and what we're doing is we're testing the product and if the product is give us good results of course we're going to roll out through all the United States nationwide. So we're waiting for the results, and if the results are good then we are going to roll out all through the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vera.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from the line of Henry Corby.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thanks so much for the call. My question is just on Brazil. You mentioned the quality of your postpaid subscriber base and I just want to query what happened to MOUs in the second quarter, looks like MOUs down 16 or 17% which looking at subscriber growth implies that traffic grew only 3% year-on-year, could you explain? Is that an another typo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very good question. I think what happened in second quarter is that promotions were more rational as we decrease some promotion. I don't think that they are going stay like that. Second quarter you saw a little bit more rational promotions thus it's different than what you are selling to the customer, so the naked themes are still the same but in the promotions are more rational and maybe in third quarter change that and fourth quarter also we change that, so that's why the minutes of use in Brazil decreased a little bit. It's because a little bit more rational promotions. We have good promotions on first quarter, so we reduced the promotions on second quarter and let's see what's going to happen in third quarter. Next question, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, operator, please next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Rick Prentiss, Raymond James. I appreciate the info on the Tracfone minutes of use. In the Tracfone promotion, do you have to buy a large bucket of minutes and text messages from Verizon and then sell the product and if so did that affect the EBITDA margins in Tracfone at all in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not the way we are going to do that. We have an agreement with Verizon and the only thing that I can say on the agreement is that this product will be profitable for, for Tracfone not like all the other products that we are selling. We're selling four products, we're selling Tracfone, NET10, this one that is the Straight Talk, and Safelink. And those are the four products that we are selling and more or less all of them has the same let's say economics or strategy there, so that's what we are doing. I cannot talk more with what the deal with Verizon or what's the deal with my other carriers in the other, in the other plans but I think we're looking to make this, this plan profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my second question is in Mexico. Obviously, impressive results in Mexico with increasing usage and nice ARPU. During the swine flu problem, you mentioned it hit sales a little bit, how were people able to go out and reload their cards or replenish their usage? How did that actually play out in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you &#x2013; everybody said there, we're selling a lot of the cards also electronic you don't have to go out and buy a card. So, you can buy a card by phone, by electronic, you can do it through your &#x2013; through your credit card. So there is a lot of different ways you should recharge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can buy also in ATMs, any ATM in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you can do it in a lot of ways to buy the card and what with the swine flu, I think really there were only may be one to two weeks where really people and store were closed. Not more than two weeks so. I don't think that was an issue for recharging your phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Campbell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that data revenues are becoming more and more important in Mexico. I was wondering if may be you could give us a number for how many mobile broadband subscribers you have in Mexico now? And my second question is on the prepaid data plans, which I understand that you've launched over the past few months. If you could give us an idea for how well those are going, how the take-up has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. We are not disclosing the data but what I can tell you is that in Mexico, we are growing around 40 something &#x2013; 40%, 45% year-over-year our data revenue. So, you could see that we are improving and that we're growing and that data has been very important for our ARPU. I think what we're focusing in Mexico and what drive us the ARPU and or maintain the ARPU and drive revenues is we're doing a lot more on postpaid. How we're doing more, we're focusing more on postpaid, we're focusing more on retention, we're making much and better quality on our network and we're giving data usage for all our costumers. So, that's really what we're focusing in Mexico. We're now selling netbooks also and everyday we're selling more value added services so that's really what it's making ARPU grow</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what you are seeing in Mexico is what you are going to see all around Latin America. We already invest in a 3G network all around Latin America and our strategy has been pushing and pushing data and data has been growing in all the markets so you &#x2013; I am confident that you are going to see the same things that you are seeing in Mexico, you are going saw them in all the other countries now. Brazil is doing very good also on data on postpaid on data. People likes a lot smartphones, so smartphones has been increasing a lot their sales, so that's more or less what you are going to see in the next years or in the next year in Latin America. In the prepaid we are also giving prepaid data and there is prepaid plans and they are also working so data is working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Verena Wachnitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi from T. Rowe Price. Hi, congratulations on the strong result. I have two questions, one is on your margin especially Mexico, but also in general. Could you comment a bit about what contributed more, the subscriber growth, slowdown, the cost cuts, the data growth? You mentioned all these factors but could you give us a sense of which was more important? And also then, in talking about data, which you mentioned before, do you think at some point we see the growth in data revenues leading to higher ARPUs rather than just offsetting a declining in voice? ARPU and if so when do you think that might happen? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question is what's the rising data? Sorry, margins in Mexico. Well first, you are seeing that we have a reduction on acquisition costs, so as you are selling less, you have reduction on acquisition costs and that's driving also margins up.</p>
          <p>Next one were the cost control that we are having is very &#x2013; it's very important. We have been having a very good cost control. And third what I am saying not that the revenue is growing and that data revenue, we used to have last year all the costs and expenses of the 3G networks and today we're having more much revenues on the &#x2013; on data. So, we used to have costs and right now we are having the revenue, so that's driving the margins up. So that's mainly what they were. These three things are, because also the acquisition costs has been going down, we are not selling what we were selling last year. So that's also something that helps the margins up.</p>
          <p>When things gets better and maybe we start to sell more then maybe the we have a reduction because we are having higher acquisition costs. And so that's what drives margins ups and down. And the second question, can you repeat it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes, I was just wondering when do you think we might see or if we might see the growth in data revenues offsetting the decline in voice ARPUs and therefore leading to higher ARPUs on a consolidated level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think people &#x2013; the way we saw that is that people, is the way what &#x2013; the way we see that is that people use voice and then are starting to use data. They are not reducing their voice or their calls to use data. At the beginning you could see that because they, two years ago data was like SMS was mainly the growth on data but today the growth on data is going browsing, downloading music, going to Facebook, so there is a lot more things that they are not reducing the voice minutes. So, I don't think they will reduce that, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daniel, just to follow-up on the question that I mean we are in a very soft economic environment across the board which have normally caused us more usage. You would expect that as the economy improve that usage will also be picking up across the board, so I think the amazing thing is that data is growing so fast in what is still a very soft economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mauricio Fernandes of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you. On the ARPU in Mexico, the increase relative to the first quarter, it appears that the flu was helpful in terms of driving usage. I was just wondering how much of the ARPU increase was the contribution from the flu and how much of it was regular increase in or technical increase in usage trends? And if you could share with us, once the flu wrath was mainly over so what was the ARPU say in June or July what it has been has been inline with the quarter with the number you reported in the quarter about 172 pesos, ending the Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what Daniel just mentioned, Mauricio, specifically that the flu was when you consider it, it was a relatively shortly-lived phenomenon. I mean, the bigger part of the flu was probably at most one week, so I think there is more secular trends out there that you are seeing. I think the growth in data revenues didn't have anything to do with the flu. It was quite amazing, it's 45% this quarter and it's much more rocky than what we've had even last quarter so you are seeing an acceleration of revenues on data and that is helping make up for a quarter. We were saying it's a very challenging economy. Mexico, as you probably have heard has been rumored to have a GDP decline of about 9% this year. Even recently the President, President Calder&#xF3;n, made the statement.</p>
          <p>So we are indeed facing very difficult times in Mexico and what have been helping is that we have we just happen to have a new product that is very much in demand that were not the case sometimes, a certain time ago. But this is a challenging environment, it's also posing more difficulty for subscriber growth. I think we have been saying that since late last year, Mauricio, if you remember that we were expecting that the economic downturn was going to impair our ability to keep on growing subscribers and that is clearly one of the things that we are seeing evidently in Mexico. So, back to the question, I don't think that what you saw in terms of more uses was so much a link to the particular assumption.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just one more. Not that this is a major driver, but in Colombia we saw a decent incline in net additions. I was just wondering if there is anything that has happened there or is that given in the current stage of penetration there that we are going to see in some quarters the number of net adds following and then the others growing? Just wondering if there is anything special that has happened in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mauricio, in Colombia we have 95% penetration so what we are focusing there is to grow our postpaid base, our database and that's where we're focusing in Colombia. So that's why you are going to see there's a economic slowdown there also. So, what the strategy right now we have high market share there also so what we are doing there is to focus on a very good subscriber data subscribers and that's really what is happening in Colombia, high penetration make us look for much better subscribers, no?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Hi, yeah, I guess two questions really. One is that, yeah, one of the key criticisms of operators in the U.S. and Europe is that they're being caught a little bit on the back foot, caught sleeping when it comes to mobile applications really giving up this role to the likes of Apple and Google. Now, given that data is obviously important for you, it's at an earlier stage of development in your markets and given that Apple and Google are not maybe such dominant brands in your markets, do you think you have a chance to head off that threat and play a more central role in the provision, the aggregation of applications? Maybe with your own rival app store or do you see yourself, you know, leaving that role to others?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just quickly if I can just ask for clarification on the Brazil subscriber numbers. Could you confirm whether or not there was any attempt to kind of clean the subscriber base with involuntary disconnections, you know, as we saw in Colombia in Q1? So those are my two questions, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Brazil, we, we're &#x2013; we have a calendar, the calendar, disconnection calendar and we're follow that calendar. We have a little bit more disconnections on second quarter because the high subscribers that we get on December and November so that's why we have that on the second quarter and what, what we are saying we are focusing a lot in postpaid subscribers, data subscribers and that's what we're seeing, we are going to see in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We are not, or we don't want to over disconnect or less disconnect the subscriber. There is a calendar, there is a policy that we have and we're following this policy. Always in the second quarter we have a little bit more of those disconnections because we have the big sales on Christmas and some of the subscribers does not consume, they change the handset, prepaid subscribers and then well we have to disconnect that. So that's mainly what is happening Brazil.</p>
          <p>On terms of the content, what you are taking about Google and Apples. Well Apple as everybody knows is, it's the all keys application, the story is through Apple, I don't know if they are making a lot of money or not. But we have also our content that we're selling to our customers. We have a store in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, this store it's big, it's not a small store. We're selling a lot of content to all of our subscribers, not only the iTunes content or the Apple content, we're selling other content too, we have a music store. We have a lot of content that is regional, so we are I think we are doing good. On Google, I don't know exactly what you are saying. We have some agreements with Google, Yahoo's, Microsoft and I think we are doing it good, no, so, they &#x2013; the content that Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is selling to the customers is good and we're growing that content very fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was related to data services. You said that SMS which used to be something like 75 or 80% of the total data services used is now a lot less. Is it possible for you to break down exactly or more roughly how much SMS is now and what are the features and services which are growing the most? And my second question is, you said that the ARPU was impacted but not much by the swine flu in Mexico. I mean would you consider second quarter ARPU in Mexico to be sustainable and similarly the margin in Mexico in the second quarter to be sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In &#x2013; what you are saying about the SMS, the only thing that I don't have it and we don't disclose those numbers. But and I &#x2013; and really I don't have it right now, but what happened, the SMS starts three or four years ago growing a lot and that's part of what we have been growing on data, okay? The SMS. And maybe SMS it's a lead, you can cannibalize a little bit of the voice with the SMS. But what I'm saying is that today the data where we are growing, that it's browsing, music, and all these type of new value added services applications, as they are not cannibalizing the voice that's my view. And right now nothing of these services are have to do something with voice, okay? So that's what I try to say like couple of questions ago.</p>
          <p>But that &#x2013; the other &#x2013; the swine flu and the ARPU, I think what I can tell you is that the ARPU is going to variate a little bit higher, a little bit lower. I don't think we are going to have because of the swine flu a high decrease on the ARPU in the third and fourth quarter. I think data is growing 45% year-by-year. So I think that's really the ways why our ARPU has been at these level so I don't think big variations on our ARPU or going higher or going lower I think everything has a tendency and what I hope is that we could sustain these ARPU for the future. Carlos, I don't know if you want to say something.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the data, which I think that it's fair to say that SMS after some historic growth has more lift I would like and it was really not growing at least not as a share of our service revenues. What we have seen over the last year or 18-months is that we have had a very significant increase in the share of data revenues within the total service revenues and this has been driven clearly by 3G data services. Just prior to the introduction of 3G, data are coming from SMS had been really flat well I think to total service revenues. Just to mention a couple of figures that I think would be interesting. In the case of Mexico, data already represents 21% of sales revenues. When in the past I think SMS has contributed probably at most something like 14,15, 14%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's somewhere a concrete of that thing, SMS it was contributing probably not more than 15% and today we have probably twice that as the share of data in total services. And so we are indeed seeing a major shift in the contribution of data and this shift is not being driven by SMS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Mexican margins depends a lot on the acquisition cost. We are if net adds will maintain or I think that third quarter it's one of the lowest quarters is because of rationality we had so maybe we can sustain that. It may be in fourth quarter that we have more growth of net adds we can decrease a little bit but as I told I don't think you are going to see big changes on they. There is a tendency and that's what you are going to see cost controls depends a lot on the exchange rate because we have a lot of costs in dollar terms or well there is a lot of things that you need to review on that but I hope we can maintain those margins now.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of James Rivett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, good morning, guys. Two questions if I can. The first is I understand how M&#xF3;vil data is great from an EBITDA margin point of view but are we running into the risk that as we go into 2010 we need to see materially higher CapEx just to sort of to fund this growth because the network capacity runs out or is that more of a 2011, 2012 type issue? And my second question relates to Rizwan's about the margins in Mexico. Is it fair to say that part of the reason why your margins have been so strong is that you bought a lot of handsets at the end of last year and, sorry about that, but you bought a lot of handsets at the end of last year and you have to now restart buying the handsets, is that a fair assumption? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think that's a fair assumption. I don't think it's because we are lowering our inventories and then we buy cheap handsets and then we're selling at high prices. I don't think that's really. What is driving margins is the acquisition cost is very important again and that the revenue, I think those and cost control. So these three things are the main reasons. And in terms of the CapEx, I think Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil has something excellent that we already invest in the 3G networks in all Latin America.</p>
          <p>Of course next year if data has been growing the way it's growing we have to make other investments, but I don't see any extra CapEx that we should put as the next year because of the data. It's inside of the budget that we have for the next two or three years. So it's moving a little bit, so you are growing a lot on data and then you have to put more CapEx on data, but you have already in place the CapEx in voice. So that's that I don't see any increase or big increase on CapEx for the next years. No, I think that's mainly we have our budget and in our budget is, it's more or less what we &#x2013; we're going to invest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, that's very clear. Just a follow up on the inventories question, so the 20% year-on-year fall I think it is in terms of the inventories. That's not handset destocking, that presumably relates more to FX issues, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, maybe you could see that in the first quarter but not in the second quarter. So in the first quarter we reduce our inventories, we have inventories at the end of December, in the first quarter we reduce that. In the second quarter, we start to buy in the second quarter handsets, so it's not because the &#x2013; all the inventory that we have, no?</p>
          <p>And where &#x2013; it's one thing, the other thing, important thing is you have inventory but then you have terms of payment and then &#x2013; and then when you have to pay that, it's maybe 30 days or 60 days or 90 days or 15 days. I don't know exactly what are the conditions of payments. So the inventory doesn't have anything to do with the payment of that inventory. So I don't think that's something that helps, no?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, two questions. Since the fourth quarter of '06, consolidated SG&amp;A has risen from &#x2013; from like 16.1% to about 18.8% of sales and I was just wondering if you could explain why is that. Is that just because of agent costs and distribution costs? And where that's going to go going forward. Are we are going to see any operating leverage going forward? And the second question is on Central America. We've seen a fairly consistent decline in nominal revenues, how can you explain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question it's what you are asking me is why we are reducing our acquisition cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, on your SG&amp;A, your Selling and General Administrative expenses, they've consistently outgrown sales since the fourth quarter of '06 and I was wondering &#x2013; I was wondering why SG&amp;A keeps on outpacing sales and what we should expect from SG&amp;A on a consolidated basis going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know exactly why it seems 2006 SG&amp;A is growing a little bit more than revenues, so if we can &#x2013; we can, I am going to check that. But maybe we're &#x2013; maybe reclassification could be it or something, but I don't know exactly. I'm &#x2013; I will check that and the second question, but that would be a little bit, I agree, it's our provisions or something like that so I don't know. I will &#x2013; I'll check that and the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is on Central America. Again we &#x2013; well we've seen declining revenues for about a year now in Central America just, or stagnant revenues. Can you explain what's happening in Central America and how you expect to grow revenues and EBITDA going forward in Central America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really in Central America we had some bad promotions last year. We have some &#x2013; some things that does not work and that we are correcting this year. I think, I feel in a much better shape where we are checking a lot all the new promotions and all the new things and that's really what is happening. What happened last year is that we sell a lot what all these customers does not consume what we feel and what we think they are going to consume.</p>
          <p>We correct that, and we are &#x2013; we are starting to grow with much better subscribers. So that's really what you could see. Right now in Central America, I think in the future you are going to see maybe next quarter because you compare with that. But you are going to see improvements in all Latin America, in all Central America assets companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then going back to your first question, besides what Daniel mentioned, we have grown more in the postpaid. That obviously means that we need to have more reserves or collection. So we have greater reserves in bad debt. And that's simply because of the growth the postpaid obviously the economic environment makes it a bit more critical. Maybe the other thing that is important is that we've also been growing in customer service centers, which is an important part of the ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the customer care centers, it's a very important. Daniel, it's important that you, we have a number portability in Mexico, we have number portability &#x2013; in Mexico we gain as the subscribers. Everybody thinks that we should lose because we have a big base, a big, a higher base than all the other competitors but we're growing in and that means that we have good cost to <mark type="inaudible" />, quality of the network, coverage, so we have a lot, a lot more things there and maybe that's why that we're growing a little bit the SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think the evolution of that going forward, is it going to continue to expand as a percentage of sales or do you think, what stage are we going to have operating leverage?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

So we are not going to &#x2013; we don't have anything to buy right now at this moment. So, we are only putting the company very strong financially. On buybacks, well, we are buying back our stock depends on the price, depends on the days but we are buying back the stock almost everyday we are buying something.</p>

Do you think that's a &#x2013; it's a sort of a sustainable level and that could help Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil to grow its free cash flow if we apply that levels to the other countries in the universe or do you think that's we could see a reversion of this trend in the CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the question, sorry? That recap, lower Cap &#x2013; lower than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if the CapEx levels in Mexico are sustainable or if they could go back to where they were or if that signals that's the CapEx could be lowered for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil as a whole generating more free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, what we said is that we are going to invest, it's 3 billion, no? What we said and I don't think maybe we can invest 3 billion plus, 5 to 10% less 5 to 10% is not exactly we have to see what the growth on maintenance, the growth on data. But I don't think we're going to have or more than 10% or less than 10% of that. And I don't think we're going to invest more than, our budget for next year is going to be around 3 billion. We don't have it right now but it could be around $3 billion a little bit more or a little bit less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, Andr&#xE9;, that last we were going to spend four year &#x2013; $4 billion per year over three years which were going to be '08, '09, and '10. And we ended up moving forward most investment to '08, which is when we were place &#x2013; putting in place all the 3G networks, as Daniel was mentioning. So last year we ended up investing a total of 5 billion in infrastructure plus 1 billion in licenses and that is much higher than what we have in previous year which is only 3 billion. That's probably where you have these differences in terms of the actual CapEx. But we are inline with our three year budget that we were mentioning of $4 billion per year over three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe, maybe next year it could be 3.5 or maybe it would be 2.8. I don't know exactly but I don't think we are going to see big changes on that one.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question or two about what's going on in the U.S. with the Straight Talk if you could give me an idea of which cities you are expanding into with that program and how long you may want to give it to make a determination of whether or not it worked. Any kind of like customer service or any kind of, what kind of expenses do you have in the U.S. as you grow the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we, what I can tell you right now is that we are making testings as to we have 240-something stores with Wal-Mart. The testings has being doing very well and we still haven't make a decision if we are going to roll out nationwide and when we are going to roll out nationwide. So that's really the economics for Tracfone could be more or less the same as other products that we have and we are looking to have a Straight Talk as a profitable product. So that's mainly what we're looking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to &#x2013; I know you're using other company's' networks, are you investing customer service people in the U.S. or is the customer service mainly taken care of through the Wal-Mart stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we have to have that. We have our customer care centers and customer centers help us in all the other products and I think they are going to help us also in this product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you'll probably, well I know, you don't &#x2013; do you have an idea of how much in revenue target that you need to hit or an EBITDA target that you want to hit?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then could you also talk about, you know, future growth just in general, do you have any plans to expand into other countries where or other even maybe other continents where you aren't right now? What are your expansion plans for growing the business in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well what &#x2013; we are almost all Latin America, we don't have anything right now. But that's always we're open to hear for some alternatives and those alternatives has to be financially sounds good for us not the way we have been doing all the other investments we &#x2013; we want to do. The next one, if we have next investment, so we are not in a hurry and we don't have nothing today. But we are open to hear from for any alternative in Latin America or outside Latin America.</p>
