          <p>Good day. Welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for third quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011 unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments, industry volumes, market shares of the latest of the data available from a number of internal and external sources.</p>
          <p>Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculation and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our business are solid despite the difficult comparison in the third quarter that we have previously discussed. We expect to achieve our annual organic volume growth target of 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth in line with our mid to long-term constant currency annual growth target for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>Today, we narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.12 to $5.18 compared to $4.85 in 2011. This guidance includes unfavorable currency of $0.23, a tax charge of $0.05 related to the closing of the newest Federal income tax audit for the years 2004 through 2006 and $0.02 of asset impairment related costs.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of currency, the aforementioned tax charge and asset impairment related costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% compared to an adjusted EPS of $4.88 in 2011. Let me remind you that if we exclude the $0.10 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:53) 2011, the growth rate would be even higher at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our revised guidance also reflects increased investment in marketing, sales and distribution, particularly in the Asia and EEMA regions.</p>
          <p>Turning to our third quarter results. We posted our strongest ever quarterly result this time last year with organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4% and adjusted diluted EPS up 33% on a currency neutral basis. As expected, therefore our third quarter results this year suffered from this very tough comparison with organic cigarette volume down 1.3% and adjusted diluted EPS up only 5.8% on a currency neutral basis.</p>
          <p>Through the end of September of this year, we have achieved strong results with organic cigarette volume up by 0.7%. Excluding currency and acquisition, our net revenues and adjusted OCI have increased by 5.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS has grown on a currency neutral basis by 10.9%.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the European Union where economic conditions continue to be very difficult. Unemployment continues to rise in the Southern European countries, most notably Spain. Consequently, tax-based cigarette volumes were down at a double digit rate in the quarter in Greece, Spain and Italy, while in contrast, the decline in Germany was a much more moderate 2%.</p>
          <p>For the EU region as a whole, the decline was 7.5%, an improved trend compared to the second quarter and down 6.5% for the first nine months of the year. For the full year 2012, we still expect that cigarette industry volume will decline by about 6%. A key component in the decline of the duty-paid cigarette market in Southern Europe has been adult smokers switching to lower-tax fine cut products and to illicit cigarettes. This can be illustrated by Italy where the duty-paid cigarette industry volume declined by 10.1% during the third quarter while fine cut grew by 41%.</p>
          <p>In addition, the incidence of non-domestic illicit trade for 2012 in Italy is expected to reach approximately 9%, up from an estimated 6.5% in 2011. Our business performed very well in this difficult environment. Marlboro gained 0.8 points in the quarter to reach a cigarette market share of 23.5%. This was sufficient along with the 0.4 share points gain by Philip Morris Selection to more than offset the share of decline of our traditional local blend, Diana.</p>
          <p>Overall, PMI's market share rose by 0.2 points to 53.2%. We are now also the leader in the fine cut category and doubled our share to 27.2%, behind Chesterfield and the launch of Diana. In Germany, where unemployment remains low, cigarette industry volume declined just 2% in the third quarter, while sales of fine cut products increased by 2.3%. This robust strength took place despite tax-driven retail price increases earlier this year and was due in part to a reduction in order sales.</p>
          <p>Marlboro continues to gain share in the cigarette category in the third quarter, up 0.2 points to 21%. With L&amp;M essentially stable at 2%, our overall cigarette market share was in line with 2011. In the EU region as a whole, economic conditions will remain difficult until the issue of unemployment is settled.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our cigarette shipments declined by 8.1%, or 4.6 billion units, driven by the 7.5% decrease in the industry volume. Our fine cut volume in contrast increased by 15.2%. The drop in our cigarette volume can be in large part attributed to an increase in illicit trade particularly in Southern European countries where total tobacco smoking incident levels have remained relatively stable.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased by the performance of Marlboro in the quarter. In an obviously difficult environment for premium brands, Marlboro was able to expand its market share by 0.4 points to 18.4%. Marlboro share was not only in Germany and Italy but also in markets such as Belgium, Greece and across Central Europe, notably Poland. L&amp;M remained resilient despite the 0.2 share point decline to 6.5%, attributable to adult smokers upgrading to Marlboro in Greece and Poland.</p>
          <p>Chesterfield gained 0.3 points to reach 3.5%, reinforcing our overall position in the low-price segment. Overall, our cigarette market share remained stable at 38.1%. While we further expanded our position in fine cut, adding 0.6 points to reach a category share of 13.4%. Across the EU region, our pricing remains strong, the latest increase having taken place this month in France. However, the positive pricing variance was insufficient to offset the volume decline.</p>
          <p>Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency, were consequently down by 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. This also reflects the continued investment behind our brand and skilled sales force. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted OCI on the same basis has decreased by just 0.9% and we remain confident that we should be able to achieve an increase in profitability excluding currency in the EU region for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>Our results in the Asia region were impacted by the difficult volume comparison in Japan and Korea where our shipment grew by 47.1% and 22.4%, respectively in the third quarter of 2011. We also face challenging comparisons in Indonesia where we achieved a 22.5% volume increase in the third quarter of last year. Nevertheless, our volume this quarter in Indonesia grew by a further 13% as we continued to increase our share in this growing market.</p>
          <p>Adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisition, grew by 1.2% in the Asia region during the quarter, this despite the unfavorable geographic mix. Improved profitability in Indonesia and higher pricing across the region more than offset the impact of lower volumes in Japan and Korea. Importantly, our market share in Korea has sequentially improved from the second to third quarter of this year and is at a higher margin following our price increase in February 2012.</p>
          <p>Industry volume in Japan declined by 7.7% in the quarter compared to a very distorted third quarter last year when distributor and trade inventories had been replenished to ensure adequate stock levels following the events in Japan. Nevertheless, we still expect stable industry volume for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>PMI's market share of 27.5% in the third quarter reflects a continued positive trend for Marlboro which increased its quarterly share sequentially in 2012 to 12.5%. On a September year-to-date basis, PMI's market share of 27.8% remains nearly three share points higher than the level before the events unfolded in Japan last year. However, we have witnessed unusually high levels of competitive product introductions which have put pressure on our traditional brands, Lark and Philip Morris.</p>
          <p>We continue to develop our innovation pipeline and expect Marlboro's positive momentum to continue. For the full year, we are now expecting our market share to be slightly below our 2011 exit share of approximately 28%. Our leading position and our strong share momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Market growth is expected to continue, driven by favorable demographics. In addition, improving consumer purchasing power is helping to drive uptrading with the premium segment reaching a share of 27.4% in the third quarter compared to 24.9% a year ago.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we witnessed a decline in the low-price segment, where retail selling prices have increased at a faster rate than in other price segments. As a result, combined with anticipated enforcement of Decree <mark type="ph" /> 191 (14:04) by the end of November, which will eliminate a tax loop hole, we expect industry volume to grow in the range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>Our volume increased by a further 13% in the third quarter and market share grew by 3.3 points to 34.9% with a particularly strong performance from premium price Sampoerna A in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:33) category and Marlboro in the white cigarette category.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude the Asia region with an update on plain packaging. As you know, the Australian High Court ruled in August that the plain packaging legislation does not violate the Australian Constitution and on October 5, issued its reasoning. In reaching their conclusion, <mark type="audio gap" /> (14:59 &#x2013; 15:02) plain packaging deprived tobacco companies of valuable intellectual property. The conclusions of the High Court are significant for other governments considering plain packaging, as they demonstrate that plain packaging is a deprivation of property, something that we expect will raise serious questions about the legality of plain packaging legislation in other jurisdictions. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:31) packages is not unique nature of the Australian Constitution which provides broad powers to the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws but contains few protections for basic rights. Australian law is violated only if the government, as the taker of property, receives a proprietary benefit from that property.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that the property was taken, the Court found that the government did not acquire the property because it did not receive such a proprietary benefit. By contrast, the law in Europe and other countries is different. For example, in contrast to the Australian Constitution, the constitutions of the EU member states generally contain strong protection for fundamental rights and place limits on the powers of central governments. A finding that manufacturers have been deprived of property would, in our view, amount to a violation of a number of EU and member state laws.</p>
          <p>Due to the scope of this specific case, the Australian High Court did not rule on whether plain packaging would reduce smoking prevalence or whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations. The High Court ruling confirms that other ongoing international legal cases are strong and that Australian government is at serious risk of having to pay substantial compensation in these cases of bringing its plain packaging measures into conformity with international treaties or <mark type="ph" /> laws (17:07).</p>
          <p>Three countries have already initiated proceedings against Australia before the World Trade Organization on the ground that the plain packaging legislation is contrary to Australia's obligation as a WTO member. Philip Morris Asia is suing the Australian government for multiple breaches of its bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. Decisions in these cases are expected within two to three years. In gross terms, these cases will examine a number of issues including whether there is any solid evidence that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates, whether there are effective, less restrictive alternatives that Australia could have implemented instead, whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations and whether the Australian government will need to pay compensation to Philip Morris Asia. We believe that the international legal cases are strong and there is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and resolved.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the Latin America and Canada region which had solid share momentum in the third quarter. Although volume was down, we increased our share in the key markets of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Marlboro was particularly strong across the region with share up in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 10.5% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The EEMA region was our strongest performer in the quarter, this despite the challenging comparison. Volume grew by 3% with continued strong business momentum in Russia and Turkey as well as an improving market climate in Egypt. Higher volume, a favorable mix and pricing in Russia and many other markets resulted in a growth in adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisition of 17.3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our volume mix has been favorable in the EEMA region.</p>
          <p>Russia was a key driver of our strong EEMA region performance both in terms of volume and pricing. In July, we implemented a tax-driven 3 ruble per pack price increase. Along with lower revised estimates for industry volume in the first half of the year and higher prices in the market, industry volume is now expected to show a slight decline for the full year 2012. Our volume in contrast increased by 4.5% in the quarter, thanks to our good share momentum as well as some favorable inventory adjustments.</p>
          <p>Our Nielsen market share on a quarter and year-to-date basis through the end of August was 0.7 and 0.6 points higher at 26.5% and 26.2%, respectively. Parliament, Bond Street and Next have remained the key drivers of our stronger share performance. We are also pleased that L&amp;M's turnaround is gaining momentum with a 0.2 share point gain in the first two months of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Russia, the government approved amendments to the tax code at the end of September including excise tax rates for the period 2013 through 2016. The government has reconfirmed the excise tax rates for cigarettes in 2013 and 2014 and extended the tax code to 2015 with an indexation of the specific excise tax set at 20%. The Duma will now review the code by mid-November and we expect a final vote by year-end.</p>
          <p>On a year-to-date September basis, Marlboro grew share in all four regions benefiting from a robust pipeline of innovative products. Marlboro's share increased notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, and Poland. On a worldwide basis, excluding China and the USA, the brand's share increased 9.3%. While we are pleased by Marlboro's strong performance, we are even more delighted by Parliament in the adult premium segment.</p>
          <p>Parliament's volume increased by 10.7% in the third quarter and by 9.4% so far this year. The brand has gained share year-to-date in four of its most important markets and is making inroads in newer markets. In Turkey, Parliament achieved a market share of 8.7%, representing a gain of 0.8 points August year-to-date.</p>
          <p>We continue to expand our market share in our top Turkey OCI markets. Our September year-to-date share reached 37%. This is 0.4% points above our full-year 2011 share and 1.5 points above our full-year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:41). The pricing environment continues to be favorable. This is highlighted by the $505 million in pricing volume that we achieved in the third quarter and the $1.3 billion year-to-date. The combination of strong pricing, limited input cost increases and productivity savings has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margin.</p>
          <p>On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin excluding currency and acquisitions reached 46.2%, a gain of 0.7 points in the first nine months of the year. On a September year-to-date basis, our free cash flow reached $7.1 billion. Compared to the previous year, free cash flow excluding currency was down $1.7 billion, or 18.6%. The decrease was driven by higher working capital requirements mainly related to finished goods <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:46) and the planned replenishment of tobacco leaf and clove inventories.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2012, we expect that our free cash flow excluding currency will be down slightly and will not adversely impact our dividend and share repurchase program. Our confidence in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to continue to generate significant cash flow is reflected in the 10.4% increase in our dividend that was announced last month.</p>
          <p>Since the March 2008 spin-off, we have raised the dividend five times, increasing the annualized dividend by almost 85% over the period. We spent $1.5 billion to repurchase a further 16.7 million shares in the third quarter. Since the spin-off, we have now used almost $26 billion to repurchase nearly 467 million shares at an average price of $55.49.  We continue to target spending of $6 billion this year.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the third quarter of 2012 was as expected a difficult quarter in terms of comparisons with last year's record third quarter. Looking at our performance year-to-date through September, we remain confident that for the full year 2012, we should be able to deliver another 1% organic volume annual growth target driven by strong performances in the Asia and EEMA regions. We narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance to $5.12 to $5.18 excluding the impact of currency, a tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver superior returns to our shareholders evidenced by the fifth consecutive increase in our dividend since the spin and our $6 billion target for share repurchases this year. Thank you and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jacek, so, first, just in terms of guidance, I guess, there's a lot of confusion just in terms of your guidance update. So, if we look at the reported guidance now $5.12 to $5.18 and compare that versus your prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.20, at the midpoint, it doesn't look like it's changed a whole lot, but you basically have taken the underlying guidance up, currency is a little bit more favorable. So, you can just bridge the guidance kind of from $5.10 to $5.20, to $5.12 to $5.18 both underlying and currency and et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, Judy. I think I will start with our previous guidance which was $5.10 to $5.20, and if you remember at that time, this guidance included the $0.27 of unfavorable currency versus 2011. Our new guidance assumes the $0.23 cents of unfavorable currency, again, versus 2011. So, we have a gain of $0.04 on the currency. Also in our previous guidance, we did not have the impact of the tax charge of $0.05 related to the closing of the U.S. tax audit and the $0.01 for the asset impairment and exit costs. So, it gives me $0.06, or gives us a $0.06 of adjustment, if you like.</p>
          <p>So, if I had $0.05 adjusted for better currency of $0.04, adjusted for the tax charge negative $0.06, I am at the &#x2013; we were at the $5.08 to $5.18 which would we narrowed upwards, if you like, to the $5.12, $5.18 and this should imply a growth rate on ex-currency basis of approximately, as we said, 11% to 12% versus the adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in the previous year. Now I think it's clear &#x2013; it should be clearer now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, when you think about 2013 and you think about your long-term growth target of 10% to 12% growth, would you be targeting to grow off of the $5.12 to $5.18 or the $5.18 to $5.24?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for this year would be $5.18 to $5.24. Actually, you should say $5.19 to $5.25. Not to further complicate the issue, we had $0.01 of adjustment in the first two quarters of the year and the $0.01 extra of the adjustment for the <mark type="ph" /> extra restructuring (28:57) in the third quarter. So, to be perfectly accurate, I should say $5.19 to $5.25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is the base that you would target the 10% to 12% off for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. <mark type="ph" /> That's what I would do. (29:10)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you and then just in terms of EU, Jacek, so, it sounds like you're expecting some recovery in fourth quarter just versus what you have been seeing year-to-date. So, can you just walk us through kind of why you're thinking that you do get some nice bounce-back in fourth quarter to kind of get to that full year down 6% for EU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's partially due to the comps which we expect for the Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. We had a very bad, or very low quarter driven by some timing of the pricing tax changes in the last year. So, we expect this to ease the pressure for this year. And also, we see how the quarter three which was very low &#x2013; sorry, quarter two which was very low for the EU and then how quarter three we closed, I think this give us the confidence that we should be in the range of 6% even I would say marginally, marginally the volumes for the total market in EU may go a little bit below 6%, well, let's say 6% is what we <mark type="ph" /> forecast (30:19).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My first question is on Japan. As you discussed, you put a lot of new products in the market. So, could you talk about how you're balancing this innovation while maintaining strength with some of your core brands in the country? And also could you give us some more color on the competitive pressures and how you see this playing out next year? Especially in light of Japan Tobacco's plans to change their Mild Seven brand name?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I said in our remarks, we are very pleased with the performance of Marlboro which not only is obviously above the level which it had before the special situations in Japan, but also sequentially as reported this year, Marlboro had higher share. Our focus since the beginning of the year was essentially primarily on Marlboro. So, four out of five of the big new initiatives which we have deployed into the market were behind Marlboro &#x2013; two behind Marlboro Ice Blast and the two behind Marlboro Edge.</p>
          <p>The most growing or the most dynamic segment today in Japan is around menthol super slim propositions and sometimes with the capsules &#x2013; with the menthol capsules, and this is exactly what we're pushing behind Marlboro. JT, because this I was referring mainly as the competitor deploying quite a bit of large amount of new initiatives into market seems that they took a little bit of different approach. The focus was broadly on the entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, clearly, there are some brands which are more on the traditional spectrum of the consumers and, hence, the losses which we incurred in the quarter of this year on more of our traditional brand which is Lark. So, Marlboro is in a very good shape. I think the innovations behind Marlboro &#x2013; what we already deployed this year and what we have in the pipeline for the next year, I think we are in a good shape. It's more of that the focus of JT on &#x2013; and they're deploying a number of innovations there hurt our share a little bit below the 28% exit share.</p>
          <p>Now with regards to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:49) and the Mild Seven, it is difficult for me to comment on a competitor's move. It is clearly a very bold and a brave move and creates some challenges presumably for JT and creates, I would argue, some opportunities for others. So, let's see how the thing is going to unfold in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then I have another question and it would be on Russia. How are you guys going to manage this scenario, where there likely will be increased regulations, smoking bans and then taxes? What are your expectations for consumption in the market and consumer behavior if these proposals are enacted? And then could you give us just a little bit more color on the progress you're making with Marlboro in Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on a tax in Russia, I think, first, we are very pleased that the Russian government continues with the three-years tax outlook. I mean, we always &#x2013; I think it is good from the government's perspective from their revenues and also from the industry, a large perspective to have a three-years tax visibility. <mark type="ph" /> Having the 2015, (33:59) clarifying what rates they would like to have, it is very helpful.</p>
          <p>Now that clearly, there will be a substantial tax increase in 2013 and 2014 and 2015 but something which we planned or you could say we anticipated. So, I think it's, at the end of the day, it's going to turn manageable on the tax side. On the regulatory side &#x2013; now, this tax, just for us to understand, still needs to be approved by the Duma. So, this is not a final thing but this is what we know at this point in time.</p>
          <p>In terms of regulatory, okay, they had three issues or the three subjects which they want to cover for the regulatory <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:41) Cabinet approved and move it now to Duma for Duma debate is a smoking ban for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:48) sector <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:50) restaurant which I think they target in 2015 as implementation, so it's not 2013 or 2014, it's 2015 and they will place this ban which is 2013, i.e., next year.</p>
          <p>Then you have some restrictions on sales in the outlets below the 50 square meters. So, that's clearly will have some impact on our volume allocations between our trade channels and the experience from other markets is that this &#x2013; it makes it a little bit more <mark type="ph" /> difficult (35:18) for customers to walk a few extra hundred meters to the next shop but doesn't impact the smoking rate or consumption.</p>
          <p>As is potentially the smoking &#x2013; the smoking ban because if I go to the more mature market, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:35) most of the countries in the planet who have a &#x2013; in the world who have a smoking ban, you have an impact of 1% to 2% at the beginning of the <mark type="ph" /> limitation (35:41) and then the market moderated sometimes even comes back to the previous level. So, I think it is overall pretty manageable situation, but we need to assume that Russia is moving to the total market performance when you are observing a more mature country, so maybe 1%, maybe 2% total of the total industry decline.</p>

          <p>Yes, I can hear you very well. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. First, Jacek, could you help me understand the magnitude of the negative effect you had in the Asian division from the year ago increase in trade inventories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're referring mostly to Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In Japan, the situation was like this. We had what we announced at the end of the year, we had the hurdle &#x2013; what we called the hurdle in Japan, the 6.3 billion unit was the equivalent what we said $0.10 cents on <mark type="ph" /> EPS (36:55) and this was related to the hurdle which we had in the second quarter &#x2013; mainly in the second quarter of last year, okay, due to the higher in-market sales and higher market share.</p>
          <p>What we had been confronted with in the third quarter of last year is that obviously following the high sales in the second quarter, we ended up with a extremely low inventory trade level and we had to replenish this inventory to the safety level. And that essentially when the distortions comes through and if you would do the quantification of this thing, I think that the adjustment would be the range of, say about 1 billion units, okay, for Philip Morris. So, you're talking about that sort of a distortions which we have to take, while we have to replenish inventories to the safety levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, Jacek, in the EU, you obviously have had run that division. What's the midterm outlook for Philip Morris in the EU? Do you think it's reasonable that for the foreseeable future that you can maintain local currency operating income? Do you think that that's an ambitious objective, or do you think despite the economic situation, the unemployment levels and so forth, you can continue to eke out a little bit of growth over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, listen, we managed to maintain, if not actually we expect that we even can slightly grow the profitability on a net currency basis this year. So, yeah, it is ambitious, but there is a huge effort. You see how &#x2013; what we're doing with Marlboro and how we <mark type="ph" /> managed to price back (38:36), how we <mark type="ph" /> guiding roughly to the share of the segment (38:40). So, obviously, we are trying to manage and mitigate the impact of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Now until you see the improvement of unemployment very much in the South of Europe because this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:52) performance of entire EU. I hardly can see how the situations can improve, but we are already third year in a crisis &#x2013; I'm talking Philip Morris and we've managed the situations pretty well. So, unless there are any shocking type of excise increases which we don't see today at all, I think the situation is very challenging and we all know it, but I think it's manageable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two other quick things, Jacek. The resignation of the EU Health Minister, do you think that's going to have any effect on the outcome or the timing of the pending update of the tobacco products directive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:37) the EU should be today after the inter-service consultation, okay. There were some delays before the departure of Mr. Dalli. And we learned about the new development &#x2013; the sudden departure, listen, we just hope that the EU commission will have a transparent, evidenced-based process while reviewing this directive. But at this stage, we do not know how the departure of Mr. Dalli will impact the timing of the TPD review with the development of the last couple of days <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:09).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, Jacek, on working capital, is the build or the use of cash flow for inventories and so forth this year, is that a one-off phenomena? Is that going to be a negligible number next year or will there be a working capital build next year in all likelihood as well but it will be considerably less than this year or do you envision a similar level of incremental use of cash for working capital next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are three elements which are the three key drivers behind the working capital development this year. One is the forestalling inventory, right? And that is a variant on which depends on the timing and the level of the tax price changes. So, that will remain but I can't give you the marketing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:56) because this we don't know, frankly speaking. The two others is the inventory of leaf &#x2013; level of inventory of leaf and inventory of cloves. And here, the situation is a little bit different because we had a very high level of sales also driven by Japan last year and now the inventory has to be adjusted, okay, because we finished the inventory in 2011 at a little bit lower level because we used up leaf in our cigarettes which we sold last year.</p>
          <p>We continue with the high volume this year and you see that we are shooting still at the 1% organic volume growth target. So, we'll continue <mark type="ph" /> leaf (41:30) to reduce my leaf inventory, which is a good thing because I'm using this to support my sales. Cloves is a little bit different thing because there is a cyclical clove and this year, I have a very high clove at much more attractive prices than the previous year, so I have no choice. Actually, we are doing what everyone should do. We have to buy cloves, when it is in the big supply at the right prices. Okay, so cloves presumably may ease a little bit next year but the rest we'll have to see.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. If I could follow up on the question on the European Union tobacco products directive, is there any clearer sense &#x2013; I understand the timing issue but in terms of what we should be expecting as major initiatives embedded within that? And then secondly, on the Philippines, I noted the market share losses and the citation that that was driven by Champion and Hope. I wondered if you could talk about what happened there and then, secondarily, the prospects for the tax law change given the changes in the Senate and the various options going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Erik, on the TPD, as I answered the previous question, I mean, it's hard to say today what the outcome in terms of the timing is going to be. We have not much of a visibility what <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:18) the directive. As I said, the inter-service consultation should have already be at the end and it has not started yet.</p>
          <p>So, clearly, the idea of the proposal there attract a lot of attention and, therefore, the draft proposal is not issued yet. So, we have to just be patient and wait for this one. Moving to Philippines, yes, we had I think about two points of the market share loss in the quarter in Philippines that's driven by the low price or bottom of the market. We had some pressure from, I think, one of the competitors.</p>
          <p>You know that there are some distortions due to the fact that some competitors are charging prices which is difficult to reconcile if somebody would pay the full excise. So, I think there was a bit of a tax loophole or that sort of a nature problem. We have adjusted in some regions, I think, the price of a Champion, so we're defending our position. But other than that, we're doing okay. Marlboro was up. Fortune was up. So, I think that's the only problem which we have on our share.</p>
          <p>With regard to the tax, I think the Senate just now or next week goes into recess. I don't think the Senate has yet issued or concluded with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:43). Depends on how much the Senate will be different to the House of Representatives bill. They will have a Bicameral Conference Committee when they will reconcile the differences. I think we need to wait until the end of November to have a tax visibility for Philippines.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I said, we have, I think, four test markets with the joint venture where we're testing the product. We're trying to understand what is the right way of marketing this product to adult &#x2013; to consumers. The whole behavioral part of <mark type="ph" /> testing (45:42), et cetera. I think it's a mid long-term project. So, I wouldn't go into the specifics of each individual test, it's a step-by-step learning cultural <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:52).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was just wondering if we can delve a little bit more into Italy. I'm sorry, the line wasn't that good. But first of all, did you say that illicit trade had picked up from about 6.5% to 9%? Was that the correct figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that correct figure. You got it correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we've got a 2% or 3% legal market decline stemming from that. What sort of shift out of factory-made cigarettes would that fine cut growth have caused?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fine cut growth we said by about 40%. I think about half of the volume decline in Italy would be due to the price elasticity and half would be somehow almost equally distributed between fine cut and illicit trade. You'll have to zoom into the geography in Italy because there was a lot of growth of the contraband in the South of Italy. There are towns now, which last year had contraband below 10% and this year, they have 50% and obviously, I can show you the names of <mark type="ph" /> an office (47:22) in Palermo <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:26) this is what is happening there. But that's about, I think, would be a third of the distribution of the losses, if you like, in Italy; about half is due to the elasticity and the remaining half in equal parts would be about the illicit trade <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:46).</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have to go &#x2013; okay, this year, I think we had March &#x20AC;0.10 &#x2013; &#x20AC;0.10 per pack and last year, you had September &#x20AC;0.20 and July &#x20AC;0.10. So, I think year-on-year basis <mark type="ph" /> evolved (48:14) to finish at the end of this quarter, you had a 4% price increase on a year-to-date basis.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jacek, can you elaborate a little bit on your views about slowdown of economies in Asia in particular and what impact that could have on market volume growth, on uptrading versus downtrading, on your ability to take pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the bigger slowdown is what I <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:38) in China. So, for the time being not impacted directly, but you take &#x2013; and then if you look into Indonesia, okay, where there is a slowdown and we still expect the economy to grow 6%, 6.5%, highest, I think, consumer confidence and moderate inflation, Indonesia which is a big market for us. I don't think we have any sort of the headwinds there.</p>
          <p>Philippines, okay, we have the open tax issue, but other than that, I think the underlying economy is not doing that bad. As I said, I don't want to downplay what we read, but I think it's much more coming from China and China as I said, for the time being does not have that much of an impact on us.</p>

          <p>I think &#x2013; I see the forecast today. As I said, in a big, large market for us, Philippines, Indonesia, okay, Japan is a different story, but even in Japan this year, following this distortion, et cetera, we estimate about a flat market. I think we should <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:56). In Indonesia, we think the market is going to grow in the range 6% to 7%. I think that earlier this year, we talk about 8%. Actually, if I look at the composition of the mix in the market, because there is a lot of uptrading, I think the value of the market goes better with 6%, 7% volume growth assumptions that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:17) previously. Not today. I mean, today I don't think that.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then in Japan, it seems like Japan Tobacco has been, for lack of a better word, out innovating you for two or three quarters now. Do you expect JT &#x2013; at what point do you expect JT to slow down their innovations or at what point would you have to step up your innovations for the market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think they &#x2013; I wouldn't say that they over-innovate us. I think there is not that they have an innovation in terms of a benefit offer to their smoker which is better than ours. I wouldn't say like this. It is just the number of the launches which they did in the last three quarters. Not on the quality, more on the quantity. Listen, I am not <mark type="ph" /> in charge (52:10) of JT. I can't comment on this &#x2013; when they will stop launching more products.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, we still have &#x2013; we just launched this week <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:28) Virginia Slims, so now we're moving to other brands where we have a pipeline of initiatives also prepared. But I think, each of these initiatives has to be launched properly to the market and we need the time to work it with the customer. Probably, it's too many things in a too short period of time. In the long run, it is not Philip Morris <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:48).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just had a couple questions for you, if I could. They're mostly just follow-ups. I wanted to ask you a quick follow-up on Japan which is, what's the underlying decline rate you expect for that market this year? If you said that, I missed that. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for this year, I think we estimate the market to be flat versus last year. So, I think with our estimate, the market should close at about 195 billion units, 196 billion units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, therefore, the decline this quarter was not unique or different from you what expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because you have, as I said, I think there was a replenishment of inventories which I quantified for us to be about 1 billion units and I think on the total market, the estimate will be in a range of 3 billion units &#x2013; the third quarter last year. So, I think if you factored it in, you will come to the &#x2013; more of the normal situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask Russia. There was a comment about inventory moving to this quarter and then &#x2013; so, is there a way to quantify how much maybe that helped your shipments in the quarter? And then related to that, I k now you've had a better share there. It's coming from brands other than Marlboro and I know you have some new products behind Marlboro. So, just curious if you can comment on that and kind of the state of Marlboro in Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the impact on the shipment was &#x2013; I said was coming from inventories but we also have a strong share growth in Russia, okay, and this is behind all brands. Not at this stage by Marlboro. Now Marlboro, yes, we have launched Clear Taste, some of the extensions of the Marlboro family into the Clear Taste. But I think on Marlboro, maybe I should put it like this. Marlboro is for us a midterm <mark type="ph" /> journey (54:51). We have three issues which we have to continue addressing with regard to the Marlboro and their performance versus our standard in Russia.</p>
          <p>One is the premium <mark type="ph" /> lit (55:00) of Marlboro which we are trying to correct with pricing Marlboro higher than it used to be. So, the last two price increases, Marlboro actually took a bit more of the price increase that was the increase in the market. Second thing is Marlboro had an issue of harsh perception and this is what we are addressing as we speak with the launch of the Marlboro Clear Taste. And the third one is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:22) Marlboro and we continue this with our marketing programs in place. I think we're making progress but in order to claim that we have a sustainable growth of Marlboro in Russia, I think we need to be a little bit patient and we are patient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have one final question for and you that's just in relation to the EU region. It's going to be your third year of roughly 5% to 6% declines in volume and I guess, it's difficult to predict the state of Southern Europe and some those countries, looking ahead, whether it be one year or one to three years, is the &#x2013; obviously, the risk in those markets where you've had this increase in illicit trade, such that you could continue to see those kind of declines in the EU region overall, I guess my question is just related to the illicit trade if that's becoming obviously a larger and larger issue in some of these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, every single government is getting focused or has the right focus now on illicit trade, because we are living with the consequences of, in some countries, high tax increases in the past and also the sudden erosion of the consumer purchasing power because all these austerity measures dented what consumer has in their pocket. I think I said in the remarks if I look in Germany when we see the markets doing very well, I mean, our quarter three was pretty strong and we're still looking for the full good year of total industry volumes in Germany. I think that's partially because the illicit trade comes back, at least to some extent to the legal market.</p>
          <p>So, I think, what we confronted today in the South of Europe, one day this volume at least to some extent will come back to the tax-paid volumes, to the industry volumes. But as I said, unless you see the improvement on unemployment side, I don't think we should be betting on any sudden improvement in EU.</p>

          <p>Well, hi, everyone. Could you just let us know if there was any news in Turkey with regards to the excise tax reform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; well, the only news which we had is that I think that the government has already increased taxes on alcohol, fuel and some other categories. So, frankly speaking, I would expect an announcement of a tax increase or tax change in Turkey somewhere before the year-end or at the very beginning of the next year. You know that the government has received authorization from the Parliament to implement a specific compliment. This will be first time historically when Turkey would have specific compliment but we need still to see the announcement of the government.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one question about France, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the outlook? I appreciate that Marlboro has been obviously impacted by costs in the &#x20AC;6 per pack price point. But any thoughts on the market will be appreciated. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market for the quarter was down a little bit less than 5%, 4.5%, 4.6%. Year-to-date, I think the market is about 4.2% down. We now had the price increase of the &#x20AC;0.40, so Marlboro went from &#x20AC;6.20 to &#x20AC;6.60. But the low-price cigarettes went from &#x20AC;5.70 to &#x20AC;6.10. So, somehow there's psychological price point barrier is removed but the prices are higher in the market. I think, Marlboro has more of that pressure being along above the &#x20AC;6 which is <mark type="ph" /> somehow we move (59:20) but the prices are higher in the market. We will see how it develops. You hear about some austerity measures in France taking place and so on. So, I think we need to see how that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:33) and what impact it will have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there was some discussions due to the Q3 in 2011 in Ukraine. So, the market was looking &#x2013; was I think 10% lower in the Q3 this year, but I think it was very much driven by some distortions in Q3 2011. But on a year-to-date basis, it's presumably a little better number for Ukraine, 3.5% and I think we estimate that the full year will be in a range of about 3%, full year total industry volumes.</p>

          <p>I wanted to circle back to the Philippines. While I recognize it's still early in terms of the legislation that's coming out of the Senate and the House in terms of the excise taxes, I was curious if you could at least comment on the price elasticities in that market and how they compare to other emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the market &#x2013; total market, this year, I think we estimate the full-year total market will actually cross 100 billion units &#x2013; I think we estimate like 101 billion units. So, this would represent sales growth to the 3% growth of the market. And there is a price in which we took in the market. Today, the elasticities will be in a range which you see in other places. If you ask me the question how we see <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:39) of the tax implementation then I need to know what is the tax, which final will be implemented there. So, there is a little bit of a speculation of this space. I don't know if I answered the question. This year, I think the market will grow in a range of up to 3%. This is our estimate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. In terms of the EU, given the outsized growth that you saw in other tobacco products, while those are definitely lower margin, I was curious, at least directionally, what your organic profit growth would have looked like on just a cigarette basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> The inventory in the (62:23) fine cut because consumers have preferences for usage of our cigarette brands. I mean, hence, we saw a very rapid share advancement in this category. The fine cut <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:33) unit profitability than the cigarettes, but this is also within the current tax structure, the governments &#x2013; some governments are also looking into restructuring of the tax from the current code, et cetera. So, it's important element &#x2013; it's becoming important element not in terms of our profitability but <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:53) which we are delivering to the consumers. This is how we look at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:57). Part of this volumes I also think will one day come back to the manufactured cigarettes.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. I guess can you talk a little bit about EEMA pricing, right? Pricing was good but margins really took a jump. I understand you took the price increase in Russia, but is there anything else in there that would have driven pricing and margin up that significantly and I guess can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of these margins because I think they're the highest on a quarterly basis anyway that we have seen in a while?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had some pricing in Ukraine as well, so it's not just Russia &#x2013; and Turkey. So, it's not just Russia and EEMA which drives the price. In fact, sustainability of the thing, yes, I think in general &#x2013; I think in general, we say that the pricing environment seems manageable, favorable and you've seen how much we have a pricing variance year-to-date on a global basis and I think that thing is going to continue. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And I guess one quick thing on the EU, right. I think you've been clear that without unemployment getting fixed, that market continues to decline and I guess can you just talk about the ability to continue time after time to generate that 1% volume growth for the total company with an EU drag of 6%? I mean can you just put a little color around your ability to keep doing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that this year is going to be the perfect testimony that this is achievable because we have, in EU, when we predicted the total industry volumes to go down by 6% and despite even the difficult comps in Asia, we say that PMI can deliver 1% organic volume growth target. I think the engines in EEMA and Asia are working at the full throttle and they can cover up for the challenging environment which we unfortunately have in EU. But I feel pretty okay about it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to touch on illicit trade. I know you've outlined the size of that opportunity in a lot of markets, but it seems like it rarely goes down. It did in Turkey this quarter. What were some of the drivers there? Is there any color you can give on what would have helped that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the price is a government focus and it's not just an industry or finance or customs authorities, but there is, as I understand, a number of ministries and state agencies which finally stepped together and decided to do something about it. And to their credit, they did a phenomenal job. I think the situation or the tensions on Turkey-Syria border also helping a little bit. Okay? There's obviously more intensity of the border controls, et cetera. So, those are the key drivers. I think the government which seems to be committed to address the issue of contraband <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:23).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then back to Russia, I know we've covered a lot of stuff here. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you were saying. If the tax increase is approved by the Duma as it stands now and as it's written, are you saying that that would be manageable or would you characterize that as a disruptive tax increase or just at least looking from this year to next, what's the magnitude of that in your opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:57) if it stays as it's proposed by the government. Now, the next year, this will translate into the platform of 6 rubles and thereafter about 9 rubles. You take the pricing in Russia, you take the inflation &#x2013; it is an increase. Is it is not a minor increase but as I said, I think it's substantial but manageable but this is not a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (67:21) increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the positive is obviously that it's laid out over a multiyear progression and you would have the predictability, but how big of a risk do you see for next year if that goes through as proposed now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is the second year in a row we have a three-years tax visibility. So, I think the government &#x2013; more governments, not only Russia, are going into that sort of an approach. Germany and other places where they want to see three, four, five years tax outlook, set at that rate, and that clearly demonstrates that there was also a benefit for the government in doing this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question, a little different. I know at the Analyst Day, you laid out a lot of great stuff about the next generation products, but clearly, it takes a little bit of time to commercialize those and get the approvals that you are looking for. Given the success of e-cigarettes in the U.S., would you consider putting those on the market anywhere? I know you were clear about how the nicotine delivery is nowhere near as comparable, but to the extent that there seems to be a consumer acceptance, at least in the market here, would that change how you think about doing that as maybe sort of an interim step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, listen, our strategy is very clear on this one. We want to commercialize this product with but with a claim. So, I need the regulatory approval to allow me to say what the product which we have, one of the three platforms which we're working on can provide in terms of the benefits to a consumer. So, we don't want to make a shortcut on this one. I launched a product which we have but without being able to make the claim. I think that's very important.</p>

          <p>One, I am afraid I can't share it with you.
