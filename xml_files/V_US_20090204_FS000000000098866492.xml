        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that in spite of the ongoing challenges with the economy we began our fiscal 2009 with solid results across the board, keeping in mind that our first quarter service revenue, which represents approximately 40% of our total revenue, is based on a one quarter lag. Earnings, revenues and payment volumes all came in better than we anticipated going into the year.</p>
          <p>The resilience of our business could be seen in the contribution of our debit products in the U.S. as consumers continued to more frequently use debit as a method of payment. In addition, we also saw growth in credit products outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets. That said, the economic situation across the globe has had and will continue to have an effect on dollar payment volumes in the U.S. and internationally for at least the next two to three quarters.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I should point out that Visa continues to benefit from growth in the number of transactions conducted over our network. As a reminder, approximately 30% of our revenue is derived from the absolute number of transactions that take place over VisaNet. This volume grew 8% in the December quarter, to almost 10 billion transactions, demonstrating that even in severe economic times Visa continues to take volume from cash and checks.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you a brief overview of the financials for the quarter. Once again, with the one quarter service revenue lag in mind, net operating revenues in the first quarter were just over $1.7 billion, an increase of 17% over the year-ago period and ahead of our guidance. Operating margins which benefited from seasonal impacts were strong as well and exceeded our stated full year guidance of the mid to high 40% range. And adjusted first quarter net income of $599 million was 35% greater than the year ago period.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we are now seeing signs of a more pronounced decline in U.S. payment volume growth, and global cross border volumes than we had expected going into our fiscal year. While we began 2009 with the expectation that revenue growth would slow to the high single digits in the back half of the year, we are now projecting that growth to be &#x2013; that growth to be in the low single digits. So our full year fiscal 2009 revenue now looks to be in the high single digits, somewhere below our longer term guidance of 11 to 15%.</p>
          <p>In our next fiscal quarter, however, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in the middle of the 11 to 15% guidance range as it benefits from a one-time $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year. This means that the normalized second quarter growth rate is expected to be in the mid to high single digits, further decelerating in the second half of the year to the low single digits.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we are reducing expenses, which based on the current trends we see for the year, will help us meet our objective of 2009 diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. Specifically, we have accelerated our previously announced global integration efforts. As we continue to integrate our previously independent operating units, we are reducing duplication and prioritizing our project funding, including our marketing spend, which we expect to be somewhat below the level of fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>As a result, we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings per share and operating margin guidance. But let me be absolutely clear about our operating plans. All of these efforts will be consistent with fully funding our growth initiatives. Byron will provide additional detail on our guidance momentarily.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to fiscal 2010 we are cautiously optimistic that we can regain our 11 to 15% revenue growth targets, assuming some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross border volumes by early 2010, and the anticipated more favorable year-over-year comparisons on gas prices and foreign exchange rates. On that basis, we reaffirm all of our guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin targets even if the revenue growth is somewhat below our guidance range. To deliver these results in challenging times it is more critical than ever that we have the people and the mechanisms in place to effectively engage our clients. We are focusing on their specific business needs and challenges and creating programs to help them build stronger and more profitable relationships with their customers, and as we make our business decisions, we will thoughtfully consider how our actions may impact our clients' businesses. Of course, we take nothing for granted but we believe this commitment to client service combined with our product and network strengths position us well, particularly during a period of intense consolidation in the banking industry.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and our current thinking and financial guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and then I'll touch on trends we're seeing for the quarter ending in December, as well as some early results for January.</p>
          <p>As Joe mentioned, it was an encouraging start to 2009 with solid revenue and earnings growth, keeping in mind that service revenues, which represent almost 40% of revenue are reported on a one quarter lag.</p>
          <p>Total payment volume through the end of September 2008 grew 12% to $701 billion over the same quarter of 2007. During this time, the U.S. posted solid results, growing 9% to $421 billion. Broken down further: debit delivered a strong 14% growth, while credit continued to moderate and slowed to 3% from the prior period's 5%. As a reminder, our U.S. payment volume is about equally distributed between debit and credit.</p>
          <p>On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 22%, modestly higher than the 20% growth of the June quarter. In contrast to the September ending quarter, cross-border volume growth in the December ending quarter slowed to zero on a constant dollar basis, down from low double-digits in the prior period. This slowdown was broad-based.</p>
          <p>Globally, which excludes Visa Europe, total cards outstanding for the period ending September grew 10% with 1.7 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit cards grew 6%, to 812 million cards, while debit rose 14%, to 864 million cards. Importantly, international growth of 16% remains very healthy. Card growth combined with ongoing efforts to broaden acceptance and usage represent a significant opportunity.</p>
          <p>Transactions processed over Visa's network, which are reported with no quarterly lag, totaled $9.8 billion in the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 8% over the similar period a year ago. It is important to reiterate a point that Joe made at the beginning of this call. While payment volume and average ticket sizes are moderating in the face of much more difficult economic times, our transaction counts, which are an important component of our net revenue, are growing very well, as the underlying secular shift to electronic payment and more precisely to Visa, continues.</p>
          <p>Turning to the income statement. In the first quarter, gross revenues of 2 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2007. Volume and support incentives increased by $19 million to 269 million, which represented 13% of gross revenue, moderately below our expectations coming into the year. Volume and support incentives are recognized based on current quarter results and this decline was almost entirely a function of lower fiscal first quarter payment volumes, which in turn resulted in lower payments and accruals. We expect that this dynamic will continue to provide some level of offset to lower revenue growth in our second quarter.</p>
          <p>Given our updated full year revenue projections, we now expect 2009 volume and support incentives to be 14 to 16% of gross revenue, down from our initial guidance of 16 to 17%. Net operating revenues were just over $1.7 billion, a 17% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the first fiscal quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving to the individual revenue line item, service revenue was $793 million, up 8% over the prior year period and reflective of solid year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending September 30. Data processing revenue reported on a current quarter basis was $554 million, up 13% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>International transaction revenues, also reported on a current quarter basis, were up 33% to $505 million as moderating cross-border volumes in the period were offset by competitive pricing modifications.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted operating margin, which tends to be highest in our fiscal first quarter, was approximately 58%, above our full year guidance, as Joe mentioned. In addition to seasonal impacts and better than anticipated expense savings, the increase in margin was due to lower volume and support incentives which are recognized in the current quarter. I'll provide additional color on our margin expectation in a moment.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the first quarter declined $29 million, or 4% year-over-yea driven by lower costs for personnel and professional fees, as well as flat marketing spend. As Joe mentioned earlier, our focus on cost is broad-based and aimed at delivering the expense savings committed to by management during our IPO road show.</p>
          <p>Please note that while we had originally guided to flat marketing spend in fiscal 2009 versus 2008, our current expectation is that the spending level will be somewhat below the level of 2008. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter, approximately $40 million of which was dedicated to the build-out of our new data center. The center will be fully operational by the fiscal fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in excellent shape with very little debt and cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments and restricted cash of $5.6 billion. Of this total, $2.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully fund the American Express and Discover settlements.</p>
          <p>Two significant cash outflows are notable for the quarter. First, in mid-October, we redeemed all of the Series 2 and a portion of the Series 3 Class C shares that were held by Visa Europe for a total of $2.7 billion resulting in a single class of C shares and the elimination of our pro forma approach to share count and earnings per share. All Class C shares are now translatable, one-to-one, into Class A equivalent shares.</p>
          <p>Second, at the end of December, we delivered on our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders when Visa funded the litigation escrow by $1.1 billion directly from our cash balances, instead of conducting an expensive follow-on underwriting. This had the same effect as a stock repurchase and reduced the amount of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes by 20.8 million shares. While there was little effect to the average share count in the first fiscal quarter, the full effect will be realized in the second quarter and beyond. As a result of these two transactions, as of December 31, 2008, Visa Inc. has 755 million Class A shares outstanding on an as converted basis, and began the fiscal second quarter with a fully diluted Class A share count of 756 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the coming quarter and fiscal 2009. While we expect to hit the middle of our 11 to 15% revenue guidance range in our fiscal second quarter, in part due to a non-recurring $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year, the back half of 2009 is now looking to be more challenging than we expected going into the year. This will have ramifications to our revenue projections in the third and fourth quarters, though we remain committed to delivering our full year earnings per share and operating margin guidance.</p>
          <p>Specifically, here in the U.S., payment volume growth has declined from 9% in the September quarter, to essentially flat in the December quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume ended the period at a negative 6%, while debit posted a 6% gain. More recently, through the end of January, aggregate U.S. payment volume growth is trending relatively flat. Credit growth is negative, in the mid single digits, relatively unchanged from the December quarter, and debit appears to have regained some momentum, rising from positive low single digits in the month of December, back to the mid single digit range in January.</p>
          <p>When you dig a little deeper into the underlying dynamics of these trends, what we're seeing is that the steep drop in gas prices over the past several months has noticeably dampened payments growth, despite notable growth rates in other categories of spend like recurring bill pay, quick service restaurants, and healthcare. All of these categories tend to favor debit over credit in this environment, which underlies some of the resilience of that product. Net-net, this leaves us cautiously optimistic that debit will continue to sustain respectable growth in this tougher economic environment.</p>
          <p>Outside the United States, for the quarter ending December 2008, constant dollar payment volume growth rates declined from the low 20s to the mid-teens. As mentioned earlier, cross border volumes were flat in the December ending quarter and in January have declined to negative mid single digits.</p>
          <p>Now, let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it may impact our current guidance. As Joe previously mentioned, on a full year basis, we are projecting total net revenue to come in below the lower end of our 11 to 15% guidance range in the high single-digits. While we still expect to achieve the middle of our 11 to 15% guidance range in the fiscal second quarter, the third and fourth quarters are now shaping up to be more challenging than we had signaled last quarter, with the probability of low single-digit growth. This second half outlook also encompasses a more pronounced foreign exchange impact, which on a year-over-year basis, is expected to reduce revenue growth by about 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Despite the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter, we are maintaining our long-term guidance of the mid-to high 40% range for adjusted operating margin through 2010. Though we should continue to realize incremental savings from our merger and cost initiatives, given the pressure on revenues in the back half of the year, the general uncertainty around the economy and our intention to continue investing for future growth, we are staying with our current range.</p>
          <p>More importantly, and to reiterate Joe's statement, we remain on track to deliver our guidance of annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20% for 2009. Looking beyond 2009, assuming some U.S. economic recovery by early 2010, as well as more favorable comparisons, particularly in cross-border activity, gas prices and foreign exchange rates, we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin guidance.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Byron. Let me conclude by saying that it's important to remember that Visa's business in the U.S., while vital to the company, is only one part of a large and growing global enterprise. And despite the current economic headwinds, our international growth opportunities, both in credit and debit, continue to offer us very attractive longer term prospects as economies expand and mature and payment systems evolve around the globe. When the economy of the U.S. does turn for the better, the actions we are taking now on expenses, on new product development in, both credit and debit and on international expansion will pay enormous dividends over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for listening. And with that, we are ready to take questions. Operator?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Craig Maurer of Calyon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Regarding the "competitive pricing changes" regarding around cross border, I was wondering if you could just characterize how that plays with the regulators over there, considering the environment, particularly in Europe.</p>
          <p>And my second question is can you characterize the level of your marketing spend that's tied to contractual obligations versus what's completely discretionary? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to begin with the pricing changes that we're talking about were made several quarters ago, and are being manifested in what we do, in what we do now. This isn't a recent action.</p>
          <p>In the second regard, the majority of our marketing spending is discretionary, not non-discretionary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, so, and that continues to be the case. I would say that the traction that we're getting on marketing spend is mostly related to the efficiency of what we're doing today as opposed to what we did a year ago when we were a new company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Which includes the recent consolidation of agencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the consolidation of agencies and, frankly, the lower cost of different types of media.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. Appreciate the commentary on the December volumes in the U.S., actually a bit better than we expected. But I was just curious, it looks like U.S. payment volume is tracking closer to retail sales than it has in the past. It sounded like it was flat. Still a premium, but not as big as the usual secular premium that we would see. So I guess I was trying to better understand, what do you think is driving that reduction in the premium? Is it really just lower average tickets and gas influencing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to a certain extent it's lower &#x2013; modestly lower average tickets which is related to the economy in general, so quick service restaurants and categories like that are increasing more rapidly than high end retail or travel or airlines, having said that fuel prices have a significant impact on our payment volume growth in the short run.</p>
          <p>I mean, if you go back through last October, gas prices steadily increased to well over $4 a gallon depending on what week you're looking at. They're around $1.70 a gallon right now. So there's a huge drop in the price of gas and gas accounts for about 10% of our total payment volume across both categories, so you have 10% of your volume where the cost of a gallon of gas is off by 40, 45%. That obviously will not be the case in 2010. Assuming everything stays the way it is, you can do the numbers, but it makes a difference in our growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's really helpful. Did you see any noticeable change in average ticket or I guess the number of swipes in the US in December? We got the volume data, but I was just curious if you saw a similar trend in transaction counts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we said we saw the number of transactions go up at a pretty strong, high single digit rate and I think it was 8%, I think we just said 8%. But the average ticket size in the aggregate is down by several dollars, by 5%, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then lastly just...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not all of that's fuel, but fuel is a considerable hunk of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah, because we've been trying to focus more on transaction count. So I'll end by asking just to confirm the data processing line is primarily transaction based, correct, not volume based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. 100% transaction based.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're very pleased with the number of transactions going through our system in this period of time and, frankly, you can't look at it and not think that we're doing what we set out to do, which is to compete with cash and checks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with UBS. Sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, and congratulations, guys. Wanted to ask a question just to start off with, we're getting more inquiries from investors trying to separate cyclical and secular trends here. Obviously the cyclical part of the growth equation is getting a little bit more challenging, which I don't think is surprising to anyone. But can you talk a little bit about the confidence level in the secular piece? There's obviously a lot of views out there that the days of easy credit are over, and if the consumer does go into a period of more sustained deleveraging with an increased personal savings rate, to what extent do you guys think about that potential dynamic as you shape the outlook over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to begin with, if you look at our combined debit and credit volume, 95% of the volume that goes through our system comes from people that use debit cards, which don't have a credit limit, or in those cases where it is a credit card from people that either pay their bill in full every month, or occasionally revolve and never revolve it more than 50% of their line. So part of the answer is that a lot of the volume that we have is not generated by people that are borrowing a lot of money.</p>
          <p>We've got to keep reminding ourselves and everybody else that the growth in receivables in the credit card business has a lot to do with balance transfers and the acquisition of new accounts. Balance transfers, those loans that are created as a result of balance transfers, never go through our system. Those are transactions that are handled outside of Visa's system, if you will. So while they may come under a Visa branded product, they are not Visa volume to us.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it's clear that things are more difficult than they used to be and it's clear that our volumes are down as a result of the economy in the U.S. and economies around the world, although as we said, our credit card volumes in some emerging countries remain quite strong.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, our transactions are up and they appear to be up because we appear to be taking share from cash and checks, in categories, in the quick service restaurants, in the bill paying categories which are often larger dollar amount transactions, in supermarkets and wholesale food chains, wholesale retail chains and so forth and so on.</p>
          <p>I think that the answer that encourages me the most is if things begin to turn around even modestly, we have structured ourselves to be poised to take advantage of it in a serious way.</p>

          <p>Pulling a Brett Favre here. I just couldn't stay away. But Byron, you were pretty clear that your expense reduction program would not interfere in your growth initiatives. But is it also logical to think that once top line growth recovers at some point, hopefully sooner, rather than later, you won't have to add back at least the bulk of these expenses? I guess another way to ask it is, what you're cutting now, does it have to be added back later once revenue growth reaccelerates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we made clear from the beginning that not all of the savings that we would realize as a result of the merger would be flowed through to the bottom line and that we stand ready to reinvest those &#x2013; a portion of those savings in new product and growth initiatives and that remains true. I think to help ground everyone, as Joe indicated, the margin for the first fiscal quarter is typically our highest throughout the fiscal year. So we would expect margins to moderate through the balance of the year, which is why we expect the &#x2013; which is why, frankly, we are holding our margin guidance to mid-to high 40s.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Hi, guys. My question is really just want to focus more on pricing. And I know that we've heard a lot of commentary, chatter out from talking to a lot of folks out there, that pricing increases are coming from Visa, MasterCard, prepare for that. And I guess what I'm really trying to understand more than anything else, even if there were some pricing increases, not necessarily the magnitude, but where exactly should we be thinking about how each one of those pieces would flow through the revenue items? I guess if you could kind of focus more on things like the card services line, the data processing fees and cross-border. How do we break out where or find the way or if you could provide a way to think about where those increases would really actually manifest themselves in the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the short run, I just suggested in my talk that we're going to be very careful about what we do, given the fragile state of the bottom line of our clients, particularly in the U.S. So while I'm not going to say we will do nothing, what we will do, will be in concert with our partners and it will be done in a thoughtful &#x2013; I think we've said a thoughtful, surgical way. And we're not going to back off of that. That's not where we believe our greatest opportunity lies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the way we've tried to be helpful is to elevate to an overall level of revenue guidance in combination with margin. I think we've said from the beginning, that in our first 12 to 18 months as a public company, as a merged entity, we had a lot of practices and a lot of opportunity to standardize and optimize our business across the globe. We are doing that and we'll basically have a non-normalized rate of growth through this year. But as we move beyond this year, again, as we've said before, the vast majority of our revenue growth should be attributed to taking share from cash and check, and growing our business with transactions and a higher penetration of TCE. We actually expect pricing to be a much more moderated impact over time on our revenue growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Byron, just following up on that, what portion of your revenue growth this year will be from the price increase? And then maybe just a quick follow-up. When will the cross-border pricing adjustments anniversary? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the second. The cross-border pricing adjustments you're referring to were initiated in Q3 of 2008 &#x2013; fiscal Q3 of 2008. So they will anniversary at the midway point of this fiscal year, which is a contributing factor to our guiding down revenue growth in the second half. With regards to how much revenue is tied to price adjustments, that's not something that we have spoken to publicly. And again, we've tried to be helpful by giving, in this case, relatively specific revenue guidance by quarter for all of 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. One of the things or one of the premises on which you're kind of basing the 2010 outlook is the thought that maybe we find a bottom here, at least in the U.S. economy in 2009 and at least in credit volume. Is there anything anecdotally or otherwise that you see out there that makes you feel comfortable with that kind of projection? Is it the disconnect between kind of the view of restriction of credit and the type of customer or the type of transaction that flows through the network? Or is there something else that makes you feel like that's something that we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me respond first by saying this is not a projection. What we have said is that if the economy in the U.S. begins &#x2013; has some degree of recovery in early fiscal year 2010, in combination with some recovery of cross-border. In addition to more favorable comparisons, specifically with gas prices and FX rate, then we will &#x2013; we are confident that we will resume our revenue guidance of 11 to 15% growth. So the way we're trying to be helpful here is if there &#x2013; under those circumstances, we feel very comfortable in projecting revenue growth back into our guidance range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just be a little bit more specific. I don't know when the economy and the world is going to recover. So when Byron suggests that there needs to be some recovery, that's what we're saying. If there is &#x2013; by around the first quarter of 2010, then I think we're in good shape.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the foreign exchange and the gas prices we're considerably more certain that that will happen, so it's really a mix of the two and remember, I don't need the economy to recover to a point where I have to get to the revenue guidance to continue to deliver the 20% earnings per share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, as a follow-up on contra revenue, it sounds like you're getting a little more constructive there, I guess, relative to your net revenue growth. Should we actually begin to see support and incentive payments fall as a percent of volume at some point in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way we've articulated that is as a percent of gross revenue, and so we have &#x2013; going into the year, we had guided volume and support as a percent of gross revenue at 16 to 17%. Because growth has been a bit less than anticipated, as a percentage of gross revenue that has fallen to in this case 13% for the quarter. And then we adjusted our guidance to 14 to 16% on a full year basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on that last question. The 14.5% or the 13% this quarter and the volume and support incentives. I assume that's based and your guidance for fiscal '09 is based on volumes staying relatively consistent where they were in the fourth quarter and January. If you've taken a leg down, does that line item have more potential to drop and could it conceivably be as low as 10% of revenues or is it not that sensitive to volume falls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start out by reminding you that the incentives are booked on a current quarter basis and the revenues on a lagged basis. So you're talking about service revenues up to October and you're talking about incentive expense on a real-time basis that occurred in the ensuing quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add to that that the way the incentives would respond would be with diminishing returns. So if revenues were &#x2013; if revenue growth was &#x2013; or payment volume growth continued to slow, there would be a diminishing, dampening effect by incentives over time. It's not linear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The flip side to that is once you begin annualizing that and you have recovery, you have the same phenomenon on the uptick that incentives will be &#x2013; will start to come back as growth in payment volumes begins to recover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then your guidance for and your commentary around cross-border, sounds like cross-border actually did get worse in the month of January and once we hit the second quarter if were running negative single digit like we were in January in terms of volumes, we're going to see that in terms of revenues as well, because pricing is going to anniversary. Is that in your guidance already, negative cross-border revenues by the second half of '09? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I guess just following up on that last question, maybe you could give a little more granularity on the slowdown, is it sort of broad based or could you touch on your major regions and specify if some regions are dragging down the overall volume numbers more than others? And then also a quick follow-up, I don't know if you give the processed transaction growth for January? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me respond. With regards to regional granularity, when the economic malaise began to set in, different regions entered that zone at different timeframes, but I think it's fair to say today, all our regions are &#x2013; it's broad based. All our regions are experiencing declines. All the regions contributed to the reduction in growth in cross-border.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true about cross-border but we have seen transaction and payment volume growth in some &#x2013; in several of our emerging countries and some of our regions outside the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have some countries that are exceptions.</p>
          <p>And then we, on transactions processed, we didn't give the January number. Our practice is to give it at the quarter, which we will do at the next earnings call and that will be for all three months.</p>

As it relates to the second question, what I said was that we are executing on what we said, we would execute on in the IPO, and that is to de-neutralize the company and to eliminate duplications, and wind-up focusing on implementing projects that made sense to the business, and eliminating those things that were extraneous or duplicative. That is exactly what we're doing.</p>
          <p>One of the fallouts of that of course is that we're reducing our headcounts in certain places as it relates to this duplication. But that's essentially what we're doing. We're putting together a company that is effective, efficient and focused, and we're doing what we should be doing and we're doing what we promised we would be doing, and it happens to coincide with a period of time where it's extremely appropriate and important that we get about the business of doing that, and getting it done and that's what we're committing we will do.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Joe, I guess I just wanted a little more clarity on that 2010 guidance. Is there a base level of revenue growth in that year that would lead you to believe that 20% EPS growth is still achievable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think &#x2013; we're pretty confident at this point, without knowing in absolute terms what's going to happen. That the things we know that will change off of the baseline that we expect in the third and the fourth quarter will get us to where we need to go. We think it could get us back up to the 11 to 15% range. We think it could fall short of that, and still deliver the 20% earnings per share. I mean, you could stress test it all the way, all the way down the hill. But we're reasonably confident that we're in pretty good shape knowing what we know now.</p>

As Joe mentioned earlier, what we do know is what gas prices have been, and what we will anniversary in terms of gas pricing. We also expect to favorably anniversary the change in FX. We then went on to say that in order to deliver or get back into our revenue guidance range, that we expect that we would depend on at least some recovery in cross-border and some recovery in the U.S. Joe went on to say that even if we underperform slightly, underperformed our revenue guidance somewhat, we could still hit 20% or better EPS growth. So that's how we've tried to frame it for you all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, so we could think maybe high single digits still achievable, maybe below little bit harder to.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>I think we've given you a pretty good frame. You should take it from there.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just on capital management, I was wondering where we were with that. I think you guys still have a fair amount of cash. Any intentions of instituting another share repurchase above and beyond the 1.1? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. So as I mentioned in earlier in the remarks, we did 1.1 billion of share repurchase in the month of December. And we have ample opportunity to go back to our board to seek additional authorization at a time and an amount that management feels appropriate.</p>

          <p>Stacy, we probably have time for one more question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And your next question comes from Bob Napoli of Piper Jaffray.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to make sure, the foreign exchange effect on revenue, I think can you give a little more &#x2013; I thought you said in the back half of the year it was only 3%. What is...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the back half of the year, we said that it was three full percentage points of impact on growth. That's on the company's entire growth rate. So &#x2013; and that's currently the ballpark that we're contemplating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the effect on revenue for &#x2013; I mean, on a run &#x2013; the change in currencies, the dramatic change we saw over the last 60, 90 days, the net effect of that is only 300 basis points on the growth rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the effect on profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the way that we hedge, we hedge the economic exposure, so revenue less expenses is an income exposure. We hedge the income. So that's, from an economic standpoint, that's hedged. When we gave the guidance for 20% or better EPS growth, that's on an as-reported basis, so the foreign exchange impacts are fully contemplated in that guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And fuel, I want to make sure I heard this right. You said fuel was before the decline in fuel prices was 10% of all spending on your card? That's higher than I had heard from other...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just last question, there was a major security breach I guess in the industry here in the U.S. and I think that there is the risks of security breaches in the industry are going up. I was wondering if you could comment on that and kind of the &#x2013; how concerned you are about that and what economic effects you think the security breach that is out there could have on various players in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we're aware of it and obviously we are involved in the correction of it and obviously we're concerned that it happened. We believe that we have made a considerable amount of progress through PCI for lack of a better term, to mitigate the possibility that these things happen. There have been some that have occurred, but not &#x2013; but frankly, not many.</p>
          <p>Now, having said that, to us, one of the most important things is that from in that regard, we have promised consumers that they will never be financially liable for anything like this occurring to them. That is totally intact and consumers can feel comfortable using Visa cards and comfortable in the notion that no security breach will ever financially affect them and I think that is the most important thing.</p>
          <p>We've got to work on making sure that nobody in the process gets hurt, but our promise is to the consumer and the confidence is directed at the consumer and I'm happy to say that that continues to be 100% effective.</p>
