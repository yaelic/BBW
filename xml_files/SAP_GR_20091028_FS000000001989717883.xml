        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or good afternoon. This is Stefan Gruber. Thank you for joining us to discuss SAP's third quarter 2009 results. I'm joined by L&#xE9;o Apotheker, Werner Brandt and Bill McDermott. Werner will discuss the Q3 financials in detail. L&#xE9;o will comment on the current business environment, our strategy and product successes, and Bill will provide some color on our regional and industry performance, and our go to market strategy. Following the prepared remarks, we have time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>As usual, I will make a few remarks about forward-looking statements. Any statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
          <p>Words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, project, predict, should, outlook, and will, and similar expressions as they relate to SAP are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. SAP undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.</p>
          <p>The factors that could affect SAP's future financial results are discussed more fully in SAP's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, including SAP's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2008 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2009. Participants of this call are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their date.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Werner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stefan. Welcome to everybody on the call. Before I begin, let me inform you that I will be speaking mostly about non-GAAP figures, as they are more in line to how we internally look at our operational performance. Also, these non-GAAP measures are the basis of our guidance. The difference between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the third quarter of 2009 is the result of the exclusion of acquisition-related charges in the amount of &#x20AC;67 million. More detail on our non-GAAP measures, the reasons for their use, and reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release.</p>
          <p>Also, let me remind you that all numbers that we have presented today are preliminary. Our final numbers will be presented in due course in our interim report. Subsequent events that may occur until then are to be reflected in our Q3 2009 financials as far as they provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at September 30, 2009.</p>
          <p>Please note that the incurred restructuring expenses of 160 million in the first quarter, 5 million in the second quarter, and 21 million in the third quarter of 2009 resulting from the previously announced reduction in positions. Our non-GAAP measures are not adjusted for these restructuring expenses. Therefore, both U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by these charges.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, let me say that we are pleased to report another quarter of increasing operating margin despite a challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>Let me give you the highlights of the third quarter. Non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were &#x20AC;1.94 billion, which represented a year-over-year decrease of 5% at constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues stayed relatively flat. The year-over-year decrease in the third quarter was the result of a decline of 30% in software revenues at constant currencies, an increase of 10% in non-GAAP support revenues at constant currencies and an increase of 22% in subscription other software-related service revenues, also at constant currencies.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2009, our recurring revenue stream accounted for 56% of our total revenue and 55% for the nine month period.</p>
          <p>Let me take a moment to explain the development in support revenues. The slight sequential decline in support revenue was mainly caused by a strengthening euro, especially against the U.S. dollar and the transition of customers to the subscription model. These two effects negatively impacted support revenue by approximately 20 million. In addition, there was a positive one-off effect of roughly &#x20AC;10 million that increased Q2 support revenue.</p>
          <p>Third quarter professional service and other service revenue were &#x20AC;564 million, which was a decrease of 25% at constant currencies. Consulting revenues of 484 million decreased 22% and training revenues decreased 23%. The decrease in consulting and training revenues was not unexpected, given the decline in software revenues over the past few quarters. Consulting revenues usually lag software revenues by around six to nine months.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased to &#x20AC;1.83 billion or 12% at constant currencies, which represents a decrease of 243 million adjusted for currency. This number includes restructuring charges of 21 million related to our previously announced reduction of positions, which for the nine months totaled &#x20AC;186 million.</p>
          <p>The number of positions reduced associated with the 186 million charge was approximately 2,900. Roughly 2,600 of these employees have already left the company as of September 30. The rest will leave in the following months according to the labor laws in the respective countries. For the full year 2009, we continue to expect a total of around 200 million of restructuring charges related to the reduction of positions.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months, total non-GAAP operating expenses declined by &#x20AC;593 million or &#x20AC;779 million, excluding restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses decreased 4% to 380 million for the third quarter and represented 15.2% of total revenues, which is an increase of 1.1 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. The cost saving measures could not fully offset the decline in total revenues, which resulted in a higher R&amp;D ratio for the third quarter. For the nine month period, R&amp;D as a percentage of total revenues remained flat year-over-year. Despite this percentage of reduction in R&amp;D as part of our overall program to manage our cost structure, our ability to innovate has not been affected, as L&#xE9;o will later talk more about the power of innovation, power to innovate.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses decreased 19% to 497 million for the third quarter and represented 19.8% of total revenues, a decrease of two percentage points compared to last year's third quarter. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was mainly a result of lower personnel expenses due to head count reduction and tight cost control in all areas.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses decreased 40% to 134 million for the third quarter and represented 5.3% of total revenues compared to 5.5% of total revenues for the third quarter of last year. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of effective cost saving measures, mostly in the area of non-customer related third-party expenses, travel expenses and personnel expenses due to the head count reduction.</p>
          <p>Overall, the company's non-GAAP margin, operating margin at constant currencies were 27.2% for the third quarter, which represents an increase of 1.1% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Also keep in mind that the third quarter 2009 non-operating margin was negatively impacted by around 80 basis points due to restructuring charges associated with the reduction in positions.</p>
          <p>And for the nine month period, the non-GAAP operating margin was 34.2% at constant currencies, representing an increase of 70 basis points. Restructuring charges had a negative effect of 250 basis points for the nine month period.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you the details on the gross margin. The non-GAAP software and software-related service margin was 81.1% for the third quarter of 2009, which was a decrease of 2.6 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. The lower margin was the result of the decline in software and software-related service revenues by 5%, mitigated by lower head count and expense savings.</p>
          <p>The professional service margin was 32.7% for the third quarter of 2009, which was an increase of 60 basis points compared to the same quarter of last year. This increase was mainly driven by a higher consulting margin. Because of the slight business mix, the third quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased by 80 basis points to 67.9% or 60 basis points to 66.9 for the nine month period.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating expenses were down by 48 million year-over year, which was mainly a result of currency losses. The currency losses are mainly driven by one-time foreign exchange losses related to our operations in Venezuela. The U.S. GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2009 was 21% compared to 31.9% for the third quarter of last year, affected by non-recurring acquisition-related items, which positively impacted the Q3 2009 tax rate by approximately 11.7 percentage points.</p>
          <p>In the nine month period 2009, our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 26.7%. Because of this one-time effect on the Q3 tax rate, we lowered our expected tax rate for the full year of 2009 to be between 27 and 28%, which previously was 29.5 to 30.5%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2009 was 2.2 billion, which was an increase of 28% compared to the same period of last year. Operating cash flow for the 2009 nine month period was 2.4 billion, which was an increase of 21% year-over-year, although underlying income from continuing operations increased only by 1%.</p>
          <p>The increase in operating cash flow is due to a positive change in working capital, mainly driven by a decrease in accounts receivables. Conversely, our DSOs went up by one day compared to the end of second quarter and seven days since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, total group liquidity was &#x20AC;3 billion, including the net proceeds from the issuance of a private placement of a promissory note. Bank liabilities were 2.1 billion, which includes 1.4 billion from the financing of a syndicated loan related to the acquisition of BusinessObjects and around 700 million from the private placement mentioned before. Therefore, net liquidity at the end of the third quarter was &#x20AC;920 million.</p>
          <p>Let me give now an update on head count. As you know, in January, we announced the reduction of positions to 48,500 FTEs by the end of this year. At the end of the third quarter, head count stood at 47,804 FTEs, which is a decrease of 3,732 FTEs compared to the end of last year. We now expect head count to be around 48,000 FTEs by the end of 2009, which is slightly lower than our original projection.</p>
          <p>Let me finish by saying that we have updated our outlook for 2009. Please refer to the press release issued today for the company's outlook.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass it over to L&#xE9;o.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Werner. Welcome, everyone, to today's call. I'm pleased to provide you with an update on the business environment and our product successes. I mentioned last quarter that we were carefully and cautiously optimistic that the worst might be behind us, with hope for some improvement in 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe this to be true, as we reported a better year-over-year performance in the third quarter compared to the year-over-year performance in the second quarter. However, while the environment has stabilized, we are still up against some difficult challenges created by the global economic recession that hindered our results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>This was felt especially hard in Japan and in some of the emerging markets, which Bill will talk about later. One challenge that we face is a very emotional market, where quick changes and sentiments, good or bad, can move the market in either direction rather quickly.</p>
          <p>Other challenges include customers remaining hesitant about making investments and the unpredictability we continue to see when it comes time to sign contracts, as customers are still closely scrutinizing deals. Hence the approval process is slow. As we head into Q4, I don't expect this to really change.</p>
          <p>As we witnessed throughout most of the year, customers are continuing to buy SAP software, but the customer wants to consume the software quickly and in increments over multiple periods. This advances smaller deal sizes with lower average selling prices and more phased deals. Plus, for large upfront deals, we don't expect to see deals come back any time soon.</p>
          <p>Some encouraging signs we are seeing in the market. The pipeline continues to build and we see healthy pipelines in all the regions and in all the industries. Customers are beginning to speak more positively about their own businesses, which we think bodes well for the future as we head into 2010 and we continue to see good progress in our move towards a higher volume level. Finally, we are driving more multi-year agreements with phased subscription deals. This model is good for both SAP and our customers.</p>
          <p>You should remember that the model of revenue recognition over many periods is not new to us. We perfected this model with our Global Enterprise Agreement, and what we have gained from the GEAs is the experience on how customers want to buy and consume software based on building a long-term strategic roadmap over several years. We are now taking this concept with some adjustments to take into account differentiated market needs down to the next 580 largest customers. We expect this to open up tremendous opportunities for growth going forward.</p>
          <p>We believe this model of buying and consuming software over multiple periods that we are driving is an important trend in our industry, and we have already proven that we have the tools, the knowledge, and the experience to capitalize on these changing industry dynamics. Bill will talk about that later.</p>
          <p>Helping us to add more volume in all segments and all markets, and establishing these multi-year relationships with our customers, our products are all best for now initiatives, which offer solutions that are quick to implement and provide fast ROI. Business Suites have -- with its highly modular design, as there are our customers that report the software at their own base in a step-by-step process and business user solutions like analytics, and risk and compliance solutions have enabled our customers to see their businesses more clearly.</p>
          <p>As Werner already took you through our reported numbers for the third quarter, let me just briefly add some comments. Despite the economic crisis in the third quarter of 2008, we nevertheless reported 22% growth in non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues at constant currencies in that quarter, making this year's third quarter a tough comparison. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the environment remains challenging. But as I mentioned earlier, the sequential performance on a year-over-year basis from Q2 to Q3 improved as we expected.</p>
          <p>On the expense side of the P&amp;L, we continued to successfully manage our cost structure as demonstrated by a 1.1 percentage point improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin at constant currencies. Excluding restructuring charges, this is now the fourth quarter in a row since the economic crisis that we have reported year-over-year margin growth. As you know, last quarter we discussed the tough 2009 second half margin comparisons we expected, due to the strict cost-cutting initiatives put in place immediately subsequent to the Lehman's bankruptcy announced in the quarter. We expect the comparisons to remain difficult for Q4, but we will continue to effectively manage our operating costs.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Bill to provide a brief update on the regions, industry and our go to market strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, L&#xE9;o. In this challenging market environment, we continue to adapt our go to market strategy to the dynamic needs of our customer, while also focusing on solid quarterly execution. We're innovating our go to market strategy in line with how our customers consume value. We are developing longer-term sustainable relationships with our customers, aligning business strategy, IT roadmap and value delivery.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at the regional performance. The regions performed better sequentially, but mixed in the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets, which I'll talk about more in a moment. All the following information I'll share with you is in constant currency.</p>
          <p>In EMEA, non-GAAP software and software-related services revenues declined 1%. Germany was down 13%, mostly due to a tough comparison from Q3 last year, when software and software-related services revenues grew by 20%.</p>
          <p>Excluding Germany, software and software-related services revenue in the EMEA region actually grew by 6%, which resulted from strong performances in Southeast Europe, the Mid-East and Iberia, while revenues were somewhat sluggish in the CIS countries. Across Europe, it is worthwhile to note that we are seeing increased interest of customers to engage in multi-year strategic partnerships with SAP.</p>
          <p>In the Americas region, non-GAAP software and software-related services were down 7%; in the U.S., down 9%. The U.S. was impacted by longer decision cycles for small and mid-size deals, which resulted in slightly lower closure rates. The good news is that there is increased predictability with large enterprise customers and more net new customers, and the improved execution with these customers is reflected in the quarterly sequential software licenses growth for the Americas.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific Japan region, non-GAAP software and software-related services revenues were down 12%. Despite good performances in Korea and Australia and increasing volume, the overall performance in APJ was negatively impacted by Japan's 25% decline in software and software-related services. We, and many other technology companies, have been challenged by a perfect storm in Japan, a change in government resulting in investment policy reviews across the public and private sector, rising yen, falling exports and low consumer and enterprise confidence. These market developments froze customers spending during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The good news is that these deals were not cancelled, simply deferred as reflected in our pipeline and the sentiment in our dialog with customers. The BRIC countries, with the exception of Brazil, were more volatile in the third quarter. To address this market opportunity in the emerging markets, we hired a seasoned executive to lead our fast-growth market initiative and scale the important markets over time.</p>
          <p>Key contract wins in the EMEA region were Telefonica, Dons Supermarket, SeverStal and Affinity Petcare. In the Americas, we signed Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Continental Resources, Bob's Discount Furniture and Banco Industrial. And in APJ, key wins were Japan Post Holdings, Queensland Motorways and PetroChina Planning and Engineering.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our industry performance. We saw good results this past quarter in asset-intensive industries like oil and gas, as well as in public sector and financial services. In fact, financial services, as a whole, has been the best performing industry year-to-date. One reason is that in this environment, financial services companies are eager to lower cost and improved productivity. The other reason is that they can run a more efficient and profitable business with the depth and breadth of functionality offered by SAP solutions.</p>
          <p>In one example, the fastest growing bank in Colombia, Banco de Credito, with 39 offices throughout the country and international operations in Venezuela, Panama and the U.S., went live with SAP at the start of 2009 and reached its goal of having a single platform with SAP in the quarter. In another example, Banese, one of the top retail banks in Brazil, has deactivated 15 legacy systems, some created as long as 20 years ago, after implementing SAP, improved its efficiency and reduced its operating risk. The bank expects to achieve a strong return from its SAP project by substantially improving operating profit. We are moving the needle.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, let me comment on Q4 and our go to market strategy. We're further segmenting and specializing our sales force to focus on specific market segments; Premier Customer Network, which I've talked about in the past, large enterprise, mid and small customers alike. We're tailoring our value proposition to longer-term relationships at the top and volume at the mid and low end, while leveraging a multi-channel approach between partners inside sales and direct sales across all segments.</p>
          <p>We do this in 25 industries across the world to ensure that our customer can leverage the full breadth of SAP products in our portfolio, and do so in an industry context that they care about.</p>
          <p>We know that the product, industry thought leadership and the business content of our people is our competitive advantage. We therefore continue to create a learning culture, where we train our people on our solutions and the end-to-end value delivery of those solutions so that customers choose SAP as their trusted advisor for business performance.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we're laser focused on Q4. We have a very tight execution plan aligned across all segments of SAP, all functions and all regions. And I'd like to point out that we're leveraging our own analytical tools from BusinessObjects to not only manage and track our largest opportunities, but our entire pipeline and volume of deals. This level of clarity is changing the way we manage our business in real time. Our team is fully mobilized and committed to execution.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it back over to L&#xE9;o.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Let me provide a brief product update on a few key product areas. First, we are seeing a strong start with our new SAP BusinessObjects Explorer solution, which is an easy to use but powerful business intelligence tool that brings together search and navigation capabilities with the speed of in-memory database technology.</p>
          <p>We already have very satisfied and actually enthusiastic live customers on the product. The pipeline is strong and we continue to receive positive feedback on its ease of use, its robust search and data analysis capabilities, and its high performance and scalability.</p>
          <p>Second, our strategy around SME continues to grow well, despite the tough environment as we remain the clear market leader in SME with a wide and growing market share lead. We owe our strong competitive performance in SME to our clearly defined market segment strategy to capture what we believe to be excellent growth opportunities with three distinctive products in a highly fragmented tech market. Those products are SAP Business One for the lower end of the SME segment, SAP Business ByDesign, the middle tier of the SME segment, and SAP All-in-One for the upper end of the SME segment.</p>
          <p>For SAP Business ByDesign, we remain on track with our orders. We continued to transfer customers during the past quarter, while starting their projects under current version feature pack 2.0, which was released for productive use according to plan in July. With feature pack 2.0, customers have access to certified end-to-end process scenarios and other enhancements of feature pack 2.0 include better decision-making capabilities with integration to the SAP BusinessObjects portfolio, including Crystal Reports software and Dashboard from Excelsior software.</p>
          <p>Our development team is already working on the next version of Business ByDesign, which will be focusing on multi-currency, flexibility and extensibility. We will provide you with more details early next year.</p>
          <p>And third, we are pleased at the progress we are making in extending our OnDemand portfolio for large enterprises. As I mentioned last quarter, our OnDemand portfolio includes SAP Business ByDesign for the mid markets; SAP BusinessObjects OnDemand solutions for both the mid market and large enterprise; and SAP Customer Relationship Management, SAP E-Sourcing and SAP Cap and Trade for large enterprises. You will hear more about our OnDemand solutions for large enterprises also in 2010.</p>
          <p>Over the past few weeks, there have been many rumors circulating in the market regarding our support relationship with Siemens. And as you probably read, we have put those rumors to rest as we expanded our strategic relationship with Siemens through Siemens' selection of SAP SRM for its E-Procurement operations and we renewed our service relationship with Siemens for global maintenance support for all SAP solutions, including support for some of Siemens in-house developed solutions that connect to SAP solutions. I think this demonstrates the value of our support offerings and the strong relationships we have with so many of our customers who rely on our software and support service.</p>
          <p>Let me finish off by saying that we remain a growth company and we're in an excellent position to achieve strong profitable growth when the economy rebounds. We have a robust flexible business model that can provide us both top and bottom line growth. Importantly, despite the challenging times, we have continued to focus on innovation and as a result, our new product pipeline is very encouraging, which is critical to driving our business forward.</p>
          <p>We are in a strong competitive position, twice the size of number two, allowing us to maintain our market leadership in large and small enterprises, and in all regions of the world. There are great opportunities in new emerging markets, and we have the broadest and deepest product portfolio and industry solution set in enterprise applications. All of this combined, I feel encouraged about our mid-term prospects.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to thank you for listening, and we will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much. L&#xE9;o, I was wondering, could you talk about the guidance around the fourth quarter implicit in the guidance for the year. Maybe you can talk around the closed rate assumptions you're assuming for both the high end and low end of that, whether you think there's any up tick in closed rates versus Q3, the same or whether it's getting worse, and maybe where the maintenance will be, maybe flattish sequentially, because of the shift in the business model towards subscription? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Werner and I will answer the question together. I'll try to take the first part and Werner will give you some facts into the second part. We are in a bit of an interesting situation, Michael. What's happening is, is that on the one hand, we see some encouraging signs. Pipeline is increasing. Actually, it's been increasing for quite some time. We see that the trend in volumes is going in the right direction as well. So from that perspective, one could say things are looking better.</p>
          <p>Now on the other hand, we also know that the slightest change in mood has an impact on closure rates. So we are trying to give everyone a very, very conservative view on how we believe the quarter will play out. This is a very peculiar year and we should not apply normal metrics to a very peculiar year, which is one of the reasons why we have decided to give you the view, the hypothesis and all the guidance on what we believe could happen in Q4. Werner, maybe if you would, on maintenance for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you looked at the support for the fourth quarter, we assume that we might see a very slight increase in support revenue quarter-over-quarter. And I think it's clear. With this -- I want to reiterate this. With this assumption on SFS revenue in the range between six and 8%, it's clear that we will see a decrease in software revenue. Michael, you wrote this in your comment already. I only wanted to reiterate that this is a matter of fact for the fourth quarter, however, this doesn't tell us anything about the future of SAP as a growth company, as L&#xE9;o stated before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I could just ask one more, you've obviously talked about phased deals increasing. Maybe you could put some context on in Q3, what value of deals you signed or what the licenses would have looked like if they'd been signed on the traditional upfront model? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing we can say, Michael, is that, of course, the number of larger transactions decreased dramatically. We had some larger transactions. I think we mentioned Telef&#xF3;nica, for example, as one of the largest transactions in the quarter. But even if you have large transactions from a pure revenue recognition perspective, you cannot assume that the entire revenue can be realized in the quarter we signed the transaction. That's one of the implications.</p>
          <p>And the other is that we see a strong increase in order entry for subscriptions, but that's something we cannot and do not bring down to details on a deal by deal basis, but more importantly, it led to increased order entry through subscriptions and this is healthy for our business model going forward.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just one more question, back to pipelines. L&#xE9;o, you mentioned that you were starting to see an improvement in pipelines over the past multiple months. And I guess this is a question for both Bill and L&#xE9;o is that, when you think about just sort of pipelines improving, what is the lead time when you actually think about those converting into license revenue? And to a degree, how should we think about that as we turn to 2010?</p>
          <p>And then also with your sort of implied Q4 guidance here, how should we think about just those big deals? You've been pretty cautious on those closing. Have we, to a large degree, kind of flushed those out of guidance for Q4? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Phil, this is L&#xE9;o. Let me try to reemphasize what Werner has been trying to say to Michael a few moments ago. What is happening or what we are actually trying to do is to move a little bit away from the big deal, one-time shop, up-front revenue kind of a situation, and actually try to drive our business model towards a more balanced situation, where we have some of those -- there will always be some of those -- but also where we will start to transform some of these larger transactions into multi-year agreements, be they subscription or be they faith .</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, the transformation of the pipeline is actually happening maybe a little bit slower than in normal years, because we are living in a peculiar year. But what you will not see is the usual peaks and valleys in the curve that are basically impacted by this or the other large transaction happening or not happening at a given date. What they're trying to do is to drive to a more sustainable and more long-term driven or medium-term driven business model, where we actually take some of these transactions and actually try to enter into multi-year agreements with our customers.</p>
          <p>The good news about that is that it is a very sustainable, very healthy business model, which is welcomed by our customers and actually is welcomed by SAP as well, because as we are driving our business model towards this, it will give us actually better business at intrinsically better margins over the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>By the way, that's one of the reasons why we are trying to also transform our cost inflation so that we can actually boost with the adjustment, without having a hit on the margin. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Werner, can you just go back on the third point you mentioned on the support and maintenance revenue in the quarter? You said something about a 10 million deferred, I didn't catch that. If you could just recap on that, that would be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very easy, Ross. We had a one-time effect in Q2 of this year, which amounted to roughly 10 million, and if you compare sequentially support revenue growth, you have to eliminate this one-time effect in Q2, which actually was the catch up of the previous quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, great. That's what I thought. And then can you just recap on the sales allowance that you have at this juncture, at this point in the year, for maintenance revenues that have not renewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we normally do is we set up sales allowances at the beginning of the year, in order to neutralize the risk we see on the maintenance invoices we send out to our customers. Risk is higher than last year. We talked about this already two times during the course of this year. And I think the level stabilizes now, and we see what we have to do on top in 2010. But there are not any extraordinary movements we see and saw in the third quarter, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, maybe just one for L&#xE9;o. As you think about Q4, it sounds like there's a fairly wide &#x2013; a wide sort of scenario here, maybe a couple of hundred million on license sales. I think you also said earlier, in response to a question, you're trying to take a very conservative stance.</p>
          <p>I guess the question is if we saw more of a kind of flush and more large deal activity, do you think that your high end of your range encapsulates all that, the high end of the range that you've kind of laid out for 4Q? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would suggest that we do not speculate on this. And, as I said earlier on, Q4 is going to be, of course, our largest quarter. It's going to be a significant quarter. We're talking about a lot of money that needs to be sold. Bill and his people are busily doing that as we speak.</p>
          <p>We are trying to provide a hypothesis in those guidance to underpin our margin guidance. And we are sticking to our margin guidance. We reconfirmed that again, and that's really the guidance we provide. The rest is basically a hypothesis.</p>
          <p>A lot of things can happen in this quarter. A lot of things are depending on the mood, on the environment. But also, as I said earlier on, we do really want to drive a bit of a change in the way we go after these very large transactions.</p>
          <p>What is also very important, we haven't really talked about it yet, is the growth that we see in volumes coming in the lower end of our business. There, actually, we saw positive trends evolving in Q3 as well.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we have tried to give a management judgment on this and hence the hypothesis that we gave you, and I would suggest we leave it at that, and we'll see what the quarter is.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Stephanie Withers on for Sarah. You've emphasized that SAP remains a growth company and that this is a peculiar year. What can we expect -- what types of levels of organic growth can we expect longer term as we return to a more normalized environment? And what would be kind of the key products or new delivery methods that you'd highlight in achieving that type of organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stephanie, thank you for asking the question. It goes without saying that we'll provide the 2010 guidance in January, not now. I'm not going to try to be pinned down on this or the other number.</p>
          <p>But let me maybe pick up the second part of your question, which I think is a very relevant one. We will be driving a lot of innovation into the market as we speak, starting with Business ByDesign, where we're getting more optimistic as we move along and we start to see some really great things happening there.</p>
          <p>Two, what we are doing on the analytics side, ranging all the way through sustainability, where we have announced a complete sustainability solution set, and things that we are doing on the technology side, which is in-memory, things that we are working on on in-memory, and looking at opportunities to bring OLTP and OLAP together, which in turn will drive a whole new wave of innovation again, when it comes to transaction applications and actually the merge of analytics and transactional applications.</p>
          <p>All of these solutions will be made available in a network type of an environment, i.e., we will be providing the vast majority of our solutions in a hybrid fashion. Be it in the cloud, or be it on premise or <mark type="inaudible" />. I think that will put SAP in a very unique situation. We will continue to innovate on our product set. We will have partners or we have partners who are innovating on top of our technology, and looking out into the future, I happen to believe that SAP not only is today the strongest solution set, but actually is going to strengthen that position significantly in a variety of industries.</p>
          <p>Let me maybe give you one example when we talk about industries. We happen to be -- I don't think that we're known to it, so that's why I'm mentioning it -- we happen to be the leader in platforms for smart meters. There will be a billion smart meters in the world in five years time. There is a high likelihood that many of these smart meters will be running off an SAP platform. By the way, that's in the cloud.</p>
          <p>So, as you can see, lots of exciting things are happening, which motivate us to be rather optimistic for mid-term future. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as you think about the SAP portfolio and achieving those goals, are there particular holes that you might like to fill through M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The wider your portfolio, the more interesting opportunities you create. You could look at vertical opportunities. There may be some horizontal opportunities. There could be some geographical opportunities. There could some channel opportunities.</p>
          <p>And it's not that we are not doing anything on M&amp;A either. Last quarter, for example, we made an interesting transaction with a company called Highdeal, which actually gets us into an even stronger position when it comes to advanced bidding for utilities, among others. And then we did a deal with a company called SAS, which is a leading company when it comes to algorithms, in particular, and optimization in the retail space. And not only are we already the market leader in retail, but with this acquisition, we actually make another leap forward.</p>
          <p>So, we are not sitting still on that side either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Now, let's take the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll take our next question from Gerardus Vos from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. First of all, on the kind of cost base, from a sequential perspective, OpEx came down by around 25 million. I noticed that there was a sequential increase in R&amp;D and G&amp;A, while in both areas, the head count actually came down. I was wondering if you could clarify what was happening there.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on enterprise support, what kind of milestones, and when do you need to hit the kind of milestones to justify the increase going into 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me take the first question regarding the operating expenses. I think the 28 million is a reduction of operating expenses from Q2 to Q3. Actually, from my point of view, it's 28 million. But please keep in mind that this includes and is diluted by stock-based compensation expenses of 40 million and restructuring expenses of 21 million. So if you exclude this, we have a sequential reduction of 67 million, and this represents 3.5%. And I think this goes in the right direction.</p>
          <p>So if you dig a bit deeper, you come to an answer to your question without raising the concern you raised with this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding enterprise support, as you know, we have actually institutionalized something rather unique in the software industry. We are going to make public a series of PPIs that we want to hit, in order to justify the next increase in enterprise support. These PPIs are due for publication in the next weeks. And then that will trigger, as the case might be, the next price increase for enterprise support.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. Just a couple of questions, if I may. In terms of the cost -- I'll take the point on the stock-based comp -- it does seem that you're talking about the costs, the comps getting much harder from here, but you do have your mid-term 35% target. I was wondering, are you still pretty comfortable with that in terms of a mid-term or three year target, let's say? And what can we see? Is that mostly going to come from growth, rather than cost-cutting from here?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you changed the management in the BRICs. Is it fair to say was there an execution slip in some of the faster growing countries, and that's why you've changed the management team or is it something different?</p>
          <p>And lastly, in terms of the cash piles building quite nicely, should we still expect buybacks if you don't do M&amp;As, if you get to, say, 1.5 billion of net cash? Is that a reasonable thing to think, Werner? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I answer the first and the third part of the question, what was -- in terms of target, you mentioned target. What do you refer to? I -- we didn't get this on the line. It was not clear enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past, when you've got the 1.5 billion plus of net cash you've tended to buy back stock --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the first part of the question, which target did you refer to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the medium term margin at the rate of 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your mid-term -- you've talked about trying to get to a 35% operating margin in the mid-term, but here I guess it looks like the cost work that you've done might be starting to be completed. Is it going to be just rote that gets us to this number or is there more that you can do on cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. First of all, it's always a combination of financial discipline regarding our spending and, of course, growth. I think we shouldn't assume that we reached 35% only by cutting cost with no growth on the top line. I think if a company is in such a situation, it can close the door sooner or later.</p>
          <p>The second part I can answer is regarding the cash position and our strong cash flow. What we have done so far is -- you have seen we had 922 million in net liquidity. The first thing we did after the quarter-end closing is that we paid back the loan for business objects of 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>And your question regarding the share buyback, as it stands today, it's too early to talk about the share buyback. We will re-evaluate this beginning of next year and come up with a clear position in our January earnings call, when we also talk about the guidance for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost point, Werner, your R&amp;D is up at what, above 15% of sales. Is it fair to say that there's still plenty of room though to take some efficiencies or do more with less in R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is not limited to R&amp;D, it's R&amp;D -- to get more out of R&amp;D what we have today. And if growth comes back, we also see a decrease in the ratio on top of it. And secondly, I would not leave out of the equation here G&amp;A, where we also intend to bring this down to the range of 4% plus, but significantly below 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Bill McDermott. Just to touch on the question regarding BRIC countries.</p>
          <p>First, I just want to remind everybody that we have added about 10,000 new customers this year -- 4,000 in Q3 -- and many of them do come from the BRIC countries. As an example, APJ has been the growth engine of our business now for a few years and continues to do very, very well.</p>
          <p>With the exception of Brazil, which is continuing to be strong, I said the BRIC countries were a bit more volatile in Q3. That should not be interpreted as a trend by any means. So we are still focused on robust growth in those wonderful markets.</p>
          <p>I do want to make a couple of points on what we did, because there wasn't an execution issue when I mentioned we hired a new executive to focus on the BRIC and emerging markets. Instead, what we wanted to do is take the best business practices that we have built over many years now in our large markets and build those best practices into our fast growth markets that scale. We also wanted to establish a strategic planning discipline, so there is a three and five year horizon to the way we think about these markets, in addition to the quarterly execution, which our regional Presidents and MDs do on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>So this is about plussing up those markets.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Werner, just going back to one of your points that you made earlier, obviously, we can see ourselves out of the crisis here and at some point we -- as the markets feel better as your pipeline is growing, we need to think about investing into the future again. How do you see the investment playing out for you guys? Maybe starting out on the sales line, how do you think about adding salespeople to kind of capture more of the volume?</p>
          <p>And at what time do you think you -- at what point do you think you will be more comfortable on kind of adding more investment around the R&amp;D line, and maybe selective strategic investments further on, in terms of getting Business ByDesign into the volume part? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, Raimo, I want to reiterate what we've said several times now. We want to ensure that this financial discipline holds and that the savings we have generated so far are sustainable. If I go through the different areas, Bill can talk to and add to sales and marketing. We will definitely first go for a shift and lift exercise in all of the regions in order to be sure that we can expect more out of what we have available today in terms of people. And then think about if growth comes, and as the growth comes, that we then reinvest the part of it into the business, meaning that we add additional people, but before we go through this lift and shift exercise.</p>
          <p>If you go to R&amp;D, first of all, we have to see that we have the right organizational set up for R&amp;D, which enables us to really get more out of R&amp;D, and if this is done then we can think about, along with accelerated growth, about adding people. But that's not something for 2010. That's beyond 2010 because clearly, the growth for 2010 from an industry perspective is somehow limited for the next year. And the same would be true for G&amp;A. Bill, anything to add from your end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you said it very well, Werner. First of all, the board is a very co-operative and team oriented board, and the idea of lifting and shifting assets from one area of the company to the other is working very well. And what customers want is they want real product knowledge. They want industry domain expertise and they want SAP to help them deliver the value so they can gain the business outcome. The more smart people we can get closer to the customer at SAP, the better. And that would be not only in our core business, but also in BusinessObjects.</p>
          <p>We also see an opportunity to galvanize inside sales and do even more there to increase the overall productivity of the sales force. So I think Werner said it very well, and the company is committed to this kind of cooperation around the customer relationship.</p>
