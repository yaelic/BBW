          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Baidu's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misale and I will be your coordinator for today.

          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call. We've distributed Baidu's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 earnings earlier today. You may find a copy of the press release on the company website, as well as on newswire services.</p>
          <p>Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will be joined by Peng Ye, our Chief Operating Officer, and Haoyu Shen, Vice President of Business Operations to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we continue, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required under applicable law. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. 2008 was a year of strong growth for us with total revenues up over 80% from 2007. That said the fourth quarter was a very special quarter for us. In particular China's economy experienced a sudden slowdown and many businesses including our customers became more cautious in their marketing spending.</p>
          <p>Also during Q4 we removed questionable paid search listings from several sectors. Despite these factors we still delivered a 58% revenue increase from Q4 of 2007. This result underscores our strong ability to execute, and coming out of this quarter the quality of our customer base is now higher and our operational controls are now tighter.</p>
          <p>Going into Q1, we expect many of our customers will continue to be affected by weak macro conditions and the typical seasonality around Chinese New Year. However, we have already observed some positive trends during Q1 which I would like to share with you.</p>
          <p>First, our advertising campaigns have generated positive feedbacks from our users, customers and employees. During the Chinese New Year period we launched an advertising campaign that included prominent placement on the CCTV New Year's Eve gala. Over 90% of Chinese households viewed this program.</p>
          <p>Second, I am pleased to note that in the weeks following Chinese New Year, we have seen significant traffic growth in the customer spending.</p>
          <p>Moving on, I would like to discuss our main focuses for 2009. First, on the customer front, one of our primary efforts in the near term is to educate the market. We will let more people know that the best way to get revenue during a difficult time is to market their product and services on Baidu.</p>
          <p>Our addressable customer market is huge. Of the approximately 40 million SMEs in China, currently about 200,000 are Baidu customers. And we are confident that with our increased sales, efficiency, and marketing efforts we will successfully educate an increasing number of Chinese businesses about the advantages of our performance-based platform.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our sales models, a combination of direct sales and local distributors is unique in its ability to reach out to SMEs nationwide. Under the significant efforts we are undergoing in this area, is a new underlying marketing system codenamed Phoenix Nest, which has been in beta phase since Q4 of last year. The objectives of Phoenix Nest are to improve relevancy in paid search and increased value for customers, thus driving monetization efficiency.</p>
          <p>Phoenix Nest achieves this objective through an enhanced algorithm that serves more relevant marketing messages. It also provides customers additional tools and information to help them better manage their spending to achieve higher ROI. We have been receiving positive feedback from customers so far, and we plan to make Phoenix Nest broadly available in the second quarter of 2009. With the roll out of Phoenix Nest, we expect Baidu's monetization capabilities to rise to a new level.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the user side, a key new innovation that was announced in December is Aladdin. Aladdin is an ongoing R&amp;D effort aimed at uncovering useful parts of the hidden web in order to enrich search results for our users. The core of Baidu's search experience is offering constant improvement to the abundance, time limits and relevance of search results. Aladdin will do just that; improved user experience gradually, but surely.</p>
          <p>Another ongoing user focused project that many of you are familiar with is our C2C platform, Baidu Youa. We launched Youa in the fourth quarter of 2008. We believe in the synergies between search and e-commerce, and our enormous user base gives us a unique advantage in this space.</p>
          <p>Baidu Youa has been met with lot of excitement. As of the end of 2008, a short two months after its beta launch, we have almost 140,000 sellers and over 15 million commodities listed on Baidu Youa. We will continue to grow Youa in the quarter to come and will keep you updated on the progress.</p>
          <p>To brief the update you on all &#x2013; Baidu Japan which we officially launched in January 2008, the focus in 2009 continues to be on product development and also in 2009 we anticipate starting to drive overall traffic. We'll keep you updated on our progress too.</p>
          <p>Before concluding, I would like say that we have the right strategies in place to tackle the current economic challenges. And at the same time, we are well positioned to capture the benefit of our markets' long term potential. According to CAN, the Internet population in China reached 298 million in 2008. This means internet penetration grow from 16% to 22.6 in one year. But this level is still far below that of mature markets.</p>
          <p>And with Baidu's status as the market leader, we have 73.2% of market share according our research. Our long-term prospects remain tremendous. Combining all of this with our great business model, experienced management team and strategies to generate growth and profitability, Baidu is uniquely positioned for success.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the call over to Jennifer for financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Robin. Hello everyone. Good morning and good evening. First of all, we apologize for the brief delay getting into the call; we had a very unusual snowfall in the city and many of the drivers are relearning how to drive on the streets, so couple of the key participants were delayed.</p>
          <p>Getting back to the content for the call; as you know the economic slowdown in China combined with the removal of certain paid search listings caused us to revise top line expectations for the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have exceeded the revised guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at some of the financial highlights for the quarter. The amounts mentioned below are in RMB except otherwise noted. Total revenue for the quarter was 902 million, an increase of 58% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For Q4, Baidu had more than 197,000 active online marketing customers, representing a 1.5% increase from the previous quarter and 27.1% increase from the corresponding period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenue for online marketing customer for the fourth quarter decreased just slightly from the third quarter primarily as a result of the removal of some of the paid search links. For the full year 2008, the number of active customers increased 32.7% and revenue per online marketing customer increased 38.3% from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost, as a component of cost of revenue was 14.6% of revenue versus 11.8% for Q3 and 12.7% a year ago. Included in the Q4 TAC number was a one-time adjustment which accounted for 0.7% of revenue. Without this adjustment, TAC for the fourth quarter would have been 13.9% of total revenues. 2008 TAC as a percent of revenue was 13.1% versus 11.7% in 2007 reflecting growing Baidu Union contributions to revenues.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth cost and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue both decreased in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago level, primarily due to increased equipment efficiency and scalability of our network. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 32.6% over Q4 '07 and up 60.5% on an annual basis, mainly due to increased compensation cost and greater marketing expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses increased 84% over Q4 '07 mainly due to additional head count. Total R&amp;D expenses for 2008 was 286 million, a 103% increase from 2007, reflecting continued investment in our R&amp;D capabilities.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items, increased in aggregate to 21.5 million in the fourth quarter from 13.3 million in the corresponding period in '07. The increase in share-based compensation expenses primarily reflects increased options and share grants.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased to 73% over Q4 '07. For the year, operating profit reached 1.1 billion, double the level of 2007. Total head count as of December 31, 2008, was about 6,400, roughly 400 fewer than at the end of Q3. The net change in head count includes increases in R&amp;D workforce and decreases in sales and marketing due to efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>Income tax expenses was 41.8 million. The effective tax rate increased from 9.1% in the third quarter to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of '08, primarily due to tax rate catch-up for our software enterprise subsidiary based on new local tax interpretation.</p>
          <p>For the other subsidiaries, we have been informed that under the new tax law these entities qualify as new high-tech enterprises. As such, they will continue to enjoy the preferred corporate income tax treatment. The effective tax rate for the full year 2008 was 10%. For 2009, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2008, the company had cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment of 2.7 billion. Net operating cash flow and capital expenditure for the fourth quarter of 2008 were 482 million and 61 million respectively. Full year net operating cash flow and capital expenditure were 1.6 billion and 418 million respectively. The company's strong cash flow generating ability will allow us to stay on track with our strategies during a weak economic environment.</p>
          <p>Now, an update on Baidu's share repurchase program. On December 16, Baidu's shareholders approved a US$200 million share buyback program. Subsequently, Baidu entered into repurchase agreements before the blackout period started. As of now, the company has bought back over 30,000 shares. We'll continue to execute the repurchase program based on market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2009, we'll continue to take a disciplined and a strategic approach to cost. While we focus on growing the top line and making responsible cost decisions, we'll continue to invest in our core R&amp;D capability and strategically important initiatives. Looking into Q1, we typically have higher marketing expenses during this quarter, related to annual events such as the boiling point party, which promotes our products and services related to entertainment search.</p>
          <p>This year in particular, we incurred additional marketing spend during the Chinese New Year. Our incremental marketing budget for the first quarter of 2009 is approximately RMB40 million more than that of Q4.</p>
          <p>As an update, our Internet TV channel outsourcing agreement with UiTV, which was signed in the third quarter of 2008, entails a total income of US$15 million. This income will be gradually recognized, as it should be, as other income. We will inform you when the deal is officially closed and when we have more clarity on the timing for the income.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we expect to invest approximately 25 to 30 million in Baidu Japan. As compared to the US$90 million spend in 2008, the incremental expense will mainly be incurred in R&amp;D where we plan to devote more resources to product and technology development.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will make additional 30 to US$40 million investment into the construction of Baidu campus. The total spend is in line with our previous budget.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you our top line guidance for the first quarter 2009. The current economic downturn has proven to be widespread in its impact, affecting all industries to varying degrees. We believe with our focused sales efforts and our cost effective and flexible marketing platform both established online marketers and new SME customers will increasingly seek out the measurable ROI that our platform offers.</p>
          <p>We expect moderate year-over-year growth for the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to two factors. One, a portion of our online marketing customers may scale back on marketing spending, given today's market environment. Two, we expect that the removal of certain sponsored links during the fourth quarter of '08 has resulted in the net loss of around 5% of revenue which impacts Q1.</p>
          <p>We currently expect total revenues for the first quarter of '09 to be between 780 and RMB800 million, which would represent annual growth rate of 36 to 39%. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Derrick.  The full rollout of Phoenix Nest. Could you guys tell us the difference between the current trial versions and the full versions of Phoenix Nest? And my second question is related to the increase in affiliate network revenues as a proportion of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Was it more driven by an increase in partnerships or just directing more advertising links to your partners? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Eddie. Haoyu Shen. So the Phoenix Nest is a new auction system, that's different from what we are using today. We're testing &#x2013; starting from Q4 we're testing but the work started actually early part of 2008; now we're just testing it.</p>
          <p>Hi. I'm sorry, I was on mute. So Eddie, this is Haoyu. The question is about Phoenix Nest. Phoenix Nest is a new auction system we're testing. The work &#x2013; we started working on this early part of 2008. We're testing &#x2013; we started testing it in beta version starting from Q4. Now we have over 600 customers participating in it and it's invitation-based only.</p>
          <p>So the difference right now between &#x2013; there is a lot of differences between the Phoenix Nest and the current system in terms of the different data &#x2013; the more data that customers can get, the more tools we give them to manage their budget. And also the setup is different. Now the other difference right now is it's only testing on right hand side. But the goal is to eventually make this &#x2013; first of all, to make this more broadly available to other customers, which we're planning to do within Q2 and also in Q2 potential, we'll open up some space on the left hand side, the top left hand side space to Phoenix Nest as well.</p>
          <p>As far as the revenue contribution in Q4 from Phoenix Nest, it's still very small because it's invitation -based and it's &#x2013; we only have a few hundred customers participating in it. And it's very important to note that system over time will get better, once we accumulate more data and more experience from the customers, it will definitely get better, monetization efficiencies increase.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Haoyu. Just one quick follow up. So this new system will be run in parallel to the current paid listing mechanism right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If -- for a while, we don't know how long it's going to be at and for a while, it will be run in parallel.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question in terms of the impact from the macro economy, I think last quarter management mentioned that manufacturing and franchise are the two verticals impacted. Heading into 1Q, have you seen other verticals that are negatively impacted such as education and training and maybe the dot-com companies, the internet companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Peng Ye. I think the only very small percentage of the customers have been. It's true that many of our customers are cautious and have scaled back their spendings. But we have already seen after Chinese New Year that very strong pickup after Chinese New Year holiday season. And also both in terms of customer spendings on their monthly budget and also the new customer acquisition, that's the kind of situation. We do not have the visibility on their marketing budget beyond this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Ming this is Haoyu. Your question about education, my sense &#x2013; our sense is it's impacted, but it appears to be more resilient than any of the other sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on TAC, how should we look at the TAC going into 2009, particularly I believe there is more significant initiatives such as the content network itself that's going into the Baidu Union space. I don't know if that will significantly drive up the TAC cost or it will still be going up gradually. And also, I wonder, have you seen any impact from some of the smaller sites being shutdown due to the government's tighter control began earlier this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dick, it's Haoyu. So TAC as Jennifer mentioned that in Q4, we had some one-time adjustment, so that made the TAC in Q4 high. But so, excluding that we think TAC is in a very comfortable range. So if you look at the whole year of 2008, it ranges from 11% to 13%. And it really largely reflects the faster growth of Union contribution to Baidu overall. If you look at our TAC rate as a percentage of Union revenue, it is very stable. So we're not &#x2013; over time, we're not paying a higher percentage of our Union revenue to our Union partners.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I expect &#x2013; it is possible that Union revenue will continue to grow faster, but I don't think it will grow dramatically faster than our organic revenue. Organic revenue is also growing at a pretty healthy rate.</p>
          <p>And you mentioned the content networks, so if you look at our Union business, there are basically two parts. One is search network where we &#x2013; third party partners bring search traffic to us and we share revenue with them. The other is content network, contextual links. So contextual links in terms of revenue is still a small &#x2013; a minority in the total Union revenue contribution, and we're putting a lot of effort into that &#x2013; in the past. We'll continue &#x2013; we'll probably even increase our focus this year in that part of the business. That business does tend to have a higher TAC ratio than the search business, but as I said, it's a smaller percentage of our Union revenue. And that's something we're putting a lot of focus on, and I think that's one of the biggest growth areas going forward for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the tighter control on content by the government, we have not seen any meaningful impact to our business yet.</p>

You mentioned that, I didn't hear it clearly, the Baidu TV, that is being recognized and why it need to be amortized instead of just equity recognition of income?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the deal, Eric, was signed in Q3 of '08. It's not completely closed the deal yet. So we do in the structure of the transaction have $15 million that should be categorized as other income. And it depends on the terms of the payment. We believe it should be amortized over time rather than a one time. So it all depends on the final closure of the deal and the intent for me to inform everybody is, we will provide more clarity on the timing and we'll provide the information on the transaction and when that's going to happen.</p>

          <p>Sure. Can you just add-on, is this &#x2013; going forward, is this going to be equity investment &#x2013; equity or an investment? Basically your ratio is more than 20% or less than 20%?</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Can I ask why you feel the need for diversification, either geographic in the case of Japan or into new business areas like e-commerce in China. Does that imply that there is not sufficient growth in the Chinese search business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We strongly believe that there is a tremendous opportunity for growth in the Chinese search area for many, many years down the road. But our ambitions go beyond Chinese search; that's why we are making the investment in areas like search in Japan and related areas like e-commerce related search services. We really feel this kind of initiatives have good &#x2013; great synergies with our existing business.</p>
          <p>The Japanese search share very fundamental core technology with our Chinese search and our e-commerce, the C2C initiative share a very good customer or user base with our existing Chinese search services. As a high growth and innovative company we will continue to innovate and try different things. These are two of the larger initiatives. We also have many other, smaller projects going on, and I think that's the right strategy for the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you guys give more color about the customer feedback on the Phoenix Nest system? Can you give us a sense what your customer like about the system. Any specific thing that they want you to improve that you're going back to the lab and trying to make it better. And do they view that as a core system or do they sort of view that as a complementary system. And also Robin maybe you can talk about this. Can you talk about the click-through rate of the new system versus the old system, maybe compare to CPC a little bit. And lastly, maybe talk about some of the verticals that are most receptive to the new system so far. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I let Haoyu handle this add into your standing</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So James, as I said, Phoenix Nest is now invitation based. It's on right hand side only. A few hundred customers are participating. So far they like it. We see good participation. They like it for few reasons. One, we give them more choices of keywords, because it's on the right hand side and we offer broad match, straight match and not just exact match because we only do exact match in our old system. And also we give them more tools to manage their budget. In the backend we also give them more data and more reporting so that they can measure their ROI more clearly than before.</p>
          <p>So right now there, because we have these two systems running in parallel some of them probably view this as complimentary. But we also made it very clear &#x2013; we will make it very clear to our customers when we make it broadly available that this is the future. We will make it success and this will be a better system for them. This will be a better monetization system for us. So eventually I think Phoenix Nest will just be Baidu's new auction system.</p>
          <p>And for some of the statistics you mentioned, CPC and CTR. CTR because it's still on a small scale so it's very hard to tell whether the difference with the current system is material, especially because now it's only on the right hand side so a lot of statistics may not indicate what's going to happen when we open up more space meaning the left hand side for Phoenix Nest going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Haoyu, can I ask you a follow up question? In theory right, when you have the new auction system or bidding system on the right and in theory the click-through rate should be lower than what you typically facing experience in the past on the left side, is it kind of fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, it's necessary to say for anyone, I think the click-through rate on the right hand side is lower than the left hand side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you able to balance it maybe with a higher CPC assuming people click on the right side, they have a greater intention of going to your customer site, doing a transaction. So in theory you can offset that with a higher CPC pricing in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That is conceivable. But at the end of the day, we don't set price; it's an auction system.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, let me add a little more about the Phoenix Nest system. A key part of the Phoenix Nest system technology is the relevance ranking technology. It's very much like a miniature search engine. We need to find the best match between user queries and the marketing messages submitted by our online marketing customers. We are working on this part too. So to start with the relevancy could be similar to the existing system &#x2013; paid search system. But going forward the relevancy will improve and we expect the click-through rate will go up too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a quick question for you on &#x2013; when you had mentioned the right side and left side. Can you give a sense of what percentage of your revenue is actually coming from the right side versus left side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow-up is, also I saw that your customer deposits increased significantly in the fourth quarter to RMB422 million from 357 million in the third quarter? Why do you think that this happened and do you expect this trend to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Typically that would be a good indication leading into your revenue projections, but for Q4 I think this is a special period that we went through. We all know that customers tend to scale back their marketing expenditures in difficult times. So more customers tend to set limits. So we have deposits with us. They went up during the Q4 period. I wouldn't directly interpret this as increase in revenue, but this is kind of a customer-driven kind of activity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call and my question is related to the Phoenix Nest. Am I correct that you are only going to implement it on the right hand in the top part of your website. You are not going to incorporate in your left hand side among the free search result. Does that mean that you want to gradually migrate your sponsor link to better separate them from the free search results?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I mentioned earlier, now it's tested on the right hand side only, but in Q2 when we open up for more customers, we will potentially also open up the top left space for Phoenix Nest. So, that's what we are going to do. And as &#x2013; also as I mentioned, as we think this will be a better monetization platform, better auction system potentially, it will be very broadly used Baidu's systems.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. How much was branded advertising in the fourth quarter and where do you think your conversion rates for the C2C platform stands, versus to some of your competitors. So in other words, you have the traffic already; do you feel like you offer a more efficient platform versus your competitors at this point? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>So as far as conversion rate, we don't have a lot of visibility into our customers' conversion rate because we &#x2013; it's a CPC model, it's not a CPA model, but I think our fast growth in terms of ARPU and also in terms of new customers shows that they are probably getting very good return on their spending with us.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is about linearity of demand in the first quarter. I think there was a previous question on the level of deposits being up significantly, and some of the commentary on the call suggests that post Chinese New Year, that we've seen demand pick up. We also have commentary that the economy is really bad. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail, are people putting the deposits in and are just simply not allocating these or are they bidding less per click and could you may be give us a little more color about how much of a change you've seen from maybe before Chinese New Year in the quarter to the period after Chinese New Year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason. The trends that we have seen at year end, I have elaborated on why we think that the customer deposit went up. I think after Chinese New Year, we continued to see the customer making deposits and as a faster rate but this &#x2013; I would interpret the data very differently.</p>
          <p>Prior to Chinese New Year, I think there is a lot of negative sentiments or cautious sentiments and people are cautious with their spending. Right after the Chinese New Year, the kind of trend that we have seen as Robin mentioned is very positive and up-beating, and we have seen the traffic went up and we have seen the customers really coming back to the platform and more actively engaged in marketing on our platform. So the trend that we have seen over the past month or two or so, I think lessened out a little bit of the cautious sentiment that we observed at the year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you, Jennifer. And then maybe a follow-up to that. I know historically Baidu has done very little offline marketing. You've relied upon your strong brand and word-of-mouth. In light of this, its seems like tremendous success that you've received or you've obtained from the CCTV Chinese New Year initiative, does that change in any way your thoughts as to how you will try to grow traffic in Japan? And should we be expecting that because you're actually getting something from those efforts that you might lead more with a formal advertising campaign offline and online in Japan versus just simply relying on word-of-mouth and viral marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Robin. Let me try to answer your question. The advertising campaign during Chinese New Year carried offline was indeed something new to the company. We did that in order to find out how effective this kind of advertise campaign would be in terms of educating the market, helping users better realize the benefit of search and helping customers have better understanding or better sense of what Baidu can do for them.</p>
          <p>But after all, we believe that the traffic growth for the search services really depends on a high quality user experience or search service for Baidu Japan. We are not at that stage yet. We are focused, we'll continue to be, on product and technology. For our Chinese business, this is something new. We are still in the process of evaluating how effective the campaign is. And how should we do things like this in the future. So that's the current view of this kind of initiatives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin and Jennifer. Haoyu. And I have two question. And the first and regarding the clean-up measure of your medical listings, and is the clean-up measure largely over. And if so, what percentage of your medical listing customer have resumed the service with Baidu. And have they already gotten proper license yet? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. Yes, we have gone through a thorough review of our customer base. And as you know, in November, we removed all of the medical and pharmaceutical sector customers. Only with proper licenses and documentations will we allow our customers to come back. As we mentioned in the press release, a large portion of the customers has already come back. And frankly, Baidu has went beyond and taken additional steps to remove additional questionable links.</p>
          <p>So net-net, that's why we have a negative revenue impact going into Q1. But at this point we are at a stage that we have gone through the thorough review of our customer base. We'll continue to monitor the customer base on an ongoing basis. However, I don't expect that any additional action we take will result in this kind of a material revenue impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And second question is regarding your margin trend, and obviously, 4Q, we saw soft margins with a margin concession about six percentage points quarter-on-quarter. And is your company taking any cost saving measure in the full 2009, especially given the macro headwind that's clearly looming? And are you planning to scaling back your cost initiatives for your non-core service such as P2P, internet imaging, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Richard. As I mentioned in my script, our priority is to grow the top line and at the same time maintain a disciplined and strategic approach to cost. There is a tremendous stability in this business model, as I said many times before. And our margin is very sensitive to the top line. In the Q4 and possibly in the Q1 you know that we have near term revenue set backs, but that does not change the business model, it does not result in the structural change of the way we conduct our business.</p>
          <p>So despite these setbacks and maybe a short term margin compression, the long-term story holds and the fundamentals remain strong. So we will not forgo important strategic investment opportunities for the sake of short term margin management. As we all have always mentioned, there is tremendous scalability in the business model. And as China's Internet industry is still emerging, it would be unwise to forgo investment opportunities that's right. And frankly, the whole organization takes a very disciplined approach to cost and we are very responsible as we make the cost decisions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure I understand the dynamics impacting the top line here. It looks like Q4 was obviously an anomaly and it's kind of hard to draw any kind of trend from that. But looking at your guidance right now, it looks like you're looking for high &#x2013; kind of high 30s for revenue growth and if you hadn't had removed those links you'd probably be somewhere in the low 40s percent type of growth. That's a pretty big drop off from what you were seeing in the Q3 level. Would you say that the difference in growth is all economically driven or are there other factors hitting your business now, that would make up for such a drop. And then are the things like Phoenix Nest and other initiatives you might have in the works enough to accelerate the growth as you go forward or is it really those are incremental and the economy is the big headwind and you'll do kind of whatever the economy allows you to do?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Steve, this is Robin. Let me try to answer your question. We already gave reasons for the Q1 guidance, the removing of certain sponsored links represented like 5% of our revenue and the rest is pretty much seasonality and impact of macro conditions. If you look at the sequential growth it's like 11 to 13%. If you back out 5% then the rest is pretty much seasonality and the macro condition. If you look at our Q1 of '08 it was pretty much flat compared to Q4 of 2007.</p>
          <p>So Q1 is usually the weakest quarter of the year and this year it is especially slow because of the macro conditions. And another reason we speculate is that during the past quarter or past few months when the Chinese economy experienced a sudden slowdown, everyone was shocked. So they did not do anything for the near-term. After the Chinese New Year, I think, people realized that they still need to do business, and the best way to promote their product and services is to go through Baidu. So, we do expect with our execution capability, or depending on our execution capability there are lots of room for growth in the future.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. Can I ask one follow-up question? On the 15 million in other income you're going to recognize, is that &#x2013; I wanted to just make sure I understand. That's going to be recognized over the course of 2009? Will there be continuation of that into 2010 as well?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>It depends on the starting point when we started to recognize that. We will recognize the amount over about a year period.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions, one is regarding your Phoenix system. And I just wonder, after you officially launch it, are you going to just launch it in the right hands, or you are going to also implement that in the left hand. So where that's going to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think I've said this a few times. Now it's on the right hand side; in Q2, we'll make it broadly available and potentially open it for the left hand side as well, the left top space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that will only exist in the top place on the left hand. Is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we are going to do in Q2. So, I also in an answer to another question, we believe if the system becomes successful, it will eventually be the only auction system we'd have. So it will probably eventually take over the main panel links as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, eventually as what you said will take the current system. So does it mean eventually on the left hand, you only have a top several positions are the Phoenix auction-based advertisement and then the rest will be natural search results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That could be one scenario, but as it evolves, we will adjust our strategy accordingly. And it will definitely be a cautious and measured approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't have a precise answer at this point, that's the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So other question is after the CCTV report in November, in December and I just wonder what kind of permanent measurements has management put together to prevent those problems from happening again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Peng here. In response to the CCTV reports, we take actions to remove not only the medical and the pharma related questionable links, but also other sectors as well. Now, we have &#x2013; after that we enhance our internal control process, and tightened the internal control management. So that to ensure all those customers will have appropriate documents researched, even though at this stage, there is not any regulations require us to do so. In the mean time, we also provide the training process to our employees to ensure service quality as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you put this monitoring or training system, whatever to other sectors beyond healthcare?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of them. I was wondering, the 5% reduction in revenues in the first quarter, does that include some of the listings that were removed in 4Q or are these all new listings are removed in 1Q? And is that revenue likely to come back or is that revenue that is more or less expected to be lost on an ongoing basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. These are the links that's related to the removal activity that we did in Q4 before year-end and you can consider this as a permanent loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also maybe if you could give some more color on labor cost? What kind of salary increases are we likely to see this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't mapped out the budget for this year and typically in the past, we monitor the CPI situations and implement our merit increases accordingly. What I want to stress though is Baidu values its talent pool of people and this is an exciting place for many people to start their career. And we value our people and we make our compensation packages competitive in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent and just wondering I think you mentioned that in 1Q the marketing budget would be RMB40 million more than in Q4, I was just wondering, how does this trend for future quarters? I guess you had a lot success with your advertising campaign in the first quarter. Will we see similar investments in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Robin mentioned earlier we are not completely done with this advertising campaign yet. Once it's over, we'll carefully evaluate the benefit, the effect of it and what we have learned from it. The important matter is we do put funding and marketing initiative as a priority for us, so we will continue to conduct activities in this regard. However, I just want to give you some sense, the Chinese New Year Eve Gala is once in a year event. The impact for a event like this is only once, only one time in the whole year's program that you can reach out to 90% of the Chinese households. So it's unlikely to produce another event like this for the remainder of the year. So I don't anticipate massive spend like the Q1 will reoccur. However, we do want to do more work in the marketing and branding initiatives on those fronts and therefore we want to spend. We will allocate resources accordingly, but maybe not to this magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you mentioned the campaign was not finished, when do you expect to wrap it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just two quick housekeeping questions. I was wondering what the CapEx related to campus construction was in this &#x2013; in 4Q? And also I think you mentioned earlier the Japan cost in 2009, I missed that number, if you could give that again please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Japan expense budgeted for '09 is between 25 to 30 million and for Baidu campus &#x2013; Baidu campus actually capital expenditure from Q4 amounted to a larger proportion of the CapEx for the quarter. For the whole year, Baidu campus accounted for about 40% of the CapEx incurred in 2008. And we have, as I mentioned, 30 to 40 million that we will spend US dollars on Baidu campus going into '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my follow up. I noticed that there are some more -- some paid search in display format. In Baidu some of the page search results are highlighted in a gray box. I'm not sure if that is some display related with the Phoenix Nest or it is just stimulated to the core search system. If you can comment on kind of the longer-term thoughts in terms of the paid results display format that would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yes. We do have those &#x2013; one thing is Brand-Link that we launched last year. Right. It's got some display on the right hand side, and a little bit display on the left hand side as well. And we are testing &#x2013; I think we were also testing display only link on the right hand side for brand advertisers. So it is in a testing mode and it's for brand advertisers, their customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe let me clarify my question. I guess I have been seeing some paid search results that are highlighted in like a gray box. It is &#x2013; I don't think it is related to the brands or is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you see shaded links at the top, on the left, those &#x2013; we had those paid links for quite a long time, and those are not directly managed by the customers. So, that's a space we will potentially open up in Q2 for Phoenix Nest.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Paul Keung with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. The question has to do with the advertisers. I was wondering if you can tell me, when you look at sort of what it looks like in fourth quarter, first quarter, did you see any unusual weakness or strength in terms of in which categories was advertising coming from. Any change in the churn rate of customers and how many of those customers really are new first time trials versus old returning customers on average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So in terms of sectors we did look at Q4 coming into the New Year -- in Chinese New Year, what we saw is the sectors such as machinery, electrical engineering, tools, chemicals, these were impacted more both in terms of ARPU and also in terms of number of active customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have churn rates been impacted &#x2013; and I'm trying to understand how many of these customers are actually first time, because there was a pretty sizeable increase in the number of advertisers in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So before Chinese New Year, the customer acquisition is slow and it's always slow before Chinese New Year, and we are seeing good pick up after the Chinese New Year, both in terms of existing customer spending and also the speed of customer acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because we had heard that &#x2013; so what are churn rates in your mind, then? Historically the churn rates you've told us is like the low teens, has that changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we ever disclosed the churn rate, because it's very hard to define. So in some sectors, in some regions, we did see higher attrition in Q4 and coming into Q1. But it's &#x2013; in terms of our total customer portfolio, we didn't see massive increase attrition of customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
