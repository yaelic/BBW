        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm very pleased to be here with you this morning with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and Isabelle Kocher for the presentation of our 2012 results.</p>
          <p>Our company is primarily made of <mark type="ph" /> six teams (00:00:28) men and women. They make the Group and its results. Today, of course, our thoughts go out to our colleague <mark type="ph" /> Tongi (00:00:41) and his family kidnapped in Cameroon. He's in charge of our development project in liquefaction in this country. On behalf of all the teams of GDF SUEZ, 220,000 employees, we would like to express our deepest feelings of solidarity to <mark type="ph" /> Tongi Muelafornia (00:01:06) and his family.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to start with a few key messages on our 2012 results. 2012 has been a milestone in GDF SUEZ's history. We have deeply transformed the Group and we have accelerated this transformation with a clear focus on energy and priority to fast-growing markets. With the most streamlined organization, we combined flexibility and global reach to sales growth in selected markets. This is clearly reflected in our industrial developments in 2012.</p>
          <p>We have also faced rising challenges in mature markets, especially in the European energy market which is undergoing lasting and deep changes. Our gas-fired generation assets have been hit by poor market conditions, fiscal and regulatory pressure has increased, and downstream competition has become more severe.</p>
          <p>But there were also very positive developments in this market, notably on gas tariffs in France and on the successful renegotiations with our long-term gas suppliers. In this contrasted context, we demonstrated our ability to adapt ourselves and to react. This is what we have done by implementing our ambitious action plan, Perform 2015, and this is what our 2012 results demonstrate. Beyond 2012, we confirm all our financial targets.</p>
          <p>But let's start with our 2012 results. All our financial targets of the guidance are met. Despite significant headwinds, our net recurring income posted a double digit growth and stands at &#x20AC;3.8 billion, in line with our guidance of &#x20AC;3.7 billion to &#x20AC;4.2 billion. In 2012, our upgraded action plan, Perform 2015, provided its first contribution with positive net impact of &#x20AC;100 million at the bottom line and another &#x20AC;100 million in CapEx and working capital optimization.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx reached &#x20AC;10 billion, at the lower end of the &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion range we indicated for 2012. This amount does not take into account, of course, the transforming transaction to achieve in 2012 with the full acquisition of International Power. Our financial strength remained a top priority in 2012. After closing the SPP transaction in Slovakia end of January, we're back to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times and our A category rating have been confirmed by both S&amp;P and Moody's.</p>
          <p>In addition, when taking into account the equity consolidation of SUEZ Environnement, pro forma net debt now stands close to &#x20AC;35 billion, meaning that we have made good progress to meet our &#x20AC;30 billion target by end 2014. Our asset optimization program contributed to this positive evolution and delivered as expected with more than &#x20AC;5 billion for the transactions announced since early 2012. And Isabelle will come back on that with more details.</p>
          <p>The sharp decrease in net debt with a &#x20AC;2 billion decrease compared to September 2012 has also been achieved, thanks to a strong cash flow generation with &#x20AC;8.8 billion of free cash flow in 2012, after maintenance CapEx. Maintaining our attractive dividend policy is a long-standing key objective of the Group and sustained by our cash flow generation. This policy has been clearly and strongly reaffirmed by the board yesterday, and it has been decided to propose to the AGM next April a dividend of &#x20AC;1.5 per share for 2012, in line with our stated policy. The final dividend to be paid in April will be 100% in cash.</p>
          <p>Now, a few words on our sustainability policy, two years ago we set objectives covering the major non financial risk of GDF SUEZ sustainability. They are part of our day-to-day business as shown by the systematic use of sustainable development criteria in the investment decision process of every major energy project. We are well on track to achieve our 2015 targets. Our portfolio of renewable energy is growing steadily, with a strong development of hydropower in Brazil and Panama, biomass in Belgium and in Poland, wind capacity in selected markets like France, Romania, Poland, Germany and Belgium.</p>
          <p>There is also a steady improvement on the health and safety results. The frequency rate stands at 7.6 in 2012. It has been more than half since 2004 when it stood at 18.1 with improvements in all business lines. We're in line to achieve the 2015 target of less than 6. Our commitments had been recognized and GDF SUEZ is among the leaders in this sector for corporate social responsibility according to Vigeo.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to mention the two labels awarded to GDF SUEZ in 2012, respectively by the French government for our biodiversity action plan and by the AFNOR for our action to prevent discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and diversity. In 2012, we have accelerated our development in fast-growing markets with the full acquisition of International Power closed in June 2012. This innovative two-step acquisition has turned GDF SUEZ into the benchmark energy player in fast-growing markets.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the strategic platform, we're entering new markets like Kuwait with our project of 1,500 megawatts gas-fired combined cycle power plant and an associated water desalination plant and more recently, for example in Morocco with our 300 megawatt Tarfaya wind farm project which is the largest in Africa. In both cases, we have been able to secure long-term PPAs over 40 years in Kuwait and 20 years in Morocco, providing strong visibility and returns.</p>
          <p>40% of our installed capacity is already located in fast-growing markets, where there is an immense need for LNG and we are accelerating the shift. 90% of the 6,000 megawatt new generation capacity commissioned last year in 2012 is located in fast-growing markets and 80% of the 10,000 megawatts currently under construction by GDF SUEZ are also located in fast-growing markets. At the same time, we have pursued our expansion in LNG, especially in Asia and signed new sales agreement with KOGAS in Korea, GAIL in India, and PTT in Thailand for a total of 2.6 million tons or 39 cargos.</p>
          <p>The second priority was to react to the energy crisis in Europe and to optimize our European activities. The creation of the Energy Europe business line, which consolidates all our Continental Europe activities in electricity and gas and integrates power generation, portfolio management and sales, allowed to extract more synergies. All in all, the EBITDA of Energy Europe increased by &#x20AC;100 million in 2012 compared to the 2011 level. In 2012, we pursued successful renegotiations of our long-term gas contracts and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will comment on that.</p>
          <p>A significant portion of our asset optimization program took place in the European area with the disposal of SPP in Slovakia, Maestrale in Italy and Sibelga in Belgium, Sibelga is a distribution network operator for electricity and natural gas in the Brussels region. But we have &#x2013; we had also to face very tough conditions for our European power generation activities.</p>
          <p>As indicated during our Investor Day last December, we have put our fleet on the continuous process of review. The depressed situation of the European energy markets has led us to adapt the accounting values according to market conditions. In total, we booked an adjustment of &#x20AC;2 billion plus tax in our 2012 accounts, mainly in Europe. I insist on the fact that it has no impact on cash and that is mainly a reversible measure. The adjustment of our European assets to market value will help us and help our strategic reallocation of assets to energy markets. Isabelle will come back on that.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in January 22, we confirmed that the SUEZ Environnement shareholders' agreement will not be renewed and announced that we signed the cooperation framework agreement as we plan to continue cooperating on the industrial and commercial front.</p>
          <p>Let's move to our Perform 2015 action plan. It is our answer to the very challenging market conditions that we're facing in Europe. Implemented since H2 2012, it has already brought a significant contribution with a positive net impact at EBITDA level close to &#x20AC;200 million and around &#x20AC;100 million at net income level. For the 2013-2015 period, we expect to benefit more from Perform 2015 with a net positive contribution of &#x20AC;200 million per year at the net recurring income level. We're strongly improving our operational efficiency with Perform 2015. The target, gross P&amp;L contribution of around &#x20AC;3.5 billion and an optimization of CapEx and working capital having a cash impact of around &#x20AC;1 billion over the period 2012-2015.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a few concrete examples of the action plan we're implementing. A reduction of a 15% of G&amp;A is part of the plan, meaning &#x20AC;1.1 billion savings in 2015. The headquarters will contribute strongly to this objective, the center's cost will be reduced by 30%, for instance it will involve regrouping most of the headquarters employees in our building in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:15:13) in 2014. Other measure relate to HR consulting expenses which will be cut by 50%. Electrabel has also already announced &#x20AC;130 million savings by the end 2013 this year, with a decrease of 245 jobs this year.</p>
          <p>We launched a complete overhaul Group procurement practices to significantly reduce external expenditure by optimizing specifications, rationalizing requirements, increasing competition between suppliers and improving the coordination in the supplier panel, we will buy cheaper and smarter. &#x20AC;1.7 billion gross savings are targeted in procurement both in OpEx and CapEx.</p>
          <p>Perform 2015 is deeply transforming our Group and as such the core element of our strategy to reshape the Group's profile. Our strategic shift towards fast-growing markets is accelerated by two main levers: first, a clearer focus on this promising market when allocating growth CapEx with a share of up to half of the total envelope. On the other hand, we reduced significantly our CapEx in mature markets, notably in Europe, but also in North America and Australia.</p>
          <p>Second, the other lever is our asset optimization program. 90% of the &#x20AC;12 billion disposal realized since early 2011 are located in matured markets. These two levers contribute to the geographical reshaping of our capital employed, of which we plan to position around 25% in the high growth areas in the medium-term.</p>
          <p>And now I hand over to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, who will give a brief update on three key topics, first the improvement of the competitiveness of our long-term gas supply, then the positive developments of the gas tariff in France, and lastly, the status of our two nuclear reactors, Doel 3 and Tihange 2. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Bonjour. Good morning. First, maybe, a quick glance on our midstream gas business, what we call gas supply, which has performed well last year and even better than what was expected and we had a conservative view last year when we discussed with you in February.</p>
          <p>This is the result of three elements. The first is that we have been able, again in this year, to preserve a large segment of our customer base based on oil index formula. The second element is the improved LNG business with significant margins last year, in particular, as G&#xE9;rard mentioned, with almost 40 cargos shipped to Asia, so very good performance of LNG business, which is taken into account in our supply business. And thirdly, naturally, an active renegotiation policy which has been pursued last year as it was in 2011.</p>
          <p>Indeed, all negotiations that we're focused for last year, but one, were achieved. And all earlier negotiations had allowed either to increase the market component of the gas formula or to reduce the volumes based on oil prices or to decrease clearly and simply the oil prices which is taken into account in the formula. In addition, we have been able to inject in some of our most important agreements yearly adaption of price structure to match the market evolutions between two reviews, as for instance it is the case for the agreement that we reached with Statoil.</p>
          <p>Going forward, active renegotiations are still again expected this year with some of major suppliers and all the negotiations have already started. And as I already mentioned to you, I think that our policy of continued adaptation to market developments is as you see, first actively implemented and delivering in these circumstances good results. As the consequences, we're confident that this year as well as in 2014 and 2015, we will be able to post good results above &#x20AC;200 million a year.</p>
          <p>Going rapidly now to the gas tariffs in France, as you know, the overall framework of gas tariffs have been very, very well clarified this year, beginning of this year and strengthened, I would say. In addition, as you know, we should note that, thanks to the favorable outcome of the judicial proceedings last year which has offset certain tariff increase which were postponed, the results of our downstream business last year is very satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, clearly, we welcome the implementation of the new tariff framework which improve significantly the visibility of the business and has considerably reduced the risk which were perceived by the market. And as confirmed, that beyond the cost coverage of the gas by definition, margin of around 2.5% is included in our tariff structure, which should lead consequently to an annual profit of around &#x20AC;250 million a year. Finally, also as you know, instead of the quarterly revision, the monthly adjustments which we're deciding with the new framework bring clearly a smoother way to new upcoming evolutions.</p>
          <p>As far as 2013 is concerned, this year, let me also remind you that given the recent decision of the state council, Conseil d' Etat, a one-off positive impact on P&amp;L will be booked in Q1 this year, 2013, and the amount is &#x20AC;150 million at EBITDA level and roughly &#x20AC;100 million in net recurring income. So this leads me to make a rapid overview of our energy business in France. And when I say, naturally, energy business in France is without the energy services of the French lead by J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Tolot and naturally also without the results of the infrastructure branch, only what we call energy.</p>
          <p>What is energy? And it's important to make a rapid point on that because the results this year have been more than twice what we achieved last year and last year &#x2013; in 2011 which were &#x2013; was affected by, first, the warm weather, as you know, and secondly, the fact that tariff increase were postponed. So this year we posted in 2012 &#x20AC;1.2 billion EBITDA and this is based on our &#x20AC;11 million gas and power contracts, both BtoB and BtoC, and clearly our downstream business in France, which includes by definition the regulated tariffs that I mentioned represent more than one-third of the overall results.</p>
          <p>And the second big contributor to our results in France in the energy business is our 9 gigawatt of installed capacity, including 1.2 gigawatt of nuclear power and around 4 gigawatt of hydro, which have clearly performed well in 2012 and this is naturally the &#x2013; this adds to the new stabilized gas framework.</p>
          <p>So going forward and assuming that clearly we can counteroffer a stabilized tariff formula which is clearly a fact, we will this year in 2013 continue to develop innovative solutions for our customers with a view to add value to our downstream business and we have a lot of projects to &#x2013; for instance, to inject more digital or more services to our sales and also the very important effort which has been undertaken to reduce our cost to sell.</p>
          <p>And secondly, naturally, we will continue to pursue our development in generation, but only in renewables in France as well, by the way, that we have the same policy for all Central Western Europe. And last year, we put, for instance, into services more than 200 megawatts of onshore wind and we will continue to do so but using less capital-intensive solutions.</p>
          <p>Let me finally make also an update on our nuclear situation in Belgium. Basically, nothing very new that stage. As you know, over the last few months, Electrabel has carried out an in-depth investigation in response to the indications that we found in the reactor vessels of Doel 3 and Tihange 2. In early December last year, we submitted our conclusions and action plan to further restarting of both units to the nuclear safety authorities in Belgium. As expected, this Belgium nuclear safety authority has communicated on January 15 this year on the <mark type="ph" /> justification fail (00:26:37) and the restart of those reactors.</p>
          <p>And in particularly, I will note that the authority has emphasized that Electrabel had delivered a report of an excellent quality and issued a very positive signal by saying that the safety as stated very clearly that it does not see any reasons why Doel 3 and Tihange 2 should remain closed permanently. So before making the final recommendation on the potential restart, the safety authorities have requested us further tests on the reactors, most notably pressure test in the primary circuit and mechanical tests on the material.</p>
          <p>Electrabel submitted earlier in this month its action plan with a detailed planning and this action plan has been approved by the safety authority. So now, we expect the test to be finalized around end of March and we expect to restart the plans in Q2 of this year instead of February which was what we assumed in our guidance. So what we told you at the beginning in this guidance of this year which was communicated at the time of the &#x2013; in early December of the Investor Day, but this delay, February to Q2, does not modify our guidance.</p>
          <p>So now, I think, over to you again, G&#xE9;rard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Before Isabelle goes into a more detailed presentation of our 2012 results, a few words on 2013 and 2014. For 2013 and 2014, we maintain our target of net recurring income, Group share, in the range of &#x20AC;3.1 billion, &#x20AC;3.5 billion and we'll give you some color around this range.</p>
          <p>First, it takes into account an update on commodity prices assumptions based on market conditions as of end of January 2013. I'll remind you that the guidance we disclosed at our Investor Day last December was based on market conditions as of end of August 2012. Commodity prices and power spreads have gone down since then, except for the clean dark side in Europe which have slightly gone up.</p>
          <p>Second, this &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;3.5 billion range of net recurring income, Group share, also assumes a restart of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 in Q2 2013 instead of February, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois said. As already communicated, the impact of the shutdown is around &#x20AC;50 million per month for the two plants at EBITDA level and around &#x20AC;30 million per month for the two plants at net recurring income level.</p>
          <p>And finally the target include the positive impact of January 2013 decision from the Conseil d'Etat on the gas tariffs shortfall, which represents a positive one-off in 2013 of &#x20AC;150 million at EBITDA level and around &#x20AC;100 million at net recurring income level.</p>
          <p>I also confirmed the other targets we have provided for 2013. The growth CapEx between &#x20AC;7 billion and &#x20AC;8 billion for the Group, therefore excluding SUEZ Environnement and net debt to EBITDA ratio below or equal 2.5 times and an A category rating.</p>
          <p>Isabelle?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, G&#xE9;rard, and good morning to everyone. I will cover three points in my presentation. First of all, the strong reaction of the Group in this tough environment, I will make a point on Perform 2015, our action plan and show you that our targets for 2012 have been overachieved, I will describe some decisions we have made also to optimize our industrial bases in 2012 and I will show you that we also accelerated last year the Group's reprofiling.</p>
          <p>Second chapter, I would say, of my presentation, the robust operational performance of the Group, you will see that our 2012 guidance have been totally achieved despite the environment. You will see that we have booked in 2012 impairments on some European assets, of course, I will describe that. Then, I will describe in further detail the operational performance on &#x2013; of our business lines and I will go back finally on the guidance for 2013, which is confirmed. And third chapter, the strong cash flow generation of the Group and the dynamic debt management.</p>
          <p>But, first of all, the strong reaction of the Group. You know that we launched in H2 last year action plan, Perform 2015, and this action plan has allowed us to overachieve the initial 2012 targets of &#x20AC;600 million contribution at EBITDA level that we had initially set with Efficio 2. You see the split of this &#x20AC;800 million impact on the different business lines on the pie chart, roughly &#x20AC;200 million for the two services business lines, that is to say, Energy Services and SUEZ Environnement, and &#x20AC;600 million for the others, that is to say, for Energy Europe, Energy International, Infrastructure, and Global Gas &amp; LNG.</p>
          <p>For &#x2013; first of all, for these four business lines, this amount of gross EBITDA contribution of &#x20AC;600 million is higher than the cost risk in these business lines which, is of course, our goal and will continue to be our goal over the years to come. As far as services activities are concerned, as we already explained, we follow less the cost basis as such than the level of margins and the goal, of course, is to be able to maintain or even if possible to increase the level of margin.</p>
          <p>In 2012, nevertheless, the amount of negative impact due to macroeconomic environment especially is slightly higher than the &#x20AC;200 million impact of Perform 2015. But globally, at Group level, on the Group as a whole, we have been able to deliver a global net EBITDA impact of &#x20AC;200 million. One of the levers to deliver efficiency is to optimize our industrial portfolio assets, of course, and to decide to close or to mothball sites to offset fixed cost.</p>
          <p>As indicated during our Investor Day last December, we have put our fleet under a continuous process of review. We have already announced our decision to close or to mothball a little bit more than 7 gigawatts of low utilized assets over 2009 to 2013. The list of this asset is specified on the slide, you see that there are &#x2013; these assets are mainly Continental European assets and in some cases in the UK also. These assets are no longer able to capture spreads. So to close them, of course, is a way for us to save cost.</p>
          <p>Recently, we have made decisions on an additional 3.3 gigawatt tranche to mothball or to convert to peak units or to optimize the corresponding plants. It is the case of Eems, significant CCGT plant we have in The Netherlands, a plant of 1.8 gigawatt, we have decided to partially mothball this plant. In fact, we maintained two units in partial conservation out of the five units of this plant to reduce fixed cost.</p>
          <p>And we continue to systematically review our fleets. And all the decisions we make lead to cost and cash savings. In fact, we do the same with the storage facilities which are also under-loaded due to the difficulties we face to commercialize these storage capacities in France. And we have decided to mothball two sites. So you see that on cost reduction, the Group delivered lot of actions in 2012.</p>
          <p>As far now as disposals are concerned, we have announced in 2012 transactions that reduced Group net debt for a total of &#x20AC;5.4 billion, including the SPP transaction in Slovakia. As you can see, most of these transactions are related to assets in major markets with the exception of Al Hidd in Bahrain where &#x2013; we already disclosed that, we had to sell 40% of our share to comply with regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>All these transactions are now closed since SPP and Maestrale in Italy were respectively closed on January 23 and on February 13. And I remind you that the impact in that debt was not booked at year-end for SPP. We confirm the target of &#x20AC;11 billion net debt impact in 2013, 2014 with transactions mainly focused on major markets.</p>
          <p>We also confirm the estimated impacts on EBITDA and net recurring income, Group share, level. The impact we gave last December already that is to say minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion on EBITDA for 2013 and again for 2014 and minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion in 2013 and minus &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2014 as far as net recurring income, Group share, is constant.</p>
          <p>Last word on Group strong reaction, I'd like to insist on the fact that we also accelerated the transformation of the Group with two major operations in 2012. First, the full integration of International Power and secondly the end of the shareholders' agreement in SUEZ Environnement leading to equity accounting.</p>
          <p>As you know, the shareholders' agreement will end on July 22 and we will then move to equity accounting for SUEZ Environnement. And for greater clarity, you will find in the appendices distributed today, 2012 accounts adjusted with SUEZ Environnement equity consolidated and we will do the same for Q1 and for H1 2013. Group reprofiling is also underway through the CapEx program which we have strongly reduced and we focus towards fast-growing markets. And you can see that this fast-growing market accounts for 35% of development CapEx.</p>
          <p>Now, the second chapter of my presentation, that is to say our robust operational performance. First of all, on net income, Group share, since this is the main focus for our guidance, we segregate Group is growing by almost 11%, i.e., &#x20AC;3.8 billion within the range we announced. EBITDA is growing by 3% at &#x20AC;17 million with organic growth slightly higher at plus 3.6%, also consistent with our target.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, net income, Group share, is down to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, reflecting the &#x20AC;2 billion post tax impairment we have decided to book at year end 2012. And I will go back in a few seconds to this point. And finally, CFFO or cash flow from operations, which is in fact free cash flow before maintenance CapEx is resilient at &#x20AC;12.1 billion, which is a very high level, boosted as in 2011 by exceptional items like non-recurring cash in Australia linked to CO2 regulation.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, next slide please, thank you, we have booked &#x20AC;2 billion of impairment losses post tax at the end of 2012. This net amount corresponds to &#x20AC;2.5 billion gross impairments which generate &#x20AC;0.5 billion of tax credit. And you will find the details in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Most of these assets are in European markets for more than 85%. These impairments are, of course, the result of the deterioration of economic conditions in European markets and we largely described this situation during our Investor Day.</p>
          <p>These accounting measures are mostly reversible and have no impact on cash or liquidity. Not surprisingly, we have recognized impairments on assets we have decided to close or to mothball or to optimize as part of the review of our portfolio, since principally these assets were not competitive anymore. For example, as I mentioned, we have decided to optimize Eems in The Netherlands and this led to a trigger to adjust the value and we have booked &#x20AC;0.4 billion of net impairments on this plant.</p>
          <p>We have also booked an adjustment of &#x20AC;0.2 billion at the end of 2012 on SPP based on the price proposed by EPH, which was lower than book value reevaluated at the time of the merger in 2008. Since 2012, these assets generated close to 9% shareholder return for GDF SUEZ, but going forward, we believe that EPH was better positioned to extract value from SPP.</p>
          <p>Let's come back now to net recurring income. Of course, this 11% increase especially reflects EBITDA growth and I will describe this EBITDA growth in detail in a few minutes. D&amp;A are almost stable in 2012 versus 2011. The increase in recurring income tax reflect the increase in current operating income, despite the fact that we have been charged in 2012 by a new fiscal burden in France for approximately &#x20AC;100 million, of course, not adjusted but which we have absorbed. All the other elements are stable for their recurring share including the financial result which is a good performance since the increase in volume of debt has been fully offset by decrease in rate.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2012, our cost of gross debt stands at 4.2% that is the lowest level ever. In this we have been, once again, very active on debt management. For example, first bonds in U.S. dollar for &#x20AC;14 at 1.39% and we have refinanced also the IP debt acquisition at very attractive level.</p>
          <p>Last words to say &#x2013; just, former slide please, that the minority interest are almost stable. In fact, the full-year impact of strategic partnerships we closed in 2011 on EPI or on gas transportation being offset by the IPR minorities buyout, and you will see that in 2013 minority interest will decrease.</p>
          <p>Let's not look at the drivers for EBITDA growth, I will go through some business lines in the next slides, but let's start with the main effect impacting our EBITDA in 2012 versus 2011. First, as already mentioned several times, 2012 was positively impacted by weather and tariff in France with a variation of &#x20AC;900 million versus 2011 with a return to average weather and to a normal situation in French gas tariff. Impact on power and gas margins have been significant, which is the result of drop in spreads. Load factors at low level, 34% for CCGT in 2012 in Europe. And it has been a little bit emphasized by downstream effects.</p>
          <p>The plant outage of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 impacted 2012 EBITDA for roughly &#x20AC;300 million. And the impact of the asset optimization program is &#x20AC;0.6 billion, in line with what we announced last August. On the positive side, the impact of commissioning is &#x20AC;0.6 billion, very close to the &#x20AC;0.7 billion we expected last year; the small difference is linked to delays in Gheco One in Thailand notably, which was delayed due project management from the EPC contractor. And we already received liquidity in damages and we still have a pending claim.</p>
          <p>Increase in E&amp;P and LNG is extremely strong at &#x20AC;0.5 million due to price effects higher than anticipated and the good dynamic on the LNG market. Forex was also positive in 2012 with an impact of &#x20AC;200 million, mostly from the U.S. dollar. And finally, the Perform 2015 action plan has led us as I said, to a net positive impact of &#x20AC;200 million beyond cost risk and beyond the compensation of the macroeconomic deterioration in services and environment activity.</p>
          <p>I propose now to enter in further detail for three business lines, that is to say, Energy International, Energy Europe and Global Gas &amp; LNG. And for the three others, I proposed to be at your disposal for the Q&amp;A session, if you wish.</p>
          <p>So Energy International first, our Energy International business line shows a consolidation between mature markets and fast-growing countries. First of all, for mature markets, the contribution is decreasing, but in North America, where in fact, even if we didn't benefit from the exceptional summer we had in 2011, nevertheless, the operational performance stayed at good level.</p>
          <p>In the UK, power system had been oversupplied, which led to lower market spreads. A strong performance, nevertheless, for First Hydro in terms of storage power plants that we have in this country and this tempers gross margin deterioration. In Australia, performance is down due to cooler summer, reduction in demand and exceptional one-off positive items in 2011.</p>
          <p>In fast-growing markets, the performance is good. In Latin America, very strong performance in Brazil. On the contrary, we saw a decrease of contribution of Chile due to the end of exceptional conditions in 2011. In the Middle East, operational performance is good, stands at very high level with lower development fees versus 2011 and especially the deconsolidation effect of Al Hidd in Bahrain. And in Asia, we recorded strong growth in Thailand with the contribution of new assets Gheco One and Glow 5, and improved performance Glow hydro plant in Laos, also.</p>
          <p>2013 EBITDA will benefit from new capacities commission growth in 2012 and 2013, and from strengthening of power margins in Asia in &#x2013; and in Latin America. For this business line, a last word to say that the relevant indicator is rather adjusted COI than EBITDA to capture growth from associates which are important in our Energy International division. And this aggregate of adjusted COI is growing by almost 8% in organic.</p>
          <p>Energy Europe now, all in all, we see an organic growth of 3.5% at EBITDA level. This good performance is the result of very contrasted effects. First, a negative impact of regulatory tax and price environment, but mitigated by positive effects, strong impact on weather and tariff in France, as I already mentioned, positive outcome from long-term gas contract renegotiations as mentioned by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and then also the strong performance of Perform 2015 with a &#x20AC;300 million gross impact on EBITDA. In 2013, EBITDA was to be under pressure with depressed prices and CO2 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:52:04) will mitigate, but with negative impact.</p>
          <p>Global Gas &amp; LNG, we saw a strong organic growth &#x2013; very strong organic growth at 30% with a strong impact on increase in oil and gas prices and also an increase in the level of production sustained by Gj&#xF8;a field in Norway, in particular. We have also strong operational results for this business line, with 2P reserves at their highest level ever with 836 million barrel of oil equivalent, a success rate of almost 70% with 11 successful wells out of 16, which is operationally taking a very high level for this business and with one of the largest oil discoveries in Dutch North Sea. We benefited from an increase in LNG sales to third parties with 60 kilowatt hours versus 41 kilowatt hours in 2011.</p>
          <p>2013 is expected to be lower than 2012 temporarily, because slightly lower production level in E&amp;P and the production will increase again in 2014 with the commissioning of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:53:38). We expect also for 2013 sustained LNG sales to third parties.</p>
          <p>So I go directly to slide 28 and I will go back to our 2013 guidance. As already mentioned by G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, we confirm our guidance for 2013, that is to say, between &#x20AC;3.1 billion and &#x20AC;3.5 billion net recurring income, Group share. This is based on an underlying EBITDA between &#x20AC;13 billion and &#x20AC;14 billion. This estimate is now based on commodities lower prices as of end of January 2013, also based on restart of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 in Q2 and this estimate integrates the positive decision on gas tariff in France. We will book in 2013 and &#x2013; with &#x20AC;15 million at EBITDA level.</p>
          <p>Comparing this bridge to the one we communicated last December, you will see some small changes. Commissioning is down by &#x20AC;100 million. It is due to the deconsolidation of wind projects in Canada, but no impact to be factored at net recurring income, Group share, level. Volume and price for gas and power is slightly down, including positive impact from gas tariff in France and impact of delay in restarting Doel 3 and Tihange 2. And you see that with the assumptions, we are still in the &#x20AC;13 billion to &#x20AC;14 billion range.</p>
          <p>For the bottom line, we confirm the trends communicated last December, with just one exception of the D&amp;A level which will slightly decrease to a range of &#x20AC;5.8 billion to &#x20AC;6 billion in relation with the impairment we booked. For the other inventory manual, recurring financial result is expected in the range &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;2.2 billion. The decrease in net recurring income tax expected between &#x20AC;1.8 billion and &#x20AC;2 billion, and a recurring share in net income of associates is stable. Non-controlling interest, as I mentioned, was decreased to a range of &#x20AC;0.6 billion to &#x20AC;0.8 billion as per the full-year impact of the International Power minority acquisition.</p>
          <p>Lastly, cash generation and debt management in 2012, we have generated more than &#x20AC;12 billion of cash flow from operations. As you can see, this cash has been used to finance our CapEx program, &#x20AC;10 billion, and to pay the dividend to our shareholders. At the end of 2012, net debt stood at &#x20AC;43.9 billion. And if we take into account the disposal of SPP we cashed in at the end of January, we were at &#x20AC;42.8 billion and exactly at 2.5% net debt on EBITDA ratio.</p>
          <p>With the equity consolidation of SUEZ Environnement, the deleveraging will continue at Group pace, and net debt will be pro forma of this equity consolidation around &#x20AC;35.5 billion mid-July. So we're well on track towards our &#x20AC;30 billion target for end of 2014 and we may reach it earlier.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much and now I hand over to G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet for the conclusion.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Isabelle. As you have seen, a strong and sustainable cash flow generation is at the heart of the GDF SUEZ financial equation. In 2012, our free cash flow reached &#x20AC;8.8 billion, stable compared to the 2011 level which was already very strong. With this level, we ensure an attractive and sustainable dividend policy for our shareholders with a dividend per share each year at least equal compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I want to summarize our key messages. All our 2012 targets have been met. We focused on the bottom line, upgraded our efficiency measures and posted a &#x20AC;3.8 billion net recurring income, Group share. We have deeply transformed and simplified our company. Energy is our core business activity with five dedicated business lines owned at 100% each. We face a challenging outlook in the mature energy market especially in Europe and we react with a determined action plan providing both &#x20AC;3.5 billion in the P&amp;L and &#x20AC;1 billion extra cash through CapEx and working capital optimization by 2015. By addressing our &#x2013; the value of our European assets with a &#x20AC;2 billion impairment, we'll facilitate the asset rotation and the strategic redeployment of the Group.</p>
          <p>We have accelerated our development in fast-growing markets and we'll continue to expand in these areas, increasing our strategic advantage among the global energy players and securing a good visibility on returns.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and I'm ready with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and with Isabelle to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Who wants to ask the first question? Yes, sir?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:24) Morgan Stanley. I have two brief questions to begin, I'm from Morgan Stanley. Firstly regarding the guidance bridge change 2012, 2013, could you tell us why there is a change of components, the mark &#x2013; change in the mark-to-market date from end of August to end of January? I imagine this pretty much change the 2014 ranges, you'd already been hedged pretty well for 2013. That was the first point.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the figures you give expected impact of dilution through asset divestment, you gave amounts that are fairly low in terms of a net result, &#x20AC;0.8 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;0.3 billion for an &#x20AC;11 billion divestment. Could you confirm that this is taking account the use you'll be making of that cash in, for instance, savings on a debt &#x2013; cost of debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer in English. As far as the 2013 guidance is concerned, you're right, we have &#x2013; and as I mentioned, in fact, we have taken into account the decrease on commodity prices between August and January. If you look at these energy prices, you see that, for example, for outside power in Belgium, the price per megawatt hour went from &#x20AC;51 per megawatt hour, sorry, to &#x20AC;44, so we put that in our guidance. We were open, as far as outside power is concerned, at roughly 20 terawatt hours so you make the math, plus also a slight decrease on spreads, we saw also during this period.</p>
          <p>As far as disposals are concerned, you are perfectly right, we &#x2013; of course, we choose assets with poor contribution as far as the net recurring income is concerned. I won't give any detail because we never disclose before having disposed the list of assets we intend to dispose. But we confirm this contribution at net recurring income, Group share. And as you know, the cash we will get, and the debt we will reconsolidate will contribute to the strong debt decrease we expect for &#x2013; over the months to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Isabelle. Perhaps Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, could you make some color about the evolutions of the commodity prices in the European markets in the meantime on this period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. I believe that was <mark type="ph" /> Emmanuel's last (01:03:34) question. No doubt about it. Recent changes in commodities prices have a negative impact on our financial outlook. 2013, as you've said, everything is pretty much hedged, but for 2014, due to the hedging policy, much of 2014 is also hedged. But we must also take account of the fact that recent movements have been kind of odd, not really on trend with recent annual averages. So I think it'll be very important in upcoming weeks for us to look at changes in coal prices, look at possible changes in terms of quota systems for CO2 and what will be the resumption in demand. For the time being figures are fairly poor, some negatives for 2014, 2015, more for 2015 than 2014 actually. After that, lots of question marks as to recovery that may take place in the uptick possibly for the three points I mentioned.</p>

          <p>Further questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm from Credit Suisse. Three questions, if I might. Firstly, this one has to do with the asset closures, by mothballing 2013, 0.9 gigawatts. You also have a program for asset divesting. Now, you've got divestments and closures and mothballing, I'd like to know what capacity you intend to close or sell in Europe in the next 24 months in order of magnitude? Second question on the dividend policy, you've committed to pay a dividend in cash 2012, apparently that will also be the case in 2013 and 2014 and you're committing to pay at least the same dividend per share. Does this mean possibly the dividend might be &#x20AC;1.50 at least in 2013? The last question, many companies in your industry are currently looking at hybrid emissions, have you? If so, what might have changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on your first question, closures, asset divestments and so forth, just make &#x2013; I'll make a general point since your question is pretty general. What we want is to adapt quickly change quickly, be proactive, forward-thinking, move with trends. We know that the market is in the throes of major change and we intend to be highly mobile, quick-footed and we can say that the &#x20AC;2 billion in value adjustments are certainly going to help us. As Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois said, we decide to close or mothball capacity when their cash generation turns negative. So we immediately halt any cash hemorrhaging, so to speak. Some of them are mothballed and that can be reversed.</p>
          <p>They can be brought back on, for instance, it can be combined cycle facility, the site performance currently underused. In some instances, some of the combined cycle plants are turned into single-cycle plants as pickers. So a great deal of work is done here. It is a very substantial work that we do to optimize our assets. We do not rule out as divestment. We've done this already in Europe and we know the market's tougher and we have to very much be very careful, select very carefully.</p>
          <p>Overall, our strategy is in Europe to develop in renewables, invest in renewables and energy efficiency, not to grow our thermal facilities in Europe. On the contrary, we would pare that down, no doubt about that.</p>
          <p>On to our dividend policy, the board restated very clearly the dividend policy is to have an annual dividend equal to or greater than the previous year's dividend. Now currently, it's more equal to than greater than, but that's actually already a good thing. It's a good thing. The marketplace was wondering a little bit, will they make good on that policy in 2012. We said it would be done in cash. We've done so. The board said so. They reconfirmed this policy.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors doesn't actually make the formal decision to present resolutions for the next 15 years in the AGM. I think it's restated its very clear dividend policy. And the foundation of this policy is a cash dividend. We made exception last year; we announced that, because we wanted to finance a third of acquisition for buying out the minority shareholders in International Power at &#x20AC;9 billion, a third of that was jointly done through equity. And shareholders did subscribe, over three-quarters of them took the share based dividend amounting to &#x20AC;6.6 billion which was basically a third.</p>
          <p>Now, on to the hybrid issues, that's certainly an option available to us. We do not rule it out. I don't know if Isabelle would like to comment on that. We've taken no decision on that, though. These are some of the products that currently are fairly fashionable, these hybrid issues. We haven't made any decision there, have neither decided in favor nor against.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Benjamin Leyre from Exane. I have four questions. Firstly, could you tell us the amounts of distributable reserves in your balance sheet to pay out the dividend in 2012? Also, could you talk to us about EBITDA momentum and gas storage in France and Germany between 2012 and 2013, could you help us do the bridge there, maybe 2011, 2012; 2012, 2013?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, do you think the opinion given by the French Nuclear Authority, ASN, fairly negative regarding &#x2013; starting back up their nuclear plants in Belgium could influence the Belgian regulatory authority one way or another in making their final decision. Fourthly, could you tell us the amount, the net income expected in 2015 mark-to market? I didn't get the last question, to 2015, thinking it will be a big jump in net income. What will the magnitude of that big uptick be? There's no improvement in commodities prices. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, payable reserves, for the accounting point of view, ended 2012, do you have a figure? We'll get this. GDF SUEZ SA, the figure is just over &#x20AC;11 billion, but that's GDF SUEZ SA, so not the consolidated Group. Regarding, I guess, storage, I don't think we can give you the actual specifics. Certainly, capacity usage in gas storage throughout Europe has been lower in 2012 than 2011 because amounts of gas consumed are lower, so usage of storage &#x2013; overall, infrastructure usage is down. That's especially true when it comes to storage infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Generally, storage is used as a way of regulating capacity and also as a sort of backup for winter season. We made operating decisions to optimize storage management by closing or mothballing two storages, Trois Fontaines and <mark type="ph" /> Soings (01:12:51) to improve the capacity usage of other storage areas. We don't give any more specifics as to the precise impact of storage capacity usage in 2012 compared to 2011. But that's exactly what it boils down to. Now, on nuclear, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, would you like to come in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't of course, try to say what one regulatory authority's influence may be on another regulatory authority. But I would just say firstly, it was agreed that various regulators would be called in by the Belgian authority to give their views on the decision. The French regulator was asked also the German regulator and the U.S. regulator. They were part of the overall advisory panel that the nuclear safety authorities are working with.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, what came out in the newspapers as the regulator's position is very much in line with the decision made by the Belgian authorities. What the regulator said was that the current &#x2013; the French regulator said, was that, at this stage, further tests would need to be carried out, particularly the test that we are carrying out. I believe that there is an agreement between the two regulators and others, to say that before making a decision to resume activity, at least two types of tests would have to be carried out, what we call hydraulic test, test that we're accustomed to doing in France in our nuclear plants, but not in Belgium, plus other tests on the equipment.</p>
          <p>And I would say that what the Belgian authorities decided in January is very much in line with what's been said there and what we've heard of the French nuclear safety authority. So we mustn't in any way misconstrue their position. Regarding a recovery in 2015, the uptick in 2015 will be thanks to an increase in overall business activity and really outside of Europe plus our ability to react appropriately in Europe through the ongoing effects of our action plan.</p>
          <p>Developing business in the four business lines aside from the Europe business line is something that's very tangible. In the Europe business lines, we're turning things around, optimizing things and this is going to make major &#x2013; have a major impact. Now, the scale of the recovery would depend on the commodities prices in Europe. That's what you said and I would agree with you on that.</p>
