          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q1 Report Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the chairperson, the CFO of Atlas Copco, Hans-Ola Meyer, please begin your meeting, and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome to everybody participating on this conference call regarding our first quarter 2012 results. Today, we have also our annual general meeting, so we will have to be rather efficient and we have to break this call just before the next full hour. I mean five to 2:00 here in Sweden, in Swedish Time.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I would like to handover to Ronnie Leten, our CEO and he will start his comments on the quarter results. Please Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans-Ola, and good afternoon to all of you. When I'm going to the presentation, I will try to refer to the slides, so that you know where we are. Let's go immediately to slide number two, where we give our quarter one highlights. I'm very pleased to see this record order intake; if you would have asked me a couple months ago would it be at that level, and most of you know the outlook we put forward at that time, I did not expect that level of demand, but I'm very pleased to see almost SEK25 billion for this received level.</p>
          <p>What are the really takeaways? When you dig a bit deeper, as it also says here on this slide, we had a very strong development in the mining segment, and on top of that we had very good automotive business order intake, <mark type="ph" /> regarding (02:23) to forget that CT was also on record level and kept a reasonable good level on the construction level. So that made that a very strong order intake and not of course, not to forget, as we tend to forget, that our continuous good development of our service strategy, so that also led to a strong growth in the aftermarket.</p>
          <p>So let me take it a bit geographically and we take the two large economies in the world, and this time I would like to start with the U.S. We had very good growth in U.S., it keeps growing, and you all remember that already we have seen this for more than 12 months that there is still a good investment going on almost overall in United States for our products.</p>
          <p>And also to say some words about China, we are comparing, and those who have already looked to the presentation had seen a minus that we are comparing here, we have a very strong China, but if we look sequentially, we see still a very solid sequential improvement in China. I will elaborate a bit more when we take regional figures.</p>
          <p>We continued to invest in market presence, dig deeper into the market, identifying the network, feet on the street will be increasing constantly, because we still believe we can take more after the market, and also the ones who have seen the press release, we also opened two new customer centers during the two quarters, and that's the one in Senegal and the other one in Mozambique, to really take control of that market.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, on the investments, we have many new products came on the market, so strong development on innovation, we don't <mark type="ph" /> seem to see (4:30), when you look later on to the bridge, to see also that it has a positive effect on our pricing strategy.</p>
          <p>The last line, strong value creation and &#x2013; it continues, I should say, value creation, I think I would like to really highlight that, with our strong profit level we have and with our asset-light model growth, it's really creating value in growth mode and really succeed that rapid growth with a positive cash flow. So, all in all, I can say I'm very pleased to see this type of outcome.</p>
          <p>If I then look to the sales, I will not go through them all, maybe I jump immediately to the operating profit, which has increased by 15% and SEK 4.6 million. For those who have not looked a bit to history, the second best ever EBIT level on the operating margin, a very solid 20.7%, there's a couple of negative effects and a couple of positive effects, you can read them there and maybe also Hans-Ola will elaborate a bit more when we go to the flow through <mark type="ph" /> bridges (5:56).</p>
          <p>On the profit before tax, maybe want to highlight that, yeah, RSC shares, we sold them all last year, so this is over. And we have an earnings per share of SEK 2.18 (sic) [2.81] (6:13), and an operating cash flow of SEK1.4 million, which is a very good solid run rate, and I think also Hans-Ola will elaborate a bit, when he will talk about the cash flows. Also we see that we paid this quarter SEK1.5 billion in tax.</p>
          <p>Then I would like to go to slide number four, orders received, level in local currency, group total plus 13% year-to-date, only one payer compared to last year. If you compare year-to-year, that's minus, the other ones are very solid development all over. And on the minus, I'll elaborate when we talk about the different regions.</p>
          <p>So let's go to the Americans, which is slide number five. I've already elaborated a bit on U.S., and of course when you talk North America, it's the biggest part; a very strong order intake with strong growth in the United States and Canada. Then you can maybe wonder why only plus 9%, as it's all so strong about the United States and Canada.</p>
          <p>One should not forget that last year, same quarter, we had one of the largest orders booked in Mexico for Pe&#xF1;oles. Of course, that makes the comparison difficult for Mexico this year, but a very, very solid development going on, and primarily also coming from the manufacturing industry; that means from Compressor Technique and IT, so Industrial Technique, which were both very solid. Sales in construction equipment improved. So we see that also when we look to the <mark type="ph" /> vendor (8:19) companies; we see a good development and good demand from them.</p>
          <p>South America, yeah: very strong, Chile, very strong from Peru, and very solid Brazil. Maybe one side remark; when I talk about Brazil, that construction is improving sequentially, but still a bit on the soft side.</p>
          <p>Then I'd like to go to Europe, next slide. The orders in Europe really increased this year, also 11%, coming from a very solid Russia, but also the good Germany. The German demand was, for us in the quarter, very favorable, so I'm very pleased to see that development coming from good development in industrial tools, motor vehicles, but also when I look to our Compressor side, it's a good development.</p>
          <p>If we look to this plus 11%, one should, of course, take into account that this is a bit inflated by the acquisition &#x2013; if we only want to look into organic with a couple of percentages, so Europe would be a little bit less than 11%, but still at a very good level.</p>
          <p>Africa/Middle East, Middle East is back. We got very good development there, especially when it comes to Saudi Arabia, and also the mining part in West Africa, as well as in South Africa, keeps developing at good &#x2013; very good levels, because otherwise you cannot make the first <mark type="ph" /> thing (10:20), the 51%.</p>
          <p>If I then go to slide number seven and talking about Asia, we got sequential improvement, positive on the order CT side, although year-on-year, as you can see on the slide, minus 10%, but still good robust demand for industrial equipment, as well as also for mining equipment. So I'm very pleased to see that we keep up a very strong high level.</p>
          <p>If I then talk more specific about the larger economy in that region and then we talk about China. I see still a good development demand in China. Of course, if we compare with the same quarter last year, it is less, but sequential, it is at the positive level.</p>
          <p>If I give a bit of an insight on the couple of segments and I'm talking then about our yellow canaries, they do still solid in China. On the other hand, when we think about road construction demand, it remains still at the soft level.</p>
          <p>Australia, what can I say more? Besides what is written here, continued to be strong demand and that's maybe still an understatement. It goes really very well and we expect really that to continue.</p>
          <p>Then slide number eight, where you see the difference over price &#x2013; pricing, organic growth increases; again, the quarter with double &#x2013; solid double-digit growth. So, it's nine quarters in a row that has given growth above 10%, so very solid.</p>
          <p>That we go to the bridge, slide number nine. I also mentioned already about price, solid plus 2%, so our continuous focus on innovation, new product and presence gives us really price leadership and allows us also to get the right value for our products and services. So I am very pleased to see that.</p>
          <p>And you see here also, the book-to-bill, when you compare orders received and revenues, that puts on the revenue level SEK22.2 billion. It's at the good level, at a very good level, I should say, especially when you take the first quarter of the year, which is normally a bit on the lower side.</p>
          <p>The Group then, yes, not much to say, but let's go immediately to slide number 11, when we talk about the business areas and then the first one is Compressor Technique. As already mentioned, record order intake, 5% organic growth, when &#x2013; especially when we go to compare with last year, which was a very strong quarter already.</p>
          <p>Very good order income, I can say even strong order income from gas and process compressors, but also the demand for our industrial compressors are at a very solid level, otherwise you cannot make the plus 5% organic growth. And I didn't mention here anything about the service, but that continues to have solid development too.</p>
          <p>Then when we look to the operating margin, 22.1%, a very solid margin; of course when you compare with last year, one can say only 22.1%. It's primarily impacted by revenue mix from larger equipment sales, which then has an effect of, of course, less aftermarket. We also &#x2013; we have done several investments in market penetration, as already also mentioned, that's feet on the street. We keeping investing in all the different areas, as we believe it still creates value to put more feet in the street and, last but not least, it's also affected by the acquisitions we have done lately, which are now in the start-up, where some costs have been taken and we will work further on the efficiency in these acquisitions. But I'm sure also Hans-Ola will elaborate a bit more when he is mentioning the flow through <mark type="ph" /> bridge, that one (15:40).</p>
          <p>But one thing is also here on the Compressor Technique, we still have coming here <mark type="ph" /> at the roads (15:44) which is coming close to 70%, I think in the quarter here, if I take it right. I think it's around 68%. So it's still very healthy value creation for the Atlas Copco Group.</p>
          <p>And when you look to the picture, maybe to highlight, we keep investing in new machines. They're definitely efficient, more efficient than the previous one, the lifecycle cost <mark type="ph" /> for all persons (16:17) will go down and this will keep us really competitive in this market.</p>
          <p>Then, I would like to go to Industrial Technique. Slide number 12, record intake. I'm very pleased to see this level, when you see 10% organic growth coming from this business area. It's great to see that and also when you look then to the profitability, 24% it's great to see. Coming from good motor vehicle in all regions and that means China, India, U.S. and Europe, and a good aftermarket business.</p>
          <p>Maybe one remark, we see in the general industry, for those who see more or less the same pattern as we also see in Compressor Technique for the industrials, more the industrial compressors. So we see more or less the same pattern in that demand. And yeah, we keep launching new products into the market with the picture that is shown here, it's one of our new high-torque tools, which is again bringing efficiency for our customers.</p>
          <p>Mining and Rock Excavation, next Slide 13. Yeah, I maybe get a bit boring when I say record again, every slide starts with a record, so maybe we should be more inventive to find another word for record. But anyhow strong activities in mining, keeps continue 22% organic growth, really right on the nice contributors, they are there. Strong growth in aftermarket, it shows <mark type="ph" /> how (18:25) that is a focus area for us.</p>
          <p>And maybe I have to apologize here that when we compare with last year and then you were looking, maybe of listening to me last time that I was a bit more careful in comparison with the expectancy here. Here, yeah, I made, maybe &#x2013; I didn't expect that it would have been 22% organic growth. So I have to apologize for that part of outlook, but I'm happy to do that also next time if I'm wrong with that level or in that direction.</p>
          <p>Then on the revenue, almost 25% operating margin, very solid. We keep <mark type="ph" /> going (19:15) there. The guys they are really under steam when it comes to the output of the factories. There are a couple of ships full of equipment on the ocean, so if you get invoiced, which also you see on the inventory, which maybe some of you could think about. But on the other hand when you look to this business area, you see still that it's a &#x2013; that is not still, that it has rose almost, what is it, 66%. So a very nice contributor to the value creation of the Group as it is in CT. We closed a couple of acquisitions which was Perfora, GIA and our distributors in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Construction Technique, here it may be the only one which has not a record. So maybe we'll have to do it next time. Lower &#x2013; still lower than last year, mainly coming from the weak demand in China from the road construction equipment and not very strong in Brazil. But if we look to the other products, in the Portable Energy, when it comes to compressor generators we have a very favorable demand. So that develops very well and we see a very strong market in North America and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>And I'm very pleased to see also the operating margin coming again in double-digits, although it is still negative-effected by some lower production volume and yeah, more <mark type="ph" /> feet (21:06) industry because we feel also that beside investing in R&amp;D, we also need to invest in new customer <mark type="ph" /> centred feet (21:14) industry <mark type="ph" /> because what (21:16) yeah, this today may be a bit lower profit but that's investing in the future, investing in the structure because we believe really that is a business area which will be a, yeah, a nice contributor for the future.</p>
          <p>Then I'm going immediately to slide number 15, summarize before I give the word to Hans-Ola. Operating profit compared to last year 15% up, and when you look to return on capital employed although, we look to our balance sheet, but look here, we went from 32% return on capital employed to 37% which is I think I'm very pleased to see this trend to &#x2013; yeah in the improvement.</p>
          <p>So maybe on Hans-Ola, you can take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Ronnie. I will just add a few short things because you have touched upon many of the important comments, also on profitability etcetera. When we look at the total profits for the period, we normally comment also on the financial items and you can read it in the report. But obviously to think about going forward is that, we have now stepped up in March, our <mark type="ph" /> long (22:48) capitalization, by that I mean, we had a very successful borrowing of &#x20AC;500 million, seven-year money. And that is of course, in anticipation of two things, the dividend that will come in the next month and then, of course, also that we have an amortization of another loan.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, we are borrowing more for that reason, so we expect that on a run rate, perhaps it's more likely that our interest net per quarter going forward will be approaching SEK200 million rather than the SEK150 million level that we have seen in this quarter or close to that at least.</p>
          <p>Tax came in about where expected and I think still that's around 25% or slightly lower, is in that region we expect in the near-term future. Return on capital employed, very strong at 37%, as Ronnie mentioned. I think we leave it at that and go on to page number 16.</p>
          <p>Ronnie has also there alluded to that if we call the organic profit flow-through or incremental profit, it's lower as a percentage affected by a few things that has been commented already, but I would rather turn to the next page on number 17 and just reiterate a few things that again Ronnie has touched upon.</p>
          <p>There are two business areas that looked a little bit different from what you can say over a period of &#x2013; of a longer period averages in terms of the flow-through. CT, this quarter compared to last year, we have more equipment sales than in relation to aftermarket sales compared to last year. Equipment sales was about 60% this quarter and it was 57% of total revenues a year ago. So that is of course a revenue mix. There are also revenue mixes between type of products. Ronnie mentioned that we had good success, that we had good strong invoicing from engineered compressors and gas and process, specifically.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, we also have a lot of investing in the growth. Right now, we have market penetration going up in many, many new countries and also in countries like China, India, et cetera, on an ongoing basis and that is eating out of the margin flow-through in this period of strong growth. We then &#x2013; we also have the effect of the acquisition contribution as you can see in that slide.</p>
          <p>The other business area to say a few words is, of course, Construction and there &#x2013; here it's a good sign that we are back compared to the low levels of profitability in Q4. But we do have a negative comparison with last year, primarily lower production volumes. So we still have factories that are not fully absorbed and then we are also investing, as Ronnie said, briefly in more R&amp;D and also in our market presence opening up new customer centers for this business area to serve the growth of the future.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I think we leave that page and go to the balance sheet. A few points is worthwhile to note, the growth of total assets is due to &#x2013; primarily due to the new &#x20AC;500 million loan that will then this &#x2013; that will then compensate &#x2013; be compensated for by in the second quarter with the dividend payout and the amortization of another loan of about SEK2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The continued growth, this is of course also increasing the working capital. With this type of growth, we will, of course, invest in the business. As &#x2013; and as some of you will remember from last year's Capital Market Day, that's exactly the pattern we are used to seeing this type of strong growth phases. It's not the cash generation that is the primary focus in these type of situations. But over time, we are more than confident that we can certainly maintain efficiency in this and we can even improve in some of the business areas that lots of projects internally is witnessing that ambition.</p>
          <p>So if we turn to the page number 19, you can see what I meant about the very soon to be amortization in 2012 of the loan. And then we have, as you can also appreciate, we have much more loans now maturing in 2019 than we had before. So that is a sound long-term oriented capital base and that's what we're looking for.</p>
          <p>And I then turn to 20 &#x2013; page 20, the cash flow, we just wanted to highlight basically that the operating cash flow which includes everything but acquisitions. As you know, we have, of course, a positive contribution compared to last year from the profitability, from the profit generation, but we are paying, and I underline paying, substantially more taxes this quarter compared to the first quarter last year and that is primarily here in Sweden that that has been a big effect. And then the other comparison that is worthwhile mentioning with last year is that last year included almost <mark type="ph" /> SEK (28:49)300 million of positive cash flow from selling Rental Service shares, which is, of course, not there this time. So, all in all, a rather expected cash flow if you ask me, and this is also in line with what we have seen in previous years in those periods.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I think we just leave for final words on the outlook to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So if we go then to the last slide where we see the near-term outlook, what we believe is that the products and services of our company, expect that to remain at a very solid current high level. So, and that I don't &#x2013; I think we can better go to the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; mindful of time, I think that's a good idea, Ronnie.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I just ask the operator to repeat <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; say (29:46) the maneuvers to pose a question on the call, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Nico Dil from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like to ask three questions, please. First of all, you've upgraded your outlook here with the results to sort of a stable level of demand. We see the working capital investments filtering through for potentially what I see as a little bit of growth coming through. How do I look at this outlook statement going forward, is this sort of the usual first step-up where we're starting to get a bit more positive and perhaps we can move even into positive territory from here or could it perhaps sort of start to tinker down a little bit further out in the year. Just sort of wondering what your longer term perspective rather is &#x2013; is than rather than one quarter out.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think you gave us a figure for Compressor Technique on the aftermarket sales 60% versus &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; 60% last year, 57% this year. What is it for Industrial Technique, please? And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the other way around, it's 60% equipment this year and 57% last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for Industrial Technique, what are the figures there? And the last question is around China. Ronnie, you highlighted that you still see good demand there outside road construction. We see the figures for Asia, for China, down 10%; wondering where the weakness is really on a year-on-year basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, maybe I can start on the outlook and why it changed. I think if we look to &#x2013; when I really take the different segment and geographical outlook, and I take U.S., I take South America, I look to say <mark type="ph" /> the believe (32:05) in the mining demand. I look Russia on the other hand maybe there are couple of areas like Europe, it is a bit &#x2013; maybe in some areas in Europe is a bit more prudent. Then I believe given that we're already on the high level, that one side, but on the other hand and I see a lot of positive things, that made us changing this level bringing in this type of outlook.</p>
          <p>So, and I think when you take it, and more specific for us, as Copco, I believe <mark type="ph" /> deal with or drive for (32:45) innovation, new product, and <mark type="ph" /> I'm digging on it (32:49) and I'm repeating myself maybe already thousand times, I believe with the new products with further feet on the street, with our focus on aftermarket, I believe also that that will help to support our outlook in that part.</p>
          <p>Then, when it comes to &#x2013; I will take the question on China, I think, and Hans-Ola can take on Industrial Technique and other part. On China, it's difficult to &#x2013; because there is a lot of <mark type="ph" /> tight (33:23) things that goes out and written and you see here and there and everybody gets a bit wondering what in the hell is going on there. And that's also the same for me when you try to demystify <mark type="ph" /> what's all gone (33:37) but if I do it a bit systematic, what I see in China is that on the road construction side because that concerns us and I'm not going to elaborate the products which we do not have in our portfolio, I still see a soft business development. So that is not really taking positive. It can maybe a bit more positive compared to quarter four, but I think that &#x2013; I'll let that for everyone to judge.</p>
          <p>So on that part I see it negative, but when I go to the positive side, I see still a good development in demand on the mining side, I see a good development on the Industrial Technique side where Chinese customers really invest in efficiency tools where I see some stable works going on on tunneling, hydropower all these parts, which is an area which is of course coming close to us which &#x2013; and also what we see as a positive development.</p>
          <p>When I take a bit deeper on CT, I still see a good development on the air separation which is also I think a good sign that there is &#x2013; that one key to investing and the small to medium size compressors, my yellow canaries, they stay at a good level. Of course, it is geographically a bit different spread, but so you have it less export oriented investment but I think in the other areas of China there is still going good development. But one should not forget, Nico, last year quarter one was really a record, record, record China and if you would read again the transcript and all that, I think I mentioned it all the time that that was a really exceptional high level. So if you would take it a bit for, if you must take a linear line over the last two years, you'll still see a good development going on in China.</p>

          <p>So on the &#x2013; I mean Industrial Technique has a lower level than of aftermarket than MR and CT, as you know, and it's not fluctuating very much. For the time being it's about the same level as a year ago. So the aftermarket and accessory level is about 25% of the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. I'm more asking a question regarding your investment intention in Compressor Technique and whether you can sort of guide us as to how far are you with the right sales organization or in a way the timing of those investments, when do you plan to finish them. And then secondly, regarding incrementals for mining for Industrial Technique, are you planning to also invest on those divisions to capture more growth or you're happy with your current <mark type="ph" /> world (37:17) state of affairs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I will start to answer your last question first. I am happy but not satisfied. I think we can <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; and (37:28) you know my statement on that. I &#x2013; we &#x2013; in all the business areas we have now, we have four, which is also transparent role <mark type="ph" /> or view (37:38), we keep investing and what do I mean when I say keep investing? We keep investing in the organization; that means in people, in feet on the street, in engineers. We keep investing in product development. We keep investing in acquisitions when we believe that an acquisition is a better solution than organic, so we do that. Otherwise, if we would not do that anymore, I think then there is only one way and that is divest that business, but that is not in the plan. At least I've not heard that in any board meetings. So that's one thing.</p>
          <p>When it comes to investment in compressors, where are we? I think there is still a lot opportunities in compressors and related businesses. We started beginning of January this year a dedicated organization for quality air business with this air treatment and gas treatment business where we believe there is a lot of upside. It will take a bit of time to really speed up that part but you will see us giving more focus on it.</p>
          <p>You have seen also we have done acquisitions in low pressure which we did a couple of months ago in Houston. We keep <mark type="ph" /> going (39:00) because also there we see some potential and we also are now building two new factories for compressors; one in India and then one in Wuxi which hopefully they both can be ready by the end of the year. We could &#x2013; we do that because we believe that we have to invest in and grow market and besides that, we keep investing in efficiency in all these different areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And maybe a follow-up regarding Caterpillar comments on construction equipment in China, suggesting that they were ready to export 20% of their production in China &#x2013; in local China into external markets, thinking that inventories were too high. One presumably thinks that the Chinese companies are also having their inventories being built up. I'm wondering whether you are concerned that you're going to see increased competition levels for some product categories of yours, Dynapac especially, in emerging markets other than China. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one mistake one should avoid to make is underestimate any competition, any event and of course when one home market, a big home market is dropping, of course, these people are looking to move their cheese and looking for opportunities. So it could end up that they end up in other areas. But one thing when it talks about Chinese competitors in construction, we have already seen them in Africa last year and the year before. So I think that that is for sure, they are already there, we see them also in South America. So that, I think, is for me not a big change. I think on one hand lucky or unlucky, we are not the biggest player in China when it comes to road construction equipment and related equipment. So it affects us when we talked about Dynapac, but I think we have that, I think, well under control for the time being, I believe.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Ronnie. Hi, Hans-Ola. Couple of questions on the mix effects in Compressor Technique, if I can. Firstly, on the aftermarket versus OEM split, given the very big orders you've had over the last few quarters, do you expect that percentage of aftermarket sales to drift lower as you step up deliveries, or you think you can keep that fairly stable? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>Then looking at your comments, it seems like the order growth in gas and process is still much faster within equipment than, say, standard industrial compressors. Does that mean we should expect a kind of weaker mix in &#x2013; within equipment going forward from this point forward as well, or is that stable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will talk a bit and then Hans-Ola, maybe you can elaborate more a bit <mark type="ph" /> say the mix (42:16) mix. But when to take the mix effect in CT really, you know you don't have it at such under control that you said you want to exact sell as much aftermarket as equipment, so I try to sell as much as possible, because it is fantastic. The more equipment we can put in the field, the higher our market share, the more I think &#x2013; later on the harvest comes afterwards and that is the whole message and mission to all people working in whole Atlas Copco, not only in CT, to do that. But we see still a good solid development and growth in the aftermarket in CT. So I'm not worried about that at all, that that is not coming. Yeah, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you see it, if you talk relative terms or money terms, the equipment grows a bit faster <mark type="ph" /> yeah, (43:14) then you get a bit shift of mix on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to gas and process, I'm very pleased to see that we get very good order income from gas and process. So it's mainly fuel gas boosters, LNG, air separation, these &#x2013; there is a lot of investments going on. And I'm very pleased that we are successful to grab some of these. In relative terms, yeah, again, it affects maybe a bit the profitability, but I think we should work hard on efficiency. We should make sure that these latest acquisitions contribute, and that is what the people in CT need to do. So, they need to work harder on efficiency, that is, investment in <mark type="ph" /> the CT industry to give (44:02) return and that is the mission I gave them. Maybe you can?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, you've said it all. I think it's &#x2013; specifically on the gas and process, it's not the first cycle we have seen when the gas and process orders are stronger, perhaps, for a certain period of time. We had that a couple of years ago, and we've had it before that and it's &#x2013; of course, it's giving very, very nice contribution to value and to volume. Your question was, of course, about the margin; I understand that. But, nevertheless, I think that it's not just one thing that happens. So, if the percentage of larger, more engineered equipment is stronger in one of the coming quarters then, of course, we expect &#x2013; as Ronnie said &#x2013; that there are other things that also improve in the same way. So, it's not that we are worried about, let's say, the profit margin on a more sustainable basis going forward, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a very quick follow-up on that Hans-Ola, you had a period, I think, where gas and process orders were weaker. You'd added some new capacity in China, I think. Just say, where within that segment, utilization levels are &#x2013; and margins, if you can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I can take that. When it comes &#x2013; I think the utilization, as such, is not affecting so much the profitability, Ben. You should &#x2013; it's not a very &#x2013; it is a very asset-light setup. It's a bit depending on what type of orders get &#x2013; mix because some segments are more profitable than orders. But, it is really &#x2013; and, of course, I will not go to say what the profitability is of the division, but it's a real strong value creator in this business. Because it's rather an asset-light business because we get, first, like I said, in fixed assets, low investment because that factory, what we build there, remember I said that one, I think, was &#x20AC;10 million so it is not big one. Second, in that business you also get down payments, so you get really prepaid. So, it is rather &#x2013; from a balance sheet point of view, it is a very attractive business for us to create value. And &#x2013; but it has &#x2013; in EBIT terms, it has a lower profitability than an oil-free compressor or whatever.</p>

          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of James Moore from Redburn. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. It's James at Redburn. I have got a few questions. On the mining business, on the 22% order growth, I wondered if you could give us a percentage excluding the large orders; I'm trying to get back to the base picture there. And, you talked about maybe being a bit cautious last quarter, Ronnie, and I didn't really get what you were trying to say in terms of the near-term outlook for the percentage picture going forward. Are you cautious again, or are you now a bit more hopeful?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I could ask about the Industrial Technique business, you're seeing good volumes around the world. Are you seeing some good volumes in Europe, particularly due to the modularization that's going on in companies like VW at the moment? And then thirdly, on Compressor Technique, thank you for all the help on the lower incremental margin. I just want to get a sanity check that we are not seeing any supply-side dynamic change here with the price versus the cost, and some impact from the Chinese or others in the compressor market, or any change in behavior from Kaishan or others. Any comments you can make on that net pricing in CT would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first kill that last one and then <mark type="ph" /> thankfully not (48:09) not that &#x2013; I think there is always some competition going on. But, it's not that we can justify or <mark type="ph" /> focus (48:20) out that you say the margin is a bit lower due to high cost increases and all that. I think it will be incorrect information. We still see a good positive development on pricing and I mentioned also when I was looking to <mark type="ph" /> the pitch (48:36). I see that the innovation in new products coming and you look &#x2013; one of the outlines on the compressor of Ceccato is a new compressor that has a very good layout, a good cost structure and I think it really has &#x2013; it's a very strong value proposition to sell for a good price. So that &#x2013; no, I have not seen that. It can always happen in the years to come, but for the time being I should say, no, forget it.</p>
          <p>Then on mining, yeah, I can understand that on one hand, I think you start to know me a bit. I'm rather cautious all the time and &#x2013; in this case but on the other hand, also very hopeful that &#x2013; and never satisfied on this. We go after orders. There are extremely large orders. I think the ones &#x2013; we announced one in &#x2013; yeah, this one in South Africa, we did that. I think &#x2013; the big ones we announce, so we only have seen one. So that is the only big one we <mark type="ph" /> really had there (49:55). The rest are really solid. Yeah, good orders coming in, in &#x2013; all over. I talked already about China as the mining. I think I talked to you about Chile. I talked to you about Peru, West Africa, Russia. So, it's all over. Sweden, we should not forget, because I think <mark type="ph" /> it's strong for us (50:20). We see a good development of the mining. And when I listen and call a little bit around with people, customers, and all the people who have an insight, I believe we should continue to expect good ordering in the mining business. And that is also supporting our outlook in that case.</p>
          <p>Then on IP, yeah, you were spot on. It &#x2013; the upside is a lot driven from new models. I was, myself, traveling a couple weeks ago in Germany, visiting a couple of companies in the automotive, and you see it is really for new models, new challenges in productivity, right material. We did this acquisition a couple months ago, which we believe is one of the future strategies for growth, so that helps us. So, we also create a bit our market, besides that there is a good demand for new models.</p>

          <p>So, the final question comes from the line of Colin Gibson from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Yes, I'll try and squeeze in two, if I'm lucky, and you can get away with short answers if you like. I wanted to circle back on a couple of things that you've mentioned already. First of all, pricing; if we look at pricing, it stayed very stable in year-on-year terms, up a couple of percentage points for the last few quarters and that's despite, I suppose, the move out of a very cost inflationary environment, into an environment with much more cost stability, I suppose. Maybe you could just explain that a little bit and just reiterate what you see as the outlook for price increases as you go through the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, again, just coming back to something that you mentioned already, competition in China, but this time thinking more about off-road equipment. What we've seen in the wider off-road market is that the brands that have been taking share are the lower price domestic brands and the expensive imported machinery has been losing share. Do you see any similar trends in the kind of products that you're active in? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Colin, thanks for the question. I think I will take the last one first. When it comes to competition and, of course, the off-road equipment, I can only talk about that &#x2013; about Dynapac, and then I can maybe elaborate a bit when it comes to construction &#x2013; in the other construction where we are operating. But what I see in China is &#x2013; and that's definitely also what we try to do and &#x2013; it's beside our premium product, where we say the best product, the lowest lifecycle cost, the one we sell under the brand Atlas Copco, the best in the world, we also have seen that you need a second offer and that <mark type="ph" /> means (53:51) to say the value offer, the value segment, and that is where we are really coming head-to-head &#x2013; where we have a chance &#x2013; head-to-head to other players and then you can say, like you call it the Chinese player, and that's also what we do and that is also the reason why we have invested a lot the last two, three years in engineering, in any marketing in China, to really make sure we also have a second offer beside our premium offer, the value offer. And that is where I believe we need to play with and to make sure that we also get a fair share of this big market called China.</p>
          <p>Then on pricing, yeah, you know we have never been this, say, crazy price increases with plus six, plus seven, because I don't believe in that because that does not create a good relation with your customers. We continuously do price management; that would also be some time that we lower the prices when we see that it has to be done, but when you read our pricing bridge you should of course always thinking that 40% of our businesses is aftermarket. And aftermarket is as a bit of another pricing dynamic than equipment. So aftermarket partly is also inflation-driven because you have a lot of <mark type="ph" /> arms and legs (55:32) which you really have in your business. You have service contracts with price management related to indexes and then equipment is more driven by innovation, trying to get better lifecycle cost for your customers and of course it's also driven a bit with competition, but as I think one end I've answered that when I answered the question on China. So that is on pricing.</p>
          <p>And on cost, the cost is besides, if iron or copper goes up, of course our products go up. But on the other hand we try with innovation not only to innovate for efficiency, but also we try to innovate for cost. So we need to beat the cost inflation and that is the whole, yeah, the continuous battlefield we have to play. I believe for the time being we are able to manage that.</p>
