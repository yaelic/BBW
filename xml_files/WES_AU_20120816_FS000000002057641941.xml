        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to the Wesfarmers 2012 Full Year Results Briefing. Your lines will be muted during the briefing. However, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterward and instructions will be provided on how to do so at that time. This call is also being webcast live on the Wesfarmers' website and can be accessed from the homepage of wesfarmers.com.au.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you and good afternoon to everyone if you're on the East Coast. Good morning, if you're still on the West Coast and welcome to our 2012 full year results briefing. I'm going to kick off by covering some of the performance highlights of the Group. That'll be followed by each of the Group divisional managing directors, who'll provide a performance summary and outlook for their respective divisions. Terry Bowen will then provide commentary on the performance of our other businesses and capital management and then I'll conclude this part of the briefing by giving an outlook for the Group. And then, we'll have plenty of time for questions at the end of the formal briefing.</p>
          <p>So, I'm now going to just talk to the highlights, so starting on slide four. Overall, we're pleased with the result for the Group for this financial year. All divisions recorded increased earnings on an underlying basis and with a number of divisions recording record profit results. As you will have seen, net profit after tax is up 10.6% to just over $2.1 billion, driven by good revenue growth of 5.8% and improved operating efficiencies. The strong growth in operating cash flows of nearly 25% to over $3.6 billion reflected the cash generative nature of our businesses and a continued focus on working capital.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing organic investments driving business transformations, our retail portfolio and production capacity expansions and our Resources businesses grew net capital expenditure to $2.35 billion. And despite this CapEx, our free cash flows increased to pleasing 41% to nearly $1.5 billion. And the board today declared a fully-franked final dividend of $0.95 per share, up 11.8% on last year full year dividend, therefore being $1.65 per share.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to slide five, in terms of highlights, we achieved strong growth in our retail earnings. In what's a challenging external environment, we think that's a really good outcome. Coles continues to transform its offer and business. And our focus on providing value to customers, innovating our customer offer and improving the store network will continue, and Ian will talk to this shortly.</p>
          <p>The growth in earnings at Coles of over 16% following earnings growth last year of around 21% is again pleasing. We believe that opportunities for the Coles business will continue well beyond the five-year turnaround performance. Bunnings achieved another good result. It's continuing to deliver improvements in range, customer service, value in the store network, and John will talk to that shortly.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the Kmart result. The strategy of driving low prices through business efficiencies and better product sourcing and stock management continues to resonate really well with our customers.</p>
          <p>We saw strong transaction growth at Officeworks, which offset heavy deflation and generally tight trading conditions. And although Target's earnings were in line with last year, we had a stronger second half after you exclude the one-off restructuring provision. Dene will provide more detail later regarding the progress of the transformation plans there.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen some commentary on the Insurance division results. The underwriting results were obviously impacted by increasing our reserve estimates in this half in respect of the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, but the underlying result in underwriting showed a good improvement as did our broking earnings.</p>
          <p>We completed the mine expansions at both Curragh and Bengalla and with higher export coal prices and increased production had increased revenue in our Resource division, partially offset by some one-off costs in increased royalties.</p>
          <p>And finally, the continued demand for industrial and chemical products and the strong operating performance in our Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers and Industrial and Safety divisions supported good earnings results. And Terry will talk about other.</p>
          <p>Slide six really has the Group performance summary and I'm not going to talk in any detail, but happy to take questions later on. And on slide seven, you've got the divisional earnings this year compared to last year and each of the divisional managing directors will talk to that.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, in terms of return on capital, we retained and maintained a very strong focus on return on capital throughout the Group. Some divisional returns reduced during the year, but this is a function of investment in key growth platforms, such as retail store networks, including the requirement to invest in property assets, given the current property development environment. And also, our production capacity increases at Curragh, Bengalla and starting this year at Kwinana, which will obviously continue more strongly next year in our Chemicals business.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to spend much time on the strategic growth initiatives, because on slides nine and 10, the managing directors will talk about that. And in terms of outlook, I'll talk later to that.</p>
          <p>Finally, at a Group level, we continue to invest in and strengthening our human resource capability, which I believe is a critical core competency of the Group. And our balance sheet's strength and improvements in capital efficiency afford the Group the opportunity to invest and we continue to maintain a very strong focus on delivering satisfactory returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll now hand over to Ian McLeod, who will talk about Coles.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. And just starting on slide 12, I'm pleased to report that Coles revenue for the year increased by 6.4% to $34.1 billion, a $2 billion increase in the last year. Earnings before interest and tax increased 2.5 times faster than revenue, up 16.3% to almost $1.4 billion. These results are underpinned by internal efficiency improvements that have built a savings pool for reinvestment in the business, as well as improved returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our food and liquor business has grown strongly and profitably with sales revenue up 5.3% (sic) [5.1%] (7:03) to $26.6 billion, and EBIT margin up 33 basis points to 4.5% (sic) [4.6%] (7:09). While comparable store sales at 3.7% growth is lower than the prior year, after adjusting for a deflation, underlying volume growth has remained strong.</p>
          <p>Our convenience business, Coles Express, also continues to produce solid results, with sales revenue up 11.3% through a combination of an improved sales mix, stronger volumes and more sales. Coles Express also recorded solid comparable fuel volumes of 2.8% as customers responded positively to our improved fuel offer. These figures continue to demonstrate the sustained improvement in performance in Coles over the last four years. I'll now turn to slide 13.</p>
          <p>It's easy to forget how bad Coles was four years ago. Stores were in a poor state. Fresh quality was poor. Food inflation the norm and we lacked a cohesive strategy. Customers were leaving us every week and morale was low. Through the hard work and effort of over 200,000 team members backed by over $3 billion of financial investment, we succeeded in improving our position, attracting additional 4 million customer transactions a week, consistently growing volumes and sales densities, as well as growing EBIT by 20% on a compound basis during the period and delivering a 360 basis point improvement in return on capital.</p>
          <p>Our comparable store sales growth has outperformed the market now for 14 consecutive quarters. Naturally, such improvements from such a challenging start are pleasing, but we are the first to recognize that there's still more to do.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 14. This slide was first shown at the Wesfarmers Briefing Day in May this year. It recognizes that we are now in the final phase of the initial five-year plan, having built what we believe to be a solid platform for Coles. This slide demonstrates our strategic intent for the future.</p>
          <p>Our focus in quality service and value will remain the bedrock of our strategy. But we'll continue to innovate in categories, in formats and in technology in recognition to the changing needs of our customers. I will now talk in a bit more detail around these future growth strategies</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 15. My first day at Coles coincided with our appearance before the competition inquiry into food pricing by the major supermarkets. It was clear to us that investing lower prices was pivotal to a successful turnaround. Our Down Down pricing campaign has been very successful for us in attracting customers, particularly those families shopping on a budget and retaining them. Our price investment strategy has served us well as we restore customer trust and it will therefore continue.</p>
          <p>Our quality fresh food program has seen us make fundamental changes to our sourcing model, moving away from a broad-based transactional model to one which is more focused, collaborative and longer term. We now purchased over $3 billion more Australian fresh food than we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>Coles brand has changed dramatically with the appointment of food scientists and technologists to work with our suppliers on developing innovative products to bring to market. Over 1,000 new Coles brand products have been introduced this year, no artificial colors or flavors are added to any of them, and almost 90% of Coles brand products are sourced from Australia despite frequent rhetoric to the contrary. Mix clothing is now in more than 60 stores and also online with a new range of kidswear scheduled to be added in October.</p>
          <p>Financial services have proved to be a very successful new business with 400,000 customers and the re-launch of flybuys attracted an additional 2 million active users allowing us to tailor offers and services specifically to our customers' needs. It does not replace our price investment strategy, but becomes an integral and important part of it.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 16. Our ability to invest in price and continue to grow profit at the same time has been driven by a series of internal programs to improve efficiency. A considerable amount of success has been achieved by the diligent and focused effort of our store teams to not only serve our customers better, but work hard to improve store efficiency and productivity. Through strong focus on ordering, stock rotation, and replenishment effectiveness, waste management is now $400 million lower than it was in 2008 despite the significant increase in volumes per store.</p>
          <p>Easy Ordering on chilled products has also helped lower waste and mark down costs. And on grocery, we've seen improvements in productivity, working capital, and availability. We're confident that we can continue to make further improvements in these areas as well as extending Easy Ordering into other areas of fresh food. The Easy Warehousing initiative is also complete, giving access to greater demand planning, better supply communications and increased DC Productivity and improved transport optimization. We've made good progress with more expected.</p>
          <p>Where fresh product waste cannot be avoided and where such products remain fit for consumption, we have entered into a partnership with SecondBite, a charity which provides free meals to the disadvantaged. The SecondBite program is now in over 250 stores and has already provided over 800,000 meals to Australians who most need them.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 17. Our renewal program continues unabated with 27 new and extended stores added during the year, including two superstores in Melbourne and a further 81 existing stores were renewed during the period, bringing total renewal stores to 252. As we continue to optimize returns from our fleet, 11 stores were closed during the year, but our net selling area still grew by 2%. Our property pipeline continues to strengthen and we are therefore confident that our net selling area will continue to grow in excess of 2% per annum going forward.</p>
          <p>As in recent years, we expect around 100 renewals to land during FY 2013. We'll also look to develop and test market, new category concepts to keep the format fresh. We will continue to invest in our people across the store base and have over 1,000 graduates from our Retail Leaders Programme, seeking more and more to promote from within and provide clear opportunities for our team members.</p>
          <p>Our focus on people is paying dividends with a reduction in this year in lost time injuries and absenteeism at four-year low. Our service programs are also paying dividends with our customer surveys indicating our highest level of customer satisfaction so far, giving us encouragement in each of these areas to do even better.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 18. To paraphrase football commentators, Liquor has been a game of two halves. Growth in the liquor market remains pedestrian and our ability to trade effectively in the first half was heavily overshadowed by system disruptions creating a considerable shortfall in performance. The second half performance has been far more encouraging and we've maintained our market share year-on-year. We have taken steps to improve management capabilities under Tony Leon, which is focused on a full review of range in price architecture by brand, which is still underway.</p>
          <p>Initial changes implemented have included small box price investment to make shopping for convenience more appealing to customers and moving away from wholesaling in the 1st Choice outlets. These 1st Choice changes will have a short-term sales impact, but provide better balance to our business in being able to offer greater customer value and also improve our profit.</p>
          <p>We continue to restructure our portfolio by adding more Liquorland stores adjacent to supermarkets where needed, and withdrawing from uneconomic stores and heritage from previous management. In total, we closed 28 liquor stores during FY 2012. 1st Choice is an important part of our portfolio, but we'll open outlets where we believe we can generate a satisfactory return. We opened eight in the year bringing our total to 84. We clearly have more work to do and the liquor team are working to ensure the improving trend is maintained. While we are disappointed by our recent performance, liquor remains a relatively small element on our total food and liquor profitability.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 19. Coles Express continues to be a quite achiever in 2012 with an 11.3% increase in sales of $7.6 billion. Total fuel volumes increased by 3.5% with comparable volumes up 2.8% and EBIT increased to $124 million. Our V-Power campaign continues to grow consumer awareness of the performance improvement from premium fuels, benefiting both our volumes and our margin mix. In 2012, we continue to have tank, pump and price board replacement program. More than 200 sites have been improved so far with more to come in 2013, improving both product availability and customer service.</p>
          <p>Tighter economic conditions have impacted on consumers' propensity towards discretionary shop purchases, which has reduced sales, but work is taking place to revitalize our offer. We've now rolled out a new much-needed stores computer system to almost 200 sites during the year with a further 450 to be rolled out in 2013. The new system will enable Coles Express to offer a broader range of promotions to customers, speed up customer service and provide a platform for further ordering and rostering efficiencies.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 20. Coles has a range of multi-channel platforms already in place and we are continuing to add to our armory as technology improves and customer adoption increases. Coles Online continues to be the industry leader in online food retailing, with over 85% of the population now able to access deliveries.</p>
          <p>In the last few weeks, we've introduced a new transactional website for the 1st Choice Liquor offer with very encouraging results. We also landed our mix apparel online site during the year. And our Coles Insurance and Coles MasterCard online sites are underpinning substantial growth in these businesses.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, the re-launch of flybuys has increased our cardholder customers to more than 7 million. All of these service options allow us to better tailor offers to our customer needs, increasing their loyalty to and spend with Coles. In FY 2013, Coles expects to send more than 150 million personalized e-mails to our flybuys customer, deepening the relationship and dialogue we have with them.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 21. Our focus over the next 12 months is to ensure that we successfully complete the final phase of the turnaround, as well as further develop our additional programs for future growth. Our objective will therefore be to generate further internal savings to reinvest in growth, continue to enhance our value and quality credentials with our customers and <mark type="ph" /> progression yield (15:47) of the network to improve the customer shopping experience.</p>
          <p>It's also clear to us that further opportunities for growth are emerging and we intend to exploit them, particularly in relation to category development, Coles brand development, multi-channel integration and financial services.</p>
          <p>But like every other year since I've been at Coles, the next 12 months will always remain challenging. While we expect deflation to moderate, energy costs including the carbon tax will start to impact costs across the supply chain and the prospect of a federal election will add further to consumer uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, I believe that the last four years have built a stronger base for Coles to rise to these challenges and continue to deliver on our growth commitments.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to John Gillam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. If we move through to slide 24, I'll start there and comment on Bunnings. The Bunnings performance across the year was pleasing for three reasons. Firstly, we had good momentum within the business from our strategic agenda. Secondly, our longer term growth plans were well advanced. And thirdly, our day-to-day trading and financial results were solid. Revenue growth of 5.6% was healthy as was earnings growth of 4.9%.</p>
          <p>Return on capital at 25.9% remains industry-leading. The slight reduction in ROC from previous highs reflects the significant current CapEx spend underpinning future growth. As I flagged last year, our trading margin eased slightly, but it should be noted that at 11.6% this is above the levels we achieved in 2010 and 2009. We're disappointed with our safety results and corrective actions are reversing this trend as we speak.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 25, I'll discuss the performance in a little bit more detail. Across the year, we've continued our multi-pronged growth focus with significant efforts being made to improve the customer offer in value products, service and services. Customer feedback shows good responses to these improvements. And that's supported by the fact we grew transactions by 8.4% in the year.</p>
          <p>Given the macro trading environment, this is a healthy sign reflective of the drive within the business. The growth in commercial sales is also a good indicator of the traction we are getting in this area. Our work on improving the commercial offer is being rewarded with market share gains.</p>
          <p>In May 2010, we first talked publicly about our range reset project and I said at that time that this was the most significant merchandising work we've undertaken for a decade. That project has now been completed by our merchandising team and the in-store execution of the outcomes will finalize in two to three months time.</p>
          <p>The reset project outcomes exceeded our expectations with this work delivering large benefits to customers, suppliers and our business. Customers are receiving breathtaking value and de-cluttered and easy to shop ranges. We've freed up space for category expansion and that's a very important part of our growth agenda.</p>
          <p>Winning suppliers are enjoying productivity gains from volume uplifts. And Bunnings is now purchasing the world's leading and best brands at materially lower cost with enhanced training, innovation and marketing support. Network expansion and existing store reinvestment was a key work area with good progress being made in both near-term outcomes and longer-term growth positioning.</p>
          <p>During the year, we opened 16 new trading locations bringing our total openings over the past three years to 65. Initiatives delivering productivity gains across stock flow and core processes continued to good effect.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook for Bunnings, slide 26, we expect to deliver continued sales growth in both consumer and commercial areas. There are five clear growth opportunities before us and our strategic agenda and work plans target each of these. I outlined this in some detail in the May Investor Briefing Presentation.</p>
          <p>The plans being executed in the areas of service, merchandising and commercial in particular are very exciting. Work to sustain high engagement levels and high team retention is also providing good internal drive. Our property pipeline today sits at around 90 sites and is in great shape both in terms of depth and site quality. We expect to open around 20 new stores this year. In summary, Bunnings today is better positioned than it was a year ago and we expect to perform well in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Officeworks, slide 27, the trading revenues for the year just exceeded last year at the headline level, as Richard pointed out. Good progress across a number of areas resulted in earnings lifting by 6.3%. EBIT margin continued to improve as did return on capital.</p>
          <p>There's been a lot of commentary on adverse macro trading conditions. The medium and smaller business sector, which is such an important area for Officeworks has been under a lot of pressure, and given that backdrop, the positive performance is pleasing.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 28 and looking at the highlights, good merchandising and operational work drove strong growth in transactions and customer participation across the store. This offset the drag from deflation, which was particularly high in the tech and furniture categories.</p>
          <p>Officeworks across the last four years has build a terrific integrated offer across every channel, which allowed total store sales to hold at prior year levels, whilst online sales grew strongly. Total online sales for the year were close to $150 million and that level continues to push up.</p>
          <p>Improved margin performance coupled with disciplined cost control helped generate earnings growth. During the year, six new Officeworks stores were opened and reinvestment in existing stores continued. Other good achievements include delivering more Web and mobile enhancements, the expansion of both the product and services range and further investment in customer service initiatives.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 29, the outlook for Officeworks is for more moderate sales growth in 2012, 2013 and we expect to face continued pressure on sales and margins. Mark Ward and the Officeworks team are focused on driving earnings growth and returns through good execution of their strategic agenda. Enhancing the consumer and business-to-business offer to grow sales across every channel is very much at the forefront of that strategy. More investment to expand and refresh the store network will occur with around a dozen stores planned to open in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Dene Rogers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, John. Hi, everyone. It's Dene Rogers from Target. Just commenting on the performance table on page 31, just for a second. So revenue was down 1.2%, comparative same store sales were down 2.1%. There are probably three fairly valid reasons why that was the case. One was that throughout the year, we operated with inventory levels of around 10%, at least 10% less than prior year. That resulted in an increase in capital, reduction in working capital.</p>
          <p>Second reason was that we reduced promotional depth and we reduced the amount of product we sold below cost. That improved margins, but it did affect sales. And then in a couple of categories, we did see price deflation.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter though, sales were up and that was primarily due to two reasons; one being that we advanced the toy sale through to June 21, so we had 10 additional days of toy sale in fiscal 2012 versus the prior year. And the second reason was that we saw a beneficial effect from the carbon tax disbursements from the federal government.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, margin improved in the second half in particular, that was through controlling promotional depths, assessing price elasticities, as well as selling less product below cost. So EBIT for the year, as Richard mentioned, was up slightly versus fiscal 2011, excluding provision for restructuring. EBIT margin was up about 20 basis points to 7.6% and return on capital up about 10 basis points to 9.8%.</p>
          <p>As we notified the market in June, we did provide for restructuring charges, primarily related to the very broad range of activities related to our supply chain in the amount of $40 million. I would also add that throughout 2012, in particular, the second half of 2012, we did invest in the business. So our cost of doing business increased quite markedly. And that money was spent on marketing, on online infrastructure and capabilities, as well as other transformation activities.</p>
          <p>Just turning to slide 32 and talking about the transformation, the four year transformation that we're underway. We are redefining value to comprise a quality, style and experience at the lowest price. We see this strategy as being practical in terms of where our competitors sit, but we also see as very complementary to the Kmart strategy, where they're providing great quality at the absolute lowest price.</p>
          <p>And just touching on those elements of defining value. In terms of quality, we launched the Target Tested marketing campaign, which was to talk to our customers about the additional quality that we're putting into our products. We also took steps to improve quality aspects of our offering. And so we conducted a national sizing survey, where we sized literally thousands of Australians to make sure that our products fits them, our apparel fits them.</p>
          <p>And then we also launched the Target Essentials in a big way. And that's growing quite significantly with margins in excess of 50%. Then in terms of style, we're working vigorously to reengineer our merchandising processes. And we're looking to make sure that we're on trends, we've got the right styles and the full ranges of styles in our stores, as well as relaunching of Designer for Target programme. So in October, we'll be launching Roberto Cavalli product.</p>
          <p>And then talking about experiences for a second, we're launching shoe fitting. We also rolled out bra fitting and then generally, in our stores, looking to improve the fashionability of the experience by offering in-store guidance to customers about how to create outfits that suit them.</p>
          <p>And then, some of the key enablers of transformation include our online business, which is growing at over 20% per month. We had about 33,000 skews growing to 60,000. And then more recently, we offered free Click + Collect in store as an example of some of the service improvements that we're offering.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of our IT, we've been investing in our supply chain related IT, moving to a pool replenishment, also our product life cycle and merchandising process is critical to sustainable growth for the company. And then supply chain is also a major focus. We're implementing our blueprint, which consists of regional distribution centers, shorter lead times. We're also looking to maintain our inventory levels to their current level, but increase the productivity via higher in-stocks. And then, as we have mentioned before, there's a big focus on increasing direct sourcing.</p>
          <p>And then the fourth enabler, our people in stores. And so it's been a prioritization of gaining customer insights to guide our marketing and product decisions, also the building of certain capabilities internally, including visual merchandising, which will reposition the company to be able to occupy the mid-tier department store position.</p>
          <p>And then, we've also had a focus on marketing and reducing our reliance upon the catalogue. And finally, I would say that we're focused on making sure that our real estate investments are in locations that are sustainable and we're able to build 12 new stores through fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>Just turning to page 33, talking about fiscal 2013. We'll continue to focus on promotional depth, move to more of an EDLP and EDVP pricing model. We'll continue to focus on direct sourcing, markdown control, as well as growing Target Essentials.</p>
          <p>And then, the final area would be to, as we reengineer our supply chain, look to move store payroll into selling activities versus our inventory management. Then, finally, we will continue to spend and invest money in upgrading our IT systems, which will improve our capabilities, as well as build 10 new stores and replace four stores.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to hand on to Guy Russo.</p>
          <p>[07WHQY-E Guy Russo]</p>
          <p>Thanks very much, Dene, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to run you through the Kmart performance summary and also give you some insights into the main highlights for the year and where we see our Kmart journey progressing in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p>So we move to slide 35, Kmart's revenue for the year was $4 billion with comparable sales in line with last year. EBIT grew to $266 million, which was an increase of $65 million, or a 32.3% increase over last year. EBIT margin at 6.6% increased to 160 basis points. Return on capital of 18.7% was up 370 basis points on last year. We're also very disappointed with our safety results, which we will continue to work on in the coming months.</p>
          <p>If you can move to slide 36. The strong EBIT growth was achieved through my great team across Australia, New Zealand and Asia, and their focus on improvement in margin, largely enabled by our progress with direct sourcing and reduced markdowns. Our everyday range is performing very well, which in turn has allowed us to improve our inventory management and enhanced our working capital performance.</p>
          <p>Throughout the year, Kmart continued to connect with Australian and New Zealand families through a commitment to provide everyday items for families at the lowest possible price. We have now achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of growth in customer transactions and units sold. The Lower than Ever price drop campaign was also launched during the year to highlight many items, which have dropped to even lower prices. We will continue to do this to ensure we sell everyday items for families at the lowest possible price.</p>
          <p>More recently, the Price Sculpture campaign was launched to emphasize that Kmart offers low prices across the entire range. Our research tells us we are seen as the lowest price DDS, which confirms our price offering is resonating with consumers. Our investment in the business continues with six Kmart stores refurbished during the year, 238 Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto stores are now re-imaged with the new Kmart and Tyre Auto design format.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 37 on outlook. So as we look forward our vision remains where families come first for the lowest price on everyday items. To grow the Kmart business, we will continue to lead on price and drive prices down for Australian and New Zealand families, continue to source more products directly to keep costs down, continue to improve the flow of stock and availability and continue to refresh our stores and open new sites.</p>
          <p>We will also connect more customers with the new Kmart, communicate the price and value message, and of course, serve customers with our helpful team members with fast and friendly service, always focused on team safety. We've dropped our prices and we'll continue to drop our prices to ensure we sell what customers need, everyday items for families and quality products sourced ethically at the lowest prices. We truly want to make customers' lives easier by saving their money.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time and I'm now happy to hand over to Rob Scott.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Guy. I'll start with the performance summary on slide 39. Revenue for the year increased by 10.1% to $1.9 billion. Reported EBITA was $17 million, which includes the $108 million charge associated with higher earthquake claims reserves. After adjusting for this charge, EBITA improved to $125 million. Excluding earthquake reserves, earnings in the second half increased from an EBIT of $48 million in the first half to $77 million in the second half. And this highlights a strong underlying improvement through the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next page. Broking operations achieved strong growth with earnings up by 27.4%. This was achieved through bolt-on acquisitions, new business wins, and improved premium rates. Excluding acquisitions, organic earnings growth for broking was around 10%. The operating margins strengthened to just under 30%.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned last year, 2012 financial year was a transitional year for underwriters as we adjusted premium rates to offset the very substantial increase in re-insurance cost last year. We were pleased with the rate increases we achieved across the portfolio of 8.4% in Australia and 10.9% in New Zealand, which sets us up well for the year ahead. These premium rate increases and growth in personal lines more than offset premium we let go as we reduced our exposure to high-hazard areas.</p>
          <p>Two factors that impacted underwriting earnings through the year were severe weather events and lower discount rates. Claims from severe weather events were $32 million above allowances and this related to the Melbourne hailstorm, WA bushfires and storms and losses in relation to crop insurance. And the impact of lower discount rates on valuations was $23 million.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 41. Consistent with other insurers, we have provided more disclosure on the key drivers of our underlying underwriting performance. The first three points on this slide I've already highlighted, being the impact of earthquake reserves, cat events above allowances and lower discount rates. We've also incurred increases in claims reserves for builders warranty insurance, which is a long tail class of business we ceased writing a number of years ago.</p>
          <p>We've also separated out the benefit we achieved in the liability adequacy test. This release is evidence of improved performance across the portfolio and the benefit of premium rate increases. We have also identified the increase in reinsurance costs that was incurred through the year. The underlying combined operating ratio of 96% represents an improvement in performance for what is predominantly a short-tail portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the next page, I'll now discuss the Earthquake 2 reserve increases. I discussed this in some detail at our recent briefing day and I refer you to those slides for more information. During the second half of this financial year, we had the benefit of new information relating to land zonings and requirements for rebuilding. We have also been able to undertake detailed scopes of work for all domestic and commercial claims, which in total represented over 14,000 claims.</p>
          <p>Allowing for this information, we increased our reserves on a full-year basis by $108 million. For those that have followed the insurance industry's response to the Christchurch earthquake, you will know that the significant uncertainties and complexities have led all major insurers in New Zealand to increase claims reserves on a number of occasions since February 2011.</p>
          <p>In undertaking our valuation, we've sought to address the uncertainties through providing $100 million margin above our current claims estimates. We believe this is a conservative allowance. We have also reduced the go-forward risk from earthquakes, while increasing our reinsurance limit to A$950 million, reducing exposures to Christchurch and changing underwriting criteria and policy wordings.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to outlook. Despite the disappointing impact of earthquake reserves, we finished the year with improvements in underlying performance, which set us up well for 2013 financial year. We expect to generate further growth in our broking operations in personal lines and through ongoing efficiency initiatives. The premium rate increases is starting to flow through the earned premiums, especially in New Zealand. We were pleased with the outcome of our reinsurance renewal on the first of July, which resulted in modest increases in catastrophe reinsurance costs, whilst maintaining retention levels. We have changed our surplus property program to a risk excess arrangement that we expect to deliver savings going forward.</p>
          <p>Having worked through what would be considered a once-in-a-generation series of events in the last two years, we are now confident that our business is well positioned to deliver stronger result in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Stewart.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll refer you to slide 45, Resources performance summary. Operating revenue at $2.13 billion was 20% up on last year. The major factors for the increased revenue are strong export prices in the first half and higher sales volumes in the second half from both the Curragh and Bengalla mines as mine expansions were completed.</p>
          <p>Royalties for the full year at $368 million were up $139 million, or 60% on last year. First State and Stanwell royalties were significantly increased due to higher coal prices for the year. The Stanwell royalty at $219 million was up $106 million on last year. Mining and other costs were higher than last year due to once-off cost of $55 million associated with final flood recovery at Curragh in the first half and cost associated with increased production following the successful completion of mine expansions. Earnings before interest and tax of $439 million is 19% up on last year. Our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for the division was similar to last year despite increased activity associated with expansion works.</p>
          <p>I'll now refer you to slide 46, Resources highlights. Highlights for the year included following continued focus on safety performance, the total recordable injury frequency rate at Curragh reduced by 42% during the year from 30.8% in FY 2011 to 18.8% in FY 2012.</p>
          <p>Project completion of the $286 million Curragh mine expansion, increasing export metallurgical coal to 8.5 million tonnes, was achieved during the last quarter of FY 2012. The project was completed within budget. As a result, fourth quarter production and sales volumes were a record for the mine. The Bengalla Stage 1 expansion to 9.3 million tonnes of ROM coal, or 7.5 million tonnes of product, was successfully completed on time and within budget.</p>
          <p>Curragh's mine cash costs, pleasingly, for the second half of FY 2012 was 20% lower than the first half, reflecting the successful commissioning of the new coal handling and preparation plant and ongoing focus on tight cost control. Our new EBA was successfully negotiated with Curragh employees with no interruptions to mining operations.</p>
          <p>Just go forward to slide 47, Resources outlook. The export market continues to be impacted by uncertain economic conditions in Europe and slowing growth in China. Global steel demand is slowing. The spot market for metallurgical coal has fallen in recent weeks by approximately 20% of current quarterly prices.</p>
          <p>The lowest spot price of metallurgical coal and the higher Australian dollar will result in i.e. less favorable short-term outlook. The outlook for FY 2013 is as follows. Curragh's metallurgical coal sales is forecast to be in the range of 8 million to 8.5 million tonnes for the year, subject to mine operating performance and infrastructure constraints. Sales mix is estimated to be 46% hard coking coal, 22% semi-hard and 32% PCI. The Stanwell royalty is expected to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. Carbon tax will be in the range of $20 million to $25 million and Curragh is not expected to pay MRRT in FY 2013.</p>
          <p>Feasibility studies for next-stage expansions continue. Timing on next-stage expansions will be dependent on satisfactory returns from current expansions and prevailing market conditions.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Tom O'Leary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stewart. Looking now at Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers on slide 49 and starting with safety at the foot of the slide, it's disappointing to report an increase in the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate despite the continued investment and efforts made during the year. We continue to work to improve workplace safety, including dedicating more resources to safety across all of our businesses, and looking for different ways to ensure that safety is front of mind for our people.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial performance, earnings decreased nearly 9% to $258 million compared to last year's result, but that had included $42 million in insurance process from Varanus Island gas disruption. Excluding that Varanus impact, divisional earnings were up 7% on the previous period. The improvement in underlying performance was driven by strong results from the Chemicals and Fertilisers businesses that offset the reduction we had foreshadowed in Kleenheat earnings. The result was also affected by the continuing external pressures on our Australian Vinyls business and the exclusion of contributions from the enGen business and the Bangladesh LPG joint venture that was sold during the year. The gains on disposal of those businesses are excluded from the divisional result and the report is non-trading items.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights on slide 50. Construction of the ammonium nitrate expansion at Kwinana is well underway, following an approval of the $550 million investment in December last year. The earthworks for the construction are now largely finished, with civil works and onsite fabrication of the nitric acid tank well underway.</p>
          <p>Delivery of all long lead items is on schedule with the first of them, the boiler, due in Kwinana in October. At an operational level, our chemicals businesses have benefited from really good production performances delivering a 4.6% increase in sales volumes despite having plant shutdowns in the ammonia and QNP businesses during the year. This production outcome, combined with strong product pricing for ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and sodium cyanide resulted in higher earnings than last year.</p>
          <p>Economic conditions have remained challenging for Australian Vinyls during the year with continued higher input costs exacerbated by a strong Australian dollar. In Kleenheat, LPG production was 7% lower than last year because of further declines in LPG content in the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline. As anticipated, earnings from Kleenheat were lower as a consequence of that lower content and the impact of increased gas prices and transport costs on production economics.</p>
          <p>Fertiliser earnings were ahead of last year with a 10% increase in sales volumes following good seasonal conditions and strong uptake of early orders in the first half of the financial year. The divisional result also benefited from a one-off positive earnings impact of $9 million resulting from the termination of an industrial gas supply agreement with HIsmelt in Western Australia following the closure of the HIsmelt operation.</p>
          <p>Turning to outlook on 51. The ammonium nitrate expansion is a key focus for the division over the coming period and remains on track to be operational during the first half of the 2014 calendar year. As I mentioned at the briefing day in May, we're finalizing detailed engineering designs and further debottlenecking of our sodium cyanide plants and I expect to seek approval for that project over the next few months. The project is expected to cost around $15 million and increased production capacity by up to 20%.</p>
          <p>In our ammonia business, we're in the process of moving our supply agreements to import parity pricing, so over time our ammonia earnings will become increasingly dependent on international ammonia pricing.</p>
          <p>Our businesses exposed to the local resources sector expected to continue to benefit from strong demand in the year ahead. But it's worth noting that we have planned shutdowns in our ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanide businesses during the year. And that will affect production volumes and earnings.</p>
          <p>Kleenheat's earnings will remain dependent on LPG content and international LPG pricing with both those drivers remaining challenging. Fertilisers have seen a good start for the 2012 season, although earnings will as always be dependent on the seasonal break in the second half as well as farmers' terms of trade.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Olivier Chretien.</p>

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. I will now cover the Industrial and Safety division. As you can see on slide 53, the division delivered a strong result for the year. Operating revenues were up 8.5% to $1.7 billion. Earnings before interest and tax grew to $190 million, an increase of 14.5%. Return on capital increased from 13.1% to 16% and we had a stable safety performance.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the key highlights for the year on slide 54. The division benefited from solid activity in the resources and engineering construction sectors, as well as continued improvement in business operations. Overall, we continue to increase our share of spend from key customers.</p>
          <p>We achieved strong sales growth in most businesses, with the best results delivered by Blackwoods, Protector Alsafe and Bullivants. We also achieved good results this year in New Zealand following the merger of Blackwoods Paykels and Protector Safety. Our improved performance across the portfolio was underpinned by a strong focus on customer service and delivery performance. We upgraded a number of our business websites and continued investing in our eBusiness capability, increasing the proportion of customer's transactions online.</p>
          <p>We enhanced our strong supplier relationships, which together, with a range of value brands and global sourcing capabilities, enabled us to meet customer needs and to bring new product ranges to the market. We also increased our sales of value-add services.</p>
          <p>The earning results was supported by increasing operational efficiencies helping to offset competitive margin pressures. We continued to develop our branch networks, which you can refer to in the supplementary information pack. We opened five new branches in Blackwoods and Bullivants and a number of gas depots during the year while closing or merging 10 smaller underperforming locations, half of those in the Total Fasteners network following the restructure of that business.</p>
          <p>Blackwoods opened its first overseas branch in Indonesia migrating the division's international supply chain capabilities. Improvements in operational efficiencies, tight capital management and good cost control contributed to our return on capital improvement. And we also maintained a strong focus on attracting and developing a diverse group of people as well as safety and sustainability.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook for the Industrial and Safety division on slide 55. The division is well-placed to seize multiple opportunities and to leverage operational improvements that we implemented over recent years. We are increasing our customer-centric focus to broaden our service offering to customers. We continue to leverage major project activity and further diversify our industry and customer base. We'll also continue to improve productivity through technology investments and we are exploring a number of new growth platforms including for acquisition.</p>
          <p>The outlook remains positive, however, trading conditions are more challenging. Global uncertainty remains with a potential slowdown and the deferral of major projects. And we face ongoing labour availability and cost challenges as well as margin pressure.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand over to Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Olivier. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide an overview of the performance of the Group's other businesses and then cover off on the balance sheet, cash flow and capital management initiatives.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 57, the result from associates, you can see, was marginally lower than last year. We recorded a loss of $34 million in total and this was primarily as a result of a non-cash downward revaluation in the carrying value of Gresham Private Equity Funds. The downward revaluation was partially offset by a $16 million gain that we recorded in the Bunnings interest in BWP and also earnings of $5 million recorded for Wespine.</p>
          <p>Interest revenue, you can see, of $22 million for the year was down on last year and that really reflected lower levels of cash on deposit during the course of the year. Non-trading items recorded a net loss of $15 million for the year. As we communicated to the market in the first half, non-trading items included at that time $181 million non-cash write-down in the carrying value of Coregas. And this followed the decision by BlueScope Steel to significantly restructure its Port Kembla operations.</p>
          <p>Other non-trading items mainly offsetting this reflected portfolio and management decisions we made where we divested the Premier Coal mine, we divested the enGen Power business and we also divested our Boddington forestry assets in the first half and then we subsequently divested Bangladesh Gas business in the second half. In total, the proceeds from this activity was around $402 million and we booked a combined gain on sale of $166 million. In regards to the gain, we expect no tax to be payable on this as the Group had capital losses to offset it.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the table, you can see Other. And this result really reflects an improved performance in the Group's self-insurance programs, following the floods and other events of the previous year. And corporate costs, you can see were broadly in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to 58, you can see our operating cash flow performance for the Group. The cash realization ratio for the year of 117% was pleasingly well ahead of last year's performance. This result included an increase in operating cash flows across most divisions and also a improvement in working capital within that result. It resulted in a 24.8% improvement in operating cash flows to $3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 59, we're looking specifically at our working capital performance, net working capital increased across the Group by $104 million on last year, but this comprised a $63 million reduction in the working capital employed across the retail portfolio despite the business growth during &#x2013; in this area during year.</p>
          <p>A particular focus for our retailers was strong discipline in regards to inventory control and especially in seasonal lines and improving sourcing arrangements. And this was especially in imported products. The solid retail business performance was offset by an increase in working capital for the Group's Industrial businesses of $167 million, including Insurance. And this was largely associated with a higher receivables balance resulting from increased Curragh sales at year-end and also increased levels of insurance premium funding in our Insurance division. There's further information on working capital and key balance sheet movements on slide 47 and 48 in the supplementary pack and I'd refer you to this.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditure on slide 60. As we did during the first half results release and consistent with our approach to actively managing our freehold property across our businesses, we focus on net capital expenditure on this slide. And that includes both the purchase and sale of freehold property. Over the year, the Group continued its strong capital investment phase. We invested $2.351 billion in net capital investment and this was 27% ahead of the prior year.</p>
          <p>Net investment in land and building is largely related to the retail network improvements in Bunnings and Coles. And this totaled $574 million and was some $148 million higher than the same time last year. Included in this result is $275 million of cash proceeds that we got from the disposal of property, plant and equipment. Again, this largely related to property divestments by Coles and Bunnings and compared to $216 million of disposals in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Coles continued its store renewal program with the completion of 108 new renewal stores for the year and significant investments made in the fit-out of new, replaced, resized and refurbished stores. Other significant capital investments included the plant expansion works during the second half at Curragh and Bengalla, early expenditure related to the $550 million ammonium nitrate capacity expansion at Kwinana and investments in Kmart supply chain, energy efficiency initiatives across the Group ahead of the carbon tax.</p>
          <p>Looking towards the 2013 financial year, we anticipate net capital expenditure to be between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, but as always, as we mentioned, this will be dependent on freehold property activity over the course of that year.</p>
          <p>So, turning to slide 61. In regards to dividends as well as earnings and available franking credits, the Group considers the current liquidity position and the maintenance of our rating and through the cycle cash flows when we declare our dividend.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart on this slide, the Group's operating cash flows have over the last four years funded not only the organic investment activities in capital investment, but also the dividend payment growth over this time. And this is consistent with the Group's policy to provide stable and growing dividends over the time. Given the amount of capital investment undertake &#x2013; that we did take over this time, I think, is testament to the Group's cash-generative nature and the work that we've done in working capital improvements that we've been able to achieve this.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned earlier, this year the directors have declared a final dividend of $0.95 per share fully-franked, which represents an 11.8% increase on last year's final dividend. The full year dividend is therefore $1.65 per share and this represents an increase of 10% on last year. The record date for the final dividend will be the 27 of August and the dividend payable on the 28 of September.</p>
          <p>In line with recent practice, the Group will continue to provide shareholders with the option to participate in the dividend investment plan, no discount will apply to the allocation price and the program will not be underwritten. The required number of shares will be acquired on market and this will neutralize any dilutive effects of shares issued under the DIP.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 62 in the balance sheet. You can see it remains in a healthy position. Strong operating performance and debt management initiatives have resulted in further improvements in all of the Group's key liquidity ratios. And this is evidenced by fixed charges cover improving to 2.8 times and the cash interest cover now increasing to 10.8 times. Our ratings remain unchanged at A- stable with S&amp;P and Baa1, but importantly on a positive outlook with Moody's.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Group's debt profile on slide 63, the Group's gross debt at the end of the period was $5.5 billion and our net debt was $4.9 billion. The all in weighted average cost of debt for the year was 7.8%. And this represented a 96 basis point reduction on the cost of debt compared to the prior corresponding period. This decrease is reflective of the Group's successful refinancing initiatives together with the expiry of higher price swaps that were put in place prior to the GFC, but are now progressively rolling off.</p>
          <p>Looking towards the 2013 financial year, we expect the cost of debt to again fall by around a percentage point to circa 6.8%. During the year, the Group continued its proactive approach to diversify and extend our debt maturity profile. Despite ongoing market volatility in this area, debt investors' confidence in the Group businesses and balance sheet was reflected in the completion of two successful debt issuances in the financial year just closed. This issuances completed comprised of $500 million of five-year unsecured fixed rate medium notes that we issued in November 2011 and a further $500 million seven-year issuance that we did in March 2012.</p>
          <p>Also, as you'll note, after the balance date and in August 2012, we issued our first 10-year note successfully raising $764 million in the euro market under our euro and medium-term note program.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 64, you can see our average debt tenor is 3.8 years and is in very good shape. The chart at the left of the slide shows our relatively low level of debt repayment now due in any one year. And this reflects the achievement of a very good staggering of maturities. And the pie chart on the right-hand side shows the now broad diversification of our current sources of debt and shows that the bank facilities that we once had in place representing about 81% of our total Group debt in 2009, now represent about 21% of our total debt.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand back over to Richard.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Terry. I'll just make a couple of very quick comments on outlook. I think the divisional managing directors have spoken about each division. So, just a couple of comments, Wesfarmers is about creating value, which we're currently doing in our businesses and for our many millions of customers. We're also about providing increased opportunities for our employees and for our suppliers to innovate and grow with us as we invest in all our businesses. We're also pleased to contribute to the communities in which we operate through employment, tax payments, and the many other contributions we make.</p>
          <p>We increased employment across the Group by over 2,000 people, notwithstanding &#x2013; last year, notwithstanding the sale of Premier and enGen and the conversion of more casuals to permanent part-time, particularly at Coles.</p>
          <p>In regard to outlook, the Group's outlook remains positive, supported by solid strategic plans in place across the Group and with the Group's diversity continuing to provide benefits. Our primary objective is to provide satisfactory returns to shareholders. As Terry said, the cash generative nature of the Group's businesses, our balance sheet strength, the strong focus on return on capital, all continues to support the current investment program, which is expected to enhance future shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>And with that, we're happy to take any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. I've just got a couple of questions on property. Firstly, in Coles food and liquor, it seems that the property income's been rolled up in the number this time. I'm just wondering if you could provide that number to us, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it was 10 at the half and 25 at the full year in 2012, obviously, up on 2011. The major reason behind that is some really good work we've been doing in our property team to fill some vacancy rates that we've had and a bit of increase in freehold property as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then just a broader question across Coles food and liquor, but also Bunnings, could you talk about what the margin impact of owning more property in FY 2012 relative to FY 2011 would have been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have a kick off first from Bunnings, Michael. In terms of trading margin, none. It really goes to ROC. And I didn't include this time the graphs that I included maybe in the half and certainly in August last year and in last year's investor briefing that showed the ROC performance for Bunnings over time because it's quite incorrect to view the ROC decline in this year without the context of what we're doing, which is investing for future growth.</p>
          <p>And what we've shown is that when we've invested for future growth, either via acquisition or via investment in our fleet or both, we've managed to achieve that growth over time and we're very comfortable with that. We'll do so in the coming few years because what we're doing now is positioning us very, very well. But the financing of the property doesn't particularly impact our trading margins at all because we charge ourselves a market rent and that's what you see recorded in the P&amp;L that we're reporting at the trading margin level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that increase in property income for the division includes the &#x2013; well, refers to the additional rent payable at market rates on the additional property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Yes. Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in Coles, I think we wouldn't regard it as being material. It's really a function of need, I guess, as we're looking to expand and develop new sites, given the contraction in propensity for landlords to grow space. We've looked to try and fill the breach ourselves. And, obviously, when we're building our stores, we tend to build them with other specialties alongside as well, so we can offset any additional costs with your improvements in specialty rents, which we've actually been able to do quite successfully in the last 12 months by filling some vacancies that we had previously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just, sorry, to confirm, the property number that Terry just gave us, that only includes third-party property income rises, not inter-company rent on Coles stores. Is that number right?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Just a question for Ian. Just in terms of the Coles food and liquor business, obviously, comps deteriorated relative to the rates for the first half to second half, but your margin trends improved. They would have got improved fixed cost rationalization. I'm just wondering if you could give us a bit of a feel for where the margin guidance came from in terms of the gross margin level in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:29) like a 50%-50% split or something like that? And then, secondly, with the Easy Warehousing and Easy Ordering, did you see the benefits sort of progressively ramp up over the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't give an indication in terms of margin in that level of detail, but I think that we obviously worked quite hard in improving our margin by driving hard on our cost base as much as anything else. In terms of our comps, our underlying position in terms of volume has remained as strong as it was. In fact, if anything, it strengthened. And what we saw in the second half is a very significant increase in the level of deflation that emerged, partly driven by ourselves through our price investment program, but also what occurred through fruit and veg in particular. So, we probably expect that to moderate a little going forward, given what happened. But it's, obviously, very difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>But certainly, in terms of our underlying position, we see that as continuing where there are further opportunities to gain further savings within the business. And that will be shared between reinvesting in price and improving profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But did you say the benefits from Easy Ordering and Easy Warehousing, was that a ramp-up over the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I think that that continues to &#x2013; we saw improvements in working capital coming through, and I think that as we get Easy Ordering more progressively utilized within the chain and, obviously, now having Easy Warehousing, we can get better demand forecasts and demand planning getting through from the supply base right into our stores as well. So, we've seen that manifest itself in our stores.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of David Errington of Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard and Terry, this is a question probably directed to you two. When I look at this 2012 result, I mean, terrific result, but it was still littered by a large number of what you'd deem to be one-off items and some of those items you could call out would be; Target, $40 million; coal $55 million, because of the flood. I suppose coal dropped its hard coking coal content from high <mark type="ph" /> 40%s (64:41) to mid-to-high <mark type="ph" /> 30%s (64:42). Gresham, enough said on Gresham, that lost $60 million again. You had $100 million in Insurance. I mean, that's a fair whack of one-off items.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm trying to get my head around this. You're either very unlucky or you're in a situation where you're in the wrong businesses or things are just sneaking into the business portfolio that maybe &#x2013; I don't know, what it is. But I'd like to know what your comments are on those one-offs? And going forward into 2013, can we be confident that those items, which were nearly $300 million, they won't appear in 2013? So, the growth in 2013 earnings on 2012 earnings should be quite significant just by these non-recurring items not happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. So, a couple of comments. Firstly, I think, a group the size and the nature of Wesfarmers, you're going to get, from time to time, these things. And one of the reasons we call them out isn't to make an excuse. The reason we call them out is so that we can disclose them and you can deal with them however you like. In our reported numbers, they're in there and, as I say, we call them out. Going through them, most of them were non-cash, other than the Resources additional cost, which related to the floods in the previous year. The additional provisioning for earthquake for Christchurch is at this stage non-cash. And, as Rob indicated, we hope it is conservative, but I've got to say, we've only settled I think it's, Rob, less than 30% or around 30% of the claims we've got on Christchurch. So, there's still a degree of uncertainty as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The Target one, we did and Dene disclosed it at the Briefing Day earlier in the year, I mean we could have put it in their budget this year and just reported lower earnings this year. But again, we've got some restructuring work to do in --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this year an extraordinary year, Richard? Like these one-offs, the renewal, in your experience are these just normal one-off items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, see the other thing, David, is during the year, I mean, we've recorded cash profits on the sale of Premier and enGen. We've taken an impairment against the Coregas, which again, I think, is a relatively conservative impairment, non-cash. Unfortunately, these days you're going to get, I think &#x2013; you're always going to get some of those one-offs in a business like ours. I don't think &#x2013; the one that I would say was completely out of our control has been the New Zealand earthquake, and that's a 1 in 2,500-year event. And we and, I think, every other insurer thought we were well and truly covered for any foreseeable event and Christchurch has been extraordinary on that front. Other than that, these are things that come along from time to time and we disclose them. And Gresham is a mark-to-market and we're obviously not happy with having to report the earnings impact on Fund 2. We'll see how Fund 2 washes out when the sale of Witchery and other sales in Fund 2 occur into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, David. Can I just add on there? I mean, we do take the disclosure of the group, but I guess we try and set ourselves a high bar. And I think if you look at it, there was nothing in the front page of the 4E and indeed in the start where we effectively added everything together and said here's our impact and here's our underlying impact, which would have been a much bigger number based on some of what you've just raised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's around the commentary of what sits in the results, as Richard said. So, I think if we didn't give that, it would be wrong. And importantly, what we didn't do at the front is try and dress up our result differently to what the headline said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And following, Terry, why don't you capitalize the interest on your property? I mean, Woolworths does, I mean they have almost $100 million capitalized interest charge. Well, that's probably what it will be. You don't do that. Why don't you do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the audit standard is that if you &#x2013; effectively if you own it &#x2013; if you're building it for more than 12 months, if it goes on, then you need to capitalize interest. So, if you think about the AN3 expansion, we don't capitalize that for more than &#x2013; we will own &#x2013; we will be building that for more than 12 months, so there will be some capitalized interest come through. If we did a very big Coles freehold property, it might go for building more than 12 months, in which case, we'd do the same. That's the rating of the standard. If you want to say, well, vacant land is sitting there, waiting to be built on and take, perhaps, a more aggressive approach, then you could start capitalizing interest. But we don't read it that way and our auditors are comfortable with the way we're treating it. So, that's just what we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, can I add? I think we always take a conservative view on those things. For example, there will be some companies this year that may calculate their provisions against something other than the Commonwealth bond rate, because of the significant fall here, we've maintained that. We're not going to a blend of state-based rate. And that's a significant impact across the group this year of just under $100 million of increased provisioning just based on that calculation. We haven't, for example, taken up an asset around the MRRT, which we could have, but would have had to be unwound, because our best estimate is based on &#x2013; particularly, because we pay the Stanwell rebate, we won't be paying MRRT. So, I mean, in the way we report we do take a pretty conservative view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a question on Coles and the working capital opportunity. If I sort of look at it since when you've bought the business, I think your capital employed there has gone up by about $0.4 billion, but the CapEx has been significantly above depreciation by like $1.6 billion. So, that implies you've had a pretty big working capital reduction. Just wanting to get a sense of where that can go going forward, because your CapEx in that division is obviously going up? You talked about satisfactory returns on capital. I just want to understand the potential for working capital improvement over time in the Coles business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the net working capital improvement, as based on our COGS, is around two day improvement this year. So, if we go back to the date of acquisition, we've probably seen in the order of about nine days improvement, which is well in excess of what we said in our acquisition case significantly. And it's fair to say versus other benchmarks international, in particular, there's still some improvement to come through that. As we caution you, I would be cautious in your forward-looking assumptions in terms of further rapid working capital release. We'll see what the markets like. It, obviously, gets harder and harder as you work through this, so the inventory with Easy Ordering now in and both and Easy Stores in, they've been big enablers of some of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, I'm really reluctant to get into sort of current trading, because we report so frequently on a quarterly basis anyway. I guess, what I would say is we haven't seen a much change than what we reported on a few weeks ago when we talked about the quarterly sales. Yeah, I think there was some one-off impacts, which we talked to in terms of the federal government money coming in. So, absent that, we haven't seen much change in trading.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, all. If I look at the land bank that you're developing in Coles and Bunnings, can you give us a feel, please, as to how that's moved over the past 12 months and are you comfortable with the level round about 4.5, five years, or are you looking to increase that over the next 12 months or do you think you're in a position now where you can actually decrease the amount that you're having to spend on land grab?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might kick that off and then, perhaps, for more information pass on to John and Ian. But I think we deliberately have pulled out property in the 4E. So, if you look at the balance sheet note, you'll see property has gone from $2.1 billion to $2.631 billion. So, that shows you the movement in terms of land and buildings in that period. But in terms of more quantitative, John and Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. David, I think the first thing to reflect on is that, at any point in time, the lumpiness of how you can acquire and develop and it's &#x2013; all sorts of variables in there regarding timing and the building and then the lumpiness associated with refinancing, again, all sorts of timing. We'd hoped to complete a couple of hundred million dollar transaction before June, it will be sort of end of August and Terry spoke about that at the presentation day, and even earlier today. So, those things can impact what something looks like at the point in time of the balance sheet dated 30 June or 31 December. So, you need to take a longer view. You asked about the quality of the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Well, the depth of it, for us, is about right for what we see as our opportunities going forward, and 90 sites is strong. It was around that level a year ago. So, what we've opened we've managed to find new and the property team's doing a terrific job on that front. The pipeline is growing a little bit in Officeworks, but that's on a much smaller scale, smaller sites and, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And in terms of as we look to the future, there's a lot of places where the innovation we've had in our formats, particularly multilevel formats that we can then start to get on to different type of zoned land is quite exciting and that opens up more opportunities for us to penetrate areas where people are a long way from a Bunnings and it's not really that well recognized; Northern Beaches, Eastern Suburbs of Sydney are two great examples of that. So, I think from Wes' point of view, we're very comfortable with how things sit. If there are some good transaction work on the refinancing side in this year, then that might change how things look and you'll be asking another question, but that's just the lumpiness as the way these things work through.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from Coles' point of view, what we're doing with developing sites going forward is part of our overall strategy to improve the quality of pipeline that we're developing. Coming into the company four years ago, the sites that had been committed to largely leasehold were sub-optimal in terms of where our new space strategy has gone. If you take a site like Taylors Hill in Melbourne, which we developed over the last couple of years, because that was a freehold, we were able to develop it in our own way and ensure that we got the right amount of space with the right level of format, with the right level of parking, which we believe is most appropriate for our customers going forward. And we see those opportunities present themselves then we'll continue to exploit that. So, there will be probably growth in our freehold as a result, but it doesn't mean it will be at the expense of leasehold, it will be a complement to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in how many years worth of pipeline of the store openings do you have at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're probably looking at about four to five years now. And certainly we've got a pretty strong line of sight now over the next couple of years in terms of development. I think that the stores that we developed last year, had we not had a proactive freehold response, we probably wouldn't have developed any stores in Queensland at all last year. So, it's a really question of needs must, but it's not going beyond our means. We're still in a position where we are looking very carefully about what we're developing and looking at what potential returns we might get out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Ian, on Coles, I'm just having a look at the outlook for inflation or deflation over the next 12 months, you've got fruit and vegetable prices coming off the tail end of a strong deflation. You've got some soft commodity cost increasing quite strongly. Your modus operandi over the past couple of years has been the significant reinvestment in lowering price to drive volume growth. Can you envisage the necessity to actually have an inflationary period over the next 12 months, particularly in the second half or will you continue to drive the suppliers and yourselves to keep on with the deflationary environment over the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it is a very difficult one to predict. I mean, the level of inflation we've seen particularly in the last quarter is probably the highest level of deflation that we've experienced in the last four years. I mean, I wouldn't expect that to continue. It would certainly moderate. And obviously, one of the largest changes that's occurred in the last of couple of years has been the weather-related effects on fruit and veg and we've seen that go both ways. Clearly, with the cycle initially hitting a couple of years ago, seeing prices of bananas rocket, but we've had corresponding reductions in other areas and we're seeing the unwind of that come through in that area during the course of the last few months. And I think that some of that will continue into the next few months.</p>
          <p>We're hearing about changes in grain in particular that are coming through. So, it's likely the prices there will increase. But if you look beyond the more recent spike in the last 12 months, the price of grain has fallen by about 15% during that period. And probably people operating smartly in that market would have been hedging forward on the price. So, it will emerge over time and like anything else, if there are legitimate price increases that are required then we'll listen to them sympathetically, but we've got to make sure that they're justifiable, because just simply passing on to the consumers is not something we would advocate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I suppose that begs the question, will you look to, in effect, fund suppliers for those legitimate price increases, but wear the cost yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, that will come into our overall investment decision as we go through the year. The reduction in milk, for example, which is often quoted, we funded that reduction ourselves. So, we will look at where our underlying pricing strategy is and where we're getting savings out of our business. And there are other cost pressures as well, which are coming through and we're seeking to mitigate them. And we know that working with our suppliers, we can seek to see them, mitigate them too. So, hopefully, it won't just be a straight pass through, but we'll be watching very carefully over the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that mitigation of cost pressures, are you including utility costs there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll look at all aspects of what we're doing and certainly as you've seen within the capital, the CapEx during the course of this year, in part the increase has been through acceleration of our refrigeration changes, and that means that our refrigeration is becoming more efficient. We've also taken some further steps to improve our energy efficiency as well. So, I think over the last four years, although volume's gone up by 20%, our energy costs have come down by 11%. And therefore, we're looking to exploit further opportunities to become more energy efficient too.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew McLennan from CBA. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question for John first, just in relation to the impact of the housing cycle, I just wanted to try and get my head around how much of an impact on the lower comp sales that we're seeing at the moment is due to the tighter trading conditions as opposed to the deflationary component? You don't mention any difficulty in terms of impacting the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. If you can recall back to the investor presentation, I spoke about the market having the distinctions of consumer; light commercial and heavy commercial. The housing cycle has the most impact on the heavy commercial side of the market and we're not immune from those impacts. We're able to offset them by doing other work in light commercial and other work in consumer. So, there is not much of a drag inside the store comp number, but obviously there is a little.</p>
          <p>And if you can reflect back on that, I think at the time I talked about the fact that there's &#x2013; the heavy &#x2013; there's about 20% of our total turnover that is commercial. And between heavy and light, it's very subjective as to how you measure it, but it's possibly around the 50/50 mark. And the heavy participates in our stores and through our trade centers in a blend as well. So, hopefully, that will give you some guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. So, that would suggest that a lot of the discount to &#x2013; or reduction in your comparable sales growth is, in fact, due to the deflationary impact of your initiatives basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's right. And we've been very frank in forecasting that and calling it out and saying it's going to happen. So, that's been a consistent theme, where we set out to achieve stronger value points for customers and to deliver that, it's been an underlying theme in our business, the productivity loop. It's been part of what the Bunnings' long-run success has been about, finding ways to create more value for our customer and going after more volume from that and investing more of what you can get back into doing something else that gives you the ability to do that again on another product or in another way.</p>
          <p>We work on the cost of product. We work on our cost of doing business. So, we're in a position to reinvest productivity gains and we've really accelerated that across the last 24 months or so. Particularly, this year has borne most of the impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of liquor, there was a mentioned that there was significant disruptions in the first half of 2012. Can we anticipate a significant improvement in sales trends as you circle those disruptions? How bad was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it was a pretty significant disruption. It was a major mainframe system change and it didn't go well, frankly. And we've actually resolved the issues now, but in order to resolve them, it took a fair amount of time, effort and focus from management to ensure that that happened. And it was a disruption during the course of the first half.</p>
          <p>And so, certainly, now we've got a much stronger position. And it isn't necessarily about your sales. I think that the issue with sales is that we want to see, clearly, improvements. But we want to make sure those sales are profitable. And one of the things that we intend to stop doing is wholesaling, particularly, on beer through our large-scale format. And therefore, that will still have a bearing on our underlying sales performance. By our underlying volumes we'd expect to start to improve, where we got the profitable sales coming through, particularly in the smaller box, which actually is a larger part of our total liquor business anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. My first question is on the Coles business and in particular understanding the step-up in margin expansion for the second half. From my numbers, Coles, excluding fuel, EBIT margins are up 51 basis points, second half, year-on-year, and only 29 basis points in the first half. Of that improvement in the second half, how much would you attribute to the flood impacts that, obviously, had hurt the second half 2011 results? I think, it was quite a meaningful impact, but was never called out separately. I just want to understand that one-off factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I wouldn't read too much into it. The time that we had the floods, there was actually pluses and minuses on that. I mean, what you had &#x2013; because it was pretty well voiced in the media that floods were going to take place, what we actually saw was a lot of people pantry filling. So, we had actually a surge in sales, which was then offset by negatives, as the floods set and certain stores were taken down for a few days. But we never call it out as a material impact at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that was just --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can read into the fact that we had the floods last year and therefore we've got some gains this year, and read that through. The margin expansion that we're seeing is a result of the efforts to manage the business effectively, drive more efficiency through the business and improve our volumes and fractionalize our costs in the stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe this question for Terry. Just to clarify, remember from last year, it was called out a $40 million flood impact or thereabout, is that --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, broadly. We took &#x2013; we --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We took an Insurance provision effectively for that, that we were, very &#x2013; well, you have to be 100% confident you're going to get and then we called out the balance. It was about that amount, Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that $40 million was within each of the segments that were impacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'd say, across the group, it was about that. And we said at the time that it was majority Coles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. My second question is about the Kmart business. Obviously, a fantastic result and an impressive EBIT margin expansion. Is EBIT margin a KPI or a focus point for that business, because I guess it's almost at odds with the philosophy of the business about offering lower prices? But you'd mainly want to see revenue growth than a lapse in good customer transaction growth. But I'm just interested in what position you take on, on a 6.6% EBIT margin or whether you're happy to see that rise further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Craig. EBIT margin is a KPI for all of us. But, our focus, as I outlined to all of you and I have for the last few years, we are very, very focused about two things: providing everyday items for consumers, which is what's reduced the SKU count from 120,000 down to 50,000, and the second part of that is to provide the lowest-possible prices we can. Our prices have dropped significantly over the last three years. They have dropped, again, significantly in the last 12 months. And even as of recently, with the campaign, I highlighted in my briefing notes, about lower than ever, I think, we dropped another few hundred prices to our consumers over the months of April, May and June.</p>
          <p>So, the path that allows us to do this, which gives us a win-win for the EBIT for shareholders and for customers is by being very focused on being a low-cost business. So, we drive costs out of the business, not only through direct sourcing, which we've had significant change in the last two years, but we drive costs right out of the business in every line on the P&amp;L. So --</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. First question is actually for Dene Rogers on Target. Obviously, a very strong turnaround in the second half. I know at the sales briefing they talked about bringing forward a toy sales event, which helped the top line. I was wondering if you could sort of give some quantification about that on the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hey, David. I can't give you a quantification on the bottom line. What I can say in qualitative terms was that an amount of sales brought forward about 10 days that were in fiscal 2011 were brought forward into fiscal 2012 on a year-by-year basis. And the profitability of those sales were enhanced by not only a focus on toy sales themselves, but also at looking to sell other products while the customer traffic was up and so the profitability of the toy sales increased because of that strategy and some changes in the marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thanks, Dene. And secondly for Ian. We've done a fair bit of surveying and describe what the press say, actually, customers seem to like our private label and in particular Coles. And I'm interested by your commentary about the thousand new SKUs and wondering if they're sort of replacement SKUs or if they're incremental SKUs and how is your private label growth going relative to the core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, your survey is clearly wrong and it just can't be taken as a given, really. How can customers possibly enjoy private label when it's as good a value as in terms of quality and much better pricing, but I'll take it at your word. We are very encouraged by the way the private label is going. We've put a lot of effort into how we're developing it. We're still getting strong sales out of it. It's growing faster than the brand. And I think that's because we've not just looked at the new products coming in, but we looked at enhancing the quality. And that's been very important in terms of getting customer credibility.</p>
          <p>Certainly, what we've seen as the consumer confidence levels have been pretty low from where they have been and people are saving more, then they're looking for ways in which they can save money in their grocery bill as well. And private label has offered them a real opportunity. And we are looking at it to making sure that still is maintained as an integral part of our strategy. We've invested in equipment. We've invested in people and we're working closely with some very small suppliers at times to kind of bring more products to the market.</p>
          <p>The initiative we've put in place this year on making sure that every one of our Coles brand products has no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, is an industry first as well. It just demonstrates our commitment to quality in this area. So, I can see that continuing to expand. We don't put targets on it. Ultimately, the customer will decide what they want to buy and what they don't. But we're very pleased with the continued progress in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, your competitors talk fairly definitively about sort of targets they were trying to get to and I don't expect you to, perhaps, fall into that same trap. But I was wondering if you could talk about some of the categories where you see the biggest opportunities going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there's no one category. We're looking at it across the board. I think that fresh food presents particular opportunities for us and we've seen opportunities in key trading times like Easter and Christmas, where we brought in additional ranges of product in meat, for example, with our finest range and also in bakery as well. And I know that this Christmas again we'll have a stronger selection of products in that particular area. And it's engendering higher levels of customer trust. Once they bought them one year, they're coming back and buying them again and it's actually given them opportunity to further invest across the board. So, I wouldn't call out any particular area, but we see fresh goods as an opportunity.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. First question on the capital expenditure outlook. I'd appreciate it if you could just elaborate on some of the divisional ups and downs in that outlook?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, what we say is that we expect Resources to probably not be as high, because of the expenditure completions or the wrap-up of the expansion works there. It's likely that <mark type="ph" /> WES CEF (95:38) will be higher than this year, because of ammonium nitrate expansion really progressing through. Elsewhere, look, it would probably be reasonably similar and it will be property that's fluctuating numbers. And I guess, where we &#x2013; so, where we're seeing a reduction at the moment, to John's point, is that in terms of net CapEx, is we did $275 million worth of sales this year. And if we get out in the first quarter with a lot of that already tucked away, we've got nine months of probably further property activity that will bring down the net. So, that's probably as much guidance I'll give you at this stage. At the half, obviously, we'll give you a bit further guidance on where things are going.</p>

          <p>We've spent $100 million mostly in the last year, but a little bit in 2011 and we're likely to spend more like $300 million in this current financial year.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, just on the Insurance division, if I could. Maybe just to clarify the gross premium growth on the second half seemed quite low. The net premium growth was actually quite high. So, I just wonder if you could clarify what was happening there. And maybe just a bit of a view as to what the Insurance margin would be in the business now on a normal claims experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Grant, I can explain that relationship between GEP and NEP. So, there are few factors that drive that. The first was, as we mentioned, we did let a fair bit of premium go this year in high-risk areas. So, that had a negative impact on GWP. But then we gained some GWP through rate increases. The other factor that was also quite material, which doesn't impact revenue, reported revenue or EBIT in any way, was that in the previous year we were required &#x2013; in 2011, at yearend, we were required to account for some long-term premium around leased motor fleet, which resulted in the year-on-year comparison between 2011 and 2012 being a bit distorted. Because it didn't impact revenue or EBIT, we don't bother going to the disclosure. But if you adjusted for that, that would have an impact of &#x2013; that would increase our GWP on a like-for-like basis to close to 10% growth for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of just the normal margin outlook just given what's been happening with your reinsurance costs and your premium rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, we put in there, I guess, an underlying core of around 90%, 96%. We'd expect to see that in a normal year or a bit better. On the broking side, we would expect to see a bit of pressure on broking margin in our business, because we're undergoing quite a major investment in systems. But we would still expect to see growth in earnings in that business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A question for Tom. Tom, you're a major beneficiary of price movements, you called out across Chem, Energy &amp; Ferts. Historically, we've had discussions about how much of your tonnes are actually exposed to spot movements and of course formally worked this over in May, the year before last. But you seem to have a lot of exposure to price, and can you give us a feel for what that percentage is in the business and how it might change going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you a direct percentage exposure. But what I can say is that in our ammonia business, we're in the process of moving our key external customers over to international ammonia-based pricing rather than fixed pricing. So, going forward, we're going to be much more exposed to international ammonia prices. In sodium cyanide, for example, those contracts are much shorter term. They're sort of two, three-year contracts sometimes. In ammonium nitrate, they tend to be much longer-term contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can ask the question another way. Your average pricing in Chems up <mark type="ph" /> $3 (100:08) and Fertilisers up <mark type="ph" /> $6 (100:10), where did that come from? Which commodities or chemical?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I've said, we did get stronger pricing at ammonia, ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanide. And in Fertilisers, it's probably across the board, I'd say, and Fertilisers wouldn't be specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you haven't moved any of these future contracts? You're getting the benefit of price. So, there is a certain percentage of your business that's still exposed to spot movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is. There is and an increasing percentage in our ammonia business, which is the 250,000 tonne per annum plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's not merchant ammonia sales, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not merchant ammonia sales. They tend to be longer-term contracts. But the pricing, as I said, is moving from long-term fixed pricing with steady increases with CPI or some other movement indicator towards international ammonia price, which is moving every month. So, that is becoming, in effect, a merchant pricing plant, but on long-term contract basis.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, guys. Just a question on Bunnings. There has been, obviously, a bit of a slowdown in the last six months. I just want to understand whether the new stores you've rolled out has diluted the profit growth in these last six months and then how you're kind of thinking, I guess, based on that ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom. Thanks for the question. There's actually no slowdown at all. If you look at the EBIT splits, first half and second half, I think this year it's sort of a <mark type="ph" /> 57%-42% (102:02). In financial year 2008, it's <mark type="ph" /> 56%-44% (102:07). Yeah. First half is always bigger than the second half and this year was no different to any other. I think people are trying to read something in that's not there, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But could you talk about then the impact of the new stores and whether that &#x2013; like are store is profitable in the first year or is that dilution impact from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We aim for our new stores to be profitable immediately and we have a very strong record in delivering on that. I can't say it's 100%, but it's very close to 100%. The ramp-up of new stores can be quite different state to state, and that's based around just some localized characteristics. We find the Sydney Basin stores take a few more years to ramp to the sort of levels that we are chasing versus maybe a Perth or a Melbourne store. And if we're entering a fresh market, like the South Island of New Zealand, then obviously you've got to do a lot of brand building to ramp the numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of impact of new stores, the other factor is whether we're landing a whole clutch of stores in very new turf or whether we're opening a store that's replacing an older store. And when we do that, there's generally a very significant lift in the space. So just the other week, the second ever Bunnings Warehouse at Mentone, which is just to touch over 11,000 square meters was replaced by a new Mentone on the Nylex plastics site, fantastic site, a couple of hundred meters down the road that gave us close to 8,500, 9,000 square meters. So, it's called one store, but it's not one store and it's a significant impact to shift the store of that like. And you're growing from an existing base.</p>
          <p>Another factor is just the level of cannibalization that may or may not be occurring. And these are all quite lumpy over time. So, in any one quarter or half, it's typical to be calling out one or the other. If you look at it over the long run, we're quite pleased with how our new stores start up, how they get out of the ground and have achieved their longer-term goals in terms of returns and customer characteristics and the sort of share we're able to get in the immediate draw areas.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've got a question for Stewart, please. As you mentioned earlier, Stewart, the spot hard coking price has dropped below $170. Can you just talk about how your negotiated pricing relates to movements in spot? So, the 20% drop in spot, usually, result in a 20% drop in the next contracted price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it certainly indicates downward pressure on quarterly pricing. And quarterly pricing, at the moment, sits at around about $220 to $225 for the Q3. Spot price has been in that US$180 to US$190 per tonne. And we're starting to see some falloff in steel demand, some capacities coming off from the steelmakers. So, they're all indicating that prices are heading downwards. And as I said before in the presentation, the spot price is down by about 20% compared to term.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the next quarter prices will be determined by supply and demand and what's happening in the marketplace. So, we'll have to &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; at this stage, I won't give a call on what the pricing will be for Q4. But clearly, there pressure heading downwards in terms of pricing for that quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, just to clarify, is there a degree of resilience in your negotiated pricing that would mean that a drop in a negotiated pricing would be less than what the spot has dropped by or do they normally follow it in the same relation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the spot price tends to be a leading indicator. And quarterly, the prices tend to follow it down. Whether they go down to the same level as spot price, that's still yet to be determined and that will all unfold over the next six weeks when we roll into negotiations for the Q4 pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks. And John, I think you said earlier that the disruption from price reset peaked in fiscal 2012. So, do you think sales growth and margin can expand in fiscal 2013 as a result of that? Or do you think market conditions will get the lead on any upside at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's an interesting crystal ball question. On margin, it will be what it will be. We're quite comfortable with current levels and they're an outcome, as Richard pointed out, so I won't comment on that. The outlook that we've said is that we expect to trade well. The range reset, from a negotiation point of view, was very disruptive and very intensive for our merchandising team across most of calendar 2011. And then, more recently, the intensity has been for operational teams and it's been very disruptive that led to one of the reasons why we had a little bit more of the high injury levels, which is very disappointing. But there's just so much to do in the store to reset the ranges that we were doing.</p>
          <p>So, I think ops teams are really looking forward to having a crack at spring and summer, free of having to deal with reset as well, and if we get the right weather conditions, last year spring was good and summer was bad. So far, we're sitting waiting for winter to end and we're looking forward with quite wet conditions down the East Coast to a good growing season for spring and, hopefully, a good summer. On the West Coast, they're talking drought, unfortunately. So, it's amazing the differences we've got, but it's hard to forecast things. Conditions around weather for spring and summer are really critical for our business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Maybe just a quick one for Terry. Terry, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of guidance on the outlook for depreciation in the business. Does the level of growth in depreciation seem to slow a little bit in the second half? And I know we've spoken in the past about how it can be lumpy when different properties, in particular, come online. What do you think the outlook is for FY 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I guide &#x2013; I mean, it's not something I particularly want to give guidance on &#x2013; I think what you're clearly going to see is Resources, as you've seen, jump as the new plant is, obviously, on line and being depreciated. Yeah. You've seen a reasonable jump in Coles and that's the refurbishment activity obviously, renewal activity biting into that business. I think the trends that you're seeing are not un-surprising, I would have thought. We've said that a lot of the growth CapEx is &#x2013; we've really called out where that's going, and we've said the rest is maintenance CapEx and we've said that maintenance CapEx, for us, largely means replacing things at the same rate of depreciation. So, that would broadly keep you in line. So, I think that's probably as good a guidance as we'd give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it sounds like you're saying the trend into next year will be broadly similar compared to this year other than Resources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, you've got to just take note of where the major CapEx has been spent, in terms of refurbishment programs and expansion programs in particular, because that's the areas that are driving ahead of depreciation, and I guess where it's land and buildings, clearly not a lot of depreciation in those areas. So, that's not going to be a big driver. And where it's work-in-progress, such as in Chemicals, Energy &amp; Ferts, that's not depreciating at this stage, so that's not a driver. So, I think if you think through the guidance we're giving you around where the CapEx is going and the divisions is going, you'll get it reasonably close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Although, if we look at the level of CapEx in the Coles food and liquor, for example, a lot of that's been on refurb over the past couple of years, and there actually hasn't been a very large increase in depreciation or not what the increase in CapEx would suggest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In, sorry, liquor?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Coles food and liquor. Coles, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we were getting comments at the half about why it was so hot, why it jumped up so high. So, I think if you go and look at the 4E, there has been reasonable increase in depreciation in Coles over the course of the year. And as I said, a lot of the CapEx in this year as we've called out was an increase in the amount of freehold property that we were taking onboard to develop the underlying levels of, if you like, property, plant and equipment was a similar number of refurbishments. So, I take property to be an increasing proportion of what was going through Coles CapEx <mark type="ph" /> and so on (111:17).</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, Ian might give more flavor, but I think it's largely to do with Clive Peeters. So, we had a provision in relation to the leases, that they were in, effectively, because we owned the property.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I assume that there is no revenue associated with that. So, that would also have helped those margins in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, it's a drop because you've got effectively &#x2013; when you think of it, perhaps, an impairment is the best way to describe it, on those leases, you're not going to get rent from Clive Peeters where you once were. So, you take a hit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were two key elements on it from last year. I mean, obviously, with the Clive Peeters issue, that meant we had to take a provision against it, because we didn't think we'd be able to fill that space for the subtenant. We've actually been quite successful. So, that's enabled us to release some of those provisions back. And as I mentioned earlier on, we've actually been quite proactive in making sure that any vacancy we had within specialties around our own field of properties where we've got supermarkets, we worked quite hard to fill those vacancies and that's helped to grow the number as well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, look, Fertilisers had a good year, particularly on volumes, as you'll have seen, but the key driver of the increase was really our ammonia business. You might recall that we'd flagged that we'd thought that the ammonia business would be down because of the shutdown that was late in the first half. But we did a lot better in that shut than we had expected both in terms of cost, but importantly in time, it was much shorter than we'd budgeted, if you like.</p>
          <p>Also, one of our key ammonia customers experienced some production difficulties that we were able to help them with through some short-term arrangements that we hadn't anticipated. And the international ammonia pricing, as I've said, helped as well. So, it's really in ammonia was the driver.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, Shaun, as I said, the last couple of years have been very unusual years, a combination of softening rates in the lead up, major catastrophe events and then structural change in reinsurance markets, which we needed to adapt to. So, last year has been tough. What we believe we've done in our business now is, through strengthening the underlying performance we have far more resilience to handle some one-off events. And that's really what we're focused on. So, the number that we've put forward at around the 96% mark is what we feel is a good representation of the underlying performance within our underwriting business and it's something that we would expect to achieve in a normal year. I appreciate there haven't been many normal years of late. But there are other parts to our business, obviously, the broking part of our business, the premium funding part of our business isn't exposed to the underwriting volatility and we're getting good growth in that side of our business.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. A question on the Resources segment with regards to the underlying cost growth, and if I back out that $55 million to get 6% mining cost growth, is that &#x2013; firstly, is that right? And is that a good understanding of the underlying run rate of sort of natural cost pressures that the business is facing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, having a look at, Craig, slide 33 in the supplementary pack, that gives you a pretty good indication of what costs have done to the first half of the year versus second half, and we'll be able to reduce down the costs. Just sort of talking more in terms of quantum, the costs for the second half in terms of total dollars compared to the first half are actually lower than the first half. And that's despite having higher production in the second half, an additional 1.2 million tonnes of production at Curragh. So, as we have commissioned a new plant at Curragh over the sort of last four or five months, we've been able to significantly increase our production, and that's been driving our cost structure down. And we've started the first month of this year with similar sort of costs that we've had in the second half of the year. So, we're seeing significant uplift as a result of increasing our production and commissioning new plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you're getting &#x2013; just to understand that. So, you're able to offset the natural wage inflation and other cost pressures through productivity on this extra volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I'm saying is in the first half of the year the costs were abnormally high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've indicated about AUD55 million --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...associated with that. With the commissioning of the new plant, we've been able to drive our cost structure down. And we think the cost structure now is about where it should be. And we're driving to drop that even further as we move forward. If you're looking at then how do we sit compared to other export coal miners, we see that our cost structure is in the bottom quartile, so we're pretty competitive against other hard coking coal producers.</p>
          <p>But as you said, the underlying cost, we continue to see pressures in the underlying cost structures. On a positive note, though, because of the downturn in the export metallurgical market, we are seeing a contractor availability increase as some mines adjust their production rates and reduce contractors. And another very good leading indicator of potentially where we're heading is haul-truck delivery times. So, if you purchase a haul-truck through, say, Caterpillar, the haul-truck delivery times have dropped down from about three years, six months ago, to about 33 weeks at the moment. So, it's a significantly reduced time to get a truck into the marketplace. So, I think they're all good leading indicators that hopefully some of the cost pressures we've had over the last two or three years maybe coming off a touch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This one is also for Stewart. Just having a look at that slide 33 on your mine costs &#x2013; excuse me, I presume that does not include any of the royalty amounts on there. But I look at it and say that it has really flattened out during the second six months, and that includes the June quarter where you had significant uplift in production. So, I suppose, I'm trying to get a handle and get an understanding as to where you're going to be able to reduce that further outside of your contractor? And I supposed, therefore, that begs the question, what contractor cost now is a portion of your mine cash cost? Is it the material or is it still very small?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. The contractor costs are very significant proportion of our cost. A lot of our overburden removal is done by contractors as opposed to &#x2013; we basically do dragline operations with our own employees, but truck and shovel is done by contractors. So, there is, obviously, significant cost associated with contractor costs. Just looking at slide 33 that you made some comments about the costs have been fairly flat during the second half, as you see, the volume has kicked up and costs have come down a little bit over that period and we'll continue to work that down and July is slightly less than what June was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the outlook, you said you'd expect that to be able to come down over the six to 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on what the prevailing cost pressures are, whether they're heading upwards or downwards, and we've been operating on, clearly, an upward movement in terms of cost structure over the last three or so years. Some leading indicators are indicating that maybe it will come off a touch, but we've yet to see that in reality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And final one, Stewart, when you talk about cost per tonne, is that cost per tonne including overburden removal, et cetera, or is that cost per the tonne of actual production of coal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's all our costs, mine site costs.</p>
