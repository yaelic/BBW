        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Nestl&#xE9; 2009 Half Year Conference Call. As usual we will take the Safe Harbor statement as read.</p>
          <p>We'll start with the highlight slide. Our first half 2009 performance is solid and broad-based, achieved in one of the most challenging environments we have witnessed. It is encouraging therefore that we are able to report continued progress in key performance indicators, namely: organic growth; EBIT margin; earnings per share and cash flow, whilst at the same time increasing the competitive positions of our key brands around the world.</p>
          <p>Our broad-based performance in this environment is testament to the resilience of our business, and sets us up for an acceleration in the second half.</p>
          <p>The group has once again delivered profitable growth, with 3.5% organic growth combined with a 30 basis point improvement in EBIT margin, both reported and in constant currencies. The same is true of Food and Beverages, with 3.4% organic growth combined with a 10 basis point improvement in EBIT margin, or 20 basis points in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Within Food and Beverages, there were strong performances from our operating segments, with five out of six achieving positive organic growth whilst at least holding their EBIT margins.</p>
          <p>The highlights of the income statement show that, after a couple of years of pressure on the cost of goods sold, we are again trending better, whilst distribution costs benefit from lower oil price, efficiency programs and route optimization. Much of these things were successfully invested in pursuit of profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Finally on the highlights, there was a strong cash flow performance, influenced primarily by the positive evolution of working capital.</p>
          <p>On the next slide is the picture of our sales development. Both RIG, or real internal growth, and pricing were positive, to achieve organic growth of 3.5% for the group and 3.4% for Food and Beverages. There was strong headwind from currencies, 4.3% negative for the group, 4.7% for Food and Beverages. The sales development was further negatively influenced by a 0.7% impact from disposals, net of acquisitions, for both the group and Food and Beverages. In total, the group sales fell by 1.5% in the half, whilst Food and Beverages fell 2%. As usual, our currency slide is included in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Next is our growth by region for our total Food and Beverage business, including the globally managed businesses. Organic growth is positive in all three areas, with RIG positive in the Americas and AOA. Emerging markets achieved over 7% organic growth. I will get into the detail on the next slide, showing our operating segments.</p>
          <p>All segments as shown on the next slide, except Nestl&#xE9; Waters continue to enjoy positive organic growth. I think you have a good grasp of the challenges faced by the bottled water industry at the moment.</p>
          <p>The category is in decline in Europe and North America, reflecting the economic environment. We gained market share in U.S. and in some markets in Europe. Our emerging market business continued double digit growth.</p>
          <p>Waters had a strong EBIT margin performance, up 110 basis points, despite the impact of the negative organic growth. Europe's margins were unchanged compared to first half of 2008 whilst North America and the emerging markets improved. The main drivers of improvement were the reduced costs of PET and fuel, as well as efficiencies in manufacturing, distribution and administration.</p>
          <p>The only business to report a fall in EBIT margin was Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, but it is still at 17.4%. This performance reflects in part the cost of some major advertising campaigns that started towards the end of the period, but was also negative &#x2013; was also impacted by negative growth as well as currency. We would expect a pick-up in the EBIT margin and growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>Looking at Nutrition's sales performance, the good news is that each of the four divisions; that is, infant nutrition, healthcare nutrition, weight management and performance nutrition, accelerated in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In infant nutrition, I could highlight improvements in a number of markets: Russia is very strong, as are Brazil and many other of the emerging markets. In the U.S., we are seeing a very good acceleration from Gerber, and also share gains in Infant Formula, even if the numbers are a bit distorted by the pricing impact of the WIC contracts. Our performance is improving also in Germany, and has stabilized in France. Basically, we are now seeing a recovery from a tough period between October 2008 and March 2009, demonstrated by all the three zones having gained market share in the recent months. We expect this trend of improvement to continue in the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Zones, Europe reported negative RIG, positive organic growth and flat EBIT margin. The growth trends were broadly in line with the first quarter, with the UK and PetCare, as well as some of the Eastern European markets, performing well. About 60% of the business cells that we measure improved their market shares.</p>
          <p>The flat EBIT margin was achieved despite the lack of leverage from growth with continued investment in consumer-facing marketing, and therefore reflects a strong delivery of efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Zone Americas achieved a good level of growth whilst also improving its EBIT margin by 20 basis points. North America had a strong first half, with frozen food, soluble coffee, ambient dairy, petcare and chocolate all contributing. Latin America also started the year well, but the growth was predominantly from Mexico and Brazil, with the smaller markets struggling with various economic challenges, such as lower oil revenues, fewer tourists and currency issues. The margin improvement reflects the benefit of growth, as well as savings from Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence.</p>
          <p>Next is Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa, organic growth was 5.9%, just above the Q1 level. There has been an acceleration in RIG for the first half to reach 2.2% for the period. On the other hand, pricing has fallen back to 3.7%.The main drivers of the RIG acceleration in the second quarter have been Africa, Middle East and Greater China. It is good to report that both India and Mainland China are achieving double digit RIG. The Zone's EBIT margin improved by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to pricing in the zone, this is lower across the zone, with milk pricing negative and the positive levels in the other categories on a downward trend.</p>
          <p>Other Food and Beverages achieved 6.1% organic growth and a 20 basis point increase in EBIT margin. Nestl&#xE9; Professional's growth was basically flat, reflecting a weak market for out-of-home consumption, but its performance was supported by increased demand in markets such as Greater China and the Middle East. Nespresso continued to achieve organic growth above 25%. Growth and efficiencies contributed to EBIT margin improvement for the segment.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the product segments. First is powdered and liquid beverages. It had an excellent start to the year from a sales perspective, with 9.7% organic growth; however, EBIT margin was 110 basis point lower, impacted by currencies, raw materials, the roll-out of Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto as a matter of it continued roll-out of Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto and by the scale-up of new manufacturing facilities. The biggest contributors to the strong growth were Nescaf&#xE9;, Nespresso and our ready-to-drink business. Powdered beverages' growth was slightly more subdued following the heavy pricing in 2008.</p>
          <p>Next is milk products and ice cream; the good news is that we believe that we have seen the bottom in terms of consumer demand in ambient dairy. The acceleration in RIG in the second quarter looks to be sustainable throughout the year. Pricing is lower after the extreme high prices of recent times.</p>
          <p>In ice cream, market conditions generally have been tough, with private label gaining share, the out-of-home business subdued and competition being very promotional. That said, we are generally doing well versus our branded competitor &#x2013; branded competitors with share gains against them in a number of markets, including the U.S. The organic growth in ice cream is impacted by our withdrawal from various value-destroying European markets, including Benelux and Hungary.</p>
          <p>Overall, for the milk products and ice cream product group, the EBIT margin fell 20 basis points. This reflects a decline in the ambient dairy margin and an improvement in ice cream. Ambient dairy margin was impacted by the need to realign our pricing, as well as the up-front commissioning costs of the Anderson factory. It should improve in the second half of the year. Ice cream's margin improvement was due to lower raw material costs and improved efficiencies in our factories, distribution and administration, especially in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Next is prepared dishes and cooking aids. We achieved the promised acceleration in frozen food in the U.S., particularly through Stouffer's meals, family meals and Hot Pockets.</p>
          <p>Chilled also performed well in the U.S. Maggi achieved double digit growth in emerging markets in all the three zones. Western Europe has been tough for the product group primarily due to category softness on frozen prepared meals and reduced out-of home dining. Key brands such as Maggi, Herta and Wagner posted good growth at retail.</p>
          <p>There is good news on the EBIT margin, with a 90 basis point improvement. The key drivers are the leverage from growth in emerging markets, cost efficiencies and the disposal of two value destroyers, that is, dried pasta in Italy and mayonnaise in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Turning to Confectionery. This business had a good start to the year with 4.3% organic growth and 60 basis points improvement in margin. The UK has continued to perform well. The U.S. has also had a good start to the year. Brazil accelerated in the second quarter due to the late Easter. Weaker performances in a number of markets, slower markets, partially offset the significant progress in others. The key contributors to the improved margin were the U.S. and Australia, both of which are seeing the benefit of reorganizations and restructurings.</p>
          <p>Petcare continued to perform at a high level, with organic growth of 9.1% and an EBIT margin improvement of 120 basis points. You might remember that the 2008 first half margin dipped slightly as a result of increased raw material prices. The 2009 margin performance shows the benefit of volume leverage and pricing actions in June 2008 and thereafter.</p>
          <p>Growth in petcare remains resilient in all three zones: we are also rationalizing underperforming and mainstream products that are being replaced with products delivering improved nutritional benefits to pets.</p>
          <p>Here is our billionaire brands, our usual chart showing the growth of our billionaire brands. As you can see in this chart, a significant majority are in positive territory, with 16 growing above the group's average. Overall the billionaire brands grew about 6%.</p>
          <p>I think I've already explained the brand performances in my comments on the product groups, but we can come back to any in the Q&amp;A. I will just say on Buitoni, which is negative and that this is a reflection of the poor category development, particularly in its biggest markets, Spain and Italy.</p>
          <p>On the next slide is our profit bridge, explaining the 30 basis point improvement in EBIT margin. The cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, have decreased by 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>The total input costs are up, but they have been over-compensated by the benefits from our accelerated efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>Distribution costs also showed a 30 basis point fall. The key factors here were efficiencies, fuel costs and product mix. Our marketing costs were unchanged as a percentage of sales, but our consumer-facing spend was up. For Food and Beverages, our marketing spend was &#x2013; consumer-facing marketing spend was up 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our administration costs are up 10 basis points, reflecting increased pension costs, whilst R&amp;D is up 20 basis points, partly reflecting the openings of new R&amp;D centers and increased spend by the pharmaceutical product group.</p>
          <p>This increase in both marketing and R&amp;D spend for Food and Beverages is in line with our consistent, year-after-year commitment to give our brands necessary support and to invest for the future, demonstrated by the multi-year trend of increasing investment in these areas.</p>
          <p>Overall, the group's EBIT margin is up 30 basis points to 14.1%, reported and in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>This next slide comes back to the important area of consumer-facing marketing spend. As you know, marketing dollars have been &#x2013; are spent locally, so we have excluded the currency impacts from this chart to show the real like-for-like trend of that spend. As you can see, we have consistently invested at a level above our RIG. Of course, this is only one aspect of brand-building, and as you are aware, for example, that our R&amp;D spend has also been trending upwards.</p>
          <p>On the next chart, I'm returning to the income statement, and going from EBIT to net profit and earnings per share. Other income and expenses are unchanged. Within these lines are our restructuring charges and impairments, at similar levels in both years. Our guidance for restructuring charges remains at about half percent of sales.</p>
          <p>Our net financial expenses have come down, reflecting the combined effects of our reduced debt and lower interest rates. Our guidance for the net financing costs is a bit lower than what we experienced in 2008.</p>
          <p>The profit for the period reached 11% of sales, up 50 basis points, reflecting the net benefits discussed above being only partially reduced by a lower contribution from associates, which were down 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>The income that is attributable to non-controlling interests, that's our minorities, has increased by 60 basis points, reflecting the sale of about 25% of Alcon to Novartis in the second half of 2008, resulting in net profit attributable to Nestl&#xE9; shareholders of 9.7%. The underlying earnings per share rises 3.5% to 1.46 swiss francs per share, or 8.5% in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our financial position and starting with working capital. There has been a reduction in the level &#x2013; in the evolution of working capital, particularly inventories, as well as improved management of payables and receivables, significantly contributing to a strong cash flow performance. Operating cash flow is up about three billion swiss francs to 6.4 billion, and free cash flow is up about 2.9 billion to 4.4 billion swiss francs.</p>
          <p>Our share buyback continues on track, with 1.5 billion bought in the first half and a target of four billion for the year. We remain committed to completing the buyback within the previously announced three year timeframe.</p>
          <p>Finally on this slide, our net debt is 17.4 billion, up from the full year as usual due to the dividend payment, but down about eight billion swiss franc from the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>That brings us to Q&amp;A, but first a quick summary. I would classify our organic growth in the first half as robust and balanced in view of the environment, especially as it is building on a strong performance in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>This is particularly true as it has been delivered whilst also achieving an improvement in the EBIT margin, both reported and in constant currencies, and whilst increasing our investment in our brands, both through marketing and R&amp;D. In other words, in keeping with the Nestl&#xE9; model, we have delivered both on the top line and on the EBIT margin. We have also delivered a solid performance in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year, we will continue to focus on accelerating those initiatives that generate efficiencies and those that drive growth, such that we would expect to see an acceleration in the organic growth, driven by volumes, from the current level.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention, now we go to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your question-and-answer session will now begin. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to remind you to restrict yourselves to two questions per person. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Your first question is from the line of Marco Gulpers from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Two questions if I may. What has changed in the second quarter that you now no longer expect approaching the 5%, but are talking now about acceleration; maybe you can give us some clue on that?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on the outlook for the input costs in the second half of '09. In the first half there was a benefit to gross margins of about 30 basis points, how do you see that progressing in the second half of the year? And how do you align that with the comments you made during the last Investors' seminar where you were talking about a renewed inflationary environment? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, just on the first question, which I think you're dealing with our guidance. I would say, Marco that we are at 3.5% organic growth, with an improving real growth confidence, first quarter versus second quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect to improve from where we are today. And I think that the improvement and the direction of the improvement is in line with what we had said previously. The 200 basis point range of the consensus for organic growth suggests our earlier guidance wasn't well understood. So, to some extent we are simplifying it. We think the consensus number itself is a good interpretation of our guidance.</p>
          <p>On the other question, in terms of commodity cost, in the first our input cost, in the first half year our input costs were up about 3%, or 2% of cost of goods. Let me just go that over to make sure we understand this.</p>
          <p>Our input cost, which is &#x2013; which includes raw materials, the basic agricultural commodities, packing materials for &#x2013; which for the first half is about 14 billion swiss francs. Those numbers have increased by about 3%, so 3% on the base and 2% on our total cost of goods.</p>
          <p>I think what we have seen is in line with our earlier discussions, where we believe that the agricultural materials will be more or less flat, which we have experienced in the first six months. But the other raw materials and packaging materials would be the challenge this year and which we are also experiencing.</p>
          <p>We, however, have been able to offset the impact of those significantly more by our continuous efficiency program and by the changes in the mix of the business. I hope that answers your questions Marco .</p>

          <p>Marco , on the &#x2013; it's Roddy &#x2013; on the comment at the seminar about the return to a more inflationary environment. That was a longer-term comment looking into 2010 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of David Hayes from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My two questions, first is on the water margin, clearly a marked improvement in the margin, despite the top line still being tough. I assume that's some pretty significant cost saving activity that has been going on there by the looks. I just wonder whether you can talk about whether that is the case and exactly where those costs have come from? And also how sustainable they are in terms of all that cost saving &#x2013; kind of level progress through the second half of this year into next year, or was that kind of one-off in nature?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just a kind of a detail question, if you like, just in terms of the finance costs. Previously, you've kind of being vaguely guiding towards a billion finance costs for the full year. 321 for the first half is quite low, I mean, is that guidance slightly less now or &#x2013; for the full year &#x2013; or is there one-off benefits in the first half that will drop out in the second half so it's used in the second half? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's come back to water. We are making progress in water, in spite of the negative organic growth, and the performance at the top-line is really a reflection of the softness of the industry both in the U.S. or in North America and in Europe. So, our focus there is really to improve our competitive positions in those markets and we are. We have gained share in the U.S. and we have gained share in some of our brands in Western Europe and we are making good progress in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So the other focus is really on improving the operating efficiency in the business and a lot of work has started in terms of route rationalization, reduction of fixed costs, and we are getting the benefits of that.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have gotten some tailwinds in the fuel-related cost, for example, on the PET and on distribution costs. I do not think &#x2013; I think other than the fuel cost which you see is some degree of volatility. I think we feel very assured that we will continue to see an improving profit performance in this business relative to what was achieved last year.</p>
          <p>Now on the finance cost, yes, I think the earlier guidance we gave that the total cost will be closer to a billion Swiss francs, I think that's a reasonable estimate for the performance this year. You have to also understand that the dividends were paid later in the second quarter and the share buyback could accelerate also in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the PET cost, but in a previous question you were talking about packaging costs still challenging. Can I just come back to that kind of input cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the packaging cost is a net number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. But just to clarify the last question on the pack &#x2013; on the input costs generally. You are still saying net-net agriculture, packaging, you are still looking at some kind of an inflationary level uplift this year. Is that still the same guidance, or -</p>

          <p>No, we believe that it will be &#x2013; we had said two to 3%. We believe it will be likely towards the 2% level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your question. Our next question is from the line of John Cox from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a couple of questions for you. I'm just wondering what's going on in Europe where the &#x2013; it appears that the volume decline worsened in Q2 versus Q1, and I'm wondering if you can just give a comment on the sort of competitive environment and the situation with private label there?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the other F&amp;B, that seemed to slowdown quite markedly in Q2. I wonder if you just give us an idea of what's going on with Nespresso there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Nespresso continues to do very well. As a matter of fact the organic growth is in excess of 25%. Now, Europe is a very difficult market and this year, in particular, what we are seeing is that the difficulties are across the entire euro zone, both East and Western Europe. What I must say is that we continue to invest in this region. We continue to roll-out Dolce Gusto and launch new products, especially in beverages, and we have improved our market shares in about 60% of the sales we are tracking.</p>
          <p>So our competitive positions have improved. Our margins have not suffered because, in spite of the lack of volume leverage and continued investments in the business, we were able to maintain our margin because of significant efficiency programs in the business across the zone.</p>
          <p>So, I think the market &#x2013; Western Europe will remain difficult. I think some of the issues that sort of kept us back in the first half will &#x2013; are now resolved, especially issues with customers with regard to pricing and so on, and I think we look forward to seeing some improvement in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wondering if I can just have a bit of a follow-up there on the &#x2013; in terms of pricing because pricing looked weaker than anticipated. You guys always give sort of the consensus. Is it fair to say that actually you're promoting pretty heavily and maybe particularly in Europe is where you're suddenly having to promote more heavier than originally expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think pricing, as you see it, first of all it's the roll-off of the heavy pricing that we're taking in the first half of last year and we have had to adjust our pricing to be competitive in this marketplace. So, I do not see a significant upturn in pricing, but we do expect that the volume element of our organic growth will improve.</p>

          <p>Jon, the bigger pricing declines are in &#x2013; particularly in AOA and then in the &#x2013; in the Americas rather than in Europe; Europe's pricing is pretty much flat from quarter to the first half.</p>
          <p>Just coming back to the other Food and Beverage, as Jim said Nespresso &#x2013; I mean, it actually accelerated slightly in the second quarter &#x2013; so, the reason that the other Food and Beverage was weaker was because of Nestl&#xE9; Professional and the Cereal Partners Worldwide JV both being a bit slower. And just also on Europe, even though you are right, there is a slowdown Q1 to H1 in RIG in Europe. Three of our four biggest European markets &#x2013; and the big four are: Germany, France, UK, and the regional PetCare business &#x2013; three of those four businesses are still posting positive RIG. So we're not in a situation of big markets going backwards at all, they're still growing positively in the current year.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question. Our next question today comes from the line of Warren Ackerman from Evolution Securities . Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Warren Ackerman here from Evolution . Jim, very impressive cash flow performance in the first half of the year, with the free cash flow not far off doubling sort of H1 on H1. You've given us some feel for the drivers behind that. Could you maybe walk us through in a bit more detail what's happening in terms of cash conversion, inventory, debtors, creditors, what the underlying picture is and what you expect going forward into the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, I guess it's a similar question to some of the others, but the Food and Beverage RIG overall was only flat in the second quarter broadly in line with the first quarter. Was that in line with budgets or were there things in the second quarter that actually were slightly behind budgets? And what would be reasonable expectation for the Food and Beverage RIG into the second half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, you will recall that the Food and Beverage RIG was negative 0.1% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Food and Beverage RIG was 0.4%. So we are seeing a continuing improvement in our RIG performance in Food and Beverage and as I said, we expect that to improve as we progress into the second half.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to your &#x2013; the cash flow, I would say that, first of all the business, looking at the cash flow from operations, which is your profit for the period and the add back of the non-cash items, that improved by 450 million swiss francs. The increase &#x2013; the evolution of our working capital was down 1.6 billion. So those two items alone explain about 70% of the improvement you are seeing. In addition to that, our capital expenditure was down 12%. So it's really what we talked about as part of our model that capital efficiency is an important pillar in our performance. And we've delivered against that in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Jim, just coming back on the first question on the Food and Beverage RIG. What in the second half of the year do you expect to see in terms of acceleration? I think previously you said that looking at the second half of the year you expect a better economic environment. And the comps get a bit easier, lack of de-stocking, perhaps nutrition gets better &#x2013; all of those things still valid or are there going to be others also that drive us up and that improve in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I also believe that we have taken some pricing adjustments over the last three months and that will put us in good stead for the second half of the year. So, we are not anticipating any significant price increases and therefore the traditional difficulties in terms of taking price increases, we don't have to &#x2013; we don't have those issues coming into the second half.</p>
          <p>So, I think overall we are looking at a more stable situation, a more sort of positive outlook on the cost side, especially given by the acceleration in our operational efficiency program across the group. And I think that gives us the ability to continue to invest against the business. And as you rightly said, we expect the businesses like nutrition will be considerably better in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're also seeing a pretty sharp acceleration in Zone AOA, as you will have noticed, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the year. Then of course, we will also have in AOA somewhat easier comps following the milk issues last year. I think the other thing that probably is worth mentioning is in Zone Europe. As you will appreciate, in the environment that we've been in of apparently perceived lower raw material costs, it's been a quite challenging time for negotiations with retailers and that's obviously all behind us now. And so we can now really focus on working with the retailers to grow both their businesses and our businesses. So also, I think, in Zone Europe we would see perhaps a slightly better second half than first half in terms of RIG.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, James. Good morning, Roddy. Question on the PET food: What we saw is still a good organic growth for the H1 but there was some deceleration in Q2. Is there a specific trend or could that reverse in the second half or in Q3 again? And secondly, where did you see this deceleration in Q2, in which areas or which regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't know &#x2013; I'll take that one for you. You might remember that this time last year there was &#x2013; there were some really very significant price increases, so there was a lot of buying in by the retailers this time last year, in Q2 last year, ahead of those price increases. So we had quite a tough comp in PetCare last &#x2013; from last year. So we're not expecting the Q1, Q2 trend to continue through the rest of the year; we'd expect it to be more stable from now going forwards.</p>
          <p>And that's also supported by our market shares which are up all around the world in every category apart from one, which is either &#x2013; I can't remember, it's either the treats or it's the litter, so it's one of the small categories that were down. And, so I think this is a slightly special case because of the comp from last year and we expect performance at this level for the rest of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And a second question, on confectionery to look at. So you showed a good organic growth as well, but low volume. Could we expect a similar trend in the second half with lower volume? Or is there also because cocoa price is more or less stabilized that we see an improved volume as well in confectionery in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; I think we expect to see confectionery improve its RIG performance. As a matter of fact, we have had good progress made in the U.S. and in some markets in Europe, especially the UK. The challenge in confectionery for us is in Eastern Europe, particularly the handful of markets, but we believe things would get slightly better in the second half. I think 4.3% organic growth in confectionery in the first half is in fact &#x2013; I would say a very, very competitive performance.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank . Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Roddy. Regarding again on pricing, in Q1 you had the price effect of 3.5%; Q2, 2.5%. Would you say it would be a fair assumption to see a further slowdown in H2 in pricing?</p>
          <p>And second question regarding the margin development of the beverages and the milk products, both products category have declined in margin. You were mentioning higher raw material costs, would it be a fair assumption to say that we should see some improvement here in H2? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let's take beverages. I think the beverage business was affected on a commodity side by coffee. Coffee prices in terms of our cost of goods went up relative to last year.</p>
          <p>We're also investing in beverages, launching several new products, the roll-out of Dolce Gusto. And I would say it's a combination of investments and commodity cost that had the impact on the first half year. I think we will continue to invest in the business. We expect the commodity side to be slightly better in the second half, particularly with respect to this category. Yes, I think other than investment aside, we should see some marginal improvement in our beverage profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the milk business, we certainly &#x2013; the H1 margin impact on the milk business within dairy &#x2013; within milk and ice cream should reverse itself. It really is just a reflection of our pricing in the marketplace coming down faster than our cost base coming down. And that is now more in a sort of equilibrium situation, so that should reverse itself in H2.</p>
          <p>And on your first question on pricing, yes, we will continue to see the pricing element of the organic growth come down a bit in the second half of the year. And it's just basically the 2008 pricing working itself out of the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is lastly regarding tax rate, the reported tax rate was just 24%. Would you say this would be a fair assumption also for the full year or is there any extraordinary effect in this tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Patrik , if you look at the tax rates last year it's pretty close to the same amount, as a matter of fact it was 24.2%. So our guidance for the effective tax rate's about 27.5% is what stands for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the reported tax rate is clearly lower than...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first half, I mean if you look at what happened the first half last year, it's just a timing issue. You always know &#x2013; last year, our first half year tax rate was about 24% and the end of the year was about 27.5%. So it's the same pattern you will see again this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions: I want to really be clear on the guidance front. On June 29 and I think today you implied that in the second half volume growth would be better than pricing growth &#x2013; is that the right way to interpret that? I mean that's the case, your first half is 3.5, you are guiding for consensus for the year which is 4.2, that means 5.5 for the year. So if volumes are going to be better, you're really saying that RIG is going to be close to 3% or higher in the second half which is a big jump from almost flat in the first half. Can you comment on that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, if you can just give us some color in terms of what's happening in emerging markets second quarter versus first quarter? Do you think &#x2013; do you see things getting better? In particular my question is, the big improvement in volumes in AOA, whilst Europe and Americas were relatively unchanged quarter-on-quarter in terms of declines or growth, is that because in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, you're becoming more price aggressive and the strategy in emerging markets is not so much as in the past about taking pricing and passing on currency devaluations, but it's more about driving volumes? If you can comment on that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the guidance, I think what we are saying is that as we move forward into the second half, we believe that the growth will be more influenced by improvements in real growth. So the mix will change in favor of volumes. So that's, I just want to make sure, we &#x2013; I think your interpretation, but I am not going to give you the exact numbers, but it the change in the mix will be on the direction as I described.</p>
          <p>On the emerging markets, our emerging market business in the second quarter performed better than in the first quarter. As a matter of fact, the emerging markets grew 7% for the first half and it was slightly above 6% in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can you comment on the pricing question, Jim? Is there a change in strategy, more focus on volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's just the reality of where we are. I mean last year, the prices were significant. If you look at our pricing evolution last year, we had 5.4% in the first half. So we are not seeing the same level of pricing activity because we don't need to, this year. And that is why you are seeing gradual slowdown in the pricing because the impact of last year's pricing actions are being sort of worked out in the system. There have been some new pricing this year but we're not changing our strategy. Our strategy is to be competitive, and that's what we've been doing and you've seen the importance of focusing on driving our competitive position. And globally our brands are doing better on the whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Jim if I may just quickly follow-up on the Alcon situation. Your guidance officially is for M&amp;A of 1.5 to 2 billion a year, and that's what you've repeated in most of the conference calls. So, can I make the assumption then that if you're going to get roughly 30 million Swiss Francs in proceeds once you exercise those puts, that that money will either go to a dividend or buybacks because your guidance officially is for 1.5 to two billion M&amp;A so why put that money in the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. 1.5 to two billion is this year, Pablo. We're not talking about M&amp;A activity into the future we are talking about this year. The Alcon options are not exercisable until the beginning of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; I'm just going to come back to a couple of things. Just on the guidance, I just want to differentiate. What we're talking about is RIG accelerating and the price slowing down a bit. We're not making any judgment call about whether there is going to be more RIG than there is pricing for the full year. We're just talking about RIG accelerating and pricing decelerating. We're not making a judgment call on what the balance is going to be, but clearly if that happens organic growth will be more weighted to RIG than it is at the moment. That doesn't mean to say it'll be more weighted to RIG than to price, just more weighted to RIG than it is at the moment.</p>
          <p>And on the emerging markets, I think what we saw last year was &#x2013; and from 2007 into last year, was some very significant pricing and that clearly impacted volumes not just in AOA but also in the other emerging markets. What we are seeing in the current year now with the pricing having come off quite significantly and us sticking a lot of money to reengage with &#x2013; spending a lot of time reengaging with consumers around their perception of value, we're now seeing volumes begin to pick up again in those emerging markets. And that's particularly true in dairy which was of course the most significantly hit by pricing and is obviously a very big category for us in emerging markets and is also true in culinary as well. So, I think that's really what's going on in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And also on this question about Alcon. We have never ever in our history done deals in one direction because you've got deals going in the other direction. We do whatever deals are there, because they are there and they're available at the right time. And despite in this current environment everybody assuming that there will be lots of businesses for sale and we'd be buying them all up, we're not by anything up. There simply is nothing available that is of any interest to us at the right price strategic.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions for you. The first one is on the water business. At the Investor's seminar at the end of June you suggested that Q2 was going to be a little bit better than Q1 driven by North America, but it seems to have been a little bit worse. Does this mean that some of the non-American markets had quite a sharp deceleration in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question is if you could just talk a little bit more about Eastern Europe? It sounds like there's been some quite conflicting trends going on within that region and if you could give us a bit more detail that would be excellent? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Coming to the water business, first of all, the category was continues to get weaker, as a matter of fact the category in the U.S. and in Western Europe in particular have continued to decline.</p>
          <p>Our share gains in the years, we were up two percentage point in shares, led by our two major brands Poland Springs and Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life. In Europe, in France for example, some of our major brands continue to do well. Vittel is improving its competitive position and Perrier is plus 4%. But we are improving our market shares in a category that is declining and continues to decline.</p>
          <p>Now on the emerging markets, our business there is in double-digit growth and I think it continues to do well. So our issue is not really in the emerging market but our challenge is to find opportunities in North America and some of the key markets here in Western Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Eastern Europe more broadly, we are seeing strong performances in soluble coffee and in culinary, chocolate's a bit weaker, I think that's really the premium end of the chocolate businesses that's struggling a bit. Also our nutrition business is performing very well in Eastern Europe and extremely well in Russia taking share there. I think by geography Russia is enjoying good organic growth although it's quite price-weighted. Poland and the Ukraine are doing very well and that's very much volume driven. So I think broadly we're doing pretty well in Eastern Europe, slightly different trends in different markets, but broadly are performing well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question on the commentary made about the input costs, you said that input costs in the first half were up 3% but that agricultural materials were flat. You've also commented about PET being down. Could you just give us a few examples of those items that, I guess, must have been up quite materially outside agri, commodities and PET, that are driving increase in the 3%? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just &#x2013; let's talk about the agricultural commodities. I think what we have experienced in the first half is an increase in most of the agricultural commodities except dairy. I mean, I'm talking, I'm not talking &#x2013; I'm talking the material changes. So the improvement in dairy has helped us manage the input costs related to agricultural commodities at more or less a flat number.</p>
          <p>The areas where we e are experiencing increase are two. It's on the other raw materials which is really all the meat and the vegetables, the vitamins and the stabilizers. These elements continue to go up at significant rates.</p>
          <p>And on the packaging side, although we are getting some relief on the energy-related packaging, for example PET, the other packaging materials; for example tinplate, is going up at a very, very high rate. I think this year our tinplate cost will be close to 20 to 25%. So it is in line with what we had sort of explained during our previous discussions and that's what we are seeing. So the impact of the total input cost increase on that basket was about 3% which translates to 2% on our total cost of goods.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you some scale: The other raw materials that Jim talked about, that are up significantly, there was around a nine billion spend, so &#x2013; it's a &#x2013; sorry, I'm being corrected: 13 billion spend. So it's a significant amount of money as well.</p>
          <p>I think also, I mean, I think that one of the reasons that we are struggling to &#x2013; sometimes we appear to be struggling to be credible and it's because I think you guys tend to look, to focus on the highs of last year and that therefore seems to be repeat the highs of last year, which isn't necessarily the case. So our start point isn't necessarily as high as your start point when we are looking at our half and half comparisons.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a follow-up on the confectionery business. I'm a bit surprised by the second quarter organic growth. I mean you have profited from Easter, also you mention that first quarter the positive effect you are expecting from Brazil in the second quarter and UK as well. Could you give some more details on whether these have been impulse products that have been weak or give specific product names where you think you had &#x2013; you struggled in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andreas , now I think the Easter impact was more or less felt in &#x2013; the major market was Brazil, because the structure of the trade is different. Easter was not a big mover in the second quarter in the countries where you have a more concentration of the larger stores, the larger traditional grocery stores. So, Brazil had a benefit albeit small, about a week, benefit for Easter in the beginning of April and we have seen that in Brazil the business has done very well.</p>
          <p>I think where we are &#x2013; there are two areas where our confectionery business faced some challenges. First of all, it's on the premium side where we have seen consumers stray down to lower price products. And in Russia where given the high devaluation that has taken place there and the need to take pricing, we're taking pricing but our real internal growth our RIG, our RIG number is negative. So, there are a couple of markets, but I would say overall our business is doing competitively well, particularly in the U.S. and the UK and Brazil.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, may I quickly ask in Russia? The weakness, were these your local brands or your global brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a total, overall it's a market condition where we have taken, by the way our organic growth is positive, it's the RIG that is weak in Russia. And it is not &#x2013; it is a general business condition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe one follow-up. It seems to me that some of your competitors have been much more aggressive in terms of marketing and they're showing lower profitability increases than you do at first half stage. Do you think in hindsight you should have been more aggressive and do you think there is a risk that there will be even more aggressive price competition in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas , we can't speak for the competition but our first half results, as I said, are solid and improving and it's a combination &#x2013; it's focus on profitable growth. And we are investing in our brands, so we are not cutting back our brand investments, our investments in a relationship with our trade, and the launch of new products. We are not. As a matter of fact we are spending more as we have communicated early in this conference call. So, I really can't speak for the competition but we are very focused on a total performance framework for our company. That's our strategy, and that's the way the company is being managed. And by the way, we &#x2013; our market share positions across the world continue to improve.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question. There are no more questions in the queue. I will now hand you back over to Mr. Singh.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Thank you very much for your patience. As &#x2013; just as a quick summary, I'd like to classify organic growth in the first half as robust and balanced in view of the environment, especially as it is building on a strong performance in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>This is particularly true as it has been delivered was also achieving an improvement in EBIT margin, both reported and constant currency and whilst increasing our investment in our brands both from marketing and R&amp;D. In other words, in keeping with a Nestl&#xE9; model, we have delivered both on the top-line and on EBIT margin.</p>
          <p>We have also delivered a solid performance on cash flow. I think it is therefore very important to put our overall performance in this perspective, in terms of a balanced profitable growth where you have strong organic growth combined with improvement in margins and also an improvement in our cash flows.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year as we said before, we will continue to focus on accelerating those initiatives that drive both growth and efficiencies, such that we can expect an improvement in organic growth for the second half of the year from where we are currently. Thank you.</p>
