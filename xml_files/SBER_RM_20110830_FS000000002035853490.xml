          <p>Good day and welcome to the Sberbank Second Quarter 2011 IFRS Results Release Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Anton Karamzin, Deputy Chairman of the Board and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. And as usual, we are very pleased to welcome everybody on our quarterly call. We are also quite pleased to have posted very satisfactory results. Our net profit for the first half of 2011 reached RUB176.1 billion or 8 rubles, 12 kopeck [RUB8.12] per ordinary share, which is almost a three-fold increase for the comparable part of 2010.</p>
          <p>I hope everybody has had a chance to see our press release, the accounts themselves and the PowerPoint presentation on our website. All of the three documents are on our website in the usual place in the Shareholders and Investors section in both languages, Russian and English.</p>
          <p>We also have heard some feedback from some of the investors and some of the participants of the call that our decision a while ago back in 2010 to be holding these calls not on the same day we announce the results, but on a day later, is not really convenient for participants, although that change back in 2010 was also done by us to accommodate some of the requests and the basic reasons for that were to give some people &#x2013; give people some time to run the model to prepare a little bit more detailed questions before we actually go live and talk to everyone. And also due to some logistical warning that people needed a couple of days in advance given that people are listening in from different parts of the world, particularly in the Americas.</p>
          <p>However, I would like to ask those of you who have a view and have a preference on whether we should switch back to having the call on the evening of the same day we announce, we release the accounts or keeping it as we're running it now to write to us in the usual email address for the Investor Relations service, Investor Relations department in Sberbank or leave a message in our website in all the usual contacts.</p>
          <p>With that, I would very much welcome everyone to start asking the questions on the account. So please, welcome.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Alex Kantarovich of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan speaking. Anton, I have a couple of questions, one of them is about operating costs. We noted that the growth of OpEx in the second quarter was 32% year-on-year and specifically cost increased 16% quarter-on-quarter, which looks a bit steep. And I just want to clarify the guidance for the full year if possible of our operating cost growth. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Alex. I would refer you to the slide 15 in our presentation that actually shows all of these numbers graphically pretty well. And again, as we mentioned on the press call yesterday, given that the results that we are publishing are proving to be better than we were estimating closer to the beginning of the year. We have withdrawn our profits outlook and core financial results outlook and official forecast for the full year.</p>
          <p>And as the market is aware, the current shareholder, the majority shareholder, the Central Bank of Russia is considering a sale of a part of its holding in Sberbank and notwithstanding any probability or particular timing of this transaction; we are under legal restriction to issue a forecast on core numbers for 2011. Therefore, I would try to give you some color on what we see through the accounts so that you can draw your conclusions on how things are going forward on your own and the reason why I referred to slide 15 that it actually gives you a little bit of an idea on how the costs are flowing and have been flowing on a quarterly basis for past five quarters..</p>
          <p>And you will see that a particular 32% growth number is quarter-to-quarter, plus if you look at half-year to half-year, it actually is 28% and in addition to the usual seasonality that you would see that normally smoothes out the number is a quarter-to-quarter comparison number. On a later stage, I would also refer to the fact that in the first-half or actually especially in the second quarter of 2010, we haven't really started our program of bringing up the pay levels to most kind of massive professions within Sberbank.</p>
          <p>And therefore, this is the particularly contrasting quarter-on-quarter parameter because it's really from the second-half 2010 that we started this effort. So, that figure itself, 32%, is a little bit misleading from the standpoint of being too short a period to compare. And of course, there is some usual seasonality that works up things a little bit differently. So I'd rather be more looking at the 28.4% growth half-year on half-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand loud and clear. Also, if I may ask about a very good result in the other items of revenue, I'm referring to non-interest income and not fees and commissions, there was a very strong figure there. If we can get some color on what is behind it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the people have been asking us this question offline in the course of past day or so. And the concern we've heard is that &#x2013; are these kind of one-off things that are not going to sustainably repeated going forward, and therefore, they should be treated like that.</p>
          <p>Largely, the allowances of those numbers, and of course, I'm not disclosing the factual details, but the allowances actually show that this is mostly regular, not one-off, revenue flows that are generated on the books of the bank itself. And, of the RUB17 billion that we're looking at &#x2013; RUB17 billion odd that we're looking, there is &#x2013; I think about half of that flow is coming off of the books of the bank, and these are kind of regular revenue inflows other than from core banking things, but they're repeatable and similarly so, there is other subsidiaries of ours that generate those numbers.</p>
          <p>Yes, one of the bigger ones is Sberbank Capital and people have been asking, are these one-off revenues of Sberbank Capital selling some of the non-core assets? Well, actually, in the second quarter and the first-half overall, they are not, those are rather assets which we have kind of revitalized, which started generating ongoing revenue flows from the main core business lines, and what we are in kind of asset preservation and preparing to sell them mode.</p>
          <p>So these things would therefore mean that, of course, those type of revenue flows aren't going to stay there forever, but once we sell them, sooner or later, that will be associated with some cash inflow in favor of Sberbank and therefore, that will not necessarily be associated with negative P&amp;L impact. So this is the nature of those numbers and the color behind them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my last question if possible is related to the recent market volatility and given that you have a sizable portfolio of securities if Q3 would show any negative number or any big impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would first reiterate that we don't have a European sovereign or bank debt on our books, and in the form of securities or any other instruments that would be subject to significant volatility. So if you ask me what's the impact from those things that are particularly volatile in Europe or actually elsewhere in the world, the kind of P&amp;L impact from that is comparable to rounding error on our books.</p>
          <p>In terms of the financial impact on those types of securities that are on our balance sheet that has the rest of the market moves also react, there's some P&amp;L impact that we see. But we think now are operating an optimal mix of portfolios between short-term trading exposures available for sale and held to maturity and the characteristics of our loan portfolio is such that &#x2013; of course, available- for-sale posts revaluation gains and losses not to the P&amp;L directly, but to the comprehensive income statement.</p>
          <p>But the parameters of our securities, the debt portfolio particularly, which is more than 93% of the overall book, are such that they are basically very high-quality and a pretty short-term duration. Therefore, given whatever temporary revaluation gains we post, we have no doubts about the creditworthiness of the issuers and therefore, no concerns of the ability to service the debt and to repay the principal. So at the moment, we are seeing a little or no effect on the P&amp;L and even if there Is more volatility to come this quarter, we are feeling comfortable that we can handle it.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Andrew Keeley of Troika Dialog. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening, Anton. A couple of questions from me. First of all, on the provisioning trends, and that you've said on kind of previous calls that perhaps we couldn't extrapolate the provision release we saw in the first quarter through to the rest of the year. Obviously, we saw another release in the second quarter, albeit smaller. I'm just wondering if you can give a bit of color in terms of what you see for the second half of the year. And clearly, NPLs are starting to trend down. Do you think that you're going to maintain your provision coverage ratio around about 150%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two things; one is, of course, I'm somewhat restricted in what I can say. But also, we will reiterate the fact that we pretty much repeat on every call that the coverage ratio itself as a &#x2013; an aggregated measure is not something that we directly manage, it's a consequence of us managing individual levels of provisions for any particular transactional exposure that we have on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, it may fluctuate a little bit and being where it is actually, at a very comfortable level, we kind of see no concerns or possible worries either for us or anyone else with that.</p>
          <p>But in terms of what we see again for &#x2013; with the risk of being something boring, let's just say that yes; because of our individual approach, it is a bit of a lumpy process. And it is unfair to extrapolate and to simply say, okay, take the provision line, whatever is there, double it to see what the full year is going to be.</p>
          <p>But let me say to you the following, as we are withdrawing our profit outlook for the full year, net profit outlook for the full year based on the quality of our results, in the first half, I would also like to withdraw the previous guidance that I have given on the provision line and the provision line guidance we have been giving as being a debit, i.e., as cost charge on the full year. So I'm withdrawing that guidance. I'm afraid I cannot say more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very clear. My second question is on your margin dynamics, I mean there was a good second quarter and I think you made some comments yesterday saying that you weren't really seeing any particularly adverse impact on loan demand from the kind of market turbulence we've seen in August.</p>
          <p>Given that lending has been picking up quite nicely, and your retail exposure is growing and the retail mix seems to be improving, and the corporate loan rates, we're already getting sector data showing that corporate loan rates are actually perhaps starting to rise. Are you fairly upbeat that the margin in the second half of the year can be around or higher than the 6.5% level we saw in the second quarter? Obviously, I'm not expecting you to give a &#x2013; any firm number but kind of..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew, you're actually formulating it very well, helping me to do my job. Actually, what I was going to say, obviously anticipating that question, is that we are &#x2013; in terms of the factors that drive the margin, at the moment, both the tactical ones which are the ones that you just listed and you didn't miss a single one and a longer one &#x2013; a longer-term one such as unique client access, reputable brand like 47 markets &#x2013; the 47% market share in retail deposits, they are all still in place. And therefore, we see no threat to them disappearing all of a sudden because of whatever is going on at the moment now.</p>
          <p>We also are seeing that in the more recent operating data that is included in the accounts in the past couple of months of &#x2013; in the last couple of months of the first half of the year is that if you dissect the margin, it is more &#x2013; previously, the positive impact or kind of the slower compression of the margin was driven largely by the fact that we are aggressively pressing down on the cost of the funding in terms of the retail deposits and any type of liability, but in the rates we were sticking to the priority &#x2013; in the assets we were sticking to the priority of the market share.</p>
          <p>Now, all our focused efforts in the marketing our loan products, all across the segments and the product lines in retail and corporate are starting to yield into the better margins and contribute kind of bigger share of positive impact into the margin, a little bit in terms of dynamics is a little bit better than from the cost of the liabilities which we foresee as a &#x2013; which we see as a very good impact that that becomes kind of another driver of sustainability of the margins. So, so far, again, I see no threats to those basic tactical and strategic drivers that keep the margins sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, are you seeing that you're having some kind of better ability in terms of increasing the lending rates on the corporate side? I mean it seems that generally, perhaps people are kind of pricing risk a little bit more kind of aggressively now. And do you feel that there is some leeway for us for putting rates up on the corporate side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see because the rates negotiation on the corporate side aren't like you make a public offer like on the retail and you put it on your website and it's a step move. It's &#x2013; our loan portfolio is largely classic, vanilla textbook, bilateral loan. And therefore, the negotiation is individual in any particular case.</p>
          <p>What we have been seeing consistently ever since I'd say late third quarter of last year, amen, for almost for a year is that due for a number of reasons that we will discuss on this call seems like somewhat high inflation, et cetera, that the actual contractual rates that we &#x2013; our credit officers manage to negotiate with the clients have been gradually growing at almost a linear pace ever since.</p>
          <p>And because those things start filtering into the margin and into the P&amp;L with a bit of a time lag as we've also discussed on these calls before, at least of a quarter or even two sometimes. So we see that these trends continue now and which means it will be filtering through the margins for &#x2013; with the same time lag like things that are being negotiated today will be seen in a quarter or two down the road.</p>
          <p>So when we measure the interest differential, i.e., the snapshot of the negotiated trade on our asset and liabilities all across the balance sheet as of now and calculate the interest differential of what it would have been by the end of the year if our balance sheet just frozen from today, so &#x2013; and measure it like every month and compare that measurement every month, so that interest rate differential has been growing consistently all the way through the first half of 2011 and almost two quarters in the previous year. So I hope that gives you enough color to make your conclusions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's great. Thanks so much, Anton.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from David Nangle of Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Dave Nangle from Renaissance. Hey, Anton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, then. Yeah, if I can just follow on in the margin comment, obviously you gave a lot of detail but it is an interesting one. Just on slide 11 of your presentation, obviously you were seeing a downward trajectory in the cost of individual term deposits. I think it's the 4.4% in Q2. And when and where does this bottom out? Obviously, you've been repricing down for the past few quarters and obviously, you've stopped repricing down, I assume of your new retail deposits, but where does this trajectory end and at what level, can you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, Dave, this is a little bit more of a tricky one for us and even not so much for the legal reasons I mentioned but for competitive. As many of you know, you do your independent marketing research and just count some of the websites on the public offers and the rates that the banking sector offers to the retail depositors, everybody knows that the rest of the market is pretty much almost pricing on the simple formula of Sberbank <mark type="ph" /> tax (23:45) basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and we tend to be not really aiming to compete on price there, but rather on quality of our products, accessibility, convenience, speed &#x2013; a close match to what people actually as savers would want to have and how they would want to apportion parts of their savings to different types of savings products. So &#x2013; and that is where we are focusing.</p>
          <p>So, I wouldn't want to give signals as to when we are seeing things because that really impacts the rates and even in an inflationary environment in the country, on one side. On another side, it is continuing to be not the primary driver for us getting the more attractive mix in our funding cost; the biggest &#x2013; big things are the quality of our product line and quality of our marketing effort.</p>
          <p>And also, I would say, to some extent, the factor of not really lowering the rate, but changing the mix and the preference of the savers maybe to switch to shorter &#x2013; to some parts of their money to shorter tenures with smaller rates but more frequent ability to reprice sometimes have those effects. I'm not saying this is what we are exactly seeing, but I'm saying is there is a mix of the factors that actually impact how these things show up on slide 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But does that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't able to be a bit more specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair, but I thought the downward trajectory isn't yet over. That's fair to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has slowed down a little bit in the recent months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's hard to say because again, the jury is also a little bit out on the inflation. We've seen how fast it has been picking up in the first half of the year and we have seen again now how we kind of slowed down a little bit, so &#x2013; and I think it's pretty much an interesting bet out there amongst the experts in the market what will be the end result by the end of the year actually given the market environment, the business environment, and the fact that we are in a pre-election year and with a fiscal policy particularly is associated with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, that's fair. I won't push more on that. And what's the official line, the artificial party line regarding the FPO? Because obviously, there is lots of noise going around in the markets on it. And what can you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The official party line remains what exactly the authorized speaker on this topic from the selling shareholder from the Central Bank was Mr. Ulyukaev has mentioned I think a week or two ago to the press that the selling shareholder is watching the situation very carefully and will make their decision at an appropriate time, and we are not authorized to say anything more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and final question just on the regional expansion and I know you get linked to more banks than you are interested in. But I guess the question that comes back to us from investors is why with so much on your plate within Russia, so much to do and so much potential, do you even think about going beyond the Russian market and the Russian base into new markets, et cetera? And what would be the response to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The response is actually very simple, it is a long-term view. We see regions like CIS and Eastern Europe having good potential in whatever terms you look at it, market penetration, absolute size and scale, growth potential. <mark type="ph" /> NREs are having strength (27:56) on that and how much competitive advantage you can also bring over from Russia to those markets if you are smart and wise.</p>
          <p>So we therefore have said, okay, as a long-term, you want to make ourselves the &#x2013; for the benefit of our shareholders, we want to make ourselves the part of some of bigger world and in those parts where the ROEs and the returns to the shareholders could be of similar quality to Russia. But we are not losing our head with it. Yes, this new slogan is probably bigger than the real interest is as you usually expect it to be. But we always referred people back to the strategy that in its international section that we have adopted for the five years between 2008 and 2014.</p>
          <p>We are saying that the very aggressive and ambitious start for us would be by 2014, to have 5% of our total revenues coming in from outside of the Russia and this is exactly the proportion of the focus that we give to it, not more, not less. So people shouldn't be afraid that we are distracting ourselves because we are not and any targets that we look at even though some of them are quoted as &#x2013; turn out to be bluff by the press and speculators are actually pretty compact and that's the other criteria that we use.</p>
          <p>In these days when you do banking acquisitions anywhere in Europe, Eastern or Western, the bigger the size, the bigger the problem you're probably looking at. So compact is not a good year for us for things to be transparent, easily cleanable and easily integratable. So with that, I am also hoping to send the right signal to the analyst and investor community saying, look, we are not losing our head with it, we're being very wise and pragmatic about that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have a few questions. Just first of all, I just wanted to get an idea of your thoughts or maybe take the opportunity of the market weakness to buy back shares, either the ordinaries or depressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob, again those things are somewhat difficult for me to talk about given the situation we are in. So let me be considerate with my words. We kind of have been discussing buybacks on these calls for a while and there is no particular announcement on this topic that we tend to do today. For us, share buybacks are one of the options available to us when we are looking at any surplus capital that we may have and we do have some and are considering various alternatives to deploy it and again mostly with a view to increasing the shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>So we have &#x2013; as you know, we had recently revised our dividend policy to increase the share of the payback that we give to the investors. And we continue to see kind of significant growth pace in our business and as I've just mentioned in the previous question in terms of make some disciplined acquisitions, especially when the strategic value kind of is compelling. So &#x2013; but at this stage, we have not taken any decisions to whether we should implement any buyback, for how much and in what framework?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a Tier 1 ratio of just over 13%, so you would have some headroom, is the &#x2013; I think I mean your internal target is to have a ratio of 10% or better. I mean is there any &#x2013; I mean is that 10% still intact or is it more reasonable to assume that I mean we should be looking at 11% or 11.5% estimated level given maybe, yeah, just to retain some headroom for maybe M&amp;A or maybe more volatile market conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I probably wouldn't be prepared to give you a more specific target, but I hope everyone on this call and then in the broader audience have had enough observations about the behavior of our team with respect to capital management and that we like our business well capitalized and in a strong combination with still turning out good ROEs and what's even more important in combination with good ROA is ROE with relatively low leverage. So we therefore will kind of continue to be &#x2013; for the sake of repeating the same words, wise and pragmatic about this, but we are not prepared to give out any particular anchor kind of level that we have in our minds about this. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. No, that's fair enough. Regarding yeah &#x2013; maybe not regarding &#x2013; but maybe it is I think it'd be after all the &#x2013; your deposit rate cuts, finally the loan growth is exceeding deposit growth, so that scooted the &#x2013; I just wanted to get an idea of what kind of loan-to-deposit ratio you feel comfortable with? Could that move to over 90% or would that be a point where you would be rather thinking of maybe definitely an end to deposit rate cuts to maybe even increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean any loans-to-deposit ratio that's below 100 is probably comfortable zone and it will be risking something a bit too conservative if we were to get nervous about things that are below that. So, so far, we have been in the liabilities focusing on market share versus &#x2013; sorry, on the costs versus the market share being the priority &#x2013; cost being the priority. We haven't yet taken a decision to make a turn to flip those two and that to again how near that decision might be, we're not yet ready to share those views because we haven't yet come close enough to that decision. Whether we will come to it before the year-end, there is no 100% probability answer in either negative or affirmative. So it may happen this year, it may not happen this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, I mean do you have any questions about just the capital market volatility but just a more general &#x2013; I just wanted to get a sense of your observations on just on the macro environment in Russia. We're getting some mixed signals and you're probably in the best position to give an idea of what you see is going on, whether credit demand is showing any signs of hesitation, some slowdown or not. So I would be very interested to get any indications regarding that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Bob, it's &#x2013; you're obviously not the first one I'm hearing that question since we published the result, but also not the first one I'm hearing the question from in the past two, three weeks as we've seen the volatility in the market. But I'm somewhat perplexed myself with when people start asking the question that soon after there's been three or four weeks of some market volatility. Okay, it may be painful, but it is so far in the context of the global kind of Russian macro and how the real sector works and Russian financial sector works, still proven to be quite distant from it.</p>
          <p>Okay, there has been volatility in securities markets, yes, fine, but we know that Russia is not overleveraged to debt market, debt instruments. Yes, there have been some currencies volatilities, but, okay, still within the boundaries that the Russian market can handle and has been handling bigger things in a much calmer fashion than people will think now. And the oil is largely where it has been, again look, there has been some volatility in its price, but from the macro context that you're asking that question, it is there.</p>
          <p>So even if there were reasons for the Russian real sector and Russian consumer confidence to suffer from any of that, the early warning signals would start coming in as far as the banking sector is observing them with time lag of a few months. So it is &#x2013; we consider ourselves very sophisticated in seeing the early warning signals and deciphering them and interpreting them. In fact, it was us back in the early autumn of 2008 when Russia was almost blissfully unaware of what's cooking up, but we were one of the first ones who were starting running around in the professional and banking community and with the governor saying, look, guys, we are seeing better things coming.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but even from that perspective, I don't see the basis for any concerns to be observable by us now and we're not observing anything. We see what the accounts is &#x2013; which is published are showing to us continuing through the operating data for July and August. We're putting pressure on our business units to keep the pace, to not lose the focus, and we are aware that should there be early warning signals for us to change our appetite to REIT, for example.</p>
          <p>We have the systems and the right caliber of people to detect us soon enough and to take the adequate decisions soon enough. But the time has not come yet and to that extent, I consider this question being pretty big, and I want people to not react that quickly to something that objectively cannot change that quickly as yet, and that should probably help the overall stability of the markets and the businesses in Russia.</p>
          <p>I understand that historically we have all gone through too many shocks and therefore kind of &#x2013; haven't been doing <mark type="ph" /> well (41:32) on milk, we are blowing on water, but I don't think there is a reason for feeling like that now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Anton, and congratulations on very strong results. Excuse me if I duplicate some other previous questions, but could you give some color on potential loan growth? I mean, if we look at the structure of Sberbank assets and liabilities, it looks like most of the loan growth in the first half of this year was financed by the redemption of the Central Bank bonds in Sberbank's securities portfolio. And by now, these holdings for these bonds have actually decreased to zero. So how would you expect to finance the loan growth down the road, either from &#x2013; possibly from further reduction of the securities portfolio in other kinds of bonds or in any other ways? Please elaborate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, a discussion hasn't been out yet. So, the answer is that, yeah, we should be looking separately at what's the mix of our portfolio and what the size of it in relation to the rest of the balance sheet. The mix is &#x2013; the mix decisions are taken for the groups managing the liquidity, marketing, currency risk, et cetera &#x2013; market and currency risks, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But the overall approach remains the following. We have excessive liquidity. This is represented in the loans-to-deposit ratio being relatively low-ish, i.e., sub 70%. We would normally aim to have a balance sheet structure that is a bit close to textbook 70%, 75% loans to assets. And therefore, we will in the near term continue to fuel our loan growth by somewhat reducing the size of our securities portfolio and, yeah, basically, this is the approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there are no &#x2013; are there any preferences of what kind of fixed income instruments to reduce in &#x2013; by the first stage or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, this is the strategy and tactics of our portfolio managers, and I don't think it will be appropriate for us to disclose that to anyone. I don't think any of our competitors do that. That's just the way we manage the composition of our securities portfolio. Besides, the size of our positions is such that if I were to give any hint on how we &#x2013; on any preferences we might have, you can imagine the impact on the price of those instruments. So, I would refrain from doing so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I will ask my one question on fee income. I was a little bit disappointed with the pace of growth. I thought &#x2013; I think it was 13% year-on-year. That's quite a bit slower than asset growth. I realize there is some seasonality. But can you maybe just give us some color on what's driving your fee income and what the outlook is going forward, and your strategy on fees going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And well, there is a bit of an effect there that actually reflects the fact that we've dramatically changed our fee composition on the loan &#x2013; on the retail loan products in exactly the second quarter of 2010. I can even give you the date, 19 of April, which for IFRS purposes has a bit less impact, of course, than on Russian accounts because it mostly deals with loan-related commissions.</p>
          <p>But still some of the commissions' structure in retail business was also changed and therefore, in the third quarter, 2011 versus 2010, the comparison is going to be a bit more consistent, and you will see better percentages. And that &#x2013; again, I would also refer a comparison on first half to first half this year and last which is <mark type="ph" /> certainly easing by far, (47:32) so &#x2013; but that is one of the reasons.</p>
          <p>The other reason is really seasonality, of course, and the other effect that I would also point out towards is that a lot of the transactional products that we do that attract those fees and commissions are getting more and more automated and as far as the client interface, they're moved into the remote channels. And I would refer everyone to our strategic target of moving the transactions &#x2013; client transactions in retail from a branch physical presence to a remote channel like terminals and Internet and mobile from 25% back in 2007 and '08 to 75% of all the transactions.</p>
          <p>We are halfway through in terms of the execution of our strategic timing, but we are getting close to 65% of transactions in remote channel. This has a dramatic impact on the cost of processing those. So, we might have kind of cheaper tariffs and not charging people that much for the transactions that involve human handling and interface, which we price pretty aggressively and expensively to stimulate people going away into the remote channels for simple stuff and really freeing up the client offices' time to attend to the issues and tasks and products that the clients want to discuss.</p>
          <p>So, there is another benefit to that process that actually shows up in some of the processing costs and people costs and head count numbers that we optimize in the cost side of the P&amp;L. So I wouldn't be that disappointed with these numbers for those reasons because, again, this is changing the structure and then the mix of the products and the commissions we charge and there is another, beyond the surface, positive feedback that accompanies that financially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And just on that point that you're pushing clients towards indirect channels, I mean, have you seen an ability to actually reduce staff as a result of that, or I mean if you can give us an update on the staff outlook, maybe I'm surreptitiously, kind of stealthily  asking a second question, sorry about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Not only that (50:17), I mean, I'll refer us back to slide 15. We've been previously looking at it on this call in the top side in terms of the ruble amounts of numbers, but the bottom part of the graph shows the actual head count, and we continue to reduce quarter after quarter, gradually. So &#x2013; and you can see that the reductions aren't kind of that aggressive as they've been like in 2009, but the only reason for that is that whilst we continued to pretty aggressively cut people in those functions that were mundane and routine and kind of automated, we, at the same time, are beefing up our head count and costs associated with processing more business volumes.</p>
          <p>For example, as we were talking sometime ago that our business plan target of getting from 2 million to 3 million credit cards in 2011, we're kind of almost through that just after half-year results and this type of a business requires a very good-quality call center with people trained well enough and fast enough to pick up the phone within the two beeps and trained well enough to give you good quality of service with whatever inquiry you might have, for example.</p>
          <p>So beefing up this capacity where we need it, where we know this is a very lucrative and a good, profitable business, give back to head count numbers as well. So net-net, we're still managing to shrink. We take this as a new business volume &#x2013; new business as a new business volume coming in through beefing up some of the head count, but we're also cutting even more to keep the overall number down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. And I'll be quite brief with one question. The question is on asset quality for the medium term to avoid any sort of guidance issues. What are your thoughts on sort of post '09, '10 reversal cycle? Because effectively, we have, over 2009-2010, accumulated about 10% of your loans effectively in provisions. Now, year-to-date, we have sort of reversed about 1.5% worse.</p>
          <p>Now, we know that <mark type="ph" /> pasts are different (53:05) from previous experiences like that some of the banking systems have sort of had reversal cycles anywhere between sort of 3% to 5% over, of course, sort of two to three years. What are your thoughts there and where do you think that sort of that reversal cycle in the medium term may sort of be? Because also you sort of hinted on the fact that this year, we're likely to see zero or positive provisioning charge, which sort of implies some sort of a continuing of what we've seen in the first half of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right in putting the question in a bit more medium to long-term horizon to avoid the restrictions on the forecast that we can &#x2013; that we are bound by. But the outlook is that &#x2013; okay, the length of the loan recovery cycle in Russia, as we've said before, is a little bit slower than in more sophisticated and developed banking sectors and in countries in the world.</p>
          <p>But, we are actually as we go through that recovery cycle and we kind of are getting over the mid hump, we are making quite some positive discoveries for ourselves. We actually are seeing that, specifically the Sberbank team is able &#x2013; is capable of achieving the recovery rate on various types of products and loan and recovery strategies and types of collaterals that we have that are much closer to what is achievable and sophisticated &#x2013; more sophisticated legal environments in systems and banking sectors, or a judicial environment. And that is kind of a positive surprise.</p>
          <p>That is why we are consistently beating our own forecast on how much we're going to recover on the loans and therefore how much of an associated P&amp;L credit released back from provisions is coming through. So, therefore, our perception so far has been extremely positive.</p>
          <p>That is more even remarkable, even in our own eyes, is that &#x2013; because three years ago, when it was all starting, our budget recovery was actually very small and not fit and sophisticated enough to deal with the size of the issues we'll have.</p>
          <p>So, we at the same time are achieving those high recovery rates understanding that we've had to build the function from scratch, get the people trained and hired, and get the automation systems in place, et cetera. So, if before I would have never said a thing like or I can probably refer to comparable previous cycle statistics on the recovery rates that the developed countries have seen, but we're now kind of comfortable that yeah, we're getting close to some of the best recovery rates that people have historically observed in more sophisticated banking sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so just to follow up on this, how much rollback to the positive surprised you were from the perspective of the percentage of the book over the next to the full year? What numbers are we talking about? Are we talking another 2%, another 5% potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're getting into the territory where I am bound by restrictions. You announced &#x2013; you started asking your questions pretty well, oh!, yeah, I won't asking about the specific numbers, let's just talk about the principal things, and I lost it exactly like you preferred it, and the next one is how much is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:11). I am afraid, I cannot answer right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You know it was coming, but let me just sort of rephrase it. Those very positive numbers are also sort of have a certain element of new non-performing loans generation, which I suppose is sort of a business as usual as well. Could you also just give us a view of how &#x2013; what is the ratio of your new NPL formation, literally just the new flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, without telling just the specific number, I'll say two things. Firstly, there are still some aftershocks although they are not really visible and material, but it's just a matter of a color that these things do exist in principle that some of the companies that have been holding on for dear life through great difficulty caused by sudden external <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:16) prices.</p>
          <p>Some of them, a small portion of that kind of says, look, I can't hold it anymore, the sales forecast for whatever they produce or sell. Not optimistic enough for them to see that they'll work out that through the debt burden in a reasonable time. So some of the people are still, as a matter of aftershock from two, three years from now, are letting it go and go bad.</p>
          <p>But also, obviously, the second thing I would say is that the new NPL formation is getting to being not very significantly higher than we've seen pre-crisis, and I'm not talking pre-crisis like the status of the past years in the Northeast but kind of on a more averaged out longer period like between '98 and &#x2013; or maybe we should include &#x2013; exclude '98 like between '99 and 2008 on that horizon. So it's not materially different from that.</p>
          <p>And what is driving that I think is that people have become more wise. I mean, there is no like headless overleveraging that people are used to have been engaged back in those times because they haven't been burned for. So people have become &#x2013; practicing safer risk approach with respect to their funding.</p>

          <p>Hi, one question in two parts, if I may. Are you able to say anything more about VBI, and if so, do you still think it's compact? And secondly, in Russia, you did talk previously about a need for perhaps a partner in consumer credit, and I wondered whether now, you're more focused on doing it yourself or whether there are still areas that you would feel happier or you could progress faster if you do it with somebody else? Thanks.</p>

There's been some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01:10) in the press  about us potentially lowering the price, but I will not &#x2013; I would not like to comment more specifically on that. What I could say is that negotiations are progressing and yes, we do believe that it is compact and adjustable as from the standpoint of business scale.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of consumer credit and more specifically what is known as POS loans, point-of-sale loans, this is the market that for quite some time we've been talking about we wanted to getting a little bit of a footprint there, and it may not that much have been mentioned in the Russian press, but actually if you monitor with the Russian press, you would have discovered that we've actually announced that we are negotiating a partnership with a subsidiary by BNP Paribas in Russia, which has a subsidiary called Cetelem that sells POS loans under its own brand.</p>
          <p>And we are in the negotiations to finalize this partnership, the resolution planned for quarter three this year and the full launch of the partnership is expected in the first half of next year. And this JV actually aims to &#x2013; the way we put it, to create a successful business, beneficial for both parties and for the loan markets as a whole. The partnership will use a concept that has been designed by Cetelem, but is supported by the attitude of Sberbank for responsible lending and not being extortionate on the margins for the consumer and therefore, would result in providing very kind of clear in terms of bank products for clients at reasonable rates.</p>

          <p>I just had a very quick question on funding, please. I know there was a bond done earlier in the year. Could you just update us on your issuance plans for the rest of this year and maybe 2012 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There aren't any particular plans that have been turned up by now, but as many people have been observing us, the approach we like to those things is that keep our debt investors universe well aware of what's going on and comfortable with our yield curve and the liquidity levels and the depth of trading in our instruments, which allows us to be making pretty quick decision in terms of timing as to whenever we need to put another dot on the yield curve and come up with another bond or a syndicated loan and do that relatively quickly as the windows of good opportunities open.</p>
          <p>Those things are, again, driven not that much by the fact that we might need the money, because as you can see from our balance sheet, the share of wholesale funding as compared to the rest of the funding trustee is like 3 percentage points, 4 percentage points, I think more than that. So, it is rather to maintain the visibility on the bond market and to &#x2013; this is the status of the instrument that is very much liked by the investors.</p>
          <p>So, within these two premises like using the opportunities, quick access, and decisions on one side and keeping the visibility and the likeliness &#x2013; and likeness, we're going to continue to use those approaches.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Rustam Botashev from UniCredit Securities. My question is about VBI Volksbanken. Given that you are still like well prepared to make any acquisition, you definitely have a plan what to do with this bank. I'm just wondering, what kind of a return on equity do you expect VBI to deliver by 2013 and what kind of a sustainable return on equity do you expect from this bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, the deal is not closed yet. So, it would be inappropriate for me to make any outlook there. But again, as I have mentioned earlier on this call, I don't really intend it &#x2013; about doing something that would make our investors feel uncomfortable about this. This is all in the long-term pursuit of sustainable ROEs of about 20%, that will kind of continue to be the primary focus of ours beyond the next five years, like into the next 10, 15 years. That's the main goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I understand that the deal is not closed, but before &#x2013; maybe you announced the &#x2013; about &#x2013; it was on your webpage, right, and so you have a business plan for this bank, I assume and in this business plan, you have some kind of an expected return, but I also assume that. Maybe I'm wrong, but anyway, so you said that you expect 20% return on equity long-term from VBI. Is there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no, no, don't misread me, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 20% is the combined ROE for the Sberbank Group that sits in our strategy for the five years. That's the target I'm referring to and again, I understand &#x2013; I hear your logic and I understand &#x2013; I clearly hear your question, but again, it's just that I'm not allowed to share this type of guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe you can tell me then what would you do differently from the existing management to improve the profitability, if you can share with me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think this is actually a very much relevant question to ask, especially at this point in time, because the existing management of most banks has been operating in pretty different macro and micro circumstances. And from the standpoint of financial position, a lot of that is changing at the moment actually, regardless of whether the transaction is going on.</p>
          <p>So, whatever the management would have been, the old one or the new one, would have had to deploy totally different approaches or quite significantly, different approaches to what needs to be done with the retail banking businesses and then corporate banking businesses in the countries with a presence of that group. So again, besides, we are operating from the standpoint that we have quite unique competitive advantages ourselves that we believe are transferable across the border that any other European bank management wouldn't have access to. So, that's as much as I can say.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Ivan Kachkovski from Aton. My question is on preferred shares. Three months ago on the AGM, Mr. Gref was quoted as saying that the Bank might consider conversion of preferred shares into commons. And the question is, if there are any particular plans or timeline on that or probably, if you put another way, is the issue of conversion on the Bank's agenda at all? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There isn't any specific guidance or decisions that are there for us to share with you. We haven't made any specific decisions beyond what Mr. Gref has mentioned back then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take our final question from Ronny Rehn of KBW. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, all right, good afternoon. A last question should be fairly quick. In your July RAS results, you alluded to an increased operating risk-weighted assets has hit you on sort of the local capital adequacy calculation and when should we expect this for sort of the IFRS accounts to come into effect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm not sure I have gotten the question right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I mean, the current calculation in the IFRS accounts doesn't include the operating risk, but I think the bank &#x2013; the Russian banking regulator does that already. It's been phased in from 2010 over 2011 to 2012. And when should we expect this to come into force or support the accounts that we see in our end and sort of the IFRS side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. I've got it, I've got it. Well, I don't think there is going to be material impact even from next year. So, besides, we have internally been doing pretty sophisticated measurements of our operating risk and regardless of the pace that the regulators want to take with it, we've been actually starting to gradually transfer to the advanced approach in measuring those.</p>
          <p>So, whenever conversions of Russian standards to Basel II is going to practically happen, we are positioning ourselves in such a way that it shouldn't have material financial impact or capital adequacy requirement impact on Sberbank. We have enough focus and attention on this in terms of our house experts and kind of enough resources from IT and financial standpoint to put the necessary risk management practices under the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:13:44) in place so that we have the smallest possible impact from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and the full impact on the Russian sort of regulation, how much was the &#x2013; and you mentioned in the last press release, it was like 60 basis points for the last &#x2013; for the second phase of the introduction. And so, it sounds like it's roughly about 200 basis points for the total operating risk. Is that miscalculated or how do I read this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think this is the right way to calculate it. I actually also do not recollect that's alluding to like 60 basis points or something. What we were, if anything, saying in public is that the overall impact, and it's not specifically relating to I guess operating <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:14:42) or anything like that, the overall impact that was calculated on the difference between Basel I and Basel II calculation is less than a percentage point, and that, by the time that it gets implemented, it's probably going to get even less for us. So, just to exemplify the fact that we're comfortable, we are pretty advanced in-house internally in how we measure those things and that is the source of the comfort. But we're not giving any guidance in terms of whether it's 60 basis points or any other particular number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, no, I'm just trying to get &#x2013; just reading from your press release, the marginal operating risk impact and the capital adequacy ratio is estimated at 0.6% as of August 1, 2011. So, that's sort of &#x2013; that's what you write. So, that's why I calculated this 2 percentage point, which sounded pretty high basically. So, you are saying and that's not the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I'm sorry about not being specific enough possibly on this call, but I think again, any preliminary measures as of that point in time has to be taken with a little bit of a pinch of salt simply because the implementation is going to be scaled and gradual and simply because based on what I have said, we are looking to be very sophisticated in managing this once it all goes into the full swing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the impact you mentioned of sort of what you previously mentioned of less than 1% would be taking together operational risk plus moving some of your assets on sort of more advanced methods under Basel II, which then probably offset each other and overall the impact should be less than 1%, give or take, may change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, and for that matter, significantly less than 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
