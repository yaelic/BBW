        <plist>
          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to Procter &amp; Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.</p>
          <p>As required by Regulation G, P&amp;G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. P&amp;G has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning everyone. A.G. Lafley, our CEO, and Teri List, our new Treasurer, join me this morning. I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter results. Teri will cover business highlights by operating segment. I'll then provide several topical updates before addressing guidance for fiscal '09 and the March quarter. Following the call, Teri, Mark Erceg, John Chevalier, and I will be available to provide additional perspective as needed.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to results for the December quarter. As expected, this was a challenging quarter. Consumers both here and abroad were under pressure from sharp declines in both housing and financial markets. Unemployment increased and consumer confidence dropped to an all-time low. Much of the developed world fell into recession and growth rates in many developing markets decelerated. The global credit crisis forced some retailers and distributors to cut inventory to conserve cash. Commodity and foreign exchange markets remained extremely volatile.</p>
          <p>Against this backdrop, P&amp;G delivered. We grew organic sales and delivered on our going and earnings per share guidance. Diluted net earnings per share increased 61% to $1.58 per share. This includes the one-time gain of $0.63 per share related to the sale of Folgers.</p>
          <p>Organic sales increased 2%. All six reportable business segments either grew or maintained organic sales for the quarter. Organic volume was 3% below a year ago due primarily to reductions in retailer, distributor, and in-home inventories in both developed and developing markets.</p>
          <p>Volume was also impacted by several price increases that went into effect during September and October. These impacted second quarter volume results in two ways. First to take advantage of lower prices, some retailers and distributors placed large orders ahead of these price increases. As a result, they did not order as much during the December quarter. Second, our pricing actions resulted in some short-term price gaps versus competition. Those price gaps with only a few exceptions have recently narrowed and are now closer to historical norms.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our markets continue to grow in both unit and value terms. And in aggregate, we maintained market value share, so consumption of our products remains healthy.</p>
          <p>Pricing added 4% to sales. This is an acceleration of the positive trend we have seen over the past several quarters. Mix increased sales 1%. Favorable business unit and geographic mix were the primary drivers. Foreign exchange lowered sales by five points, consistent with our most recent estimate. Total sales were 3% below a year ago at $20.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was down 90 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to higher commodity costs and 40 basis points of Folgers related restructuring charges. Feedstock spot prices peaked during June and July, but because of the length of some supply chains, we did not see the full impact in cost of goods until the December quarter. Commodity and energy costs reduced gross margins for the quarter by about 300 basis points.</p>
          <p>Business unit and geographic mix lowered gross margin by an additional 70 basis points due to faster relative growth from Baby and Family Care and developing markets. Pricing, productivity, and cost savings program offset about 80% of these impacts, leaving gross margin down 70 basis points for the quarter.</p>
          <p>The all-in effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.7%. The unusually low tax rate was due to the tax-free gain of the sale on Folgers. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 25.7%, reflecting the net effect of foreign mix, audit settlements, and the effect of foreign repatriations.</p>
          <p>Moving to cash, we generated $5.6 billion of operating cash flow and 4.2 billion of free cash flow fiscal year to date. Free cash flow productivity is currently running below our 90% target due to temporary increases in working capital. While shipment patterns remain highly volatile and uncertain, working capital should improve as production patterns are adjusted to order flow and lower commodity and energy costs result in lower inventory values over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Capital spending is at 3.4% of sales fiscal year to date, consistent with our annual target of about 4%. We remain comfortable with our 90% free cash flow productivity target for the year, excluding the one-time gain from Folgers.</p>
          <p>Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased $5.2 billion worth of stock. This is consistent with our 8 to $10 billion target range for the year. We're now exactly halfway through our three-year, 24 to 30 billion repurchase program and have bought back 15.3 billion worth of stock thus far. In addition, we retired 2.5 billion worth of stock as part of the Folgers transaction during the December quarter. We paid $1.2 billion in dividends during the quarter. P&amp;G's dividend yield is 2.8%, the highest it has been in almost 20 years.</p>
          <p>This was a tough quarter with a number of macroeconomic factors moving against us. I thought one example of how these factors impacted business segment results might be helpful. Net earnings for our biggest business segment, Fabric and Home Care, dropped by 25% during the second quarter. To put this in perspective, commodities negatively impacted net earnings by about 35%. Feedstock prices peaked in June and July but because of Fabric and Home Care's supply chain, the full impact did not hit until the December quarter. And while some commodities have moderated recently, spot prices of other key materials used by Fabric and Home Care such as phosphate, citric acid, soda ash, and sodium sulfate are up 50 to 150% versus year ago.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange negatively impacted net earnings by about 15% as several important markets such as Russia saw the value of their currency drop sharply versus the dollar. The global credit crisis caused retailers and distributors to lower working capital in order to conserve cash, and consumer confidence in many countries around the world dropped to record lows. As a result, reductions in trade, distributor, and consumer pantry inventories lowered net earnings by an additional 10% during the December quarter. So taken together, commodities, foreign exchange, and inventory driven volume impacts lowered Fabric and Home Care profit by about 16% versus last year. Importantly, the business offset well over half of these negative impacts with pricing, cost savings, and productivity programs.</p>
          <p>Impacts of this magnitude are unprecedented in our industry and have been felt across each of the business segments to differing degrees. Despite all of this, we were able to grow company organic sales, maintain global value shares, and deliver earnings per share in line with our going-in estimates.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, many challenges remain but we believe we have the right plans in place to continue growing top line organic sales and bottom line earnings. I'll say more about this later in my comments on guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Teri.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. Starting with the Beauty segment, organic sales were in line with the prior year as price increases offset lower shipment volume. We feel our Beauty business is holding up quite well in the current environment relative to others in this industry because of P&amp;G's diversified portfolio across categories, countries, and channels. We have a broad category mix ranging from fine fragrances to skin care to hair care to deodorants. Beauty is one of our more globally diverse businesses with a healthy balance of developed and developing market presence. And our Beauty business is very well positioned for the current economic climate as it is largely focused on the food/drug mass channel.</p>
          <p>Retail Hair Care volume grew low single digits with broad based growth across all major retail brands including Pantene. Volume growth was led by Head &amp; Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Rejoice, and Nice 'n Easy. All grew mid-single digits or higher for the quarter. Head &amp; Shoulders delivered double digit growth in CEMEA and Japan behind new Anti-Breakage innovation and strong sales fundamentals. Herbal Essences grew high single digits in developed markets behind the successful restage of the brands.</p>
          <p>Across Asia, Rejoice volume grew double digits behind the Extraordinary Smoothness and Extraordinary Reactions initiatives. Nice 'n Easy shipments were up high single digits in North America behind the continued success of our Perfect 10 innovation. As a result, Nice 'n Easy all-outlet value share in the U.S. is up over three points to more than 20%. Global Hair Care shares are growing and U.S. all-outlet value share of retail Hair Care increased nearly a point to 32%.</p>
          <p>Professional Hair Care volume declined mid-single digits, due primarily to general market softness as consumers reduced the frequency of salon visits.</p>
          <p>Skin Care volume declined mid-single digits, mainly due to the divestiture of Noxzema. Olay Skin Care declined slightly as double digit growth in Greater China was more than offset by trade inventory reductions and higher levels of competitive promotional activity, primarily in North America. Lower volume was partially offset by improved product mix from higher shipments of SK-II and the Olay Regenerist line. Over the past three months, U.S. consumption of both Olay Definity and the Regenerist line are up over 20%. Global value share of the facial skin market was consistent with prior year.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics volume declined to mid-single digits, primarily due to trade inventory reductions. CoverGirl's market leading U.S. all-outlet value share grew over 0.5 point to 19%. We continue to build share in prestige fragrances although volume declined high single digits due to trade inventory reductions, market contractions, and a shift of initiative timing to the second half of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>In the Grooming segment, organic sales were up 1% as price increases and improved mix more than offset a 5% decline in organic volume, driven largely by double digit declines of Braun. In Blades and Razors, volume declined low single digits due primarily to trade inventory reductions and unit volume market contractions in some developed markets. On a value basis, the global market continued to grow at over 5%, driven by trade-up to premium systems and pricing.</p>
          <p>Gillette's share of the market increased one point behind the continued strength of the Gillette Fusion franchise. Fusion grew share in all of P&amp;G's top 17 countries in the December quarter and is up nearly three points over the past six months. In the U.S., Fusion value share of male systems was up nearly two points to over 20%, making it the largest wet shaving system in the U.S.. Share gains on Fusion more than offset share declines of legacy systems.</p>
          <p>In female wet shaving, Venus grew behind continued success of the Embrace and Breeze innovations. Global Venus value share has increased over two points to about 38%.</p>
          <p>Volume of Braun was down due to market contractions, exits of the U.S. Home Appliance and Tassimo coffee maker businesses, and trade inventory reductions. Braun's value share of the global dry shaving market increased 0.5 point to about 35% behind growth of female epilators.</p>
          <p>In Health Care, organic sales were in line with prior year as pricing offset organic volume declines. As expected, Personal Health Care continues to be affected by declines in shipments of Prilosec OTC due to the loss of market exclusivity last calendar year.</p>
          <p>Oral Care volume declined low single digits, primarily due to trade inventory reductions in China ahead of a mid-tier brand restage launched late in the December quarter.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Crest's all-outlet value share of toothpaste was in line with prior year at 38%, continuing its leadership position. Importantly, shares of Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste achieved record high levels for the past three months at over 8%, up two points versus year ago behind the success of Pro-Health Whitening.</p>
          <p>In toothbrushes, Oral-B shipments were in line with prior year. P&amp;G shares are up over 1.5 points in both the manual toothbrushes and rechargeable handle segments due to Oral-B CrossAction, Pro-Health, and Pulsonic innovations.</p>
          <p>Volume in Feminine Care was in line with the prior year as double digit growth of Naturella in Russia and Mexico was offset by a mid-single digit decline of Tampax globally. In the U.S., Always all-outlet value share of the pad segment was up over 0.5 point to more than 58% behind the breakthrough launch of the premium initiative, Always Infinity. After just three months in the market, Always Infinity has gained 6% value share while selling for a 60% price premium to the main Always line.</p>
          <p>For the Snacks and Pet Care segment, organic sales grew 4%, reflecting significant pricing actions in Pet Care. Pet Care sales increased low single digits and shipments declined mid-single digits. The consumption decline was anticipated as we implemented multiple price increases in response to significant input cost increases. Iams value share was flat for the quarter at nearly 8% in a market that grew over 16% in value terms due to pricing.</p>
          <p>Volume in Snacks was down mid-single digits. As we prepare for the restage of Pringles in North America, we had to manage trade inventory to match manufacturing capacity. Pringles all-outlet value share of the U.S. potato chip market declined about 1.5 points versus prior year to 11%, due mainly to lower promotional activity ahead of the brand restage.</p>
          <p>Next, in the Fabric and Home Care segment, organic sales grew 1% as price increases and improved product mix more than offset volume declines. Fabric care shipments were down mid-single digits, primarily due to lower shipments of Tide in the U.S., China, and Saudi Arabia, driven by trade inventory reductions and share declines following price increases. P&amp;G's all outlet value share of detergents in the U.S. was down over two points as lower shares on Tide were partially offset by increases on Gain. We remain the share leader at 60%.</p>
          <p>Home Care shipments declined low single digits as high single digit growth of Febreze was more than offset by declines in dish Care and surface care following price increases. Importantly, P&amp;G gained U.S. all-outlet value share in surface care and air care and maintained share in dish care despite the price increases.</p>
          <p>Battery shipments were down low double digits behind significant trade inventory reductions, market contractions, and share declines. Duracell's market leading U.S. all-outlet value share of alkaline batteries was down two points to 46% for the past three months as private label products gained share in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>Next, Baby and Family Care delivered strong organic sales growth of 7% behind price increases and higher volume. Volume in Baby Care grew low single digits, led by high single digits growth in developing regions. Pampers grew double digits in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. In Western Europe, Pampers grew high single digits behind strong consumer response to the UNICEF vaccine partnership campaign. Pampers value share of the Western European diaper market is up nearly two points to nearly 55%. In the U.S., P&amp;G's overall diaper value share was in line with prior year at 36% as the decline in Pampers diaper share from a shift toward lower price tiers was offset by gains in the Luvs brand.</p>
          <p>Family Care volume declined low single digits as growth of Bounty was offset by a decline of Charmin due to a high base period that included the Charmin Ultra Strong initiative. Bounty was driven by the Best Bounty Ever initiative and strength of the Basics product line. Bounty U.S. value share grew 1.5 points to over 44%. Charmin U.S. all-outlet value share declined modestly to 27%.</p>
          <p>That concludes the business segment review, and now I'll hand the call back to Jon.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Teri. Before we get to guidance, I want to briefly explain how we're managing in this volatile environment and respond to questions we've been receiving since Analyst Day in December. We have established the following three priorities to guide our efforts through this period. First and foremost, we're focusing on value. We're ensuring we have strong plans and discount channels and at winning customers. We're establishing performance based value messaging across all touch points: on air, on package, and in store. And our shifting funds were effective to coupons and consumer promotions that deliver better value.</p>
          <p>We're monitoring pricing closely and intervening where appropriate to maintain appropriate value relationships. As we do all this, we're broadly maintaining investments in brand building and innovation, both of which build value over time for consumers, customers, and shareholders.</p>
          <p>Second, we've prioritized cash and profit and profitable share growth in that order. As part of this, we're aggressively reducing cost. To date, our efforts have identified 1.2 billion in year-to-year savings, but we're driving for more. We'll save over $100 million this year through the planned reduction in the number of expatriate managers as we build stronger local management teams. We're eliminating unnecessary hierarchy and reducing senior management staffing. We're aggressively negotiating construction and capital contracts and are working closely with our media partners to drive meaningful efficiencies across all markets. These efficiencies should enable us to maintain our increased share of voice while lowering costs.</p>
          <p>We're reducing travel costs by relying more heavily on video and phone conferencing. So there are a lot of proactive choices being made to reduce cost and improve productivity.</p>
          <p>Beyond standard cost reduction efforts, we're stepping up efforts to dramatically simplify our work and our organization structure. Simplification reduces cost and increases both speed and quality of execution. I'll give you one example. We currently use up to 4,000 colors globally for resins that we use in blow-molded and injection-molded parts for packaging and products. By reducing colors up to 50% and restructuring our supply base, we estimate that we can save $50 million a year and significantly simplify operations.</p>
          <p>Third, we're focusing on turning this crisis into an opportunity, refocusing on consumer value, cost and cash discipline, and as just mentioned, seizing the crisis as an opportunity to dramatically simplify our operations and our organization. All the actions we're taking should both help mitigate the short-term impacts of the crisis and build an even stronger company for the long term.</p>
          <p>Let me now answer some of the questions we've been receiving that may be on your minds, starting with market growth rates. Our markets in aggregate continue to grow. There has been some contraction in discretionary categories such as fine fragrances, hair care, and quick clean. Some consumers are trading down, but our strategy of offering consumers a range of choices within a product category is working. For example, Luvs, Gain, Bounty Basic, and Charmin Basic all delivered solid volume growth during the December quarter.</p>
          <p>Private label is a factor in only some of our categories and only some of our markets. For example, there really isn't a private label dynamic in the developing world and it's a very small factor in Beauty. Private label shares in our categories across North America and Western Europe have continued to increase modestly but are up less than 1%. And as I mentioned earlier, our shares are holding.</p>
          <p>Innovation continues to create value. For example, by providing men with the best shave possible for as little as $1 a week, Fusion represents a great value even in this tough economy. That is why Fusion increased global share by almost three points during the quarter and increased shipments by almost 20%.</p>
          <p>And women continue to see value in products like Always Infinity. Always Infinity has achieved a 6% value share after only two months in market despite being priced at a 60% premium. Consumers seeking the best performance and comfort in the category see Infinity as an excellent value. So while consumers are under increasing financial pressure, they continue to respond to innovation and value and we don't expect that to change.</p>
          <p>Next, commodities and pricing; during our analyst meeting last month, we revised our fiscal 2009 estimate for the impact of higher commodity and energy cost from about $2.7 billion to about $2 billion. Since that time, commodity and energy markets have remained volatile but have generally been moderating, which is good news. As a result, we now expect to incur slightly less than 2 billion in incremental commodity and energy costs this year.</p>
          <p>We continue to receive questions on potential price rollbacks, which I would like to address next. It's important to understand that pricing is related to much more than just the short-term trends in commodity costs. Of course, commodity prices do factor into our pricing strategies but they are not the only consideration. A significant portion of our pricing is driven by innovation. Improved products that provide additional benefits to consumers often cost more to produce. Our pricing is designed to recover these costs and create funding to support future innovation. This creates category growth and value for consumers, customers, and P&amp;G.</p>
          <p>We continue to deal as well with significant increases in commodity costs. Over the past three years, commodity costs have increased by $4 billion. We've offset only about 75% of these increases with pricing to date. While commodities such as oil, which we don't actually buy, have moderated, a representative basket of key materials we do purchase is 20% more expensive today than at this time last year. For example, the spot price of super-absorbents and surfactants are both up 25% versus year ago. Costs are up even more in markets that have experienced significant currency devaluation. In countries such as Russia, The Ukraine, Poland, and Mexico, the cost of U.S. dollar denominated inputs is up sharply and in many cases still rising.</p>
          <p>We continue to monitor price gaps and the relative consumer value of our brands. We will take appropriate action when needed, but we do not currently see the need for broad scale pricing interventions. Importantly, if it does become appropriate to reduce prices in the future, we would expect volume growth to reaccelerate.</p>
          <p>Next, let me touch on the credit markets and our debt portfolio. We continue to choose commercial paper as a vehicle to cover about 30% of our financing needs. We have had uninterrupted access to this market. We're currently issuing in very comfortable maturities of four to six months with coupon rates of about 50 basis points. Our commercial paper program is backstopped by undrawn lines of credit. These lines of credit were renegotiated over the past 18 months and are primarily five-year facilities.</p>
          <p>P&amp;G's access to the term market is also very good and rates are attractive there as well. In September, we issued two floating rate bonds valued at a combined $2 billion at 3 and 18 basis points over LIBOR respectively. And just last month, we issued a $2 billion five-year fixed rate note at a coupon of 4.6%. All three offers were oversubscribed. These rates are lower than the rates on the bonds that are maturing over the next 18 months. We remain committed to our AA-minus credit rating and to returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.</p>
          <p>Moving to guidance, we believe it's prudent to broaden our guidance ranges for the foreseeable future in response to all of the uncertainties we've talked about today. We expect fiscal '09 organic sales growth of between and 2 and 5%. This lower range reflects second quarter results and continued uncertainty. Price/mix should contribute 4 or 5%. Organic volume is expected to be flat to down 2%.</p>
          <p>Since Analyst Day, foreign exchange markets have remained very volatile. The dollar strengthened versus the British pound, the euro, and Russian ruble, but depreciated versus the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and Philippine peso. These moves have largely offset each other. As a result, we continue to expect foreign exchange to reduce sales by about 5% on the year. Acquisition and divestiture impacts should be a neutral to negative 1% impact on sales growth. In total, we expect all-in sales to be flat to minus 4%.</p>
          <p>We continue to see operating margin about flat for the year including Folgers restructuring costs. And the tax rate on continuing operations should be between 27 and 28%. We're comfortable with the current consensus earnings per share estimate of $4.29, which is approximately at the midpoint of a revised fiscal 2009 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35.</p>
          <p>Now for the March quarter, much of the credit induced inventory contraction manifested itself in the December quarter. However, there is likely to be additional impact going forward. And if consumer confidence around the world continues to drop, we would expect consumption in more discretionary categories to be further impacted. These considerations are reflected in wider guidance ranges for the March quarter.</p>
          <p>Organic sales are expected to grow 2 to 5%. Within this, price mix should contribute 5 to 7% of sales growth. We expect organic volume to be down 2 to 3% versus year ago. Foreign exchange is estimated to reduce sales by high single digits, and acquisitions and divestitures are expected to be neutral in the quarter. In total, we expect all-in sales to be down 2 to 7%.</p>
          <p>Operating margin for the quarter will be down modestly versus prior year, including incremental Folgers restructuring. Commodity cost and volume deleveraging impacts should be largely offset by productivity improvements and cost savings programs. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.86 per share including Folgers related restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>We wouldn't typically comment on the June quarter at this time, but when your models are updated, you will see we expect operating income to significantly improve versus the March quarter. This will be driven by a smaller commodity impact, a reduction in trade inventory headwinds, full implementation of productivity and cost reduction programs, as well as price increases being executed currently to recover transaction impacts of foreign exchange movements in developing markets.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we continue to operate in a very difficult environment. Despite this, we are growing organic sales and earnings per share. We are maintaining global value shares. Our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong and we are returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.</p>
          <p>A lot of uncertainty remains, but the entire management team is fully engaged and focused on the fundamentals that are important for success in our industry. We continue to improve productivity and simplify our work processes and organizations. These are the right things to do in the short term and will build an even stronger company for the long term.</p>

          <p>I'm just curious on your thoughts about the magnitude of the volume declines we're seeing across many global HPC companies and the impact on the promotional environment over the next 12 months. Now the way I look at it, are we heading back to the old school price war as commodity costs roll down and the consumer remains under pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so, Nik. If you look at the volume trends, I think they are clearly a function of two things. The fact that markets are slowing for the most part still growing, but some as Jon said, of the more discretionary ones actually declining, and they are function of what we hope will be relatively short-term inventory draw-downs by our trading customers and by consumers. And I think that behavior is understandable. We've seen it in every other recession.</p>
          <p>I think what you want to watch is the relative changes in share position. I'm pretty pleased with this quarter that we just completed because for the most part, we held our share position or we were able in some important cases like Hair Care to modestly improve it. I'm also pretty pleased because if you look at the businesses where you can do head-to-head comparisons, the paper businesses, the Beauty Care businesses, some of the other businesses, we're holding up pretty well. I think we're in a relatively strong strategic position and we're operating well. So I think that unless you see big changes in market share positions that you'll see pretty rational behavior on the part of all of the players in the different industries.</p>
          <p>Now, the one thing I will say, there's absolutely no doubt in this environment that consumers are looking for value. And as Jon tried to point out, sometimes that means a low opening price point, an affordable price point. And that's why our basic lines &#x2013; that's why the Gains and Luvs of the world do relatively better. That's why private label grows in recessionary times. But in many cases, value comes with innovation and a higher price point. And the thing that we're heartened by is a lot of our value added offerings in our category and brand portfolios are holding up very well and in fact growing a lot of share. And that just simply means that there are different consumer segments out there that have different sets of needs and a different consumer value equation.</p>
          <p>So a long-winded way of saying I don't think you're going to see a lot of &#x2013; I don't think you're going to see a return to irrational price wars. I do think you'll see a lot of us dialing in the right values to make sure we're offering consumers a good value, but I don't think you're going to see any big shifts.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. In looking at your organic revenue growth guidance for the fiscal third quarter, it seems as though generally you're looking for a little bit of an acceleration there. And given the fact that fiscal Q2 really only had from what we can tell two bad months, can you walk us through some of the components in terms of less de-load impact? You're seeing that already improvements in Tide, what have you, that give us confidence that you can accelerate the organic top line in a quarter where you're going to have three bad months as opposed to two bad months. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, I'll start out. First of all, we're getting more traction each month from our pricing and from our mix moves, right? So we're actually seeing sequentially month by month an improvement, a relative improvement in our price mix.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we know exactly what our innovation and initiative program looks like for the January &#x2013; March quarter and we have a number of strong initiatives that were either just launched in the quarter that closed in December, are being launched or will be launched in January &#x2013; March that actually sweeten the mix.</p>
          <p>And then I guess the third thing is we should see the inventory situation begin to moderate a little, but frankly I want to stay cautious there until we actually see it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just a question on mix, something I've been asking about for a couple of quarters and I understand that consumers will continue to pay for value add like in Always Infinity. But I'm actually surprised that mix was still positive in the quarter given examples like Tide being down double digits, or you mentioned of course developing markets outpacing developed market growth; so if you can just &#x2013; and the midyear growing faster, if you can explain a little bit how mix is still positive.</p>
          <p>And then also just, A.G., following up on your comments on innovation initiatives for the third quarter, have you done much consumer testing on those that says consumers will be ready for mix enhancing purchases in this environment or were those things tested six months ago when people had a little bit more money in their pocket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take care of the last question first. As you might imagine, the consumer testing is intensive. It's relentless and it's ongoing. And every Monday morning when we get together, we look at the latest consumer data on just about anything we can get our hands on. So you're on a very important point there, Lauren. It's got to be timely, okay, consumer data.</p>
          <p>Clearly, I mean let's take the Tide example, okay? Where Tide has lost &#x2013; first of all, the double digit drop, just to be clear, in Fabric was on the earnings side, right? The top line has held up better of course. But if you look at the Tide portfolio and the Tide mix, where we felt the pressure is in the basic Tide offerings, right? That's where consumers are shifting to Gain or trying one of the price brand alternatives, whether it's private label or manufactured or a manufacturer's brand.</p>
          <p>We introduced Tide Total Care. I think we've done 100 to 150 million on Tide Total Care, okay, and that's the rate. And Tide Coldwater continues to do well; it's sold at a premium per load. We still sell a fair amount of Tide with a Touch of Downy and Tide with Febreze. So for those consumers, that represents a good value, okay? Some choose not to use a separate fabric softener. Some want a little more fabric softener freshness and fragrance in their load. So it's really hard to generalize across a mass consumer audience because a mass consumer audience doesn't exist anymore.</p>
          <p>If you step back on your mix question, we're still benefiting from some geographic mix positives. And if you look, as I said, in number of the category and brand portfolios, we're benefiting from some positive mix. If you think about what the consumer pays for most of the P&amp;G portfolio, almost everything we sell is sold between $1 and $10 a unit. I mean we're not talking about expensive items that can't be afforded even in a recession. So based on everything we see, we think that's what the price mix is going to be for the next quarter and we'll hold that basic price mix through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just build on that with one point and that's simply the strength in the current environment and to come of our premium price innovation. We're really in a good position across multiple categories and consumers are responding.</p>

          <p>Can we just get some more granularity on the cash flow because it looks like free cash flow fell about 60% year over year? And then the cash conversion cycle, it keeps creeping up and it has crept up for a while. So I'm wondering if it's a one-time thing this quarter and why should that improve as we look out for the rest of the fiscal year?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bill. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're still expecting to hit our free cash flow targets this year. What you're seeing in the second quarter is really a year-to-year impact of accrual levels on marketing expense and things like interest expense, which we expect to reverse as the fiscal year continues.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I want to focus a little bit on operating margin leverage, especially as it relates to SG&amp;A. I guess I was surprised not to see as much cost cutting as I would have expected in this quarter given the SG&amp;A didn't really improve as a percentage of sales there. How much of that is related to what Jon was taking us through in terms of Fabric Care and particularly in terms of foreign exchange? Fabric Care was hit by negative 5% on the top line but negative 15% on the bottom line, so I want to get underneath that multiplier effect as it relates to SG&amp;A. And as well within SG&amp;A, I guess given the context that it sounds like advertising has come down, by how much? Have you shifted that to the top line? And maybe just to add in because you didn't quite answer the last question, talk us through inventory if you would too, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why don't I start and then Jon can jump in? Jon talked about one of the key impacts in the short term on cash flow. The other one has been, we've got &#x2013; we are in the process of &#x2013; have already adjusted our production cycles, so we match what we make to what's ordered. And on the positive side there, Ali, we're working ever more closely with most of our major retailers so we can operate on a much shorter cycle, so we can produce more of what we manufacture to demand. So we're reasonably confident that that's going to improve, okay, as we go through the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>On the question about advertising, absolutely not, okay; we have held our marketing spending and our advertising spending. And in fact what's really going on is that the advertising markets are softening; and for the same dollar, we're buying more delivery, okay. And when you look at our shares of voice, in many businesses we're actually improving our shares of voice and that's what matters. What matters is share of spending or more importantly share of delivery to consumers in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>On the first question on SG&amp;A, Jon, do you want to start that and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, really, Ali, what's happening on SG&amp;A is fairly simple. We're seeing a deleveraging aspect related to the sales and volumes decline, which is offset in this quarter to continued productivity savings, so we're really seeing year on year the same level of productivity savings but they have been offset by sales deleveraging.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which was your Tide point; but if you step back, I mean our productivity program that we first discussed at CAGNY now nearly a year ago and updated at the analyst conference in December is on track; and in fact, we're accelerating it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two questions, the first one very quick. With the dividend yield being so high, do you still plan to increase it next year or is there a chance that you tone that down because I know that has been a long-term annual thing for you? But then my bigger question is the comment that operating income was going to grow disproportionately in the June quarter because you would in part be finally realizing the benefit of pricing in emerging markets, I guess that surprises me because the emerging market currency started to devalue way back in the December quarter. So I'm surprised that the pricing is lagging so much and that's not the same as what we've seen from some of your competitors. So can you comment on that and say is that a game, if you will, to capture some market share in the short term or are you just having a harder time implementing that pricing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question first; there are actually a number of factors. If you look at October &#x2013; December, the biggest impact was commodities. The second biggest impact was currency, okay? The smallest impact was the draw-down in inventories by the trade and consumers. So, roll forward to the June quarter, commodities look a lot more positive in the June quarter than they do in the December quarter, so we're going to get a lot of help from commodities. Currency, who knows, and we're staying conservative. And then as Jon described, we think that we'll get a little bit better, okay, on the volume trend as we move through the balance of the year. But those are the primary &#x2013; the primary driver is commodities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the question on the timing of the price increases in developing markets, the major moves really occurred at the end of the October &#x2013; December period. And as we've talked before &#x2013; previously relative to commodities, it takes a period of time to get those prices fully implemented and reflected on the shelf. That period of time relates to our normal customer planning cycles.</p>
          <p>On dividends, we've paid dividends as a company since the year we were incorporated 118 years in a row. We've increased the dividend for 52 consecutive years. We're projecting continued profitable growth, and I would expect therefore the dividend trend would remain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the long-term sales growth objective. And I guess taking a step back, during the peak of the cycle here when emerging markets were strong, you were getting some pricing. You were putting up 5%, and now we're looking at more trough numbers that are I guess as low as 2%. And I guess maybe could you walk us through why the thinking that long-term organic sales growth might need to come down a little bit, why we might be overreacting to weak discretionary spending, or is that something that your guys are evaluating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say &#x2013; I mean the simplest way to think about this is we're evaluating it. And every year, we go through our strategic growth models by industry and we build it up for the company. My question would be what's long term. Right now, frankly, we're focused like a laser on today and this week, okay, and making sure we're on top of what consumers want and need, and we're working closely with our customers and suppliers.</p>
          <p>You've seen us; we've moderated our growth goals in the foreseeable future. We've widened the range of debt from two to five. That looks right in the short term. I think we're going to have to see where &#x2013; when we come out of what looks like is going to be a global recession. We're going to have to see how deep the recession is. We're going to have to see when we come out, and we're going to have to see what GDP and market growth looks like when we do come out, and then we'll be realistic.</p>
          <p>I mean the one thing I think you can &#x2013; hopefully you can count on us for is when we started this decade in 2000, the first thing we did is we took down the growth goals because they weren't realistic. And the first building block of our growth is market growth. So we'll look at where we think market growth is going to come out, and then we'll have the same building blocks. We'll have a building block for what we think we can do with innovation and share growth. We'll have a building block for what our ongoing acquisition strategy is going to be, and then whatever that adds up to will be our long-term goal. But I think we're in a very volatile and obviously uncertain period and it's going to take months and quarters for that to sort out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean there's nothing that we've seen in the near term which causes us to definitively move off that goal. There's nothing that says that consumer behavior in normal economic times has fundamentally changed. In the worst operating environment we've seen in a very long time, we grew organic sales at 2%, certainly not four to six but not negative. And as A.G. said, we'll just have to see how this plays out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks guys. I was wondering if you can talk about &#x2013; I guess, Jon, earlier you referenced a little commentary on category growth rates. Can you just give an update on what you think those category growth rates are for Western Europe, North America, and the U.S. and also &#x2013; sorry, in developing markets? And also I guess what percentage of your global categories are you gaining share in right now say over the last three-month period? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the last one, we really look at by business, by industry or category, and by region what our share performance is, and we're growing modestly in the CEMEA world. We're growing modestly in Asia. We're actually growing modestly in LA [Latin America], and we've given up a little bit of share in Western Europe and the U.S..</p>
          <p>The total global picture is we're basically holding. And if you look at any period: past four weeks, past eight weeks, past 12 weeks, past six months, it's pretty much a holding pattern. And that's not surprising because I think the recession hit harder in the U.S. and we've been managing through in the last six months a period when we've been frankly leading the pricing up, okay. And when you're leading the price up, we know there's going to be some short-term period of exposure. But it's the right thing to do. We're leading it up in a way that's measured. We're leading it up in a way that's still delivering consumer value. We're leading it up in partnership with our retailer partners, and we're leading it up in a way that maximizes and optimizes value creation.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. markets, what's really going on is there's some slowing, okay. So if you look at all of the categories that we're in, this is roughly 40% of our total business. If you look at all the categories that we're in, we're still looking at 4% value growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 3 to 4% value growth in North America; we continue to see higher growth in developing markets, albeit somewhat decelerated, from 5 to 6%. And no surprise Western Europe and Northeast Asia continue at about flat to 1%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the one phenomenon that is occurring is there's a widening between the volume dynamic and the value dynamic. But again, that's understandable, right. I mean, that's understandable given what's going on in the currency market, especially in developing markets but not only in developing markets, and what's going on with pricing over the last year. But we're actually fortunate we're still in an industry that's growing. It's slow, it's a slog, but it's still growing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one quick question on the retailer inventory destocking situation. It sounds like it's not getting better in January and I wanted to see if you could confirm that. And then secondly, most retailers or I should say a lot of retailers have a January fiscal year end, and I'm curious if some of this destock on their part is window dressing ahead of that fiscal year end. And have you gotten indications that the ordering patterns may return back to normal once we get past that into February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to use your description, but I worked in retail most of my &#x2013; in my 20s before I joined P&amp;G at 30, and I think everybody in the business knows that you get your inventories as low as you can before you close your fiscal year. In part it's self defense, it's fewer things to have to count. But in part it's you want to make your business and financial results look as good as possible. So obviously there is some year-end draw-down, and you're right. We probably haven't seen the end of it or even the bottom in some of our categories.</p>
          <p>I think what's more important is what will be the new inventory levels that they try to operate on starting in February. And clearly and some prominent retailers have been pretty public and vocal about this. Clearly they're trying to operate at lower inventory levels and you know what? So are we, but in order to pull that off in a way that's really going to work, we're going to have to have much better integrated systems and much better coordination, and we're working hard on that.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's still a little bit more of an unknown and we monitor consumer panels to track this is what consumers are really doing. We have some businesses that are discretionary and I think they're easy to understand. Fragrance, clearly people backed off in the fragrance market. The good news is we grew share, okay? There are purchases &#x2013; you can delay a $200 electric shaver purchase, okay? Salon visits, we know women are stretching out their salon visits. Some are not going and only coloring at home or whatever. Others are stretching out the time between visits. So I think those are fairly well known.</p>
          <p>We have some other businesses where pantry inventories are built up. You'd be amazed how many batteries are on hand, and unfortunately we have been amazed by how many batteries are on hand, but that will get drawn down, okay, in a period like this. But we really need to understand what consumers are going to do business by business with their pantry inventory, so that's the one we'll keep watching. But I want to be cautious on inventories. I don't want to assume that it's going to end.</p>
          <p>The last thing I would say is what will determine where retailers and manufacturers end up on inventory levels will be the balance between in-stock and service level and inventories. And we already know that some customers, they pushed it too far, okay? We have improved our in-stock position quarter to quarter, month to month, but we are hitting a level that we're not getting additional improvement, and one of the reasons we're not getting additional improvement is because the inventory levels have been drawn down too far, and that's not a good tradeoff. You can do the math, that's just not a good tradeoff. So, the smart retailers won't let the inventories go too low.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as A.G. indicates, that dynamic is essentially self-limiting at some point, and we're currently seeing broadly U.S. out-of-stock levels at the highest levels in 24 months.</p>

          <p>Now we'll move to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up on that and if I could just ask a separate question on Skin Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seemed to me that some time ago, sophisticated manufacturers were doing automatic replenishment with their major partners. So if that's the case, were you not making product to demand for some time? So the first question is what kind of increase in this making to demand are you seeing.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I have a question on Skin Care. As you talked about this period being one also of opportunity, it's such a cluttered, messy category, even with your own products. I see print ads with Definity and Regenerist, and I imagine if women don't know this sort of stuff, they wonder why you're advertising two brands. But in a lot of &#x2013; in some categories, we're seeing the weaker players being squeezed out; so I'm wondering what the opportunity is in Skin Care to make it easier to shop and to gain more market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first on the produce to demand; yes, we are on a journey to increase the amount of our business that we cover with produce to demand. But you have to understand that even in certain categories where we produce to demand, ultimately the retailer sets his inventory level. So I mean a very simple thing like the number of cartridge packs per hook, okay, in the store when that's prescribed by the retailer and when it doesn't have enough holding power, we have an in-stock problem, okay. And as Jon said, if you walk as I often do on the weekends stores that are representative of our major retailers, they just don't have the holding power, either because they set the in-store inventory bogie or target too low or because they're not replenishing at a rate they need to replenish to keep stocks &#x2013; to stay in stock on the shelf.</p>
          <p>So what are we doing about it? Okay, one of the things we're doing about it is we have a large organization called Retail Pulse, and we've increased our investment in Retail Pulse. Retail Pulse are merchandisers that physically go into stores and work with retailers where they permit this kind of support and make sure that we're in stock, that we're priced right, that the category is allocated right. More importantly, we're working with a number of retailers on getting the shelf sets and category assortments right, and that really in the end is going to be the solution. And still unfortunately, too many retailers are over-assorted and they are not really assorted by the principle of space according to movement, and therefore they don't enough holding power for the fastest moving brands and SKUs. So Connie, it's a real problem. It's an ongoing problem. We're working on it. And there is real business benefit there for us.</p>
          <p>On Skin Care, the good news is channel trade-down. I mean clearly, you are all following what's going on in department stores and that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And there's trade-down and out of department stores and specialty stores. And in a number of Beauty categories and Personal Care categories, there's trade-in to our channel, okay, and that's good. And we've been on a crusade for a decade or more now to democratize Beauty and to make it accessible and available to more women; the best products, okay, accessible and affordable for more women.</p>
          <p>We do have to be careful on the portfolio. As Teri reported, we're actually growing share on the Regenerist and Definity lines. So I think what that says is we know who that consumer segment is, and we're very clear with her that we're speaking to her and we're very clear with her about the benefits and the value of what we offer. I also think that in categories like this, there's a real opportunity to sort out, and that's going to require these category resets that I was talking about earlier, and we are working on that with major retailers. Fortunately, we're essentially a two-brand player. In Skin Care, SK-II is actually coming back, and Olay is holding its own and is one of the largest skin care brands in the world, so I think we're relatively well positioned.</p>

          <p>And now we'll turn to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up and one new question. On your categories all together in the U.S., you said in value terms they were up 3 to 4% in the quarter, all retailers included. What was the volume performance, so that maybe we can see that pantry de-loading? And my other question is could you give us a little bit more gross margin guidance for the third quarter and the year and specifically can gross margins be up in the third quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the category volume trends where it's three to four, I have the U.S. numbers at hand. In the same three to six month period, it's up 0.2 or 3 to 101 &#x2013; to 1%, so that's the gap you're seeing, okay, about a 2 to 3% gap between volume shares and value shares. And then the second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross margin going forward should get sequentially better, primarily driven by two dynamics: one, the abatement in commodity costs going through cost of goods sold as we go forward; and two as we talked about earlier, the full reflection of pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And now we'll turn to Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also a quick follow-up and another question. Could you give us a quantification of what you think de-stock will do to organic volume in the next quarter, in the third fiscal quarter? And a new question on advertising versus promotion, as you look going forward, certainly ad rates have dropped pretty dramatically. Do you look to change the mix and maybe step up your trade promotions to try to attract more of the value consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jon talked about the guidance, so I'll let him comment on that one. On the mix, the marketing mix, it just varies across industries and categories. What we do in Fem Care is going to be totally different from what we do in the laundry detergent which is going to be totally different from what we do in Oral Care, okay. So they're situational, right?</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have been shifting support in general to the store and the point of purchase, okay, but it's not trade spending in the sense of just handing the trade more money, okay. We don't do that. We pay for performance, okay. But if you walk stores, you would see our performance and value messaging much more prominent on shelf, on package, on display. It's couponing in markets where couponing is a well-established consumer habit, and coupon redemptions go up in recessionary times. In markets like the U.S., we've clearly shifted dollars to coupons. But if you look at the way we coupon, every one of our coupons has a brand equity communication message on it and it has a performance value message on it. So, it's not just $0.50 off, okay, your next purchase.</p>
          <p>And then depending on the market, we're doing more digital, and there are a number of categories that are doing quite well with digital. But I think the simple way to think about it, as we do market mix modeling, we actually calculate the return on investment on every brand, on every element of the mix, and we move the dollars around to where the dollars are more effective and more efficient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question of organic volume growth in the third quarter, as I said earlier, we're guiding to down two to three. There are two dynamics behind that. One, as A.G. said, we're going to be prudently conservative going forward. We still expect there to be some inventory dynamic in the first part of the quarter. Second, as I've mentioned, we are currently raising prices in parts of the developing world to offset the transaction impacts of devaluation and that will obviously have a volume impact as well.</p>
