        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Amy, and good morning everyone. I'm sure you're all very tired given the active days of yesterday and today, but it's a pleasure to be here this morning.</p>
          <p>We reported our results, as you're aware, on the third quarter with earnings of over $2.2 billion, which is an increase of 73% compared to last year. Excluding certain favorable items this quarter, we had earnings of $2 billion which, again, very strong driven by exceptional growth in our Canadian retail franchise, as well as strong Capital Markets and Insurance results. We also have record results year-to-date with earnings of $5.7 billion and based on our performance we expect to meet our medium-term financial objectives in 2012. These results clearly demonstrate the earnings power of RBC and the strength of our diversified business model with the right mix of retail and wholesale as we highlight on slide six.</p>
          <p>I am also very pleased to report that today we announced a $0.03 or 5% increase to our dividend bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.60 a share. This is our third dividend increase in the past 15 months.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide seven, our capital ratios remain strong. Our Tier 1 capital ratio stands at 13% reflecting solid retained earnings growth and risk-weighted asset management, offset somewhat by the impact of our acquisition of the 50% stake in RBC Dexia, which we're very excited about and we closed at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we noted in Q2, based on our current interpretation of the rules, which is yet to be finalized, we already meet or exceed the Basel III capital requirements that become effective in the first quarter of 2013. Currently, our estimated Basel III pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio is 8.3%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the performance of our business segments, overall, we're extremely pleased with the strong momentum in Canadian Banking and we are also proud that these results were achieved while simultaneously reaching new heights in customer loyalty measures. Canadian Banking had a record quarter with earnings of over $1 billion accounting for half of our total earnings. Even in a slowing environment, volume growth was strong at 8% and we continue to leverage our size and scale to take disproportionate share of industry growth and profitability and to gain market share. What's more, we achieved these results, while demonstrating relative margin stability.</p>
          <p>As part of our enterprise-wide cost management program, Canadian Banking is focused on eliminating cost and reinvesting in the future. This quarter, Canadian Banking delivered strong operating leverage ahead of schedule and an efficiency ratio of under 45%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Wealth Management, as you know, we have an ambitious growth objective for this segment and while we are behind schedule as a result of the uncertain markets and low interest rates, we're well positioned and have good leverage to benefit from market stability. Notwithstanding the current environment, which I should say has improved over the last month or so, we continue to extend our number one position in Canada in both Wealth and Asset Management, and are investing to strengthen our competitive position outside of our domestic markets during a period of challenging industry conditions. We are confident that we are investing in a foundation that will provide strong future growth, particularly as markets begin to stabilize and client activities increase.</p>
          <p>Turning to Insurance, we had another strong quarter. This business continues to make a consistent contribution and complements our overall retail offering, providing innovative client-focused solutions through our multichannel distribution network. We continue to strengthen our business for future growth by improving our products mix, pricing, distribution, and claims management process. For example, this quarter, we made changes to our priority distribution channel, which we expect will drive greater efficiencies over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Moving to International Banking, while disappointed by the performance of our Caribbean Banking, which continues to reflect the prolonged weak economic conditions in the region, we believe that this remains an attractive region for RBC and the strategic investments we have made in recent years position us well for long-term growth. Our market position is strong, our margins are strong but we have been impacted by reduced demand for loans and the credit cycle, which Morten will cover off. In the near term, we're aggressively managing this business and we believe our performance will improve significantly in 2013.</p>
          <p>In RBC Investor Services, our performance this year has been relatively solid. However, our results have been impacted by the accounting treatment for the acquisition, as I believe you are all aware. You may recall we were required from an accounting perspective to take a write down on our current investment in RBC Dexia to reflect the purchase price, the majority of which we took last quarter and the remainder recorded this quarter at the time of close. As a result, despite Investor Services being profitable, no earnings have been recorded in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we believe Investor Services is well positioned as a top 10 global custodian in an industry with solid long-term fundamental and while this business is impacted by market and interest rate pressures similar to Wealth Management, it provides good leverage to market stability.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our reputation, brand, and financial strength to win additional business, improve earnings trajectory and drive long-term growth.</p>
          <p>In Capital Markets, we had another solid quarter of earnings, reflecting the successful repositioning of the business, which we have been discussing over the past few years. As we have highlighted, we have aggressively reduced risks and eliminated complex assets from our balance sheet. We have reduced trading inventories in response to global uncertainty and we've narrowed our focus and breadth of training products. We have grown our lending to corporate clients significantly especially in the United States and that has supported substantial growth in our Investment Banking as well as loan revenues and we have continued to execute our focused strategy in our key geographic regions without expanding our footprint.</p>
          <p>Looking specifically at Q3, our corporate, investment banking business had solid results demonstrating our strength in Canada and the success of our build-out in the United States and the United Kingdom. In Canada, we are acting as financial advisor to Nexen on the second largest Canadian energy M&amp;A transactions in history and the largest foreign energy acquisition in Canadian history.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we had a very active quarter and were involved in multiple capacities and a number of key mandates. As an example, we acted as lead advisor in Apollo's $7 billion acquisition of El Paso Exploration and Production Company, as well as joint bookrunner on the financing. Another notable transaction was Penn Virginia Resource Partners' acquisition of Chief Gathering where RBC was the M&amp;A advisor, equity placement agent and the lead arranger of the credit facility.</p>
          <p>Our strength in the U.S. was most evident in the latest Dealogic league tables. Measured by fee revenue, RBC ranked as the 10th largest global investment bank for the first half of 2012 and we have jumped 7 spots to number 10 in U.S. Loans Bookrunner Ranking increasing our market share to 2.4%, up from 1.1% in 2011. Within the Americas ranking, overall our market share has increased over the past two years to a record 3.9%, up from 2.4% with more than half of this increase coming in the United States.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, RBC acted as financial advisor to a consortium that acquired Open Grid Europe from a German-listed utility for &#x20AC;3.2 billion. We were also lead arranger on this deal providing the supported credit facilities. This transaction represents our largest UK cross-border M&amp;A transaction involving a German target and is a testament to the successful build out of our investment banking business in the UK even in the face of these challenging markets.</p>
          <p>Although trading was down on a sequential basis, it was a solid quarter reflecting the success we've had in repositioning our business, particularly in the fixed income area and our focus on the customer. It is worth highlighting and emphasizing that we generated solid trading revenues from a base of securities which is approximately 25% lower than it was a year ago, and our bar is down 50% or close to 50% from its peak which was Q3 2011 &#x2013; in Q3 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, while market conditions remain uncertain, RBC has good momentum and a strong competitive position in our core markets, as well as a solid pipeline.</p>
          <p>To conclude, our results and dividend increase this quarter continues to demonstrate our earnings power. Our long-term diversified business model of retail, wholesale and other businesses combined with our geographic presence provides, in our view, the right mix of earnings and risk diversifications which will continue to translate into strong earnings.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we believe we're well positioned to continue to extend our lead in Canada and building on strong client relationships in select U.S. and international markets while delivering long-term growth to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over Morten.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. Starting with credit on slide 10, overall credit quality improved compared to the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses of $325 million declined $23 million or 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 34 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower provisions, primarily in Canadian Banking, but also in Capital Markets, partially offset by higher provisions in the Caribbean business due to the ongoing difficult economic conditions in that market.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Caribbean, we continue to face challenging credit environment given the region's dependence on tourism from both the U.S. and Europe. These challenges are likely to persist in the near-term until we see improvements in the economic environment in the region.</p>
          <p>With respect to gross impaired loans, new formations have improved significantly at $261 million. This is the lowest level of new impaired loans since the third quarter of 2006. Gross impaired loan balances were $242 million lower than the prior quarter, largely due to lower impaired loans in our residential mortgage portfolio as well as in our business lending portfolios in Canadian Banking and Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Canadian retail portfolio on slide 11, overall loss rates improved this quarter to 30 basis points of PCL, down from 34 basis points last quarter. Our mortgage portfolio continues to perform well with provisions on residential mortgages remaining low at 2 basis points, consistent with our historic performance. We continue to actively monitor and stress this portfolio and remain confident in its ability to withstand significant movements in the key underlying economic parameters.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12 on our European exposure, compared to last quarter, our net exposure was up approximately $4 billion or 10% reflecting the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in RBC Dexia which added approximately $6 billion primarily lower risk investment portfolio assets as deployment of funds from client deposits. This increase was partially offset by our continued risk management and balance sheet optimization efforts, including a further reduction of holdings with some European securities in the Investor Services business. We remain comfortable with our exposure and continue to transact in a prudent manner with well-rated counterparties predominantly in the larger European economies.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk, average management value at risk was $37 million and average stress VaR was $60 million with both remaining stable compared to last quarter. One element of our ongoing risk management activities is the active management and further reduction in trading inventory primarily in fixed income.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 13, inventories in the fixed income business has decreased by 25% over the past year as we have narrowed our focus and breadth for trading products and shifted our focus to more traditional investment banking activities. We had a total of eight days with net trading losses during the quarter with no losses exceeding the value at risk.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Janice.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten, and good morning. Turning to slide 15, as Gordon mentioned, we had a record third quarter with earnings of over $2.2 billion. Our results included three items of note outlined on slide 21 which had a favorable net impact of $262 million after-tax. Excluding these items, net income was $2 billion, up $295 million or 18% from last year and 12% from last quarter. These results were driven primarily by record earnings in Canadian Banking and strong performances in Capital Markets and Insurance.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business segment, starting on slide 16, Canadian Banking had record earnings of over $121 billion. Excluding the favorable mortgage prepayment interest adjustment of $92 million after-tax earnings were still a record at just over $1 billion, up $147 million or 17% over last year, primarily reflecting strong volume growth of 8%. On the same basis, net income was up $98 million or 10% compared to the prior quarter primarily due to the positive impact of seasonal factors as well as solid volume growth across all businesses.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 16, Canadian Banking delivered strong adjusted operating leverage of 3.5% this quarter. Looking ahead, while we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter it will be at a lower level than what we achieved this quarter given the current low interest rate environment and the timing of initiative spend.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our medium term efficiency objectives, we continued to drive our efficiency ratio lower. This is quarter, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 44.8%, an improvement of 150 basis points from last year reflecting progress on another, on a number of initiatives. For example, our staff levels remained flat over the last year despite adding 27 new branches and extending branch hours.</p>
          <p>In regards to margins, notwithstanding the low interest rate environment, we continue to achieve relative stability. On an adjusted basis, net interest margin was relatively flat from last year and increased 2 basis points over last quarter. The sequential increase over last quarter reflected lower mortgage breakage cost and a favorable change in our product mix. Our margin performance reflects our strict pricing discipline as well as our ability to grow volumes at a premium to the market and profitably gain share.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect margins to reflect the competitive landscape and prolonged low interest rate environment. I would note that the change in our estimation of mortgage prepayment interest is not expected to have a material impact on margins in future quarters.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wealth Management on slide 17 in Q3, we earned $156 million. Certain regulatory and legal matters unfavorably impacted our results this quarter by $21 million after-tax. Excluding these items, net income was down $15 million or 8% from last year largely due to lower transaction volumes reflecting continued investor uncertainty. On the same basis, earnings were down $35 million or 17% over last quarter largely due to the decrease in the fair value of our U.S. stock-based comp plan and lower transaction volume. As Gord noted earlier, our Wealth Management results continue to reflect challenging market conditions and investments we're making for the long-term.</p>
          <p>Moving to Insurance on slide 18, net income of $179 million was up $38 million or 27% compared to last year, driven by lower claims cost in our Canadian Insurance products and a favorable adjustment of $24 million after-tax related to changes we made in the quarter to our proprietary distribution channel. Compared to last quarter earnings were up $28 million or 19%, largely due to the favorable adjustment.</p>
          <p>International Banking results this quarter reflect the $11 million after-tax loss related to the RBC Dexia acquisitions. Compared to last year, this quarter also had higher TCL in the Caribbean Banking, lower brokerage commissions in RBC Investor Services resulting from weak market conditions in Europe and higher stock costs. Compared to the second quarter, which included the $202 million after-tax loss related to the RBC Dexia acquisition, we also had higher TCL in Caribbean Banking, which Morten discussed.</p>
          <p>Turning to Capital Markets on slide 20, we had a strong quarter. Net income was $486 million, up $227 million over last year due to higher fixed income trading results, reflecting improved market conditions and higher corporate and investment banking results driven by strong client growth in our lending and loan syndication businesses.</p>
          <p>Compared to last quarter, earnings were up $37 million or 8% due to the strength in our corporate and investment banking businesses. This quarter's strong growth in our lending and loan syndication businesses largely in the U.S. and higher M&amp;A activity more than offset lower equity trading and equity origination.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we are very pleased with our record performance this quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model and the earnings power of our organizations.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin questions and answers. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-queue so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Gordon, but for the addition of Dexia, I guess, the exposure to Europe would have declined. So is the plan to continue to whittle that down or is it now in the range where it needs to be to support the ongoing business there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start, and then we'll let my colleagues &#x2013; want to add in some business perspectives. So, I mean, we are continuing to, as I said, actively look at the exposure that we have and ensure that they are appropriate and relatively low risk. We continue to do business out of our UK operations that involve transacting with well-rated counterparties, primarily in the better rated countries, and that will generate, depending on our success in the transaction, some variability in the exposure. And given the counterparties we are dealing with, I'm quite comfortable to see that number move around somewhat because the mix of it is with better counterparties. I think what we're focusing on is making sure that the weaker end of the exposure scale or the areas where there's not a strong strategic rationale for being there that we take proactive action to dealing with that.</p>
          <p>So I would say that depending on our business success, you may see some ongoing slight reductions in portions of the portfolio, but with any luck we'll have that offset by some growth in business activities with well-rated counterparties that we are looking to do business with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see any need to high-grade the portfolio at all? You are perfectly happy with the counterparties as they sit today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On balance, I'm quite satisfied with the exposure that we have. I mean, there's always opportunities to whittle out some of the weaker pieces, but I would say we're close to the end of dealing with those issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Another one for Morten. The Caribbean PCLs are still elevated and I'm wondering when you expect that to tail-off. And then just on the trading, over the past two quarters, how much of the trading results have been benefiting from just the whittling down of your trading assets? Are there any substantial gains going in there? And, I guess, just to confirm, Janice, the operating leverage of 3.5% is not sustainable in Canadian retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll jumpstart with the Caribbean, and I'll let Stan and Janice probably handle the other parts of the question.</p>
          <p>So, on the Caribbean, I guess, a couple of points there. I mean, the performance continues to be so much disappointing, but I want to emphasize a couple of points here. One of the things we did during the quarter was have a thorough look at our portfolios in terms of allowance coverage across the region, particularly for the retail portfolios. So a reasonable portion of the provisions you saw this quarter represents an effort as a result of our review of those portfolios ensuring consistency in approach and appropriate level of coverage ratios for those portfolios to the $66 million worth of PCL for the Caribbean. A good chunk of that is more in the nature of catch-up and reflective of review of the quarter.</p>
          <p>I commented on impaired loans formations and they remain relatively high in the Caribbean, but I think it's also worth noting that both impaired loans formations are down $20 million plus for the quarter, the overall level of impaired loans is also starting to come down. So, while asset quality remains a problem in that business, we are generally seeing a movement in the right direction. And so from an asset quality standpoint, I would expect to see slow but gradual improvements.</p>
          <p>I guess, the balancing part to that, I would say the performance from my perspective in the Caribbean banking business is now more dependent on seeing revenue and net revenue improvements and further improvements in asset quality, I think that will take a while. As I said in my comments, with the economic environment, we cannot expect to see a quick turnaround there, but the trends are generally moving in the right direction. And if we have an economic improvement, the recovery piece on asset quality will speed up, but it will take some time to work through the problems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that response.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gab. On the trading question, as we've talked about really for a couple of years now, we have been very focused on reducing legacy exposures and reducing complexity in the business. So, really what you're looking at is from a trading perspective very clean numbers. I'd refer you to Morten's slide 13 where you can look at declining inventories from a year ago, you'll notice that really Q1, Q2 2012 and Q3 that we just reported really is not significant change. What really has happened as we've talked about is we've refocused the business around this, very keen focus on plans than origination.</p>
          <p>And what you don't see in these numbers is around that a significant pickup in velocity, that is the amount of secondary flow that we're doing in the business to support client activity. So, velocity has doubled from Q3 last year to Q3 today. And that's really what's driving the numbers even though generally in the market we are looking at very difficult environment, especially on the equity side volumes are down significantly, but we have been able to gain market share on what's been driving that is the focus that we had a year ago on the clients. We talked about supporting our clients through very difficult markets and that's paying off. And then as Doug, has talked about our focus on origination and quarter-on-quarter &#x2013; sorry, year-on-year we've seen about a 24% increase, for example in DCM revenues. So, the model has shifted and it's proving to be in this environment certainly more resilient than a pure trading model.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Gabriel, it's Dave McKay here, I will answer your operating leverage question. I think reflecting on Janice's comments, we are just forecasting slightly lower operating leverage given the timing factor around expenses and the volatility there, but still forecasting positive operating leverage.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a quick question on capital and what might be the governing concerns. There's clearly not Basel III common equity given where you are in the ratio, but looking at the essence to capital as the CMHC securitization funding rolls off, I imagined, yes, it's the capital multiple trend up all of equal. If you can get us &#x2013; give us a sense of how &#x2013; what the order of magnitude of that might be just on the securitization rolling off? And then how constraining do you think gross leverage ratios is, whether it's OSFI version or the Basel II version, how constraining will they be over the next couple of years and will it change the way you're looking at the marginal profitability of variety of activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Janice, Peter. Why don't I start with that and maybe my colleagues in Capital Markets can give some business color. When we look at capital in terms of constraining factors, we don't see leverage being a constraining factor. The roll off of the mortgages and securitization spending is not that significant because as you know we have the lowest insured ratio mortgages of all of the Canadian banks. And when we manage our balance sheet we are really managing for risk return. So, as you saw us deleveraging our balance sheet, it was all about ensuring that we were doing the right activity around balance sheet optimization. With respect to capital, we are maintaining very conservative buffers in anticipation of Basel III, because we're waiting for some additional guidance around areas like national SIFI. You've seen us on our segment reporting allocating a lot of capital down into the segments to ensure that we get the right behavior around our balance sheet leverage and our use of the balance sheet in optimizing activity. So, why don't I turn it over to Doug, you and Stan to discuss how we're optimizing at the margin in Capital Markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter, I'll just comment on gross adjusted assets. As we've have shrunk the trading inventory, a business that we've grown and has proven to be very successful is our secured financing business. And so that's picked up a lot of the balance sheet swank that has been reduced on the inventory side. And I echo Janice's comments that we don't see leverage constraints as any issue to that business is right-sized for our size and the activity levels and the risk profile that we want to maintain there. So, we're very comfortable and don't see it as a constraint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The RWA pick-up in the investment bank's balance sheet is really around the loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, if you look in at the stuff, you will see that we have had significant loan growth and it was in Janice's slides as well and most of that's in the U.S. and it's about 75% to investment grade and that would be the largest use of balance sheet or largest increase of balance sheet year-over-year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as Janice said, just to emphasize, we did have the lowest level of securitization of the bank. The other comment that I would just make from a general perspective, and I think this applies to all of the Canadian banks. But the bad news about the way we're operating today is we're operating with fully loaded capital and liquidity rules compared to a lot of other banks around the world. The good news of that is it puts us in a very strong position as the world unfolds going forward, and these rules are applied more strenuously to other institutions. And so, when you look at how we're running our businesses today, it's with pretty much fully loaded capital and liquidity rules.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a point of clarification first of all. I think it was Janice, in your remarks you were suggesting that you were &#x2013; the FTE count was flat year-over-year. When I look at the overall FTE count in Canada, it looks like it's up quite a bit. I understand the other is probably Dexia related. But were these people brought in at the end of the quarter, and can you talk about the expense hit at the top of the house for Q4? And then I'll sneak a real quick one in for George Lewis as well. George when I look at your results, I tend to always think of Royal's having the premier Wealth Management franchise, but your results just don't look as good as your peers. And it hasn't been &#x2013; it hasn't looked as good as your peers in the last few quarters. I wonder if you can talk about what it is that you're finding challenging with your business and what it is that you're going to do to sort of fix it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, it's Janice. I'll start with the FTE question. So when we look &#x2013; when I talk about FTE, at the end of the quarter, I think in total we added about 6,000 FTE related to our acquisition of the other 50% of Investor Services. Remember that we have a significant presence in Investor Services in Canada. We have the dominant market share. We have 2,400 FTE in Canada. So almost half of the total of 6,000 in Investor Services that we added. So, when you look at potential expense or revenue, you'll see what will be flowing in in Q4 would be a fully loaded 100% pick up of the Investor Services business, both revenue and expenses. There are no other net adds anywhere else in Canada in any of the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, it's George. Thanks very much for the question. And I guess I'd start by disaggregating the Wealth Management segment we have here at RBC and making the point that our Canadian businesses on a peer-to-peer basis continue to perform extremely well, both in Wealth Management and Asset Management. So, we continue to gain share in both of those businesses, and those are our highest margin businesses.</p>
          <p>Where we are differentiated in our strategy is we have a large U.S. Wealth Management business and a growing UK and emerging markets Wealth Management business as well. And overall, when you look at our revenue sources, we are trying to drive a greater proportion across our segment in fee business, that's why we're growing asset management in particular, and within our geographic businesses emphasizing that. But fully one-third of our revenues remain transaction-based revenues and a large portion of that is reflected in our U.S. Wealth Management business, which I would say is making progress in improving revenue per advisor.</p>
          <p>But I'd say the most differentiating factor you've seen in the last couple of quarters in our results would be the investments we're making in building our UK and emerging market business. So, for example, we attracted 40 advisors into those platforms in the third quarter alone. And we're taking advantage of the strength and stability of RBC, our global focus on Wealth Management, but we're investing in a very challenging environment, as Gord mentioned. And while clients are coming over, they are largely staying in cash balances at the moment as opposed to long-term investments. So it's taking longer for that revenue and positive impact &#x2013; income impact to flow through on our results from that positive activity. So, that would be the big differentiator because we have those global businesses which our Canadian peers would not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just want to confirm a couple of numbers that I think were mentioned. You said in the &#x2013; with respect to the $51 billion of wholesale loans that you have, there is a percent in the U.S. that I didn't catch and 75% is investment grade, you had 40% year-over-year growth and 9% quarter-over-quarter. So, how are you getting that strong growth in this lending? What kind of margin are you getting? And what kind of ancillary fee income do you build into your pricing expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, yes, the total loan book is $51 billion, and you are right on the growth numbers; I think year-over-year it's gone from about $37 billion to $51 billion, which is roughly 40%, which is a significant increase. And most of that increase has occurred in the U.S. The exact amount, I'd have to give you, but I would say that probably it's about 90% of the increased loan book is in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:14) this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the last year and over the last quarter. I mean, the Canadian loan book has been basically stable over the last year, and the growth you're seeing in the loan book is largely in the U.S. And the margin &#x2013; so that you have to keep in mind that we have sort of plus or minus 300 investment bankers in the U.S., 150 corporate bankers, a couple of hundred municipal bankers. We have a lot of people in front of clients and a lot of opportunities to lend. And I think one of the best opportunities is that a number of our competitors, especially European competitors, have been backing off that market and a number of the customers in the U.S. would like to do business with a Canadian bank. So, it has been a reasonable opportunity at least.</p>
          <p>I would say in terms of the margins, we're lending to &#x2013; the average customer's a BBB, BBB minus public company, and we would be lending between <mark type="ph" /> L+125 and L+150 (37:20) with some fees upfront. What we try to get to is a two-to-one ratio in terms of ancillary versus core lending revenue. Because we've been growing the loan book as quickly as we have, that will come. We've also &#x2013; as was noted earlier in the comments, we've been doing a fair &#x2013; more leveraged finance, and we've been able to distribute what we've underwritten, and that's also been lucrative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Gord. The other thing that I would emphasize, because I think it's extremely important, is that if you remember back to what we were doing in the early part of the 2000s, we intentionally drove our loan book down in the United States and internationally quite dramatically, and it was on the basis that you weren't getting paid to extend credit, covenants were light, to say the least, and to some degree, we didn't have the ability to generate the same level on ancillary business.</p>
          <p>So, if you actually look at our loan book today in the United States, it's still lower than it was back in 1999 and &#x2013; I think that's correct, isn't it, Doug? Yeah, it's lower than it was back in 1999 and it remains lower than many of our other Canadian competitors even as we sit today. So, we've had a lot of capacity to extend our credit because of the decisions that we've made over the last 10 years or so. And the big difference is not only do we get paid today to extend credit, the returns on the loans themselves are much more attractive, but the terms and conditions are also much more conservative and our ability to leverage those corporate and commercial relationships is much more significant today. So, while the growth appears to be very high, which we believe is a very good thing, it's off a very low base because of some of the decisions that we took over the past 10 years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is for Dave. Dave, could you talk a little bit, you said the operating leverage is going to be less in Q4. Could you talk about your plans for next year? And then, just give us an update on your outlook for NIMs. And are you seeing anymore slowdown in mortgage originations as a result of the new rules that have gone into place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. It's Dave. So as we look at what we are trying to do, we are certainly &#x2013; our goal is to drive positive operating leverage, and we've always talked about that. So we'll continue to manage our expenses and our revenues carefully. Now, we are in a bit of a volatile world and there is pressure on deposit margins. We've been able &#x2013; very successful in offsetting that with good growth in higher margin, commercial and credit card lending over the last quarter. So you've got a lot of offsetting forces going on. So it's tough to predict exactly where are things going, but overall I think the comment was that it's going to get a little bit tougher to manage that. But our target is to drive our efficiency ratio down into the low 40s, and we are &#x2013; as you can see, we are continually quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year making very good progress towards that and we'll continue to focus on that goal. And that's &#x2013; the important part of that driver is to make sure you manage your revenues and your expenses carefully. Now we are heading into &#x2013; I think continuous &#x2013; as we've talked about over the last year, a lower rate environment pressures our very large deposit business, and that pressure won't alleviate.</p>
          <p>As far as the mortgage business, you'd have to expect some slowdown. We've come through a very strong spring mortgage season. We're extremely happy with our results and the significant market share gains that we've seen. We'll continue to compete. There is not a lot of evidence of the slowdown right now, but you'd have to expect with the B-20 rules really kicking in and some of the price depreciation that won't be there in the marketplace around housing. Those are some of the key drivers you see in mortgage growth. You'd have to expect some type of slowdown from the strong, strong rates that we are seeing today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just, Dave, on the spreads, I think in the past you've said with the prospect of maybe Bank of Canada raising rates, but now that prospect looks diminished. Are we just looking at a sustained period here of a few basis points or one or two compression in margins over the next year, is that a fair assumption to make or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not projecting anything drastic here. As we roll off higher rate mortgages and put on lower rate mortgages and we don't have the ability to use our very strong checking account and DDA deposit base to fund, it puts downward pressure on overall margins without an increase in our rate environment. So, we'll continue to operate in that challenging environments, and the key is to keep growing your credit card business, your commercial business to try to offset that. But you are right. I think you are on the right track to say that there will be somewhat of a downward pressure there, but we don't expect anything drastic.</p>
