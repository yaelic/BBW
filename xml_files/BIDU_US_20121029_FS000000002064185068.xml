      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. This was another solid quarter for Baidu. We posted revenue in line of guidance despite evolving industry dynamics. Our focus on integrating our services to provide a seamless experience for users and to deliver unparalleled ROI for our customers continues to prove very successful. And as mobile traffic continues to take off, we are investing aggressively to cement our leadership with users. We're also working hard to close the mobile monetization gap, although this will initially involve a period of transition. As you know, we hosted our annual Baidu World Conference in September, where we shared a clear vision for our future in mobile and cloud. I'll say more on this later on the call.</p>
          <p>First turning to our performance for the quarter, we achieved a record net customer add of 38,000 quarter-on-quarter, and that's a 28% customer growth year-on-year as we continued to help SMEs in second and third-tier cities leverage the Baidu platform for their marketing needs. This was due largely to improvements to efficiency of our sales teams. Much work remains to be done on this front and we've just begun to realize the potential here.</p>
          <p>More traditional advertisers also came on board from sectors like food and beverage, cosmetics and retail in this quarter. These customers are still new to the online space and we are well positioned to benefit as they move budget to online marketing. We continuously see strong contributions from the travel vertical, where spending on Baidu has outpaced industry growth. We are well placed to capture future opportunity in this important sector.</p>
          <p>Lastly, there is tremendous room to improve monetization technologies and tools to create efficiencies for our customers. This will continue to be a focal point and we expect to continue seeing gradual contributions on this front. As you know, success ultimately rests on user experience, and that's the reason we work so hard to integrate rich, relevant content with web search. And this doesn't just mean Baidu content; it includes all other vertical partnerships, third-party apps, content, websites and sponsored links. This is what box computing is about. And on desktop and mobile platforms, we are delivering this experience on about 80% of our searches.</p>
          <p>What's even more impressive is that over 50% of these box computing results involve integrated Baidu products. Our vertical product, like Post Bar, Baidu Knows, Baidu Encyclopedia, Baidu Maps, Baidu Image Search and Video Search, the travel site, Qunar, and video site, ITE, are all leaders in their respective fields and are improving all the time. By more closely integrating them with web search, we are taking the user experience to the next level.</p>
          <p>We've also integrated hundreds of thousands of apps onto our platform. This means that Baidu's search box can now find semantic intelligence to return relevant app search results. For example, if a user searches for an accounting app to keep track of her finances, she will be served with a variety of relevant apps right on the search result page. This is the kind of similar experience PC and mobile users demand, and will continuously improve our ecosystem growth. We truly believe that whoever offers users the best experience will win in the long-term, and with our deep experience and understanding of China's internet, we are confident that we can do this better than anyone else.</p>
          <p>I also want to emphasize the progress we've made with ITE, which is the key strategic vertical for us. China's online video industry is growing rapidly. Monthly user time spent increased by over 100% year-on-year in August, which is an incredible number. During this crucial period of growth, we are pleased that ITE has established itself firmly as a premier player in the market. It has rich and diverse content that's driving brand recognition and greater high-quality content. It's now number one in China in terms of time spent per user and number two in terms of total monthly time spent, according to iResearch. Monthly unique visitors reached 407 million in Q3 compared to 250 million last quarter due to increasing brand awareness and seasonal factors, and mobile traffic now accounts for about 20% of the overall traffic.</p>
          <p>We believe in the mobile future, and that future is arriving fast, and Baidu is in a great position to meet the challenges and exploit the opportunities brought by this PC-to-mobile evolution. To give you a sense of this, mobile search traffic was up 110% from Q3 last year and 25% from the previous quarter. And based on our internal tracking, we continue to enjoy an ever-stronger position in the mobile search market. Following this trend, we have seen some good progress on our mobile monetization even though this may be coming off a low base. While we are encouraged by this growth, it is still going to take customers time to catch up the shift to mobile, as we've seen in more diversified mobile markets. Enhancing efficiencies on the mobile monetization platform, educating and encouraging customers to adopt this channel and developing mobile-ready websites are just some of the tasks ahead.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind everyone that this is not the first time Baidu has navigated a complicated transition. About four years ago, when we realized the ever-larger internet search volume and customer number required a more sophisticated monetization system, we started something called Phoenix Nest. Educating customers was of paramount importance. We needed to encourage them to leverage the new SME tools offered by Phoenix Nest and we had to demonstrate the system's clear benefits. After much careful planning and extensive customer outreach, we made the decision to fully roll out Phoenix Nest to our customers in late 2009. The transition's rapid success proved our execution capabilities. The large majority of our hundreds of thousands of customers transitioned to this new monetization platform smoothly and efficiently, and today the Phoenix Nest system serves as the sturdy foundation for <mark type="ph" /> our business (10:27).</p>
          <p>The PC-to-mobile shift is in some ways similar and creates new opportunities for us. This shift will also require a period of re-tooling and customer education as we show them how to take full advantage of the mobile internet opportunity. We are fully committed to pushing this transition forward, and confident that our efforts in mobile monetization will pay off in the long run.</p>
          <p>Let me update you on our mobile and cloud products. Staying ahead of industry developments, creating a seamless mobile internet experience and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:10) users and usage are key priorities. Our progress on this front is reflected in the strong market position of both our mobile search and LBS products, like map.</p>
          <p>At this year's Baidu World Conference, we announced that we will now open up our sophisticated cloud infrastructure to third-party app developers. We officially rolled out powerful new tools and resources for developers; what we call our seven weapons. These are designed to enable developers to build, distribute, manage, store and optimize their apps on the Baidu Cloud platform. Already over 100,000 developers have registered on the Baidu platform, and as more come on board, the value of Baidu Cloud to users will increase exponentially.</p>
          <p>In mid-September, we launched a version 4.0 of our mobile maps app, which further indicates our industry-leading LBS functionality. This involves our free proprietary online <mark type="ph" /> launch (12:37) navigation service and real-time information for users on the go that includes real-time fast arrival times. We are particularly excited by the new indoor navigation functionality. We realize it isn't enough to simply tell users how to get to the mall or the theater. This function means they can find their way to the exact shop or the exact ticket office they need to get to. And Baidu LBS now covers restaurants, movie theaters, karaoke halls, malls, hotels, public transportation, supermarkets, parks and all kinds of services. So the commercial potential here is huge.</p>
          <p>The latest statistics from Analysis International rank Baidu mobile Maps number one in daily active user accounts, and we are building on this position all the time. As you know, we announced a few days ago that we established an LBS business unit, which will cover all map and previous local-related products. This is an indication of how important LBS is strategically for us.</p>
          <p>Total user numbers are increasing exponentially at nine times year-on-year this quarter. The new division will be focused on accelerating the expansion of our LBS services to build on the strong base we have already. So there is a lot more to come here.</p>
          <p>And as part of our mobile ecosystem, we also launched a new-improved mobile browser this quarter. Our aim here was to produce a highly compatible, versatile, interface for users to enjoy all the rich services that Baidu and Baidu's developing ecosystem can provide. The browser features the fastest HTML5 engine on the market today. It's gaining good traction and has seen over 10 million activations in the first few weeks since its launch.</p>
          <p>To conclude, the transition in search to a more mobile-centric model is well underway in China. And while we are naturally very excited by this new opportunity, we also understand well the challenges that any evolution of this scale inevitably brings. I want to emphasize that there will be a transition period lasting a couple of years before the mobile monetization gap will close. But I also want to make it clear that there is much Baidu is already doing to close the gap. We are educating customers about the new possibilities afforded by mobile marketing. We are optimizing monetization for mobile. And perhaps most importantly we are building a compelling mobile ecosystem around Baidu core products like mobile search, maps and LBS, and around Baidu's unrivaled cloud capabilities. The rewards that mobile stands to bring are huge, and with a clear strategy in place, we are focused, confident and ready to win the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the over to Jennifer to go through the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. We posted another solid quarter with good top- and bottom-line growth. As Robin laid out in his prepared remarks, this is a transitional time for the industry in the Internet in China. To make sure we are capturing the tremendous market opportunities we see ahead, we will continue to increase the pace of investment in our key businesses and products key personnel, key partners and core infrastructure facilities. Food and M&amp;A will continue to complement organic investments, particularly in mobile and cloud technology and vertical content.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to go through our financial results for the quarters with you. All amounts are in RMB unless otherwise noted. For the third quarter, total revenues were RMB6.3 billion, representing a 49.7% increase year-on-year. During the third quarter, Baidu had approximately 390,000 active online marketing customers; a 28% increase from the corresponding period in 2011 and an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue for online marketing customers for the third quarter was approximately RMB16,000; a 17% increase from the corresponding period in 2011 and an increase of 3% from the previous quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q3 was RMB538 million or 8.6% of total revenues, compared to 8% in the corresponding period in 2011 and 8.3% in the previous quarter. The increase was mainly driven by increased promotion of Baidu's products and services, such contractual apps and Hao123 to our network.</p>
          <p>As previously stated, Baidu Union is an important network for us. We have greatly improved the quality of the network in the past two years. We manage a dynamic relationship with our partners and we will leverage it to drive our own products, current and new. As indicated before, we expect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:37) as a percent of revenue to trend upwards in the coming quarters as a result. Bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue in Q3 were 4.3% and 4.5%, respectively, compared to 4% and 4.2% in the corresponding period of 2011. This increase was mainly due to an increase in network infrastructure capacity.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense in Q3 was RMB643 million, an increase of 40% year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in marketing and promotion-related expense and people-related expenses. For the coming quarter, we have a lot of exciting new products and features that we'll look to promote. R&amp;D expenses in Q3 were RMB615 million, an increase of 61% over the corresponding period in 2011, primarily due to increased head count, reflecting our continued strategic investment in R&amp;D talent.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items increased in aggregate to RMB57 million in the third quarter from RMB39 million in the corresponding period in 2011. Share-based compensation is an important component of our overall compensation and incentive structure. We plan to put more emphasis on this to attract and incentivize key talent.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for Q3 was RMB3.3 billion; an increase of 48% over Q3 2011. Total head count as of September 30, 2012, was about 18,660; roughly 1,300 more than the previous quarter. Income tax expense was RMB468 million for the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13.5% compared to 14.5% in Q3 2011.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Baidu for Q3 was RMB3 billion; a 60% increase from the corresponding period in 2011. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS for the third quarter of 2012 amounted to RMB8.60 billion and RMB8.59 billion respectively. Net income attributable to Baidu, excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure for Q3, was RMB3.1 billion; a 60% increase year-on-year. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS, excluding share-based compensation expenses, plus non-GAAP measures, were 8.76 and 8.76 respectively. As of September 30, 2012, the company had cash equivalent and short-term investments of RMB21.3 billion. Net operating cash inflow for the third quarter of 2012 was RMB3.8 billion. Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2012 were RMB504 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you with the top-line guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012. We currently expect total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012 to be between RMB6.155 billion and RMB6.345 billion, which would represent a 37.6% to 41.8% year-on-year increase. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary review, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I believe a couple of dynamics play out in the second half of the year, including macro slowdown in China, some change in the competitive landscape, maybe mobile traffic changes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:30) customer number. I wonder if management can comment how this factor impacted the Q3 results and what are the factoring in for the Q4 guidance as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dick. Good morning to you. As we have laid out the main drivers for the business, we had a very solid quarter in Q3. We had record net add in terms of number of customers and we continue to make good progress with traditional advertisers on the large account basis. The overall market micro situation, obviously if we compare that to last year, is softer, not as strong as last year, and I think that we continue to have very solid financial performance in this environment. We did put much emphasis in our prepared remarks to talk about the opportunities that lay ahead that the transition affords us between PC to mobile, and I think there is tremendous opportunities that's laying ahead, and there is much work, great progress that has been made by us. The opportunity is huge and we are excited about that. We stand ready to educate the market, to help our customers and to take up the financial rewards from the new universe that mobile brings to us.</p>
          <p>So if we look at comparatively to last year, some of the micro environment isn't as healthy, but I think from an execution standpoint the team continues to demonstrate that we can really deliver, continue to develop the market, and it also shows the market potential is huge. The industry is going through a transition. Mobile traffic is going up very fast and I think we are all very excited about the new opportunities. So these are the factors that played into the Q3, Q4 numbers. Back to you comments on the competitive landscape, no new entrants really had material impact to us in Q3 or in our Q4 forecast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is, we have seen &#x2013; it seems like there has been a deceleration in the deferred revenue and consumer deposits growth, so could you comment on those front? And then secondly, you also mentioned that you haven't seen any material impact from new entrants on your financial results in the third quarter, as well as your fourth quarter guidance, but how about on the traffic side? Have we seen any impact on the traffic side? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eddie, on deferred revenue and the customer deposits, I think you are right in looking at some of these metrics as if there is any trend. I think majority you know of our business is from the SME business. In the SME business, they pay an out front deposit. I think on this Q3, if you look at our balance sheet, the customer deposit continued to post a sequential, a very handsome, increase. The deferred revenue is more a timing issue. It has something to do with part of our large account business. It depends on the tests, such as if the contract has been circulated back, and we have all the proper paperwork in place. There is a little bit of timing difference. But deferred revenue itself is not really an indication of future business.</p>
          <p>When we talk about the financial impact and traffic impact, I feel &#x2013; I think if you guys have followed Baidu all along, throughout our history, we've had multiple entrants, multiple &#x2013; we are always very familiar with competition. And what we believe is the player that ultimately serves the highest quality of search results to the users that can really address the users' needs, will win. And the traffic trend that we are seeing, as we've talked in our prepared remarks, the tremendous opportunities on mobile. And much &#x2013; if we look at the overall users' needs, they today come from multiple devices. And our ultimate goal is to address the users' needs, their search needs, regardless of what kind of end devices coming from. So this is the overall trend that we are seeing. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, mobile is growing very fast and we are excited about that opportunity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Victor. Thanks for taking my question. My question is regarding mobile. So, in your view, what are your strengths or competitive advantage as the traffic moves from PC to mobile, and what do you think is your weakness or the areas that you believe still need improvement as we face the traffic dilution from PC? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as you know, we have a very dominant position in the desktop web search. We have been building the best quality search service for the Chinese users for more than 10 years and we have a great brand for search. When users shift from PC to mobile, they naturally look for the same brand, same quality of search services. So we enjoy a lot of benefits on the mobile front. Having said that, mobile search is different from desktop search in certain ways. That's why we are working very hard to come up with search experiences that address those unique needs for mobile users.</p>
          <p>In term of challenge, as I mentioned over the previous prepared remarks, there's a shift, so many of our customers are not really ready for the shift. Their sites are not so mobile-friendly and they are not very used to come up with creatives that uniquely suit the mobile users' needs. In terms of the starting point, desktop search is the undisputed gateway or starting point for most of the Internet users on PC or desktop, but on mobile, things are evolving very quickly.</p>
          <p>We have seen users to use their &#x2013; use apps. They spend a lot of time seeing apps, but less time seeing browser. So we offer both browser and apps specially designed for our search products. We also have the best service in terms of LBS, especially Baidu maps. I also mentioned that has been growing tremendously. So going forward on the mobile, there might be multiple starting points like search or maps, and we are working hard to prepare for that, and I believe that we will continue to be the sender of the Internet ecosystem in the mobile age.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions and thanks for all the comments on mobile so far. I also wanted to follow up on mobile as well. Could you remind us, what's the mobile search query, just for search, what's the mobile query as a percentage of the total query? And also, could you please comment on your thoughts on the differences between coverage ratio, click-through rate and keyword price for mobile, let's say a couple of years out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mobile traffic as a percentage of total search traffic continued to grow, and, like I mentioned, year-on-year mobile traffic grew triple digits. So you can get a sense that traffic mix continued to shift. And in terms of monetization, we have done a lot of things and we're trying all kinds of different techniques to help educate our customers. And the coverage click-through rate, cost per click, all depends on the maturity of the mobile search market or mobile paid search market. So the monetization on our end will continue to improve user experience, user interface while continue to improve. But more importantly, our advertisers or customers, they need to come up with ways to fully take advantage of that. As I mentioned before, we expect this will take a couple of years to close the gap.</p>

So first, congratulations on the strong results against the dynamic <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:33) market. A couple of question on rates for mobile and the other is on vertical. The first question is on Qunar. So, can you update us on the company's performance in the past quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is also regarding to mobile. So currently, I find that there are several debates in the area of mobile operating system. Why is Alibaba <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:54) was bought out by Google. They have given the dispute. And the other is quality management. The complaint is that they are not invited by the match-up to the conference of the launch of the Windows 8, for Windows point 8. So my question is, can you tell from the management about the trend, it seems that there will be a kind of pressure at that ecosystem based on different operating systems, will become more and more close. And if that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:24) operating system will become more closer than before, so what kind of study that we can take to deal with that kind of challenges? So I will stop here. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I take your first question with regards to performance of Qunar. Qunar continues to perform very well. As we highlight in our own business, the travel vertical outperformed the industry average in this past quarter, so we see strong travel vertical performance on our own platform, and since we consolidate the Qunar overall financial numbers, the Qunar business itself also posted strong Q3 performance. I think on both the &#x2013; that really proves that the travel vertical has great potential and we're well positioned to continue to perform well in this vertical.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the mobile OS question, our belief is that going forward an operating system and a single device will become less and less important. The power resides on the cloud side and the integration, significant integration, between the terminal devices and mobile operating system and the cloud computing power. We believe the system will continue to offer opportunities, at least the Linux-based open source, it's not closed, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:05) has promised it to be open, but even if they are not, a single operating system on a single device will become less relevant.</p>
          <p>So we have the technology to come up with necessary capabilities and we are busy building our computing power and infrastructure on the cloud side, and we are trying to fully integrate the client side and cloud side, and going forward, we believe this will become a trend, and developers will follow us on this.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. Can you share with us the traffic, the search traffic growth trend, on the PC and mobile side, and also the paid click growth? Specifically I remember you guys mentioned in the first quarter conference call that mobile search represented about 20% of the total traffic. So right now is it still at 20%? Does it imply the PC traffic growth is similar to the mobile traffic growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the traffic growth, as I mentioned, mobile is growing very quickly, triple digits, year-over-year. PC traffic is certainly not as exciting. But overall, consumers do have information needs, be it on desktops or mobile device or even television. Going forward, there will be multiple screens for consumers and wherever they are, we just try to meet their information needs. The overall search market will continue to grow. We just need to come up with the right monetization algorithm and educate our customers to take full advantage of this new computing environment and new devices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your question on paid clicks, well, sequentially the paid click continues to grow and is of course one of the drivers that drove the Q3 results in terms of sequential revenue increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. My question is on ARPU front. Historically, Q3 actually has been a strong season for the sequential ARPU increase, but this quarter we have been seeing very small ARPU increase. So is it an effect of the dilution of the new customer or is it because your pricing power or paid clicks growth has reached certain limits? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Wendy, as you note, our revenue is driven by the number of customer growth as well as ARPU per account. We did add a lot of new customers this past quarter, and these customers, a majority of them are SMEs. And SMEs, as we develop in second and third-tier cities, their spending power, of these new players, are not as strong as the existing or more bigger players. So that's one of the elements that's driving the ARPU number.</p>
          <p>I think one of the references I would refer to was last year. Last year, ARPU did pose very strong sequential growth. And last year, if you recall, we had a significant outstanding performance by the large accounts. And the large accounts, not only because it was good services and players recognizing the value of our platform to allocate more budgets, we also had half sectors like e-commerce and group buy, and these people were spending millions with us. So that was the driver for ARPU in the past year. And this year, as you have consistently seen, the SME development has been the theme and the SMEs' ARPU capabilities, of course, is no comparison to the large accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to follow up on that, so looking to the future, will your future focus more on the small customers or big customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to have room on both fronts. I think what we have posted in terms of net customer adds, it shows that when you put an emphasis, it continues to really try to improve the process, the market potential is there. It's really waiting for us to develop. And on the large client business, I think we have highlighted some of the online players, that they really know how to take advantage of search engine marketing. And traditional players, it takes time for us to develop and cultivate.</p>
          <p>This year in particular, the macro sentiment is more tight compared to prior year, so we continue to do work on that front, but I think the bigger environment does not really allow the large customers to really grow at a fast pace. But from what we're seeing, the large clients continue to have huge budget opportunities that it takes us, too, and them to work together to move their budget over. So in terms of potential, it's there. I think just both on the large clients and SME businesses, it takes our work to continue to develop the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First, let me apologize if the audio is not very good because we're having a storm here in New York. My first question is about your current traffic acquisition costs and investment levels. I think during the quarters, your cost and expense as a percentage of revenues actually came down a little bit on a sequential basis. But do you think that level of expense are sustainable during the transition period between desktop, mobile and some of the internet search industry competitive landscape change? And how should we model the level of your spending on traffic acquisition costs and R&amp;D and sales and marketing going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think, as I said, we posted very solid Q4 financial performance. We continue to enjoy high operating margin, but I have indicated for some time that we are in the investment cycle and we should not expect that this high level of operating margin will last forever. And in terms of the investment, I made the clear indication that we're going to accelerate our investment pace. In terms of expense line items, some of the items that you've referred to tag. As I said, we manage a dynamic relationship with our partners and we leverage this union network to promote our products and services, and this may include contextual apps which help us generate incremental revenue. It also help we use this network to promote our products, such as the Hao123, such as new services and products that we want to push out through the union network.</p>
          <p>So, through dynamic changes, we expect the tag rates to increase. I think if you look at the historical trends, historical ranges of the tag, it is dynamic and it could move quite sizably. This past quarter, we have seen some marginal tick-up, and as I indicated clearly, we expect the trend to go up in our quarters. In terms of other line item investments, people, we have consistently invested in our R&amp;D talent and that has an established pattern and will be continuing to be our focus. I did indicate that SPC is a very valuable item for us to leverage to incentivize our staff, and that's one item that we continue to &#x2013; that we can leverage going forward.</p>
          <p>The infrastructure has been the theme for us to invest to support our strategic initiatives like cloud and mobile, and we have increased our pace in infrastructure setup, and that momentum will carry. Sales and marketing, if we look at that, we have many exciting new products, particularly on the mobile front to push out, and we'll use these line items to push our new products. I also indicated that mobile affords much new opportunities and it takes &#x2013; we need speedy executions, and we may leverage M&amp;A to complement our organic investment to position us strategically in a timely fashion. So that's basically, if you look at the activities going forward, this is kind of the picture I would give you, a view as you look forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jennifer, if you could talk a little bit about the money, the expenses related to new customer adds. You seem to have seen an acceleration in customer adds while some of your marketing dollars remain pretty consistent as a percentage of sales. And so are you just getting more leverage or is that theme &#x2013; do you think that theme is going to continue? I seem to hear a message about you're going to be in investment mode, but maybe you could just talk a little bit about that, specifically the new customer adds. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>New customers that we really brought on board in the past quarter are primarily SMEs. And in both the direct sales force as well as the distribution networks, the partners we have, have both contributed to the customer growth. And some of these customers, they come from the second and third-tier cities and they are across the industry sectors. There are some new sectors that are cultivated in these different markets. Sectors like agriculture even, or local services like restaurants or business services. So these are smaller businesses that may have little marketing budgets to begin with. But what we are doing on the sales team front is on, one, to train them, to really understand the search and the marketing, on the other hand, to give them better, more user-friendly interface in terms of system so that they can self-service. So while we develop these customers and their budget may be slow, we hope that we will educate them and they can see improved and great ROIs, and they can continue to work with us.</p>
          <p>So, I think on the top hand, the market opportunity is there, the SMEs are out there, and we are reaching out to them to develop the markets. So I think on those themes, it doesn't change. I think one of the features which relates to SME is we did make note that we're seeing tremendous growth in mobile, and customers take time to really understand the benefit. And I think this is particularly true for SMEs. So their position to take advantage of the mobile front will be timely and it will be time-consuming and it will take a lot of effort from our end. And mobile is the future and we have been talking about the opportunities in mobile and the investment we need to do there. And the investment, we're very clear on what we need to do.</p>
          <p>We have updated you about the progress we made on the mobile front, and I think over the next few quarters, even a number of years, we will be I think positioned to really shape the mobile picture and really educate the customer to bring them on board to mobile front, and they can leverage and take advantage of it. So this is the dynamics that's going on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our top spending category, yes. Let me offer you this information. The top five sectors for us in the past quarter includes the following: medical healthcare, education, travel, machinery equipment and franchising. So, if you look at the top sectors, these are the familiar sectors that you have seen in the past. We always have some sector, one or two, that changes, partly because of seasonal reasons. So when we look at the sector growth, we feel the main sectors are the same, but some sectors, like machinery, are not as strong. And as indicated in the past, that we do see the B2C sectors seems to growing steadily and healthily, and the B2B seems to be relatively depressed. In the last economically slowing period, we witnessed a similar phenomenon.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. As you stated, the company added more customers in the third quarter than in any quarter in history. So, obviously, customers want to be on the Baidu platform. My question is, what are your customers saying about the evolving dynamics and competition in the market? And do you expect competition to help grow the overall search market in China? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on developing these customers, particularly their SMEs, it takes a lot of our outreach to educate them. Our focus is to service them well, and for these customers, I think they can't get enough of us. The traffic, the search engine marketing model, is performance-based, as you know. So for the spending that they have with us, we drive relevant traffic to their business, and that creates business opportunities for these customers. So our focus with these customers is how can we improve the ROI? How can we drive more traffic to these customers? And if they see the benefit of that, that means they will increase their spending with us. So that has been the constant theme. I think the beauty of search is it is performance-based and the customers will be happy to spend more with us if we can really drive the relevant business opportunities for them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the opportunity, and congratulations on a good set of numbers. Could I just check with you, you talk about a change in the customer growth rate, as several people have asked, several analysts have asked. If you exclude the growth that you're seeing in SMEs, what would the ARPU trend for your large customers have been? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel it doesn't &#x2013; I don't know if this is the right way to look at our business. I can't exclude the SME businesses, because the SME is the majority of our business. Our large clients, if you look at that, there are maybe a thousand of them in the country, and these are typically brand players that they would have multiple marketing promotional needs. And that can be addressed by different platforms. So these large players, if you look at them, they do have spending on traditional media platform.</p>
          <p>They also take advantage of display apps in Internet and they use search to drive high performance kind of promotional needs. The large client business has been increasing very strongly over the years. Last year, it was an exceptional year, and this year, obviously the macro environment is not as strong as last year, and so we have indicated that the large client business is not growing at the triple-digit kind of scenario that we saw over the past year or so.</p>
          <p>But having said that, we continue to see very strong performance on the large clients. There is much opportunity we have and these large players have huge budgets, and the opportunities is for them to really bring their ad budgets over. So for large clients, the opportunity is in the ARPU, but large client business is only a small part of the overall business. So I think the business for us is we really serve a wide range of advertisers' needs. If you have a low budget, you can do advertising with us; if you have huge budgets, we can also be the platform that services them. So I think the question is, the SMEs, I can't exclude them. They are smaller spenders. Large clients of business, ARPU is an opportunity and we'll continue to develop a relationship and help them see the value that we can offer to them.</p>

          <p>Good morning and evening. Thank you for taking my questions.

          <p>In terms of market opportunities, I think we've been always very focused on servicing our customer. And I think as industry leader, we need to develop the marketplace. And as I said throughout the call, we see continued potential and opportunities for us to work to develop the market. I think the opportunity that's exciting laying ahead of us is what mobile development is really playing out. The mobile offers our advertisers new universe to present themselves, to target audience in a higher frequency and more precision. So we're excited about this opportunity. The market customers are there. I think ultimately users access Baidu for their search needs through multiple device, and as the users take more advantage of the services we offer, that gives the opportunity for the advertisers.</p>
          <p>So in terms of growth initiatives, we talked about all that. I think potential continues to be huge, but obviously the market, I know results is not &#x2013; we can singlehandedly push it through. So the market awaits us to develop, and the mobile is great opportunity, but we need to educate the customers and we need to develop the market. So overall, I think, back to your question, it's not just looking at where we are today on the PC front. I think we look at a dynamic multiple-screen industry evolution.</p>

So we can only give you the time for qualitative descriptions. In terms of pricing on desktop and mobile, right now, pricing on mobile is lower in terms of cost per click. As I mentioned, we are working very hard to improve the monetization system for mobile and to educate our customers to take full advantage of the mobile, and we expect that will take some time to close the gap.</p>
