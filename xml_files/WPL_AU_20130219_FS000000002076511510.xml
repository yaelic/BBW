          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Woodside's 2012 Full Year Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, 20th of February 2013.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Peter Coleman. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, all, and welcome to our 2012 full year results briefing. We very much appreciate your continued interest in Woodside. Sharing the conference call today is Lawrie Tremaine, our Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO. And with Laurie is Rob Cole, our Executive Director and Executive Vice President of Corporate and Commercial, who will join us for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>If I can move across to slide two, I'm sure the disclaimer notice, please; the main point here is that everything we'll talk about today is in U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>We can get on to the financial headlines on slide three. Today's results really highlight the ongoing strength of the company's base business and the very significant contribution Pluto made to our bottom line. You can see that 2012 has been a record year for the company in many aspects with strong improvement across key financial metrics.</p>
          <p>In particular, I'd like to draw your attention to the record revenue which led to a significant jump in our net profit after tax to almost $3 billion. We continued to deliver strong returns to our shareholders with a record full year U.S. dividend to $1.30 per share.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four. Looking back on our achievements over the past year, we could describe 2012 as a year of delivery against our revised strategic direction.</p>
          <p>Our safety performance improved slightly with a fall in total recordable case frequency but when measured against global benchmarks, our health and safety performance still fall short of our expectations. To address this, we will soon be implementing measures to achieve global top-quartile health and safety performance by the end of 2017.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we produced 84.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, a record volume for the company, which clearly demonstrates the value Pluto brings to our portfolio. Pluto achieved 89% capacity utilization against the 65% forecast contributing 24 million barrels of oil equivalent to full-year production.</p>
          <p>A strong balance sheet gives us many options but with that comes a greater need for fiscal discipline and this disciplined approach was evident as we captured potential new growth opportunities in Israel and Myanmar.</p>
          <p>And finally, in 2012, we embarked on a significant program of cultural change centered around the Woodside Compass, which links our values, vision, mission and strategic direction. It makes clear what our long-term success depends not only on the oil and gas we produce, but on doing what's right.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll hand over to Lawrie to take us through the financial results, and I'll join you at the end.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was a successful year for Woodside. So, it's a pleasure to be reviewing our results with you this morning.</p>
          <p>I'll begin with production on slide six. As Peter said, production for the year was 84.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, up 31% on 2011. This result was consistent with our market guidance during the year. Reliable production at Pluto since start-up in late April is the major reason for this positive result. Pluto was operated at an average capacity utilization of 89% against our internal forecast of 65%.</p>
          <p>The North West Shelf oil facility was shut in for over seven months in 2011, culminating in the commissioning and start-up of the new FPSO, the Okha, in September. With a full year of operation in 2012, we achieved a 2.5-million-barrel output increase year-on-year.</p>
          <p>We've also seen improved performance from the Vincent field. This was mainly due to increased facility availability and the impact of three infill wells brought on line between September 2011 and May 2012. The Vincent FPSO is currently at a shipyard in Singapore for a planned overhaul and will be offline for much of the first half of the year. The overhaul will improve the long-term reliability and availability of the facility.</p>
          <p>Field decline and the impact of the expiry of the Ohanet risk sharing contract negatively impacted production in the year. Field decline was most significant at the Stybarrow field following a boost in production in 2011 from the Stybarrow North infill well. We also experienced field decline at Enfield and in relation to condensate production from the North West Shelf Angel field. We maintain an active program of infill well development, to help offset this field decline. In 2013, we are planning for the fourth phase of infill drilling at Vincent.</p>
          <p>Now to reported profit on slide 7. As Peter mentioned, we achieved a record reported profit result in 2012. The result of $2.98 billion was boosted by a $974 million after-tax gain on sale of a minority portion of our Browse equity. After allowing for this and other non-recurring items, our underlying profit was $2.06 billion, also a record.</p>
          <p>Pluto played a significant role in this positive profit result. Pluto contributed revenues of $1.4 billion and a gross profit of $642 million for a part year of operations. North West Shelf LNG prices was the main driver of the $244 million favorable price variance shown in the chart. Average realized North West Shelf LNG prices were $77.85 per barrel of oil equivalent in 2012, more than $10 higher than the prior year. Oil prices and the premiums we receive for our Greater Enfield area crudes remained strong in 2012.</p>
          <p>Exploration activity has been lower as we rebuild our exploration portfolio. Our 2012 exploration expense reflects $90 million in cost savings associated with the farm down of a number of higher-risk prospects drilled during the year. Higher finance costs in 2012 reflects the cessation of interest capitalization against the Pluto project from May 2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, we recognized several impairments and write-offs in 2012. These adjustments included the $82 million impairment of the Laminaria Corallina asset following a reserves reduction, the $91 million write-off of the Argus 2 appraisal well and the Panoramix wells in Brazil for $26 million, and the further amortization of Pluto expansion, onshore FEED cost of $49 million.</p>
          <p>Next, to underlying profit on slide eight. Our 2012 underlying profit of $2.06 billion is an annual record and 25% higher than the $1.66 billion recorded in 2011. We've adjusted for non-recurring items of $922 million after tax. The largest impact was the $974 million gain on the sale of a minority share of our Browse equity. A further $27 million relates to the after-tax impact of Pluto delay mitigation costs booked in 2012. And finally, $25 million of tax paid in Timor-Leste, relating to the sale of a Woodside subsidiary back in 2007. The tax and penalties assessed are subject to an appeal.</p>
          <p>Turning to gross margin on slide nine. The height of the columns in this chart represents our average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent across all products. The blue section of the column represents the unit margin per barrel of oil equivalent. Our unit gross margin for 2012 remains a strong $45 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting the high oil prices maintained throughout the year. Unit margins were slightly lower than 2011, largely a result of the higher proportion of LNG in the total product mix, following Pluto start-up.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cash flow on slide 10. Now this is my favorite chart. Free cash flow is defined here as operating cash flows plus or minus net investing cash flows. As you can see, we experienced negative free cash flow throughout the Pluto construction phase. 2012 represents a dramatic turnaround, once again, largely driven by the proceeds from the sale of Browse equity, operating cash flows from Pluto and stronger LNG prices. Browse proceeds aside, this result serves to highlight the significant cash-generating capacity of Woodside's foundation business and now also Pluto.</p>
          <p>Next to investment expenditure on slide 11. This chart shows our historic and 2013 estimated capital and exploration expenditure. We invested $1.8 billion in our business in 2012, down from $3.8 billion in 2011, with the start-up of the Pluto LNG plant, lower Browse and other project expenses and the reduction of exploration expenditure.</p>
          <p>The 2013 investment expenditure outlook has been updated from previous market guidance to include our estimate of possible expenditures at Leviathan and Myanmar. At this stage, the outlook excludes any project expenditure that would result from a final investment decision for the proposed Browse LNG development. We expect to provide a further update on Browse in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Exploration expenditure is expected to increase in 2013, back closer to our long-term average annual expenditure. Peter will provide more detail on our 2013 exploration activities later.</p>
          <p>To our funding position on slide 12. Our net debt, shown as an orange line in this chart, has reduced significantly in 2012, consistent with the free cash flow discussion earlier. We ended 2012 with net debt of $1.9 billion, down by over $3 billion from a year earlier.</p>
          <p>With potential investment spending at Browse and Leviathan, we have maintained $4.1 billion of available funds in the form of cash and undrawn debt facilities. Our balance sheet is well positioned to support growth.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, our debt had an average tenor of 3.7 years and the average cost of debt was 3.4% based on a portfolio basis.</p>
          <p>Now to dividends on slide 13. The directors have declared a fully franked final dividend of $0.65 per share. This takes our 2012 full-year dividend to $1.30 per share, $0.20 per share higher than in 2011. Given Woodside's strong liquidity position, the dividend reinvestment plan will be suspended for the final dividend.</p>
          <p>Finally now to capital management on slide 14. This slide summarizes our approach to capital management with the overall objective of maximizing returns to shareholders. We have a foundation and Pluto business, which is running well and generating significant cash. We have demonstrated a preparedness and capability to actively manage our asset portfolio to create and accelerate value with the Browse equity sell-down being a recent example.</p>
          <p>We recognize the need to renew our focus on cost management in both operations and projects, especially in the good times. Our stewardship of the balance sheet has resulted in low gearing, adequate liquidity to support growth and a solid investment grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on disciplined investment decisions. We're not under any pressure to mandate projects. Our decisions will be driven by the imperative to create value and maximize returns to shareholders. And should growth be delayed or our investment criteria not met, the company's strong balance sheet places us in a great position to return the cash generated by the business to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks for joining us this morning. I'll now pass you back to Peter to update you on how we're delivering on our strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lawrie. And as Lawrie mentioned, with the strength of our balance sheet comes an obligation to invest in growth or give higher-value returns to our shareholders. We should all remember that Woodside is a growth company. We're focused on broadening our portfolio in-line with our strategic direction and to provide long-term shareholder value. Before I turn to our strategic direction, let's take a look at Woodside's LNG production history on slide 16.</p>
          <p>This slide shows Woodside's share of LNG production from the North West Shelf and Pluto over more than a decade. You can see that production grew steadily in 2005 and 2009 following the start-up of North West Shelf trains four and five. But the real kick was the addition of Pluto volumes last year where our 90% ownership of the asset almost doubled Woodside's share of LNG production with more to come in 2013.</p>
          <p>The better-than-expected ramp-up of Pluto has cemented our status as Australia's leading LNG operator. And while we're now reaping the rewards from Pluto, let me remind you just how difficult it is to take mega projects from the drawing board into production.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we see an industry in significant transition. A decade or so ago, the global LNG industry was defined by four or five conventional suppliers with the customer list being relatively short. Today, the industry is in significant transition with seven new LNG projects currently underway in Australia alone.</p>
          <p>Beyond Australia, the list of competitors is growing. North America's first LNG export project took a final investment decision last year and other projects are likely to follow. East Africa also has potential to be a significant new supplier in the next decade.</p>
          <p>While the demand and supply market is increasingly dynamic, the fundamentals stay the same. LNG mega projects are long-dated, capital intensive and underpinned by long-term supply contracts. And they are becoming more complex and challenging to bring online.</p>
          <p>We are acutely aware of these changing dynamics and are taking significant steps to drive down the cost of developing LNG facilities. We have a focus on growing our marketing and commercial capabilities, expanding our technology base and broadening our portfolio. But I'll talk more about these in detail later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's take an in-depth look at project execution challenges on slide 18. Market competition for LNG is driving many operators to start projects early. The pre-work of planning and scheduling is essential to manage scope changes that occur during execution, and let me tell you, we had our fair share with Pluto. Other operators will no doubt be experiencing this.</p>
          <p>To ensure that we're prepared for these challenges with our future developments, we're responding in several ways. Firstly, we're strengthening our development capability. By this I mean bringing in the right people, organization structure and processes and systems to evolve our project management capabilities. We've appointed a team of experienced senior managers to leverage our relationships with key contractors and also focus on contracting reform. This includes a review of construction-led engineering and design to streamline fabrication processes.</p>
          <p>We're also turning our attention to support infrastructure to seamlessly execute these mega-projects. This includes having streamlined logistics and relationships across the development and execution phases. And lastly, we're taking significant steps to drive down the cost of developing onshore facilities in Australia with a focus on technology. For example, the Woodside next-generation LNG technology takes modular construction of onshore LNG plants to a new level with potential cost reductions of up to 20% compared to conventional LNG train designs. Progressing technologies such as these is vital to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive global market.</p>
          <p>Slide 19. There's a lot of noise regarding LNG supply and demand, talk of competing supply from new entrants, differing energy supply mix, uncertainty around Japanese nuclear power station restarts and the linking of LNG contract prices to Henry Hub. Put this noise aside and what does the global supply and demand actually show? This chart shows how difficult it is going to be for LNG supply to keep up with demand. We see more upside than downside for demand for the reasons outlined on the slide. For example, the penetration of gas into China alone can have a big impact. If the proportion of gas in China's 2025 energy mix increases by just 1%, LNG demand will proportionally increase by about 6 million tonnes per annum.</p>
          <p>To meet the global demand outlook to 2025, the world needs new LNG projects including those proposed in Australia, North America, East Africa and other regions. Even then supply will struggle to keep up with demand. Lead times in locations such as East Africa are going to be significant and we can't realistically expect a large contribution from some emerging supply markets before 2025.</p>
          <p>To put this another way, over the past 40 to 50 years, the LNG industry has built 250 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity worldwide. We now need to do roughly the same again in over the next decade. So, we're very confident about market fundamentals continuing to support our projects. We believe that it remains in the buyers' interest to commit to offtake agreements that will provide project components with the market certainties they need to move new projects forward.</p>
          <p>So, let's take a look at Woodside's existing LNG contracts. By the end of 2014, we expect that about 85% of our long-term contracted LNG portfolio will have been subject to price reviews in the preceding three years. These price reviews are being undertaken in a tight market environment where over the next few years we're potentially going to see schedule slippages on new projects which are largely committed in any case.</p>
          <p>This is providing a favorable environment for price reviews which, once finalized, will typically hold firm for three to five years. Recent benchmarks from our own price discussions and from other regional-supply contract discussions confirm favorable pricing with long-term prices continuing to be indexed to 85% to 90% of oil-price movements. This typically means that for every $1-per-barrel increase in oil price, LNG prices increase by close to $0.15 per MMBtu. In this market, Woodside is well-positioned with uncommitted volumes, largely from 2014 onwards, and a lot of interest being shown by customers.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our reserves base and as we mentioned previously, any &#x2013; another challenge for any E&amp;P company is replacing production. Currently, our proved reserves replacement ratio is at 88%, which simply is not good enough for us. The chart on the left-hand side shows a general decrease in our overall proved plus probable reserves. So, what are we doing about it?</p>
          <p>Exploration is the obvious answer, and I'll talk about this later. But reserves growth can also come from acquisitions, maturation of contingent resources to reserves, and positive revisions to existing fields. During 2012, we divested a minority portion of our equity in Browse, which decreased our contingent resources. However, we expect to add a major new contingent resource booking of about 890 million barrels of oil equivalent for the Leviathan gas field on completion of the farm-out agreement. A proportion of these resources may be booked as reserves pending a final investment decision on the domestic gas project.</p>
          <p>In addition, maturation of Browse contingent resources is expected should we reach a positive final investment decision. We're also looking on &#x2013; working on demonstrating the technical maturity and commercial viability of the Greater Laverda development, which could result in the maturation of these contingent resources.</p>
          <p>And finally, a significant proportion of North West Shelf undeveloped reserves are expected to be classified as developed at the end of 2013, following the planned start-up of the North Rankin B compression platform.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. So, what are we doing on the exploration front to improve our reserves? It must be said that 2012 was a disappointing year for exploration drilling, but we continue to build our knowledge base and acquired more than 15,000 square kilometers of seismic data. We also established a new ventures team to look specifically at frontier and emerging basins. We saw early results from this team with in-principle agreements to enter the Leviathan gas field and exploration opportunities in Myanmar.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this slide, we will be significantly increasing our exploration spend in 2013 to deliver the first part of our new long-term exploration plan. We're aiming to bring our exploration spend more into line with our peer group average and also balance our spend over a broader range of opportunities in emerging and frontier basins.</p>
          <p>In 2013, we're planning to drill up to eight wells in Australia including two potential wells in the underexplored Outer Canning Basin and a prospect at Gumbo-1. We'll also be acquiring 3D seismic over our large permits in the Southern Beagle Sub-Basin, which we believe have both gas and liquids potential at a number of levels.</p>
          <p>On the international front, we plan to join our Leviathan joint venture participants in drilling a deep oil well in the Levantine Basin, now targeted for early next year. And in Myanmar, we're due to commence 3D seismic surveys over the A-6 permit later this month, and we expect to survey the AD-7 permit towards the end of year.</p>
          <p>Slide 23. We understand that in a competitive Australian and global environment, we require a clear strategy that makes the most of our world-class capabilities and provides us with a disciplined approach to generating new value. As many of you will be aware, our strategic focus has three main elements: maximize our core; leverage our capabilities; and grow our portfolio.</p>
          <p>When it comes to maximizing the value of our core business, we could hardly have hoped for a better contribution over the past year than that which we received from Pluto. It's a great example of how profitable and reliable producing assets can open up new value-adding opportunities.</p>
          <p>At Browse, we were very pleased to realize early value from this resource by selling a minority portion of our equity. This transaction demonstrates our ability to generate value from our discovered volumes in the pre-development as well as the post-development phase. And our conditional entry into Leviathan demonstrates Woodside's capacity to leverage our capabilities in order to establish new partnerships and grow our business.</p>
          <p>Our conditional entries into Myanmar in late 2012, one outcome from a series of basin studies we're currently maturing, was a good result in our bid to grow our portfolio. In both Israel and Myanmar, Woodside was recognized by the existing resource owners for the strong deepwater capabilities we can bring into play in an emerging or frontier basin.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're pleased with our early progress against our strategic direction and we look to continue this momentum in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>This next slide shows a cross-section of the opportunities we currently have in our sights, grouped together in the execution phase, pre-FID development or an opportunity further into the future. What I like about this set of opportunities is its balance in terms of time, location and the scale of the investment required. Woodside is not all about two or three major LNG projects that consume our time and resources. We're now generating a good spread of options to generate value. And having said that, we know that we have to continue to grow this portfolio to deliver superior shareholder returns. In line with our strategy, we'll continue to take a disciplined, considered approach to new opportunities that play to our differentiated capabilities and represent good value.</p>
          <p>Moving to the final few slides, while 2012 was a year of delivery for Woodside, we're certainly not pausing for breath. Let's talk about the year ahead. We're aiming for another record year of production in 2013, with an expected increase of between 4% and 11% on last year. A full year of production from Pluto is expected to contribute about 40% of our total equity production, and we will be working hard to consolidate high reliability from the plant during the year.</p>
          <p>As always, we remain focused on reliability both in the short and long term. In 2013, we'll carry out a major shutdown on North West Shelf Train 2 and refurbishment of the Vincent FPSO while in dry dock at Singapore, so that these facilities continue to generate value for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Speaking of generating long-term value, this year we anticipate the start-up of the North Rankin B platform which will access 5 trillion cubic feet of undeveloped low pressure gas reserves to maintain our production levels at the Karratha gas plant.</p>
          <p>This has been a very complex project on a global scale, one that's tested our capabilities to their limits, and now promises to reward us in the years ahead. We'll also continue to work on the Greater Western Flank Phase 1 project to develop the Goodwyn GH and Tidepole fields, the next major development for the North West Shelf project.</p>
          <p>Slide 27. When it comes to our developments, we also have a busy program in 2013. At Browse, we continue to take a disciplined approach to the assessment of tender bids for offshore and onshore infrastructure to be in a position to consider a final investment decision by the end of June.</p>
          <p>Onto Sunrise, we've had a number of productive technical engagements with the Timor-Leste government in recent months. And I'm pleased that we've been able to build our relationship in order to share this information. Although this engagement does not represent any agreement at this stage, we continue to build on dialogue with both governments to agree on a development which satisfies the requirements of all parties. Work will continue on the Laverda and Cimatti oil developments during the year and we're working with the Leviathan joint venture to finalize the agreement to acquire 30% interest in the petroleum licenses which contain the Leviathan field. During 2013, we also expect to be in a position to consider a final investment decision on a domestic gas development for the Leviathan field.</p>
          <p>And finally on to exploration, this slide summarizes our 2013 activities that we previously spoke about on slide 22. In particular, the under-explored Outer Canning which features a number of multi-Tcf prospects where we anticipate drilling two wells. Other wells &#x2013; this year &#x2013; other wells and seismic are included on the slide. From the slide it's clear that there's a lot of activity to keep our exploration team very busy.</p>
          <p>Finally, as you can see, we have a busy program of activity in Australia and beyond across a broad range of opportunities. 2012 was indeed a year of delivery for Woodside, and we continue to take forward our growth strategy and deliver long-term shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your time today. And now, I'll hand over to questions and answers.</p>

          <p>Hi, everyone. A question firstly directed to Lawrie. Lawrie, I still get confounded by the predictability of your PRRT calculations. Could you just run through how it was a credit this year and how that relates to Browse given that &#x2013; I don't understand why that's PRRT liable given that you don't have any revenue from that particular project?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. I'll try my best, but it's probably the most complicated question you could ever ask me. Essentially, we have a &#x2013; we had a capital base for Browse, and as part of the sale transaction, the whole capital base was written down, and that's normal for a sale of an A&amp;A asset. So, associated with that capital base was a deferred tax asset &#x2013; sorry, a deferred tax liability.</p>
          <p>And so, with the sale of the asset and the write-down of the whole asset base, the deferred tax liability needed to go as well and so that was written back. The deferred tax liability comes with that and so we're talking about $400 million here. That &#x2013; the deferred tax liability comes about because some of those expenditures have been deducted for tax purposes so the tax asset base, if you like, is zero but the accounting asset base is greater than zero. When you write off the accounting base, you've not got an accounting base of zero, a tax base of zero which means you also have to write off the deferred tax liability. I hope that makes some amount of sense. But if I catch up with you over the next few days, I can explain some more.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think I'll need that, but &#x2013; all right, that's fine. So, going forward, though, Lawrie, you would regard this as typically a once-off thing, wouldn't you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, that $400 million write-back of the Browse deferred tax liability is definitely a once-off event.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, and I'll ask my second question, then. On the basis, Peter, you mentioned about your international strategy, can I ask on Browse? Woodside would have a different cost of capital than your other joint venture partners in Browse. How do you think about that in relationship to something that may have worked for others but not for you in coming to a decision on Browse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's an interesting consideration, John. But it's not one that drives Woodside's decision process. We've got to drive our processes based on our required returns for an investment like Browse. The other joint-venture partners will have to look at it in the context of their own opportunities and their own cost of capital or cost of debt.</p>
          <p>I think the good news is on Browse, if you look at the size and capability of all the joint-venture partners now, I wouldn't expect that that would be an issue for them going forwards So, the funding requirement, I don't &#x2013; personally, I don't think that will be the major driver. I think it will be the returns on the project and whether they're acceptable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, everyone. Just a couple of questions. The first one relates to slide 11, the Leviathan investment you flagged there. I guess what are the assumptions driving that in terms of timing of FID? Is that just for Phase 1? What &#x2013; can you give an indication of what the total CapEx for Phase 1 is meant to be and whether given are you talking an FPSO for the development there, whether you're planning to lease or own that asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nik, I can answer part of your question, but we'll have to pass on particularly the latter part of your question just because it's too early. So, you're right. We have included an amount in the chart on slide 11 for Leviathan. That is mostly taken up by the purchase price or the acquisition price that we disclosed with our original announcement. So, that was $696 million. It also includes the first of the subsequent conditional payments. So, we are assuming in there that we'll pay $200 million, I wish it was only $200, $200 million when the laws are promulgated in Israel allowing gas export.</p>
          <p>Then the balance is made up of &#x2013; a relatively small balance made up of just the works to prepare for the first phase of Leviathan development, that being the dom gas phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And my second question, just on Sunrise, the CMATS Treaty is due to expire, I believe, on the 23rd of February. What is your understanding of what's likely to occur beyond that date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Nik, as you're probably aware, CMATS &#x2013; the 23rd of February is not actually an expiry of the agreement. It's an expiry of a period that locks both parties into the agreement, and then after the 23rd, the agreement will stay in place until either one of the parties or both parties decide to challenge the agreement and take it down. So, really, the 23rd, the only thing on the &#x2013; that happens on the 23rd is the parties now have the option of nullifying the agreement. We don't expect &#x2013; we haven't heard anything from either the Australian or the Timorese government in that regard, and we're &#x2013; as we said, we're working very hard with both the Timorese and the Australians on development concepts at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good day, Peter and Lawrie. The first question relates to Browse. You mentioned, again, you're still on track to target an FID decision middle of the year, and you also mentioned I think the last month at your quarterly that you'd commenced marketing of that gas. Can I ask you, would you still be looking to have signed up the bulk of the proposed Browse output to HoAs prior to that mid-CY 2013 FID? And if so, can we anticipate a fair wave of agreements to come through over the next couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben, absolutely. For us to go forward to FID, we would need certainty around what our pricing arrangements would be. These volumes we sold it on an equity basis, so each of the parties will need to make their own decisions in that regard. If you recall, under the sale agreement of MIMI of the minority equity portion, we've actually got a joint sales agreement to them that picks up, from memory, about 3.3 million tonnes per annum. So, we're currently in the Japanese market jointly trying to sell that volume into the market, and that was one of the keys for us with that particular transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And second question with respect to Leviathan, are you able to outline for us what are the final requirements or the conditions precedent to finalizing that agreement specifically with respect to the Israeli government's consideration of export volumes? And is there a quantum of or regulatory decision that Woodside would be targeting in terms of going ahead with the Leviathan purchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's two parts to it. The first part is just &#x2013; is finalizing the conditions in the farm-out agreement and we're very well-progressed in that regard. And we've really &#x2013; and there's only a couple of matters on the table for us to finalize the wording around. So, we don't see any impediments in moving forward, with finalizing that particular agreement. With respect &#x2013; no, I would expect here in the not too distant future, finalization in that regard.</p>
          <p>With respect to Israeli approvals and so forth, once we finalize that, we then have to go through a regulated approval process. We've spoken to the Israeli government and we don't expect there'll be any hold-ups at all in going through that process.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to exports, the agreement we have in place does not have a condition precedent with respect to requiring exports. It has milestone payments that will be made to the current owners of the resource should we or current equity holders should certain things occur. And one of those is certainty on &#x2013; from the Israeli government on being able to export gas and what sort of quantity that gas will be out of Leviathan. So, really the critical step for us now and moving forward with government, with the partners is understanding what the export conditions would be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. Look, I just wanted to ask a little but more about your graph about the project pipeline on slide 24, I think it is about &#x2013; how to read that and how to read the circles that fall in and out of those lines and just where everything is? I guess, it looks as if Leviathan has sort of leapfrogged some of the local energy projects and that sort of thing. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Angela, I wouldn't read anything more into that than the limitations of our graphic artist in getting everything into the &#x2013; his head's just fallen on the desk. What we're really trying to demonstrate here was just the funnel of opportunities coming through and where they were in the development phase for us. And we've talked a lot about trying to broaden Woodside's portfolio of opportunities so that we can consistently make good choices at the right time about our investments. And this was really an effort on our behalf to try and characterize what was coming down the pipeline and exactly where it is in that particular pipeline. So, please don't read anything into the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I also ask just about your latest views on North American LNG exports? I think you've said in the past that maybe you'd expect about 50 million tonnes a year or something to be coming from that direction into Asia by maybe the end of the decade. Is that still your view? It does look as if some of the projects have gained quite a bit of momentum over the last few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We still believe that the number's going to be in that range of 30 million tonnes to 50 million tonnes, and there'll be a mix of that coming out of the Gulf of Mexico and out of Canada. We believe that Canada projects will be what we call classic-type LNG projects, greenfield, long-dated oil price linked, to have a significant oil price linkages to it. The Gulf of Mexico projects are still in their infancy. We've had one project go to an FID on the train and some other proponents moving forward.</p>
          <p>I must say we're still struggling to see where the value opportunity is in that. It's a much different commercial proposition, and it's putting far more risk on the buyer than has historically been in place, particularly if the buyers are insisting on a Henry Hub linkage to the price. So, that almost puts you into a situation where the operator becomes &#x2013; gets into a tolling situation, which is really a midstream business. It's just a rate-of-return business.</p>
          <p>So, it's difficult for me to see how that will grow in any substantial way because of the returns that that business will offer. And our view is that it's more likely to be attractive to what we call portfolio players in the industry. People who have existing portfolios will be &#x2013; be able to take advantage of moving cargos in and out of those portfolios to their customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Greenwood from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I have two questions, one around M&amp;A and the other around Leviathan. First of all, on M&amp;A, you've had a busy 2012: divestment of Browse, acquisition of Leviathan. You're also broadening your exploration footprint. I'm just wondering whether you can give us a sense of whether you're happy now with the improved diversification of the portfolio, whether you see still a lot more to do on the M&amp;A front going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see its continuing in this vein, Mark, at least for the foreseeable future. Our real focus has been on ensuring that we go after low-cost assets and there's obviously not that many of those around. So, what we have said is when we look at our inventory of assets or the quality of the assets, we want them to &#x2013; people to look at them and say, look, they're all world-class assets. And so, having said that, our M&amp;A activity will continue to focus on most regions or those opportunities that provide an advantage for Woodside in that sort of asset development. And that will be cyclical from time to time.</p>
          <p>We've also mentioned previously that we're looking at moving up and down the value chain as well where that makes sense. We have a fourth ship coming into the Pluto fleet that will come in in the middle of this year so we're looking forward to that providing flexibility. And you may hear more from us in the future around what we do with portfolio in that regard and whether we take a larger position in shipping or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I asked the question because you made the point today about the strength of your balance sheet, that you'll returning cash if growth is delayed. So, just trying to get a sense of what you're likely to do with that strong cash flow you're generating, whether we could see return to shareholders or whether you're going to continue to seek M&amp;A opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the priority will be growth, but we've made a very clear commitment. We're not going to sit on cash for the sake of sitting on it. We believe that if the opportunities are attractive enough then our shareholders would support us and that if we needed to go into the debt market or otherwise in the future. So &#x2013; now, our view is, no, we'll be very active in the management of our cash and capital into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question around Leviathan, it looks like you're anticipating an FID this year for the domestic gas phase, if I read you correctly on that CapEx that you've budgeted, although perhaps it's towards the end of the year. I'm just wondering you've said before targeting start-up for the domestic gas phase in 2016 and Noble has indicated a capacity of around 750 million cubic feet per day. What sort of ramp-up would you expect as you place that gas into that market? Could we expect you to get there pretty quickly? Do you see demand being that strong or do you think it's going to take a number of years to get up to that stated capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two parts to the answer. The first one is, the operator has indicated to us that they expect to take the joint venture to an FID decision in the second half of this year and that the current proposal is for it to be an FPSO-based gas development going into a small pressure reduced platform before it goes into the grid in Israel. And as part of that the operators then also are very actively looking at export opportunities as well and has a number of studies under way in that area. They've also indicated that their target date is 2016 so I can confirm that's our view as well.</p>
          <p>With respect to the ramp-up on what's happening in the market, the view at the moment is that this gas will go in and feed, do two things. It will displace liquids that are currently existing in the market already. And then secondly, it will also &#x2013; there'll be new growth coming out of the market as well. We see significant growth in the Israeli market &#x2013; domestic market.</p>
          <p>As far as the ramp-up is concerned, it's too early for us to give you a ramp-up indication as we've got a team on the ground now working with the operator. As we form a view &#x2013; as we go through the year, we'll certainly give the market an update on that expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for the update. Just a quick question. You've mentioned that you're entering FEED on Xena this year. I was just wondering if you could remind us how the Pluto wells are going and what the likely Phase 2 activities will be on Pluto, whether that's compression and/or Xena and whether they're separate projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, as you recall, we drilled five wells on Pluto. We only need three wells to keep the plant running at full capacity. Four of the wells are capable of the full design capacity that we have. We have the fifth well, Pluto 5. We've been doing some diagnostic work on it. We believe we have a downstream blockage that we're just not sure what it is. But that well is still producing quite well and expected to be a long-life well. There's no issues around reserves on that.</p>
          <p>So, what I would tell you is we had &#x2013; we have adequate capacity in Pluto. The reserves numbers hold firm for us, and we're doing some work on that with one of our vessels to free up some more volume on the Pluto 5.</p>
          <p>And then on Xena, you may recall Xena was part of the original development plan for Pluto. We've chosen to move forward on Xena and we'll probably do it in a two-phase, drill a single well and then to manage our capital spend over time. So, we want to bring Xena in early. As you may recall, Xena was always in our development plans and we expect to go to a final investment decision on this in the not-too-distant future.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And just one more for Lawrie, sorry to bring up the PRRT again. But once we've stripped out that Browse one-off, the credit in PRRT expense seem to be around $120 million which was still significantly higher than what we had been forecasting. And I understand that's due to the augmentation on Pluto. I'm just wondering do you expect that to continue, or do you think your PRRT expense will actually be a net debit going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the size of the PRRT expense depends in part on revenues and deductible expenses, so it's hard for me to make a prediction. But you are correct to say that augment &#x2013; apart from Browse, augmentation is the other factor which reduces our PRRT expense and that is, as you say, is augmentation on Pluto.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Peter. Look, just really not much news on Browse, Sunrise or Pluto, which I guess we're sort of accustomed to. But would it be fair to say that Leviathan and your sort of increased focus overseas is sort of now, I guess, leapfrogged or overtaken some of these Australian-focused projects given you also expect the sort of high &#x2013; some of the high costs involved in developing new projects. What's &#x2013; where do you sort of see all that heading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Andrew, it's a good question. Now, what I &#x2013; the way I would characterize it is we're moving forward on all of those projects as quickly as we can then they're just in different phases of the development. My view is that Leviathan is something that we've not talked a lot about to the market. In fact, most of the questions that we're receiving are more trying to understand where that's heading.</p>
          <p>Browse is well understood by the market. We've &#x2013; we are still heading towards considering an FID on Browse by the middle of this year. And I can tell the market that that's on track with us and we've been sharing our latest cost and schedule estimates with our joint venture.</p>
          <p>And as you know, that joint venture is undergoing change still and BHP and PetroChina are in the process of an equity sale there. So, no, I wouldn't say any change at all. It's just more reflective of Woodside now having a more diversified portfolio and that I think that's a really good thing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions, three questions in fact on Pluto and LNG. The first relates to the amount of LNG that's to be subject to repricing. I think in May last year, you said that there was 80% of your equity LNG to be subject to some form of price renegotiation between 2011 and 2014. I'm just wondering has that changed or been reduced? Have you in fact locked up any new SPAs between May last year and now? And can you give us any insight on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stuart. Firstly, the numbers &#x2013; rough numbers 80%, 85% that hasn't changed at all. We've mentioned in today's pack it's 85%. The time period is the same as the one that you just referred to, 2011 through 2014. To date, we have started in that process. I'm not at liberty to tell you how many of those contracts we've completed, but I can tell you we have completed more than &#x2013; we've at least completed one, so I can give you some indication. I can tell you the &#x2013; we're seeing strong pricing as we go through. So, we're seeing the sorts of pricing outcomes that I indicated in the pack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just leading then on to Pluto and I think the repricing that was indicated to occur in 2014, is that in fact embedded in your contract that there's a reopen? Or is that a certain outcome or is that something that has to be negotiated and achieved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we can say much more than we've said in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, Stuart, that was Rob Cole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry. It's Rob. Yes, I've been on the line for Q&amp;A but the guys have been answering all the questions, so I'm just sitting in the back. Look, I don't think we can say much more than we said in the past. We can't comment on specific contracts. But what I can say is that, and we said this in our annual report, the pricing discussions are under way for Pluto and we're targeting similar market price outcomes as other relevant Australian benchmarks for delivering long-term volumes into Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. We'll move on from that. Two other questions. One is a small one, just really $130 million of CapEx forecast this year for Pluto. I'm just wondering what that relates to? Is that an LNG carrier or something coming in, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, that is a good question, Stuart, because we asked the same question ourselves yesterday. Look, I think it's just a combination of tail-end, tail work and also probably settling out with contractors as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay, which leads to the question then on that new carrier that you expected to receive there this year, is that &#x2013; would that be leased? Is that purchased outright or has that come into the figures somewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that will be a leased vessel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks. Just a final question just on growth outlook. I know years ago you used to mention, with respect to potential Pluto expansion, negotiations with other resource owners or discussions. They seem to have not been expanded, and I think in the last quarter there was no reference about any kind of discussions and no more now. Can we conclude from that that basically the opportunity set for doing a standalone Pluto 2 or with other people's gases now not really any kind of realistic option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would say, Stuart &#x2013; I have a view that in any negotiations, it's like a carousel. You go through windows as to when things will come together for us. We have presented to the various parties that we've been talking to cost and options around Pluto expansion. So, we're continuing to talk to them. We're just waiting for their feedback and they may have a different timeline to the one that we've been working on. But again, it comes back to now. This is why we wanted to develop a diversified portfolio. So, we're not continuing to have to focus on one particular opportunity that investors are seeing a suite of opportunities being moved through, and we can go snap on these opportunities when they become ripe. And at the moment, Pluto expansion is just not in the frame where I can tell you that there's a deal to be done that's imminent.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Stuart, just one of my colleagues reminded me that, of course, the budget &#x2013; the CapEx budget for 2013 also includes an allowance for Xena.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Bullen from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a quick question around the potential to return cash to shareholders, would you consider drawing down on your cash reserves and debt to fund that or would it have to be from free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a little early. We haven't asked the board to consider that because, obviously, as Peter said, our priority is growth. But we feel like we have an obligation to have a well-exercised balance sheet. We find ourselves at the end of 2012 with significant cash and undrawn debt. And we just recognize there's an obligation that comes with that. And the obligation is to firstly, deliver on growth if we have appropriate opportunities. And if we can't do that or if more likely growth is delayed, then we would be prepared to pay some of the available cash back to shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James, if I can just add to that, I'm sure you are aware, there are some in industry globally that are borrowing to pay dividends. That's certainly not our intention into the future. So, we expect to have a disciplined cash management policy. And we're not at a position at the moment where we would see that we would need to borrow to pay dividends. We would prefer to go to our shareholders with a view that says we've got a suite of opportunities and the shareholders support us in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just a question around, I guess, unconventional gas as well, that still seems to be a hole in the skill set of Woodside. Is that something that you're looking to fill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we recognize our capabilities and at the moment unconventional gas doesn't fit necessarily into our capability set that we have. As you may recall, previously, I've mentioned that unconventional gas takes you into more of a manufacturing-type mode. And with &#x2013; unit cost becomes extremely important. Woodside's a &#x2013; so, we recognize the skill set. Having said that, we've also advised the market that if there's an opportunity and we could find the right partner who had those capabilities, then we're into developing hydrocarbon.</p>
          <p>And so, you probably would not see Woodside in at least in the short-term taking an entry as an operator into that area. But I certainly would not allow Woodside looking at other opportunities on a broader basis.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as the call is coming to a close, we only have time for one final question. And we have a question from James Redfern from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's James Redfern here. Just a question on the LNG pricing from the last quarter. I know as the LNG revenues were down 13% and that the received prices were down &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; LNG revenue was down 13% and received prices were down 11%. And I understand there were no spot sales out of PIuto. So, was that contract pricing that was the driver behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, what are your referencing? Are you referencing our Q4...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm. Sorry. I know revenues were really pre-announced, so, I just wanted to get a handle on the 4Q revenues for LNG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to your question is that &#x2013; so, your question, just to clarify, is a quarter-on-quarter question. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes. So, the received LNG price was down 11% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Q3, as I recall, and I'm looking at Mike Lynn for verification &#x2013; as I recall, the Q3 price would have included several spot cargoes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Q4 would have had fewer spot cargoes. And so, I would say that's the most likely explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three spot cargoes in Q4 and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Mike Lynn speaking. I understand it's three spot cargoes in the third quarter out of the total of eight cargoes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in the fourth quarter, any spot sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None in the fourth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then none in the fourth, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Okay, great. Okay, thank you. That was all.</p>
