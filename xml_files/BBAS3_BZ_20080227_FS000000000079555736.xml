          <p>Okay, thank you. Good morning, this is Aldo speaking. Thank you all for joining us. As usual in this conference call we'll have the presentation results highlights followed by a Q&amp;A session. Geovanne will present the slides soon but before that I want to highlight some figures of our performance.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we dealt with extraordinary effects. We had the net income of R$5.7 billion and a 25.5% ROE. In the fourth quarter our net income amounted R$1.2 billion. We ended the year with more than 106 billion in our loan portfolio. With highlights to loans to indicate those and FME which has the individual respectively builds of 33 and 34% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Talking about individuals we reached an 18.5 to the market share in favorable loans with a balance of around R$12 billion and an increase of 43.3 %.</p>
          <p>In the current loans business that we started recently and which will help us to get a large market share. We achieved R$2.9 billion at the end of the year. Another good result was brought by our business with cards, which revenues and base increased 30% and 23% this February in 2007.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the 200 years that we will celebrate in 2008, we are deeply committed to strategies that allow us to have a sustainable business such as the launching of new specific products on loans, cards and insurance to different kind of publics. They range in the number of operations in which the public sector and its employees. They increasing the business with not account customers through partnerships with large companies, growth in the mortgage business, the maintenance of our lend leadership in no banking solutions in automated channels and social and environmental commitment of the company.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, all of you. Good morning to you all.  This is Geovanne speaking. Let's start from slide 2 where we present our recurring net income. You can see that it was 56.8% higher than the same period last year. Which means that in absolute terms, we came from a R$3.7 billion of recurring net income in 2006 to R$5.7 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>The return on equity achieved 25.5%, totally in line with our expectation of new trends on reais. In the fourth quarter, the net income amounted to R$1.2 billion, 10.8% lower than the third quarter and 0.4% below the same period of 2006. However, it is important to remember that when we compare the net income of Q4 '07 in the same period of 2006. This reduction is explained by our lower tax rate in Q4 '06.</p>
          <p>As you may remember up to 2006, Banco do Brasil used to pay dividends and interest in shareholders equity biannually. Therefore, the tax benefit of the interest that belonged to the second half of 2006 was entirely accounted in Q4 '06 results. As a consequence the tax rate achieved 14% back then. From 2007 on, our dividend policy changed to quarterly payments, as a result the debt tax benefits from interest and shareholders equity in Q4 '07. '07 covered only three months. Therefore the tax rate was higher than the same period of last year and achieved 26%.</p>
          <p>On slide 3, we have the annual comparison of the main non-recurrent items that helped during 2006 and 2007 results. While the 2006 results were positively affected by non-recurring effects of 2.4 billion reais with highlights of tax credits. 2007 results were negatively impacted in 690 million reais that came mainly from the one-off expenses to finance yearly retirement plan and the one-off expenses to promote a capital injection in CASSI, Banco do Brasil employees health campaign.</p>
          <p>On slide 4, you can observe the main items that have contributed to build the recurring net income in the fourth quarter, when compared to the previous quarter. Procured debt at the bottom-line to the income, to the net income. On the positive side, I would like to highlight here that our -- we can see earnings of R$322 million in the net interest income. Plus R$92 million in fee income and R$86 million from other positive effects.</p>
          <p>In the negative side there was an increase in administrative expenses and provisions for credit risks. The balance brought a decrease of R$121 million to the recurring net income in the period, which added to the non-recurring expenses with the healthcare financed by CASSI and also from the expenses with the early retirement plan totaled a net income of R$1.217 billion. We do have the chance to explain later and to give you a breakdown on the increase in our administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, we can observe the evolution of the net interest income with an increase in loan operations revenues and the stability in interest expenses, both in the quarter and in the year period. Besides, there was reduction in revenues from securities in the year-to-year comparison due to our macro economics in there and with decreasing rates.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 6, the graph on the left part of the slide shows us that 200 basis points reduction in the average SELIC rate 6% of 2006. On the other hand, Banco do Brasil's spread dropped only 64 basis points, totaling 7.8%, totally in line with our expectations and confirming that stronger business of our spreads to cut in the benchmark rate.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide we can see the evolution of our loan book spreads. We can see that spreads for individual loans remained the most attractive ones if compared with the other books. With the increasing operations with lower risks and lower rates such as favorable deductible loans and car loans and also with the decreasing rate in the benchmark rate for the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>The portfolio is operating in lower levels in terms of spread when compared to the same period last year. There was a reduction in the average spread in the individuals' portfolio from 31.8% to 26.6. However, it's still a very attractive spread and that explains our strategy of growing faster our loss to individual book.</p>
          <p>On the slide 7, we will see that the changes in the mix of our assets are the main reason to maintain our spread at the 7.8%. The line graph shows a relation between Banco do Brasil floating interest rate and the SELIC. We can see that this relation has been stable while the investment rate, when compared to SELIC, has presented a positive this same year.</p>
          <p>In the other graph, we use it to show you the evolution of our assets long exposure. Dividing it between floating rate assets and fixed rate assets. We can see that according to this bar chart, there has been a reduction in floating rate assets that reduced from 22.9 to R$15.1 billion as a result of the decrease in the benchmark rate. On the other hand Banco do Brasil focused on the growth of fixed rate assets mainly credit from 29.9 billion to R$62.4 billion of loan exposure to fixed rate assets, to better protect our margins.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 8, we can see that our loan book reached R$160.7 billion, a 20.7% growth rate when compared to December. This growth rate was below the average industry, mainly due to, first the decrease in the balance denominated in reais of our note books abroad, due to the appreciation of reais against dollar 6.6% decrease. And also a lower increase in the Agribusiness portfolio.  That was only a 15% increase.</p>
          <p>In the quarter then the average portfolio grew by 7% and I would like to highlight here loans to businesses that increased by 9.7% and totaled R$65.5 billion. For the past 12 months, the growth in this book was 26.1% and it's also important to remember that our loans to businesses, they are representing an update in our base of 41% of the total 45.</p>
          <p>In results worth to mention that the most -- the biggest part of this portfolio, that moved the most, was definitely lower to SME. Future provisions grew about 34.4% in the year. Another highlight with regard to our credit growth was definitely individuals portfolio that reached R$32 billion, a 33.4% increase when compared to the same period last year and up 8.4% increase in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The share in the total portfolio of loss individuals increased from 18% as of December 2006 to 19.9% at the end of 2007. And as I mentioned before the Agribusiness loans totaled R$51.9 billion, a growth of 50% in the year and up 7.1% in the quarter. This portfolio loss shared the overall book that came down from 33.8% share to 32.3% and this lower performance in the Agribusiness book has -- was due to seasonality.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 9, we have the breakdown of our individuals books which represent, as I mentioned before, almost 20% of the total loan book in Banco do Brasil. The highlights here are definitely payroll deductible loans and car loans and also credit cards operations. The payroll loans reached a balance of R$11.9 billion at the end of '07. A strong growth of 43.3% when compared to December '06 and 7.9% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the terms of disbursements the total value of payroll loans amounted to R$13billion in 2007, which means a monthly disbursement of an average R$1.1 billion per month. With these results Banco do Brasil kept its leadership in the payroll deductible loans market with 50.5% market share. I would like to remind you that it's part of our main targets to achieve at least 20% market share in this market in the payroll deductible loans markets.</p>
          <p>Another highlight is in the individual's portfolio. The individual's portfolio is due to the strategy adopted by Banco do Brasil to tap the car loans market.</p>
          <p>This is a brand new market for us that it will celebrate two years and we grew for the past 12 months 227%. In the quarter, there was a 31.5% growth and we amounted R$2.9 billion balance in the car loans book. The R$730 million from partnerships with auto dealers including this year the partnership with Localiza. In car financing, I remind you that we went over two points.  We achieved a balance above our target that was R$2.2 billion at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And for 2008, our target is to achieve R$6 billion balance in the car loans business. Well, besides these other operations I can not forget to mention here, credit card loans which grew 39.5% in 12 months and 17.8% in the quarter reaching a R$4.3 billion balance. I will have a chance to discuss later the numbers of the credit card business. But this increase definitely reflects the tremendous growth we promoted in the turnover of this business and also in the number of activated costs.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 10, according to Central Bank Rules and the numbers disclosed by the Central Bank, we make here a comparison between the credit risks of Banco do Brasil and the average industry. We can observe that in the line graph on top of this slide, the average risk in Banco do Brasil loan book remains stable at 5.4%. Banco do Brasil prefers to be very conservative in its provisioning policy. And as you can see in the graph below in terms of coverage Banco do Brasil has a 204.5% coverage ratio over past two months for more than 90 days.</p>
          <p>While the average coverage ratio for the banking industry is along 169% it is important to remember that we are not considering them in this calculation year. The additional provisions we have accounted in our books. If we have to include this additional provision that coverage ratio of Banco do Brasil would go up to 242%.</p>
          <p>In the next slide we can see in the last graph on the top of the slide, that provision expenses over total book dropped quarter-to-quarter achieving a 3.7% average rate. Here it's worth to mention that as in the fourth quarter there is a higher volume of contracts in the Agribusiness portfolio due to the plantation season.  As a consequence, the total amount of provision expenses grew significantly in the fourth quarter, according to the growth in our credit book.  Also in slide 11 we can see that in the volume graph on the right hand side of the slide, there has been a stability in the number, in the past due loans ratio of our book. Okay, this provision -- the provision, total provisions in our book represent 6.4% of the total book while past due loans over 60 days are at the 3.3% range. Which means that we cover more than 1.5 times the past due loans for more than 60 days, with the provisions we have accounted in our books.</p>
          <p>When we make the Q4 '07 and Q4 '06 comparison we can observe a slight increase in past due loans of our book. However, when we compare to the Q3 '07 there was an improvement in past due loans due to the renegotiation that we promoted in the Agribusiness portfolio, according to the authorization from Central Bank. And this negotiation is expected to end on February 2008.</p>
          <p>On Slide 12, we would like to show you here the balance of our provisions we have accounted in the book. Here we divide according to required provisions to comply with the Central Bank rule and also with additional provisions. The required provisions amounted R$8.7 billion, and the additional provision formed is at R$1.6 billion. These additional provisions are in the book to <mark type="inaudible" /> that might happen in the Agribusiness book.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Slide 13, you can see that our deposits are still growing in a very good pace. The highlight here goes to savings deposits and demand deposits. At the end of '07 we had a total deposits of R$188.3 billion. That represented an 18.5% growth rate when compared to December '06 and a 9.4% increase in the quarter.  Demand deposits registered the best performance, an increase of 28.1% in the past 12 months and 32.5% when compared to the previous quarter. This performance <mark type="inaudible" /> a very specific characteristic of our economy in December where the economy is fairly liquid due to Christmas bonus, vacation bonuses as well.  On the other hand, savings deposits grew by 25% in 12 months and 4.6% in the quarter. Time deposits, they are still responsible for the most part of our deposits base, however showing a small increase 11.2% in 12 months and 2.2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to fees, I would like to discuss on Slide 14 that we posted an 11.4% growth rate for the entire year in fees. This was a little below our expectations and mainly due to purchase of tables that we decided to reduce the features to retain customers and also due to a higher competitiveness in the Asset Management business. These two <mark type="inaudible" /> would explain missing the target of fee growth between 12 to 15% for the entire year.</p>
          <p>With regard to the quarter four numbers, we reached a R$2.6 billion of fee income, a 13.3% growth rate when compared to Q4 '06 and 3.7% in the quarter, driven mainly by the growth in the cost base and also due to new contracts in Insurance and Pension Plan products, that usually there is seasonality and we usually see an increase in Insurance and Pension Plans product sales.  It is worth to highlight that in the fourth quarter we stopped receiving fees from the secured -- the Social Security system, about R$7 million per month. And that fees related to cash withdrawals and deposits were accounted in another different line in the P&amp;L, in other operational revenues and expense.</p>
          <p>Customer fees grew 11.9% while the customer base increased by 6.7%. Here it is important to mention that the behavior of our revenue is reflecting the measures adopt by the bank in order to grow its business through checks, payroll with good part of the contract that set in the negotiation, a reduction in the so-called credit opening fee, and also due to lower a fees in the Credit Card business due to the competitiveness of this business. We would also like to mention that our future service revenues, the future fee base must be impacted by the new regulation in the banking industry. And because of that for the entire 2008 period, we are expecting fee growth to be single-digits of around 8%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 15, we can observe the evolution in our Asset Management business and <mark type="audio gap" /> customer base. At the end of '07 we reached R$220 billion in assets under management, dipping our leadership in Latin America with 18.3% market share.  The rest of the balance of assets under management was 20.5% in the year and 6.5% in the quarter. However, it is important to mention that we lost some market share due to the increasing competitiveness in this particular segment. And this is one of the reasons why we had to become more aggressive in reducing fees in this business, helping us to decrease the fee growth rate of the entire Asset Management business in Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the slide, we show you the evolution of our customer base. There was an increase of 1.6 million account holders in the period, that totaled 26 million account holders at the end of '07. It is important to remind that besides our account holders we are promoting an organic growth in our base, and we have also other clients. And when we brought the concept of banking consumers, we could add that to this 26 million account holders, around 7.2 million savings account holders, 3.6 million Social Security beneficiaries that receive their benefits through Banco do Brasil and also 3.3 million non-account holders customers that make Banking business with Banco do Brasil but do not hold accounts with us. This would total a 39.1 million banking consumer base in Banco do Brasil, the largest one among the Brazilian banks.</p>
          <p>On Slide 16, we can see that the added value for our Insurance business reached R$1.2 billion in '07, a 6.8% increase when compared to '06. Moving to Slide 17, we observed the contribution of business with Cards. Here we have the added value of these operations that presented a 14.9% increase quarterly, R$2.3 billion in 07. In the quarter the growth was 20.2% amounting R$657 million.</p>
          <p>I bring you &#x2013; bringing you other numbers with regard to our Credit Card business, I would like to show you on Slide 18 that the increase in the added value of cards is direct linked to the strong expansion in the card space, and also due to the growth in the total revenues of this business. From December '06 to December '07, we reached 69.1 million cards of which 20.2 million are comprised of Credit Cards and 48.9 million comprised of Debit Cards.  In the year 12.7 million new cards were issued, being 6.1 million Credit and 6.6 million Debit. Regarding revenues turnover with Credit and Debit cards, we reached R$49.3 billion of turnover, 31.9% growth in 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows the behavior of our administrative expenses. It's important to, and in the next two slides we will explain better the performance of this expense that in the certain extent meets the estimates of our market analysts. There was -- when we look to the overall amount of administrative expenses in the year, we were very comfortable and very happy with this performance because administrative expenses showed a 3.3% increase below the inflation.  However, in the quarter there was a 10% increase, and for the sake of estimate, we would like to discuss it in the two next slides to give you a breakdown of what effectively happened in personnel and other administrative expenses in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking specifically about personnel expenses, we have in Slide 20 the analysis of changes between the third and the fourth quarter. The increase of 10% in these expenses, which means around R$177.4 million of extra expenses in the fourth quarter, was the result, one, of R$82 million increase due to the salary rates we granted to our employees. Just to remember we ended September with a salary negotiation with the unions that granted around 6% increase in the overall salaries for banking employees.  This was for the entire sector, okay?  Besides that there was another R$53 million increase in personnel expenses due to a change in what we call Occupational Accident Insurance. This insurance represented -- it used to represent up to June 1% of the average payroll of the Bank. This was for the entire industry, okay. And there was a change from the Social Security, and that increased this rate from 1 to 3%. As a result, we had an increase of R$53 million in this line.</p>
          <p>And the last effect was also big increase in the number of employees. The average workforce increased by 2,800 employees in the period, that corresponded to a R$61.3 million increase in personnel expenses. This workforce increase was necessary to replace the employees that left the company by June, around 7,000 employees left the company in the early retirement program. And we were able to replace them all in the fourth quarter. Since in order to join Banco do Brasil you must <mark type="inaudible" /> a public exam and it took us the entire third quarter to make all these actions to allow us hire these people in the fourth quarter.  It is worth to highlight that half of the amount of the expenses with Occupational Accident Insurance are related to months of &#x2013; to the months of June to September. So the effect is the impact of this increase in the Occupational Accident Insurance in the fourth quarter should fit between <mark type="inaudible" /> be deducted by 26.5 million that was related June to September period.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 21, I would like to give you a breakdown of the changes that we had in other administrative expenses. There was an increase of R$157 million in this line due to 72 million that we could consider as non-recurring expenses, okay. That could be classified as non-structural expenses. These expenses -- the breakdown of it, we had around R$32 million of contributions we did to the Foundation of Banco do Brasil, around R$24 million of foundation, and <mark type="inaudible" /> granted to the Foundation of Banco do Brasil. And usually every fourth quarter, Banco do Brasil makes that kind of capital injection in this foundation to finance all the projects that are being carried out by the Banco do Brasil Foundation. And another R$8 million that were donated to the Children and Teenagers Rights Fund, and of course that these donations also have tax feedbacks.</p>
          <p>Besides that we cannot forget that in order to face the increasing business along the third quarter. Banco do Brasil has in fourth quarter as well, had to hire temporary workforce to help us make all the transfers from the payroll that we bought from the state of <mark type="inaudible" />, and the state of <mark type="inaudible" /> as well.  Since we had 7,000 people leaving the company by June, and there was, how can I say, vestige of employees during the third and fourth quarter. And we were still expecting people to be hired.  So in order to help us make all these transfer, not to jeopardize the quality of the service we had to hire temporarily some workforce. As a result, we had to account R$21 million of extra expenses.</p>
          <p>And finally there was a non-recurring expense of R$19 million of marketing expenses. We had TV campaigns, ad campaigns, 10 million was directly linked to our offering we made in Brazil, an advertising campaign in Brazil to incentivate Brazilians to participate in our offering. And the result of that was that 25% of the offering was allocated to individual investors here in Brazil.  So R$9 million was another marketing campaign that -- it was a start-up of the celebrations for our 200 years anniversary. And we had a massive TV campaign here in Brazil starting all the facilities to celebrate the 200 years anniversary that we will have in October '08.</p>
          <p>Thus it would not -- we do not consider that R$72 million of non-structured -- non-structural expenses, instead of a raise of 10% in the quarter in our other administrative expense, we would see an increase of 5.4% in other administrative expenses, totally in line with our expectation of increase in line with inflation.  And this increase was mainly arising from third-party service, security and other contracted service in the quarter, due to the organizational growth that we promote -- the organic growth, sorry, that we promoted in our business. It's important to remember that we have to create three specific areas in Banco do Brasil to address mortgage market, to address car loans market and also Credit Card business. Differently from our peers, Banco do Brasil has promote its growth organically. And in order to do that we must create organizational areas in the company to start servicing new business, but the expenses from the creation of this area, we will see up front in the P&amp;L while the revenues that will be generated by this businesses, we will see it throughout the quarters.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, when you compare this strategy to our peers', usually they make acquisitions, the goodwill will be amortized throughout time. However the revenues of these business that they buy, will start being accounted immediately because usually they buy, they do not start up, they buy existing companies that are already generating revenues.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 22, we can see that fee income and personnel expenses, a comparison between fee income and personnel expenses. Here it's important to notice that the coverage ratio of personnel expenses over fee -- fee income over personnel expenses, even with all the non-recurring impacts was above 100%. If we adjust that, excluding the one-off expenses with the retirement plan, early retirement plan and the capital injection in the healthcare plan, we would have a coverage ratio of 128%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 23, we can observe that our cost income ratio also deteriorated due to these one-off expenses. If we put apart these non-recurring items, we would have accounted 46.9% cost income ratio. It is important to remember that the target for '08 is to end the year with a 45% cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 24, we show you our leverage capacity. Our BIS ratio ended the year with 15.7%. With this ratio, it guarantees a leverage capability for Banco do Brasil to grow its loan book by R$93.6 billion. And despite all the growth we're promoting in our book, our loan-to-deposit ratio continues to be very competitive and very attractive at 85%. So there is no capital or even <mark type="inaudible" /> constraint for Banco do Brasil to finance the growth of its assets.  And we are estimating for the entire year to grow &#x2013; of '08 to grow our loan book by 25 to 30%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the last slide of our presentation, I would like you -- to discuss with you the annual guidance that we gave to the market and what we reported, and also the annual guidance for 2008. With regard to our net interest -- to our margin, financial margin over earned assets the guidance we gave last year was to be around 8% and we ended '07 at 7.8%, in line with our guidance. For 2008, our expectation is to maintain this ratio between the range from 7.5 to 8%. The guidance for provisions to credit risk was achieved in the most positive way. Provision expenses over average book represented 3.7% of the average portfolio annualized. The target was -- the guidance target was between 3.7 to 4%.  And for 2008, we're expecting to maintain these average provisions over book for the entire year between the range 3.7 to 4%.</p>
          <p>Fee income, the guidance was to have fee income into 12 to 17%.  We missed this guidance due to increasing competitiveness in the banking industry, some measures that we had to take to become more attractive to retain customers to gain market share and that's why we grew by 11.4%. However, due to the new regulatory environment in the banking industry that's specifically with regard to fee income, we are reducing our guidance to a single-digit one and we expect 2008, an 8% growth rate in fee income.</p>
          <p>In administrative expenses, administrative expenses the annual performance came below our guidance. We were expecting to beat normal inflation with it and it came at 3.3%.  For 2008, we are expecting to have our expenses growing between 7 to 10%, specifically due to adjustments we must make in order to face the increasing competitiveness in the sector.</p>
          <p>With regards return on equity, our guidance was mid-20s and we ended 2007 with 25.5%, in line with the guidance. And for 2008 we are sustaining the same guidance, mid-20s as well.</p>
          <p>Loan book, loan book the guidance was to grow between 25 to 30%.  We missed this guidance, due mainly to the performance in the Agribusiness book that grew only by 15%. The expected target for this book was 20%, not 15%, and also due to the decrease in the reais denominated balance in the loan book that brought due to the depreciation of reais over dollar.</p>
          <p>However, with regard to individuals and business, we believe that we practically achieved the guidance. The guidance to individuals was between 35 to 40% growth rate in '07.  We ended the year with 33.3%, growth rate for '08, the guidance we are adjusting it to 30 to 35% growth rate.  Business our growth -- our guidance will be maintained.  We were expecting 25 to 30%. We ended '07 with 26.1% increase in this book and we will sustain that in 2008.</p>
          <p>With regard to total deposits, we were in line with the guidance to grow between 15 to 20. We ended '07 with 18.5% growth rate.  For '08, we sustain the guidance at the range of 15 to 20%.</p>
          <p>And finally, with regard to Credit Cards, this we outperformed the guidance.  The guidance was to end the year with Credit Cards activated at 16.5 million Credit Cards, and we ended '07 with 20.2 million Credit Cards activated.  The guidance for '08 will be 25 million Credit Cards by the end of '08.</p>
          <p>Well, those were the details of the results we wanted to share with you.  We could now open the floor for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Excuse me, Mr. Carlos Firetti with Bradesco would like to ask a question. Please Mr. Firetti, go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. I have a question related to the expense side, you gave us equity pay on the G&amp;A expense in personnel, but I would like to focus a little bit more on other lines like your legal risk expense. I'd like to know what would be a good number to use in order to forecast this line more correctly for 2008, since I think you had some non-recurring expenses in this line associated with the past economic plans in Brazil? And also another question related to the other operating expenses and income line, this line had an increase in the fourth quarter.  I know there is some seasonality regarding to the update of some provisions. But I also would like to have from you, what do you think is a reasonable growth to assume for this line going forward? That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that, this is Geovanne. As a matter of fact, trying to estimate this legal risk expenses is a little bit hard especially because the range we make provisions are 0, 50 or 100%. Not as gradual as it is for instance when we are provisioning for credit risk.  Definitely in the fourth quarter of '07 there was an increase due to R$100 million we accounted to face economic plans. According to our controlling director, we are paying a very close attention to this legal environment.  And you should expect for 2008 the level of, how can I say, legal risk to be &#x2013; well, it's hard to try to assess a number. But probably I think that the numbers we have since the third and fourth quarter of '07 would be I would say to -- it would be -- you could start with these numbers, an average of 350 million just for the sake of estimate.  But once again, this is a very difficult line to try to assess because we don't have the control on the decisions taken by courts.  And whenever there is a litigation going on, if this decision is, how can I say, is denied in the first court and goes to a higher court, it's approved in the higher court, we will have to write -- provision 50% of the litigation.  Okay?  So, probably -- it will be a kind of guess, okay, but you should expect something around R$300 million per quarter. I think it would be conservative between 300 to 350 due to all the changes we are doing. We are expecting to happen in the country.</p>
          <p>However it's important to highlight here that with regard to labor claims, Banco do Brasil is taking some measures to reduce the volatility of it.  What we are doing? We are with all the employees that are leaving the company nowadays, they must sign a formal agreement with the company.  And according to this agreement, this is also approved by the court and the employee has no longer right to start any labor claim in the future. Because sometimes when you lay off people, they take like three, four, up to five years to start a labor claim. So you don't have the exact control of the amount of labor claims you will have in the future because you don't know whether your employees will start a legal claim against you or not. However with this agreement, this formal agreement we are signing and all these several people that left the company in the early retirement plan, they have to sign this agreement. We did that in order to reduce the volatility in this line.</p>
          <p>With regard to civil claims, it's unpredictable because every customer that gets stuck in the revolving door to enter in our branches can start up a legal claim against the bank asking for moral hazards, moral and other kinds of damages, okay. But for the sake of estimate I think that between 300 to 350 million per quarter, would be a good guess.  But we must wait for the upcoming quarters to see if this trend will be confirmed or not.</p>
          <p>And the other one has to do with other operating expenses.  It's important to mention here that there is the deliberation &#x2013; a rule from the Brazilian SEC and this is applicable for all companies, public companies in Brazil, okay. All companies, they must assess what will be the future liability for patient claims and healthcare claims for its employees, okay. And you must do that and account that when you publish your fiscal year numbers, okay. That's why the fourth quarter usually comes with a higher volume of operating expenses, and we have the explanatory note number 24 teaching the exact idea of the actuarial assessment of all of our future liabilities.</p>
          <p>Aldo, perhaps you could share with us some ideas that you're starting to discuss in order to reduce this volatility. We are starting to discuss with <mark type="inaudible" /> if we could use a part of the surplus to mitigate or even to completely reduce to zero the future liabilities that we would have due to actuarial changes in patient claims for those employees. Which responsibility is towards -- the sole responsibility of Banco do Brasil or to the healthcare plan as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they did &#x2013; there was something that we did in the past in 1997 when there was a surplus. <mark type="inaudible" /> part of Banco do Brasil actuarial obligations were transferred to the pension plan and our part in the surplus that time was used to support this expense. We are discussing to do the same now with <mark type="inaudible" /> and <mark type="inaudible" /> transfer actuarial obligation that we have in our balance sheet to the pension plan. And the pension plan we've used the part that we have in that surplus to support this expense. But we cannot do this by ourselves.  We have to achieve an agreement because the law is very clear. We can do both with the surplus. We can reduce contribution or we can increase benefit.  So I think difference on those two options, two possibilities have to be achieved by a consensus, by a negotiation with the pension plan. And we are in the middle of a negotiation with the pension plan trying to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p>And I cannot forget to mention that with regard to other operational expenses, we do have a breakdown of these expenses in explanatory note 15E in our balance sheet. I don't have the flow that we're expecting for a specific kind of expense but I will try to bring that in the next call for the first quarter results. But I would like to highlight here if you look in that explanatory note, there is a specific expense that we call in Portuguese <mark type="inaudible" />.  All the payrolls that we are buying from municipality and state government, we amortize the price we pay throughout time as long as the contract stands.  And these contracts will be effective until 2012.  And we have already started to amortize the payrolls we paid, and that's why when you compare to '06 there was an increase of R$157 million in our operating expenses. Due to the level of amortization of these disbursements we did for governments, municipality and state governments when we paid to buy their payroll, okay. But I will try to bring that on the next call, Firetti. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi all. I have two questions. The first is related to the increase in CSL contribution.  What kind of interest &#x2013; effective tax rate do you expect for this year? What is the effective increase that you foresee?  And the second one is, you just mentioned regarding the rise in expenses, and part of it related to the hiring of additional personnel to meet for the recent acquired payroll from the employees of <mark type="inaudible" />. So I wonder when the bank will start really to pay these salaries. As far as I'm concerned, I think <mark type="inaudible" /> is already paying &#x2013; is still paying the employees of <mark type="inaudible" />. And so when do you expect these benefits? I mean, that the client base should be ready for you to start exploiting the opportunities that comes around with this client base? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi Maria, it's Aldo.  As far as I know Banco do Brasil is paying all employees of state of <mark type="inaudible" /> and state of Minas Gerais.

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regard to your first question Maria Laura, I would like to ask the help of our Controlling Director because as I remember, as I recall, the expectation was to increase our tax rate by I think 300 basis points. If I don't -- if I recall quite well. Despite the increase of 600 basis points in the social contribution, the impact in the increase of that tax rate would be lower due to some specific deductible expenses that we have in our, how can I say, in our balance sheet. And we will have also to update all the tax credits that we have accounted, that were accounted considering a 9% rate of social contribution over profits, okay.  And it will be adjusted to 15%. We have our <mark type="inaudible" /> showing the size of our provision that must be used to update our <mark type="inaudible" />. It's explanatory note 18.8. We have a timing differences provisions around R$23.4 billion. So what we're talking about is the potential activation of 6% over R$23.4 billion of deferred tax credits due to timing differences just because of that. So we are not expecting a considerable increase in the tax rate.  It could go up to 30, 30 to 31%, okay due to this change in the <mark type="inaudible" /> Nilson, if you want to add some comments please feel free.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. I have no doubt that you are regarding the personnel expenses, I know you must offer your old employees that left the company in second quarter but you hired another one.  And I thought that they would cost less than the persons who leaving &#x2013; left the company.  So how can I adjust the number? How -- if I had a comparison with the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding all the factors, excluding the increase of the union, something like that. I want to know, regarding the personnel expenses only, I would want to know if it will be a lower cost or higher cost, could you explain it a little bit more, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="inaudible" />. First of all, you must bear in mind that the bulk of the employees that left the company, they left by June, okay. So in the third quarter there was some blanks. I don't know if I can say that in English, but we didn't have time to hire new personnel to replace the old ones that left. Usually, a new one costs a third of an old one in the same position, okay. And this was one of the reasons why we had to hire temporary workforce to help us in the business during this time. And at the end of the day, it increased other administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>By the -- and if you compare personnel expense in the third quarter '07 with the previous quarter, there was a reduction in this expenses due to these people that left the company. The new ones, they added something around R$82 million in terms of expenses. However, when we compare to the same period of 2006, there was an increase of 4.9%. This was definitely mainly due to the salary raise that we granted to the personnel. The fourth quarter of '07, it's fully impacted by the 6% salary raise we granted for bank clerks in Brazil, okay. So this is the major reason why we had a higher, how I can say -- expense number. You should have made the adjustments, I don't have this calculation here, but definitely you should deduct from the R$1.9 billion the 61.3 million that was &#x2013; sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, the occupational accident insurance, in order to be comparable you should take that apart to see effectively the kinds of savings we're expecting.</p>
          <p>According to our estimates, Nilson, you could help me with this answering, we were expecting from 2008 on, to save around 150 million up to R$200 million per year in the personnel expenses line due to the replacement of old ones to new ones. Is this number correct?  Nilson, I don't recall quite well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yes, definitely because the numbers I have here, it's in Table 17 in our MD&amp;A, okay. As of Q4 '06 the total amount of personnel expenses was R$1.846 billion.  As of December '07, R$1.936 billion. The salary raise was 6%, okay, and the increase was only up 4.9%, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have a couple of questions. The first one, thank you for the guidance that you offer in Page 25. If I could ask you what is your basic micro assumption behind this guidance in terms of both GDP growth, what you're expecting for '08 and more importantly interest rates, what's your best case outlook for Selic for the end of the year? That's question one. And question two, you give guidance for provision for credit risks more or less in line to what we see recently in the 3.7% to 4% range. There is some explanation you give in your press release that in first quarter there's going to be, I believe R$450 million coming from some initial studies you've done in January, relating to that new business portfolio. I was wondering if when we think about provisions for the first quarter alone, we should think about -- the normal 3.7% to 4% plus this 450 as a one-time thing?  Or the 450 will be included in the overall 3.7% to 4% guidance you are giving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Hold on a sec.  Just to check, the first question wanted to understand the guidance for the Selic rate and for what?</p>

          <p>No, no, no, no, no, both Selic and GDP growth that you use in order to come up with your loan growth assumption and your net interest income assumption? Selic and GDP growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are working with the basic scenario of maintaining Selic by the end of '08, 1125, okay. The fact why we are reducing our guidance to net interest margin from 8 to 7.5 to 8% is that we're expecting to grow faster the car loans book, which average spread is at 14%, and also continue to grow faster payroll. And they definitely will help decreasing the net interest margin in the, how can I say, in this portfolio. Besides higher increase in the Agribusiness book, Agribusiness book has already posted a reduction in its net interest margin close to 6%, it used to be close to 7 due to the lower rate we are charging now and lower equalization revenues as well. Equalization revenues grew up from 1.4 to 1 billion and probably depending on how risk performs, it could -- our expectation is throughout time, go back to the historical level of around R$600 million per <mark type="inaudible" />, okay.</p>

          <p>Yeah because it will depend, we have up to February 29th for the outstanding balance of loans that are still under renegotiation to be restructured. We have something close to R$400 million. So the final date will be February 29th and that's why it's a possibility because so far we don't know effectively how much of that was restructured or not.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a follow up on the agricultural exposure, because we noticed <mark type="inaudible" /> in that book increased slightly in the quarter. So can you just kind of give us a sense for what are you expecting in the portfolio this year and any deterioration in asset quality and also what kind of loan growth on the agricultural segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The agricultural segment, since there is seasonality usually the plantation season starts in August. However, with the restructuring of some installments, we have postponed it to the fourth quarter. We expect before '08 a 20% growth rate, okay. With regard to risk, as you may see in the numbers we've disclosed, as of December, the average -- the re-concentration was at 11.8, now is at 13.8. I think that if you remain at the 13.8, and we are not expecting a faster improvement in this rate because we have been very conservative as we have been mentioning in our calls. We've rolled over these loans for a five-year period. So as long as these people start paying us back, we will not start improving their risk profile. And that's why we will continue to make more provisions to the book in order to, how can I say, to strengthen the quality of our balance sheet. However, the numbers of delinquency rate are very under control. The only problems that provisions tend to remain higher in this book due to this average higher risk profile. And we will not improve it as long as these people does not start paying us back.</p>
