        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, President and CEO of Wal-Mart de Mexico, and Mariana Rodr&#xED;guez.</p>
          <p>I would like to begin by saying that I think results were good, as we faced both a challenging economic environment and a negative calendar effect.</p>
          <p>In terms of the environment, the global economic indicator declined, which is a proxy for GDP, decreased 9.5% in January. This figure is similar to that of the crisis of 1995. In our case, during that month, our total sales increased 9.2% and comp store sales increased 2.7% and 4.5% in comparable weeks.</p>
          <p>Our sales have been driven by an increasing number of customers that are purchasing at our stores. Disposable income and consumer confidence have been affected and what consumers are asking for is lower price, and it is precisely that what we are emphasizing. Our core strategy, Every Day Low Prices, is now as important as ever.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation and a strong balance sheet with no debt allow us to continue strongly investing in price, while at the same time continue opening new stores of our different formats, remodeling existing stores, paying dividends, and buying back shares.</p>
          <p>Regarding the calendar effect, February had 28 days versus 29 of last year and the effect of Easter that last year was in March and this year in April. Despite these factors, comp store sales growth for the quarter was 1% and 1.9% for self-service formats.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the following. The number of customers we serve increased 10.1% and 0.6% for comparable stores. In the case of self-service formats, growth was 13% and 2.3% respectively.</p>
          <p>Another quarter with improvement in gross margin despite investment in prices and the mix of formats as more discretionary formats, Suburbia and Vips that have higher margins underperformed, and even despite mix of sales within self-service as customers are pulling out their spending in non-food areas.</p>
          <p>Net earnings for the retail business excluding the Bank grew more than sales. The return on equity for the last 12 months through March was 24% while return on capital employed was 26.9%.</p>
          <p>Now, I will ask Eduardo to comment on our current strategies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to you all, and thank you, Rafael. I agree, Rafael, with you and most probably with all you listening to this conference that we are facing a very tough economic environment.</p>
          <p>But the bright side of the situation is that we are very well positioned in this environment. We have the financial and operational strength that we need and we have the people, the experience, and the results-oriented management team that knows how to run the businesses under circumstances like we are facing today.</p>
          <p>I am convinced that the environment give us an opportunity to drive more customers to our stores, to increase the loyalty for existing customers, and to be more relevant for all of them. This will allow us to differentiate more from our competitors and to come out of the crisis as a stronger company.</p>
          <p>Mexico, as you know, we have had many crises, and we have managed to come out of those crises better positioned and more efficient. And this will not be the exception. This is a company where long-term strategies are also relevant in the short term. We drive efficiencies and lower prices, and we continue opening new stores. And these efforts in the short term have also a good impact for the long term. The traffic that we are generating will support the future sales growth and the discipline in expenses will allow us for more leverage.</p>
          <p>Regarding prices, this quarter we relaunched let me put it out this way, EDLP, focusing on three different things. One is consistency, having the lowest price in the entire country in every single department and every day of the year. Second, transparency, we want to make it easy for people to compare prices and we are inviting our customers to do the math. Even at Sam's, we are comparing prices to grow the value of our membership. Third, customer relevance, we are starting every season with the lowest price on the top seasonal items. We have the best prices on the best regional brands, the best prices in most important categories of our format, and the best prices on the best selling items in all of our stores. And we are also emphasizing the price message, and we are helping customer to make the math and compare.</p>
          <p>Bodegas Aurrer&#xE1; launched the program Station Mascaramos los precious de las competencies or over the price of our competition. We compare prices so that our customers remain convinced that Bodega is the champion of lower prices. At Walmart, we launched a very aggressive program of more than 1,000 products at less than 10 pesos, 10 pesos or less. And we also made our Fresh Tuesdays and Wednesdays programs more aggressive, enlarging the number of departments participating. Besides fruits and vegetables, now our customers find excellent prices in dairy, meat, fish and seafood, groceries and consumables.</p>
          <p>At Sam's Club, we have the event 10 wants to be 11, in which we gave an extra product for every 10 identical grocery products purchased. We also have the exclusive Sam's Club sale where members will choose to purchase products with three, six, 12 and even 18 months no interest with most of the bank credit cards.</p>
          <p>And in term of communicating the product message, we launched our personalized saving communication program to more than 58,000 members. We send each of &#x2013; one of them a detail of what they saved during 2008 by purchasing at Sam's Club.</p>
          <p>Vips have several events such as El Porton, 39 pesos, the granting of 20% discount to Sam's Club members, and the program Kids Eat for Free at Vips. And all these price efforts are paying off, don't you agree, Rafael?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I agree, Eduardo. This is reflected both in our customers' growth and in the fact that we are growing more than the market. Let's look at February, which is the most recent same-store sales figure reported for the industry as measured by <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Same-store sales for Walmart grew 1.5%, and if we consider only our self-service format, we grew 2.3%, which compares favorably to the 1.2% decline of the industry excluding Walmart.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Rafael, I will also highlight the merchandising pro end of Superama developing. Through the dynamic merchandising for the weekends, we are displaying at the entrance of the stores the merchandise that our customers buy more during weekends such as wines, refreshments, sushi, and cold meat trays. We also enlarged our table wines assortment including 100 products at 60 pesos or less. And finally, we had a beef fair with more than 70 products from 13 different countries.</p>
          <p>Finally, some comments with regards to our social responsibility. I am very proud to let you know that for nine consecutive occasions, we were recognized as a Socially Responsible Company by the Mexican Center of Philanthropy, CEMEFI, and the Alliance for Social Responsibility in Mexico, AliaRSE. We are one of the 10 companies and the only retailer that has received this recognition for nine consecutive years.</p>
          <p>All of the Wal-Mart format stores froze the prices for the tortilla and other 500 basic private label products.</p>
          <p>Regarding sustainability, we installed in our Bodega Aurrer&#xE1; combinaci&#xF3;n with Aguascalientes, the largest solar photovoltaic installation in all Latin America. This project consists of more than 1,000 panels that generates more than 265,000 kilowatts hours per year, which represent 20% of the use of the store, and it avoid emission of 140 tons of CO2 per year.</p>
          <p>Wal-Mart de Mexico became part of the international commitment made by Walmart Stores to eliminate 70% of the phosphates in all laundry and dishwashing detergents by 2011, furthermore, reduce the use of packaging in 5% by the year 2013.</p>
          <p>Wal-Mart de Mexico placed containers for recollecting disposable plastic bags at entrance of its Superama stores in Mexico City. The bags will be delivered to our recycling centre. This program is part of Wal-Mart de Mexico commitment announced in 2008 to reduce plastic bag usage in 50% by 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, Mariana will give you more details about the numbers.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eduardo. Sales, as Rafael mentioned, had a very negative calendar effect. Total growth was 7.8% while same-store sales grew 1%. In terms of comparable weeks, same-store sales grew 3.3% though this growth still does not eliminate the Easter effect.</p>
          <p>Regarding the different formats, in terms of same-store sales, the best performing during the quarter was Sam's Club followed by Superama, while the weakest were Suburbia and Vips.</p>
          <p>Growth for self-service format was 1.9%. Customers at comparable stores grew 0.6% and average ticket 0.4%. The formats that had the strongest growth in customers were Walmart and Bodega.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the quarter was 10 basis points higher than in last year's first quarter. This improvement was driven by efficiencies with suppliers, in inventory management and in distribution. General expenses grew 8.9%. If we exclude the Bank, expenses grew 7.7% compared to 7.8% increase in sales.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at some balance sheet items. As of the end of the first quarter 2009, our cash position amounted to 10,782 million pesos, 2,168 million pesos more than last year. During the first quarter of the year, the company invested 969 million pesos in fixed assets and repurchased 9.5 million shares for an amount of 303 million pesos.</p>
          <p>Inventories increased 21.6% versus last year, while accounts payable to suppliers increased 14.2. The increase in inventories is mainly due to the opening of 189 units during the last 12 months and because of the merchandise we have ready for Easter. With regards to accounts payable, this quarter we prepaid a higher amount to suppliers than what we did last year.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave you back with Rafael Matute.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would like to remind you that this year the cash dividend of 0.61 pesos, approved at our last shareholders' meeting, will be paid on April the 30.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we announced at our Analyst Meeting, this year, we will invest 11.8 billion pesos, and we will open 252 stores, increasing the installed capacity by 10%. So far this year, we have opened 14 units, two Bodega Aurrer&#xE1;; five Mi Bodega; five Bodega Aurrer&#xE1; Express; one Walmart; and one Superama. With these openings, we went to five cities where we had no previous presence. So we now have 1,217 units in 229 cities throughout the country.</p>
          <p>Thanks again. And I remind you that we will be available to receive any calls with questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
