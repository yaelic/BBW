        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob, and best wishes to all of you for the New Year. Welcome to Monsanto's first quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Monsanto's Chairman and CEO; by Carl Casale, our CFO; and by our Chief Technology Officer, Rob Fraley. Also joining me are Will McAndrew, Manny Cruz, and Ruben Mella, my colleagues in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you this call is being webcast and you can access it at monsanto.com. The replay is also available at that address. For those of you who would like to go to our website, the slides for the call are posted on the Investor Information page.</p>
          <p>We're providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>Today's conference call features our sixth annual review of our R&amp;D pipeline results. Carl will start things off with a review of the quarter, of guidance, and of seed orders. Hugh will expand on the outlook for 2010, and Rob will take you through the pipeline update.</p>
          <p>Because our time is short today with the R&amp;D update, I will now turn the call over to Carl.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bryan, and good morning and happy New Year to everyone.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter is a small quarter and it's a quarter that reflects very little of the business that will ultimately determine our fiscal year outcome. But it's an important first step in delivering on the milestones and commitments we've outlined for the year. But before I get in to the detail of the results, let me give you my view of how this first small quarter fits in to our full-year outlook.</p>
          <p>First, as you've heard our team say many times before, our guidance is a commitment, not an aspiration. Importantly at this first milestone, we closed out the quarter with EPS and free cash flow results ahead of our preliminary guidance. As we show on slide four, if I combine the early data points from the first quarter with our evaluation of the remaining variables for the year, I feel confident confirming our full-year EPS and free cash flow targets today. That's our commitment.</p>
          <p>Second, fiscal 2010 marks the return to our normal earnings pattern as a result of the reset of the Roundup business. This can be seen on slide five, where all of our earnings this year will occur in the second and third quarters. The small first quarter magnifies nominally with some key measures, particularly our corn margin. I'll address these directly as they skew the quarter, but we would expect to see the total Seeds and Genomics segment margins normalize for the full year.</p>
          <p>Third, this quarter yields the first data points in the two areas I get the most questions on at this point, our confidence in our Roundup outlook for the year and what our order book tells us about the important US Seeds and Traits season. These are still early indicators at this point but both continue to track well and reinforce our confidence in our ability to deliver on our fiscal 2010 commitment.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, let's walk through the first quarter results. As expected, the year-over-year decrease in our first quarter results clearly reflects the resetting of the Roundup business. Against that, we delivered an ongoing EPS loss of $0.02 per share for the quarter, down from earnings of $0.98 per share in the prior year. On an absolute basis, SG&amp;A declined year over year, while R&amp;D expenditures were slightly higher than the prior year as we managed more projects in the latter phases of the development cycle.</p>
          <p>While we anticipated certain discrete tax benefits that would be reflected in our full-year tax rate, several of those occurred in the first quarter and represented a $0.03 benefit realized in this quarter. Given the first quarter loss, those discrete events add up to an effective tax rate of 56%, although the full-year rate should still be in the 30% range.</p>
          <p>We also entered the quarter slightly ahead of our free cash flow expectation. Free cash flow was a 1.6 billion use of cash in the quarter compared with a $124 million source of cash this time last year. The reset of the Roundup business accounts for roughly 30% of this shift. A little more than half the cash decrease is the result of some prudent working capital management changes, but also the timing of cash flow in the quarter. This was primarily driven by a change to move up payment terms from our seed licensees, which have traditionally been collected in the first quarter and are now collected in the fourth quarter. The remaining balance in fiscal 2009 came from the proceeds from the POSILAC divestiture, which was $300 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash deployment, we continued to use our cash to fund our current three-year $800 million share repurchase program. We spent a little over 60 million repurchasing shares in the first quarter, bringing us to about 40% of the way to completing our full authorization. Likewise, while anticipating lower overall earnings than we had in fiscal year 2009, we've maintained our dividend and continue to see funding our dividend as a priority for free cash generation in 2010.</p>
          <p>If you move on to slide seven and the segment detail, we can step through both the quarterly drivers and the indicators for our full-year performance. The largest driver in the overall first quarter results is the expected shift of Roundup. Gross profit for Ag Productivity declined significantly as we lapped the peak in the supply/demand imbalance in Latin America last year. More important is the progress we've made against our plan to generate 650 million to $750 million in Roundup gross profit this year on the way to a sustainable $1 billion in gross profit by 2012.</p>
          <p>We're executing on our 2010 Roundup objectives to reduce Roundup prices to bring premiums more in line with the historical norms, increase overall volumes, and optimize our low cost production advantage. Even at this early juncture, worldwide branded net selling price is in the 10 to $12 per gallon band that we're expecting for the year. In Brazil and Argentina, our branded pricing is squarely in that band. As in other parts of the world, there is still significant generic competitive presence in the channel, but with what we sold and with the second season ahead in Brazil, we have achievable volume targets for the region.</p>
          <p>In the US, the season still lies in front of us, but the early-fill and US prepay portion of the season provide early indicators that the season is shaping up as we would have expected. The channel response to our price reduction has been good and there is very good channel support reflected by the products we have in position at this point in the year. The clearing of generic inventory is still underway, keeping farm gate generic prices depressed. While it's still early days and we'll monitor the spread on our branded price, we believe our price movement incentives put us where we need to be at this point in the season.</p>
          <p>Moving now on to the seed and trait side of the business, given the small quarter a couple of timing and mix effects had a magnified impact on both our gross profit and gross margin. On the gross profit side, total Seeds and Genomics declined $81 million to 597 million for the first quarter in 2010. In particular, gross profit in corn Seeds and Traits was down 25% to 304 million. At an absolute gross profit level, the decline in corn Seeds and Traits predominantly reflects the shift in timing of our corn business in Mexico, as we mentioned at our November Investor Day.</p>
          <p>In order to create a localized corn distribution model more on par with rest of North America, we helped distributors have on-hand inventory and that moved up roughly $40 million in gross profit into our fourth quarter. Since this was a structural change, this revenue pattern will begin to be reflected in our fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the decline largely reflects the decrease in planted acres of corn in Brazil and Argentina, where drought and commodity prices depressed acres this year. In both Brazil and Argentina, we project planted acres declining roughly 15 to 20%. With the second season still ahead in Brazil, we may see some rebound in total acres, but we still expect all implanted acres to be down for the year in both Brazil and Argentina.</p>
          <p>On the margin side, overall Seeds and Traits margins were down four points to 58% for the quarter. This is driven by corn margins, which are down 11 points from 64% in the first quarter of last year to 53% this year. The margin effect we see in the quarter is driven by a shift in our mix in the US as our business evolves and is magnified by limited corn sales in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our total volume and absolute gross profit from the US corn was up in the first quarter but the margin was off by 11 points. The reason is straightforward. In a small quarter, we are seeing the mix effect from selling a greater portion of branded seed versus licensed seed. With the growth in our branded seed business, we sold more branded seed in the first quarter than we ever have historically. That's a positive in the fact that it contributes more gross profit dollars to our bottom line, but has a lower overall blended margin because it includes the seed plus the trait as opposed to the higher margin trait-only royalty from licensees. If we step back and look at the full year, aggregate Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit margins are tracking with our target, although we may see some shifts in the composition by crop.</p>
          <p>For corn, we've talked about strategic investments we've made in 2010 to drive the accelerated three-year ramp up of SmartStax, including incremental launch year production costs and the targeted price reduction to drive triple-stack penetration. As we've indicated before, those investments raised the average cost of goods per unit this year. However, despite the fact that our branded trait penetration more than doubled in Brazil and our double-stack mix was up again in Argentina, the overall corn acreage reduction in Latin America limits an upside to offset this launch year effect in the US.</p>
          <p>Factoring in the other crops, however, our overall blended margins for the Seeds and Traits business is still expected to be relatively flat year over year. Likewise, we remain on track for a 5.1 to $5.2 billion in absolute gross profit target for Seeds and Traits. Thus the value of our crop portfolio approach has allowed our upsides and downside to offset each other.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the last element of our Seeds and Traits outlook, the order book. Given our expectation that 2010 sets the tone for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield acceleration, the logical question becomes how are actual orders tracking in the order book for this year. Hugh and I personally reviewed the order book at calendar year end, so I'll give you both the data and our read on how the order book translates into our operational milestone.</p>
          <p>First, by December 31 a good portion of the seed is on order but not all. In a usual year, the selling season wraps up by mid to late February, and that's still likely to be the case even in a late harvest. With a significant portion of the selling season is still ahead, this represents an early look.</p>
          <p>Second, despite the early look, prepayments tracking year-over-year cash received from independent dealers are approximately 20% above the prepayment levels at the end of December last year. Cash in hand provides the best barometer of pace and reliability of orders and the fact that this year we are seeing better prepays in the later season is a signal of good overall order patterns.</p>
          <p>Third, the order pace bodes well for our introductory volume of SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield. At our November Investor event, we increased our expectation for launch year SmartStax volume to more than 4 million acres as shown on slide eight. More than half of our SmartStax target was spoken for before farmers had the benefit of knowing the specific hybrids available. That's a function of the late harvest where hybrid qualification was later than usual, meaning we didn't have our lineup of commercial hybrids into the hands of our sales force until early December.</p>
          <p>But given those orders, early adopter uptake in this first year has been good, and that gives us confidence we're on pace to meet our 4 million acre target.</p>
          <p>Likewise in Roundup Ready 2 Yield, our accelerated 8 to 10 million acre ramp is on pace. There's no denying that we had to cut through the chatter and sell the performance of our class of 2010 varieties; but like SmartStax, placement of our early adopter volume is happening and we're on pace to deliver on our 2010 commitment. For both Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax, our realized selling prices continue to be in the expected ranges we previously discussed.</p>
          <p>As I view fiscal 2010, our task is execution. And at the start of fiscal year, we're executing against the plan on the critical areas that influence the quarter, particularly our Roundup strategy and the corn trait opportunity. And perhaps more importantly, the early signs are in place that give us confidence that we're meeting the milestones that drive our Seeds and Traits opportunity in the US.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh for a further look at the outlook for these milestones for Seeds and Traits in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Carl, and let also wish everybody on the phone the very best in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Just two short months ago, nearly 200 of our investors met with us to see our newest research facility in North Carolina. And during those couple of brief days together, we laid out for you the operational path that walks us through 2010, '11, and '12. So you might be asking what has changed in the last 60 days or so.</p>
          <p>First of all, some things haven't changed at all. If you look at slide nine, our opportunity in the three-year bridge from 2010 through 2012 is a reflection of the positive mix lift that we will get from new product upgrades like SmartStax, Roundup Ready 2 Yield, and our corn biotech traits emerging in Latin America. Our job continues to be to deliver innovation to the farm and give farmers a compelling choice to upgrade to these next generation technologies. If we do that and we do it well, the upgrade and the value of our product offerings will steer us to our path of doubling our gross profit in 2012 from our original base than 2007.</p>
          <p>Secondly, where we have new data points since November, they serve to strengthen our confidence in our products and in our strategic plan. In particular, we announced our final yield results from a wet and late harvest that confirmed what we've always believed; that our technology and our germplasm advancements deliver greater value to farmers regardless of the variability in growing conditions. I'll let Rob speak to the specifics from our yield results but these results reinforce my confidence that farmers will see the unmatched value propositions from SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield this year.</p>
          <p>Likewise our progress with corn traits in Latin America is tracking right on plan. With the benefit of larger seed footprints in Brazil and in Argentina than we have in the US, we're seeing corn trait penetration move at an accelerated pace. In fact, in just the second yield of commercial availability, roughly 50% of our branded seed in Brazil is YieldGard Corn Borer. In Argentina, we're now on track to sell more double-stacks, reaching roughly 70% of our portfolio and demonstrating the conversion speed in this technology hungry market.</p>
          <p>And I think one final update for this category is over the last month, we've had conservations with our licensees and other stakeholders around our plans for the transition and stewardship of Roundup Ready 1 soybean technology as it comes off patent in the middle of this decade. We've been planning for this expiration point for a long time and we took the initiative to clearly express our intentions given growing confusion in the industry. We recognize our leadership role in establishing a protocol for handling product transitions since our Roundup Ready technology is the first broadly used biotech event to approach patent expiration.</p>
          <p>So in a year where the topic of competition and agriculture promises to remain a part of regular industry conversation, we remain focused on delivering the grower innovation, and we have clearly expressed our path in three brief points. Number one for Roundup Ready 1 soybeans, our original soybean product will remain available through and beyond Monsanto's US patent term which expires in 2014. Global regulatory support for this product will be maintained for at least three years beyond that point. We also announced that seed company licensees would be extended through the patent period to avoid any confusion regarding seed supply from multiple sources.</p>
          <p>Secondly for Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, Monsanto's commitment to higher yielding next generation soy product remains clear with an incredible 2010 seed class already emerging, and this will be broadly licensed throughout the seed industry as is our standard practice. This new product platform in soybeans will be the base for future products such as dicamba tolerants, healthy oils, and our drought-tolerants in soybeans.</p>
          <p>And finally number three, it remains clear that seed companies may choose to sell either or both the original soybean products or the new generation higher yielding soy technologies.</p>
          <p>If I step back and I think about where we are relative to what we expected in November, it all leads me to my final point. 2010 is a really important year. It's the foundation year for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield, and that makes it the foundation year for our operational plans. Given our order book, as Carl has reviewed, I feel very good about the accelerated plans for both products. And since we don't think of fiscal 2010 in isolation but rather in concert with 2011 and 2012, we feel very good about our operational plans through the 2012 timeframe.</p>
          <p>If I bring all this together, let me tell you how I place this quarter into the context of the year and ultimately into the landscape of the progression towards 2012. First of all, these are early days. The year is young in Brazil and Argentina and it hasn't really started yet here in the US. Before the seed goes in the ground, there is still a lot that will happen. That includes the usual annual parlor games of trying to guess the total planted acres and the last minute switch-outs from corn to beans and then back again. But our broad expectations would suggest that corn acres bump up over 2009 levels to about 88 million acres, and soybean acres are probably down a bit to around 75 million acres. We will certainly watch this, but we expect little impact on our trait milestone targets even if acres do shift around some this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we're off to a really good start. This is a year where execution for Monsanto is critical, and I can assure you that that reality isn't lost on us. Our commitments are clear and the organization is focused. If you cut through the noise that cluttered the late harvest, the reality today is that our sales teams are armed with game changers in the form of SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And that alone breeds excitement and energy at all levels in this organization, and it gives me the confidence that we can deliver on our operational plans through 2012.</p>
          <p>Finally, SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield become real case studies in innovation. I've always been very proud here at Monsanto that our science is cutting edge. But as Rob will always tell you, it isn't science for the sake of science. Everything that we do is oriented around creating commercial value that's tangible to our customer, the farmer. As SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield exemplify, when you put the industry's best R&amp;D capability behind things that create real value for farmers, that in turn creates real opportunity for our company and for our shareowners.</p>
          <p>So it's one thing for me to tell you that I've never seen our pipeline broader or deeper. I think it's another thing to hear it from the team that lives it and sees it in the data that emerges every year at this time.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand the call over to Rob for our annual R&amp;D pipeline update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh, good morning and happy New Year to everyone on the line. Over the past few months, we've shared a great deal of data with you on the path to 2012 and how the game changing technologies emerging from our R&amp;D pipeline are the key enablers to that success. I've also shared a sneak peak at our pipeline and our long-term prospects at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina last November. But today is all about progress, and this year is particularly special. And I'm pleased to tell you that for the sixth consecutive year, our biotech pipeline progress is accelerating.</p>
          <p>So let's begin on slide 11, and I'll tell you I am as excited as I've ever been for one of these updates. Simply put, our trait pipeline progress is flat out compelling. And in our sixth year of doing these annual updates, we're still establishing some important firsts that propel this acceleration. Let me highlight the ones that excite me the most.</p>
          <p>The first, 11 projects advanced phases in the pipeline and this is two more than we projected when we previewed this year's pipeline in November at Research Triangle Park. And it's in fact the single largest volume of project progress we've seen since we've been doing these updates. I think even more exciting is that five of the 11 are new projects just being added to our pipeline from discovery, and I think that's a testament to the breadth of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Second, we've had multiple advances in every phase. This is the most balanced advancement class I've seen. We had four projects enter Phase 4, three projects enter Phase 3, and three projects make the leap into Phase 2. And just as importantly, these represent projects from all of our core crops and from platforms ranging from better yield to better weed and bug control, two consumer oriented traits.</p>
          <p>Third, our Phase 4 advancements put us on track for some major commercial firsts. In this class we have our first-ever trait developed for the international market. We're also moving the first two biotech traits for healthier oils onto a commercial track. And with our SmartStax Refuge-in-a-Bag concept, we have an extension of this blockbuster product in Phase 4 before the first SmartStax acre is even planted.</p>
          <p>Finally, while we won't focus specifically on breeding, I'll tell you that our breeding pipeline is really humming. Just last month at the American Seed Trade Conference, the ASTA conference in Chicago, we gave you the final corn breeding results and demonstrated once again our competitive advantage is expanding. Today we have one significant update, and that is our cotton germplasm, where again we've shown our next generation Delta-Pine Land varieties are out-yielding the best that we and the competition have to offer.</p>
          <p>So Hugh said it and I'll reiterate it; our research progress is phenomenal. But what's exciting is not that we have great research, but that we can turn that research into great products for farmers.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, you'll see that this value translates into business opportunity as we launch new products and upgrade our mix. Specifically you'll see the value of our pipeline represents in 2020 farm-gate sales, where we conservatively expect to generate 8 billion from our base biotech germplasm and disease pipeline. What you see is our science meeting agricultural need and helping farmers around the globe improve their profitability.</p>
          <p>So as we dig in to the update on slide 13, you can see how our progress this year maps out on our actual pipeline. A couple of the key points I'd draw your attention to. First, you can see the volume and balance in the phase movement I described in the orange bars. To put it into perspective, in the last two years approximately two-thirds of the projects on this chart have either been added or advanced. Now that's the acceleration that I've described.</p>
          <p>Second, we actively manage our process to make sure that the last dollar invested returns the same as the first. And to be fair, this year we've removed a couple of smaller projects like high-oil soybeans, which while compelling could not compete with a higher value project.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continue to make great progress in our yield and stress collaboration with BASF. However, as we sat down with the BASF team this year, we made the decision to keep all of the yield and stress projects in phase for at least another year of testing before new advancement. As you know, this was one of the wettest years in a decade; and frankly it's hard to test things like drought and yield in a particularly wet year like we saw this year. Now putting it into perspective, more than 75% of our drought tests had more than adequate moisture because of rainfall. And because field testing is an important validation point, and I think this is really important, as the market leader we see an obligation to have robust data backing our performance before we make any product advancement.</p>
          <p>So while we did not officially advance any yield and stress projects during 2009, we clearly added to our data set and expanded our pool of candidates, which you can see on slide 14. The twofold increase of candidate genes compared to just three years ago fuels our joint pipeline with second generation product, and I'd highlight couple of developments here. First in the early phase projects like our nitrogen utilization corn and our higher yielding corn, the biggest advantage of the BASF collaboration is the identification of leads that will populate the successive generation of products in each family. In both cases, we identified and tested a significant wave of new leads this year that we'll be evaluating in 2010 in the field. In fact, we have more leads in our yield and stress pipeline now than ever before.</p>
          <p>Second, our most advanced projects, drought-tolerant corn and higher-yielding soybeans, made some important strides in their first year and the advanced phases. Because these will be the first yield and stress projects we'll commercialize, it's worth sharing with you those updates. So on slide 15, you can see the 2009 results for our drought-tolerant corn. As our lead project in this family, this product is focused on improving yields under periods of water stress for low moisture markets such as the Western Corn Belt. Ultimately, this also builds the platform as we extend the drought family into water replacement and insurance opportunities across the Cotton Belt. So relative to the commercial track, Drought 1 is in Phase 4 and we have now completed 12 regulatory submissions this year.</p>
          <p>From a performance standpoint, despite the excess moisture of 2009, our lead product performed well in stress plots as we expanded trialing into our elite germplasm. So we continue to validate the very best gene by hybrid combinations and are pleased with the continued strong results we've seen in our drought testing.</p>
          <p>Likewise, I think the higher yielding soybeans on slide 16, what I'm struck by is the consistency in performance we've seen year in and year out. As we enter the era of yield focused products, a step change in performance will translate to a more consistent yield improvement experience on the farm. Higher yielding soybeans, which were advanced to Phase 3 last year, have added 2009 as the fifth consecutive year of strong performance demonstrating an average advantage of approximately four bushels at 95 test locations. This represents the most significant near-term soy yield product, and we plan to combine it in the first soybean triple-stack with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and dicamba-tolerant, offering US growers unprecedented yield and weed control flexibility.</p>
          <p>The opportunity to stack our yield and stress pipeline with our next generation agronomic traits is the perfect transition to the updates in our broader pipeline. So on slide 17, we've highlighted the projects in our pipeline advancement chart that I'll cover today. Now given the breadth of our research and the quality of the data we're generating, there's an awful lot to share, and I'll focus on just a few of the projects that advanced and the ones that I think are particularly interesting from a data perspective for this year.</p>
          <p>So when you talk about momentum and industry leading innovation, I don't think there's a better place to start than with our Refuge-in-a-Bag enhancement to SmartStax. That's shown on slide 18. Now SmartStax on its own is a blockbuster product because of the refuge reduction opportunity. But I'd tell you and I've heard this echoed many times from growers that I believe the Refuge-in-a-Bag benefit might be even more eagerly anticipated by farmers. As Hugh mentioned earlier, we crossed a major milestone for Refuge-in-a-Bag or RIB in just the last few weeks. With our partners at Dow AgroSciences, we made a full regulatory submission to the EPA on a snowy day in December, putting us officially on the commercial track for the industry's only 5% RIB product. And of course, this is now pending EPA approval.</p>
          <p>As you know, farmers love the convenience allowed with the RIB product. And that's exactly why I think our two-step strategy of gaining reduced structured refuge to 5% with SmartStax and then making our RIB submission was so important. Simply put, the best way a RIB concept works for a farmer without hurting his yield is to deploy RIB at a 5% refuge level. In particular in a high insect pressure environment, the benefit of a 5% refuge product over a 10% refuge product I think is going to be obvious, and that's why we think it's the best approach.</p>
          <p>So I'm pleased to tell you that our field testing conducted over the past three years confirmed the benefit as shown on the graph. At the 5% level, farmers see comparable yields to what they would have seen with no refuge, and I think this is a significant breakthrough. Growers are going to be able to experience fence row to fence row planting and that convenience without a yield penalty or the hassle of planting a separate structured refuge.</p>
          <p>So if we move to slide 19, we can see one of our early phase products in corn. Grower choice and continual improvement of efficacy is a core tenet of our portfolio strategy. And I think this is highlighted with our next generation of corn agronomic traits. Here I'm focusing on the advancement in dicamba-tolerant corn, which will be launched as a triple stack with Roundup Ready and glufosinate tolerants. The photos here are really amazing as you see the improved efficacy and broader application windows at more than 2X the normal application rate, giving farmers again expanded choice in weed control and more tools to handle difficult to control or herbicide resistant weeds.</p>
          <p>The grower choice of agronomic controls is also seen in soybeans, and our first biotech project for an international market that has advanced to Phase 4 is shown on slide of 20. Insect-Protected Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans for Brazil will represent our first stacked soy product and a huge step forward for farmers, eliminating two insecticide applications with this broad-acre trait. As with the past several seasons, the higher yielding bug protection generates huge yield gains, including the 11% this year under a year which had pretty medium insect pressure. And that advantage is recognized with the customers in Brazil. Even at this very early pre-commercial stage, we've licensed 95% of the germplasm providers, giving you I think a glimpse of the strong interest in this hit project.</p>
          <p>Our soybean advances don't stop there, as we've added our two value added consumer health platform soybeans, Vistive Gold and SDA [Stearidonic Acid] Omega-3 into Phase 4. Both are important because they represent a glimpse into the next generation of biotech products that can bring direct health benefits to consumers.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, you can see Vistive Gold, which will be the commercial product name for our Vistive III product. This will be our first broad-acre biotech oil improved product. And we're now proving that Vistive Gold can provide food companies with a healthier, more stable soybean oil for frying and baking that contains significantly lower levels of saturated fat and eliminating trans fat. And our food testing is bearing this out. In testing with French fries, Vistive Gold reduces trans fats to zero, and saturated fats are reduced by 48% versus traditional soy oil, delivering a significantly healthier consumer product and providing the food industry with a great tasting, durable product that is food label friendly.</p>
          <p>Again, this is more than just lab work. In November we completed the regulatory submissions to the USDA for Vistive Gold, starting our final run before commercialization where this value-added trait will be stacked with our high yielding Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform.</p>
          <p>One of the surprises of this year's pipeline review is the phase transition of our DGT cotton on slide 22. DGT is short for dicamba and glufosinate-tolerant, and this project advanced to Phase 3 after only one year as a Phase 2 product. DGT cotton has demonstrated excellent performance again in the field in 2009, and we plan to launch it stacked with our leading Roundup Ready Flex product in our lead cotton germplasm. DGT plus Roundup Ready Flex will offer growers the ultimate in efficacy, durability, and flexibility for controlling difficult weed infestations, all with no yield impact.</p>
          <p>So as I round out the biotech pipeline updates, we obviously didn't cover everything that advanced, but I think that's a further indicator to me that the progress we've made this year is so unprecedented that we can't cover all the highlights in this session. And to that end, the head of our biotech team, Steve Padgette, will have a series of further pipeline updates next week that will provide more detail and more color and describe a couple of other research gems that will build on the updates that I've given you this morning. I hope many of you will be able to join him in person either in New York or in Boston or via webcast for those updates.</p>
          <p>So as we wrap up, I know there is no advancement discussion that's complete without an update on the graduating class. So on slides 23 and 24, you can see the final yield data we've published for Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean and SmartStax corn. Now Ted Crosby and I shared this data with you at the ASTA meeting in Chicago in December, so I'm not going to go into great detail. But I think it's really worth reiterating that both products are step changes in the value we offer to farmers and the yield data certainly supports that.</p>
          <p>So for the last update I don't want to lose sight of the fact that our breeding pipeline is just as important to the commercial opportunity. Again, we reviewed our corn germplasm performance with you in December at ASTA. So slide 25 only reinforces to you that again in 2009, our performance lead has extended. The yield advantage that we have coupled with our industry leading dry-down advantage creates the most value on farms and places us clearly in a position to declare that our lead is expanding and our products give farmers the best opportunity to maximize yield and return.</p>
          <p>Now I promised one further update and that's on slide 26. And of course while corn gets a lot of attention, our breeding efforts in cotton are also showing phenomenal results. You'll see that the new varieties we're launching in 2010 are consistently out-yielding the competitors. They're out-yielding the class of 2009 varieties we had in the marketplace this year. And I think perhaps most importantly, they're out-yielding Delta-Pine Land's famous Triple Nickel variety. And so with performance like this and what we've seen in our breeding program, I think we're entering really a new era where cotton growers should be able to see the same steady yield improvement from breeding that has become expected in corn.</p>
          <p>So if you move to slide 27, I can summarize how I think about the pipeline and our opportunity. First, what we've seen over the last decade and a half of biotech is really just scratching the surface of this business opportunity. Our biotech pipeline, our breeding gains, the stacking possibilities with all these traits have the opportunity to revolutionize agriculture once again. Second, the pace of change is accelerating along with the pipeline. New genotyping methods and high throughput sequencing are going to open doors to predictive breeding and new types of biotech gene discoveries. I think we're just at the beginning, on the fringe of understanding that. Third and perhaps most important, all this leads to productivity gains for our farmer customers to meet the ongoing challenges of doubling yields and increasing on-farm profitability.</p>
          <p>I think it should be clear that our pipeline isn't standing still. If you move to slide 28, we are advancing and launching solutions for the farm in a record pace and truly reducing research to practice across a broad spectrum of crops. 2009 was a phenomenal year with two blockbuster products set to launch and a record 11 biotech advancements. But as I've said many times, we're really just scratching the surface of the potential for our science and the farmer solutions that it creates.</p>
          <p>So, thanks for your time. We look forward to seeing you with the team next week. With that, I'll turn it over to Bryan for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and happy New Year; first question for Carl on corn seed. Your gross profit there declined nearly $100 million or about $40 million more than the sales decline, so if you could elaborate on the reason for that and comment on to what extent if any you experienced some deferral of sales into the second quarter given the late harvest in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks Kevin. I think if you take a step back and you just do the year-on-year comp for the quarter, the quarter is exactly $1 less than it was last year; $0.90 of that $1 is Roundup. A dime of it is basically corn because it's Latin America. If you take that dime, almost exactly half of it or a nickel is basically a business model change that we implemented in Mexico. Traditionally we ship seed basically in the fourth quarter to third-party warehouses, and then we would basically ship it out to our distributors in the fiscal first quarter. And the business model change we made down there is we now ship directly to distributors in the fourth quarter, so that benefited Q4 '09. And since it's a structural change in the business, that will benefit us again in Q4 in '10. So that's a timing issue but not one to two; it's basically one to four.</p>
          <p>The other nickel is basically just the reduction in acres that we saw in Latin America and Brazil and Argentina. We really like what the mix did down there from a trait standpoint, but we're just off on the acreage down there, and so that's basically where the other nickel went in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen a little bit of shipment movement from one to two because of the late harvest, but that would have been more reflective on beans than it would have been on corn, Kevin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You and Carl, on SmartStax, is the pricing that you put forth back in November, $130 per acre, is that being realized or is there some discounting going on to get the 4 million plus acres launched?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so thanks for your question, it's being realized. I mean it's 4 million acres. It's a pretty small base this year but it's being realized. I think the encouraging thing in SmartStax, and Carl made the point in his opening remarks, I'll maybe ask him to expand on it, we had half of the product placed before we even had the hybrid selections in place. Carl, I don't know if you want to talk about that, just the significance of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So demand is strong, and bear in mind, at 4 million acres, we're targeting the early adopters for the technology. So the pace of orders that we see on SmartStax is very consistent, David, with what our expectations are, so we feel good about the 4 million acres for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question for Rob, with respect to the stress, weather stress issues, does this decision not to advance things given the weather we've been experiencing, does that put you at a risk that we might lose an entire year in bringing those products to market? It sounds like a lot of good things are still going on, but do you need to see a lot of stress and if we don't get it, it's going to postpone those products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's obviously hard to test drought stress and some of the yield traits with the kind of weather. I mentioned on the drought.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could do all the testing we want to in the growth chamber, but we've still got to get it out in the field to identify the commercial lines and fit. Obviously this was a tough year. As I said, 75% of our drought trials had too much rain and too high a moisture for stress. But this was an unusual year. This was probably one of the most unusual agricultural years I've ever seen, so I don't expect that to repeat. And we've also taken actions to further expand our field testing for this year. So I think we'll be in fine shape.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl, there is no segment gross profit guidance in the slides, and you made some comments about things moving around a little bit. So I'm just wondering if you can expand on that, particularly as it relates to corn and soybeans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Vincent. As we look at specifically corn, we were expecting some upside from mix and acres in Latin America, and we lost that with the decline in acres. And basically we've already talked about the potential &#x2013; not the potential but the increase in COGS that we're going to see this year in corn due to the winter nursery costs associated with SmartStax, so it's early. We lost one offset, so we're not willing to say that margins are going to be off on corn because we need to see what's going to play out with the majority of the market. But that is a possibility. But we're off, basically the nickel is 1% of our total gross profit that we're projecting for our Seeds and Genomics segment for the total year, with virtually the entire business to go.</p>
          <p>So our experience has been as these &#x2013; when you have a portfolio like we do, the upside and downsides tend to offset each other, and we might see some potential upside either in corn, veggies, cotton, or beans that could potentially offset any decline that we may see, although we don't know yet that we would see it in corn. So in aggregate while there may be some shift around, we think we'll be fine on margin and mix for the year in aggregate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to understand and paraphrase that, you're basically saying you're missing $0.05 worth of gross profit in corn. Everything else is tracking in line with the previous expectations, and there's the possibility that the corn business itself in the rest of the year would make up that $0.05. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The corn business meaning in and of itself do it, Vincent. And if we don't see it in corn, certainly with the size of the business and the mix in the portfolio, our expectation is it would be made up elsewhere.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's early. It ties to the earlier question on how we see pricing in SmartStax. So far so good, but it's still early in the season for competitive price and pressure. Usually you see tumultuous pricing activity as we grind towards the planting season. But I'd say at this stage and with the price sheets that we've set out and the order flow and the progress in the order book, Carl, we're tracking pretty much on line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we feel real good about the pricing we have in the marketplace right now because our order book isn't tracking against what we would expect on the late year.

          <p>Yes, I'm going to say a few words and then ask Carl to comment in a little bit more detail. But I'd say we're tracking pretty much exactly on plan. Our pre-sales in the US, we've been encouraged with the fact that you have seen in pre-sales generic cleansing, so a lot of the old cheap stuff is still flushing through the system, Chris. We set price bands at 10 to $12, and we're tracking right inside that 10 to $12 range. Early days in the Northern Hemisphere but I'm encouraged with what we've seen there. Carl, do you have anything to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think if you think back to what the original strategy was that we laid out last fall, we said we'd get our price right relative to generics, and then we would basically put one-time price incentives in place to restock our position within the distribution channel. And that's exactly what we've seen occur, I mean our customers have bought into the strategy, which despite the fact we're still seeing depressed generic prices because inventory out in soy cleared, with the incentives our distribution system is restocking us with the knowledge of what those generic prices are. So volumes are moving as we would have anticipated given what the plan was. We feel real good about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; Rob, a question on breeding and how it relates to biotech. On slide 12, you outline the revenue opportunity between breeding and biotech by 2020. Germplasm contributes almost as much value as biotech, two questions there. One, in the near term can we expect an acceleration in the number of hybrids that were developed through molecular breeding? And if so, would that lead to an acceleration in your yield gains versus competitors? And just in terms of how you quantify the split between these two, on a product like SmartStax, where a lot of the benefit is coming from improved genetics, does that all show up as a biotech revenue opportunity or are you splitting it with breeding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, thanks for the question and greetings in the New Year. Basically what we're seeing is the acceleration of yield as a result of the mapping and sequencing technologies that we discussed pretty extensively in North Carolina. And basically the value reflects in terms of incremental yield and incremental share both domestically and internationally as a result of the enhanced germplasm performance. So it's not a double count with the trait. It's incremental to that performance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, you haven't had many products come out of molecular breeding, and I think corn was less than 10% last year. Is that....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started our molecular breeding efforts about six or seven years ago, and we're just seeing right now the very first of the molecular breeding based hybrids work their way through the pipeline. That's going to accelerate prolifically here over the next several years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so would you expect your yield gains versus competitors to accelerate as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would expect our overall yield gains to accelerate based on the greatly enhanced predictability of hybrid and variety of selection and the use of all of our automated tools on the breeding side.</p>

          <p>Question on double-stack and triple-stack, first on double stacks, how many acres of VT Double Stack PRO with refuge reduction do you expect, and the same question for triples?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the double, P.J., it was really a test market for us this year. It was a probe or live market research. So we had the gorgeous opportunity of putting some doubles out there that had refuge reduction. We put them into some of the boundary areas where we had seen share erosion.</p>
          <p>On triple stacks, I think we were in the region of about 30 or 31 million acres in this season, so it's a lot more substantial. And as Carl mentioned in his comments, order book is tracking well. It's tracking particularly well at the end of a wet season. I think the VT Triple PRO story has been extremely positive and very strong feedback. Doubles, early days; I'd treat it more as real-time market research and we'll decide how much of that we do next year based on how this season shakes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just as a follow up, specifically has there been any price competition in both spring area that you mentioned which is where you are targeting this double-stack product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's early still. I'd say nothing beyond normal but it's all still a play for. I think here's how I'd frame it, P.J. Versus our price sheet, particularly as we've been placing these new technologies, we're seeing the season play out as planned, but I'd feel a lot better if we got another six or eight weeks under our belt. But I'm encouraged at the early movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick question on Roundup, with all the cost cutting that you had announced with head count reduction and all that, Carl, you didn't see much operating expense reduction. I mean there was 25 million reduction, but it wasn't big. So I was wondering why you aren't seeing more cost reductions come through to the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>It's the pace of basically those reductions hitting against the restructuring, P.J., but when we look at it in aggregate from an SG&amp;A standpoint, we're on plan within the business.</p>

          <p>I know you sometimes are unwilling to dive into regulatory issues, but I want to try it anyway on Refuge-in-a-Bag. Given the December submission and given the normal pace of regulatory approval in the past for similar products, when might farmers see Refuge-in-a-Bag from Monsanto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's always &#x2013; you're right. We're always reluctant to speculate on regulatory timelines because you're dependent on an agency. But maybe I'll ask Rob just to ballpark how he sees RIB coming through.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, so as I said we've just made the submission. Dow and Monsanto made the submissions in the last part of December. Given the typical timing for EPA reviews, my anticipation is we have a decent shot at 2012 for Refuge-in-a-Bag, but it all depends on the regulatory review process and the EPA timing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey Hugh, a couple years ago, you made the statement that we're just now seeing the tip of the iceberg on research technology developments. And I'm wondering how you see it now. Now that you've got the SmartStax underway and the Roundup Ready 2 Yield, are we seeing more of the iceberg or how do you see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've seen a fragment of the iceberg breaking off and drifting into commercial reality, which is really encouraging. For a company, a technology company to have two blockbuster products out there and launch in the same year is a big deal. So I'm very pleased with the graduating class. I think the best is still ahead of us in terms of yield improvement. I'll maybe ask Rob to say a few words on how he sees the iceberg now that we've got the first two graduates out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're &#x2013; Peter, good morning. We're seeing more than the tip of iceberg, but I think the other thing is the iceberg is getting a lot bigger because the power of our breeding engine with all of the markers and moving to sequence based breeding is going to really drive the acceleration and yield in breeding even farther faster than we can do with markers.</p>
          <p>On the biotech side with the collaborations and the deals and the partnerships, we're looking up more genes than ever before. I mentioned in the call that we now as a result of the BASF collaboration are testing more yield and stress genes than we ever have. And I think to the point that we covered a little bit in November, SmartStax is barely out the door when we're looking at the next rendition of Refuge-in-a-Bag. And I laid out really another whole series of next generation bug and weed control products in corn, so I think we're still very much at the beginning of this technology cycle from both a breeding and a biotech perspective, and that's what I think makes it such an exciting time for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I had a follow-on on a different subject. Looking at China, they appear to have a super egg macroeconomic story, but they also have high barriers to entry for Monsanto, other multinationals. I'm wondering is there any room for collaboration with Chinese companies like Origin Agritech? These guys seem to be the leader in seeds and traits in China, and I'm wondering if there's any room for you guys to do things together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't looked at them specifically. We've formed partnerships with other Chinese companies. We've just announced an investment in a major R&amp;D facility in China in the last month. And I think the encouraging thing that we see &#x2013; it will take time but the encouraging thing is in the run-up to the winter break is China green-lighting biotech plantings. And I think strategically that makes a big difference on how the country sets up for the future and how they secure food production domestically, Peter. So I think it's going to be about partnerships. I don't know Origin, but we've built partnerships with a number of companies over there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>We just opened this fall a very sophisticated R&amp;D lab outside of Beijing and put in place partnerships and relationships with many of the Chinese research institutions.

          <p>Hi, good morning Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two real quick questions. First, I was trying to reconcile what happened down in South America. I understand acreage was down maybe 15% in corn, but the penetration for biotech went up dramatically. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how big that business is in the prior quarter here because I would have thought maybe you'd fared a bit better with that penetration lift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, this is Bryan. If you take a step back and you think about the acreages there, your leading one there is Brazil, and that's where you've made some significant advancements in a first generation trait. But if you look at where we're really highly penetrated in the double in Argentina, that's actually pretty small acreage. And you see both reductions in Brazil and Argentina in each of those planted areas, and that probably offsets some of the upside that you would have seen from the trait penetration in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Carl, should we read any tea leaves from the balance sheet, the deferred revenue line because I noticed it was down about 40% year over year. Is that a leading indicator of any sort or why would that be so different relative to say November '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest driver of that is change in timing on prepay, Bob, from a cash standpoint. That's what you're looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, terrific. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, so let me thank you. This was generally an extended call because of the pipeline update. So let me thank you for your patience and again wish you on your families a happy New Year as we enter 2010.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, some things have changed since we met in our biennial Investor day, and a whole bunch of things have not. So against that backdrop, let me sum up how I'm thinking about the early days of our 2010 fiscal year and then the three-year progression and the run-up to 2012. As I mentioned earlier, it's about execution, and there is work ahead of us. It's early days, but I feel very good about where we are given that position with the order book in the US. The operational plan is strong and our progress against the early milestones that really matter, whether that's Roundup or SmartStax or Roundup Ready 2 Yield, they give me the confidence about turning that plan into a commercial reality.</p>
          <p>So if the path to 2012 is about execution, the road beyond '12 is all about innovation. And I think as Rob has shown again today, that innovation isn't just continuing. But as we commented on, it's actually accelerating. So I think today we've laid out that path and the early milestones that allow you to view our business as we do. The forecast I'm confident in our path through '12 and enthusiastic about our continued longer-term opportunity.</p>
          <p>So with that, I wish you all the very best in 2010 and look forward to catch up with you in the New Year. Thank you.</p>
