        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome everybody here in Frankfurt to SAP's fourth quarter results conference. My name is Stefan Gruber, I'm Head of Investor Relations at SAP. Let me quickly walk you through the agenda for the day. First of all, you will get a quick recap of the 2007 numbers by Henning Kagermann, the CEO of SAP, including detailed analysis of growth opportunities and a mid-term outlook up until 2010; then Werner Brandt, the CFO of SAP, will walk you through the results of 2007 in detail and he will also introduce you to the outlook as well as the changed format to the outlook. And then we have L&#xE9;o Apotheker, Deputy CEO of SAP and President of Customer Solutions and Operations, who will provide more color on the regions and who will discuss our growth opportunities both in the established and the new businesses.</p>
          <p>As usual a couple of technical comments. This conference is being webcast in our Investor Relations website. For those who follow this event on the web, I guess probably that's a majority of today's attendees, please send questions by email to investor@sap.com and we try to take some questions by email later on. For those of you here in the room in Frankfurt, we have roaming microphones, please use one of the roaming microphones later on during the Q&amp;A session, so everybody on the Internet can hear the entire dialog. And all the slides we'll be showing today are available for download on the SAP Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>And finally, that's the standard statement I have to read, it's the safe harbor statement.  Please note that except for certain information, matters discussed in today's conference may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The factors that could affect the company's future financial results are discussed more fully in the company's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to turn it over to Henning Kagermann. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you; and let me just say that it could be that I use product revenue instead of software and software-related revenue because it's quicker sometimes. Okay. So we had a good year 2007 and I want to come to the highlights. Let's start with the guidance. You know that we had the highest growth after the boom year 2000 for product revenue. It was on a constant currency base, 17%, that shows the volume, and therefore, let's say, beyond the range we have given in the guidance.</p>
          <p>From a margin, it's similar. We came up at the high end of the range with 26.7 and you know that, let's say, we have invested into Business ByDesign as indicated on the 20 basis points, currency 30, so you can easily see how strong the underlying business was also from a margin side.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look to the market at every year. Market is measured in U.S. dollars, so I have just translated normally without sophistication our numbers in U.S. dollars. And you see downwards that this corresponds to more than U.S. $10 billion, total more than 14. And therefore, if we compare ourselves to the market with 15% growth in U.S. dollars, it's 24, so clearly outperformance the same as on the total revenue side &#x2013; so like in the last years.</p>
          <p>And I think from that it's obvious that the market share gains are significant for percentage points or organic growth. Yes, we made some smaller acquisitions, but it was roughly one percentage point to our product revenue, and therefore this is not substantial year.  We gained by the way our market share in all regions and we will come to this.</p>
          <p>Now, we have done a few other things I would like to highlight. You know that our target is always to be market leader in those segments we identify as strategic for SAP. We want to do it more through innovation less through consolidation, and I would like to guide you through the four key areas we had identified many years ago known to you. We said in order to double our expressible market, we want to focus in particular on the business process platform, mid-market, business user solution, but not forget the core business.</p>
          <p>So let me start with the core &#x2013; with the business process platform, because it's underlying under the other business as well. This is key for us. We talked about it many years. It's now completed, but more important, we have a huge adoption in the market. You know that a business process platform that is unique in the market, how SAP defines it as three key pillars; one is the integration platform NetWeaver; momentum is huge. We have now 29,000 productive systems. We add 1,000 every month.</p>
          <p>From a software revenue point of view, those revenues we allocate to NetWeaver have reached roughly 1 billion euro. Two-thirds is application-related. It's when we sell the Suite and NetWeavers in the bundle. But a third is already standalone NetWeaver sales, 330 million euro doubling against last year. So you see the momentum.</p>
          <p>Second key pillar is the services. The more services we have, the better -- the more chances that we have that people are consuming these services through composite applications from other applications; you know that was something where we referred to potential revenues in the future. We have now over 2,000 of these services available. Roadmap is completed as announced. We have 150 references, clients that speak about it, so that's in a good shape.</p>
          <p>And very important, the third pillar, composition, is now available as well.  It was a key achievement of last year; that this final package product piece is shipped, so process platform is complete. All our products are transformed with the exception of Business One, but this was never our intention.</p>
          <p>Let's come to the core business, and here it's key that clients are adapting to these platform-based ERP systems. That was a frontrunner, and you know that now the Suite is there. So, therefore, that will be the next one.</p>
          <p>More than 5,000 productive clients adding 500 a month, that's a pretty fast momentum. Behind is this concept of enhancement packages, so not the traditional upgrades any longer.  You know that clients don't like it, costs money, takes time.  Enhancement packages, I have not the quote here, but if you go to Tuscan you know them. Here, they said, the cost implementing them is nothing more than a support package, which is nearly nothing.</p>
          <p>An enhancement package is not small and cheap for you. An enhancement package is something like 100,000 person days; it's a lot of innovation to our client. There is key &#x2013; good growth in some key industries; again, L&#xE9;o will cover that. And for me, most important in last year is the successful launch of the new CRM release in December. So it's now available for our clients and we had extremely good feedback from the press and from the business analysts because it has both &#x2013; there is a lot of functionality in it, but it's extremely simple. And we need both to attract users and to push it more into installed base.</p>
          <p>From mid-market, we have completed the portfolio.  It's a U.S. $45 billion market. We believe with the Suite product we can cover the entire market. It's a lower end with Business One. We added 4,690 new customers in 2007.  At the higher-end SAP business all-in-one, which is now modern on a business process platform that was achieved, we have bundled some CRM. We added 1,700 new customers, so that is in a good shape. And you know that we have, let's say, taken some of our money in '7 and we will take some of our money in '8 for organic growth into a new business &#x2013; in a new business segment, which we will address by SAP Business ByDesign. We believe it's more the low end of the mid-market. It's not only new product, it's an entire new business model.</p>
          <p>We achieved 650 customer engagements. People ask what is an engagement here?  So let me explain. This is everybody who is either in trial or in implementation. All right.</p>
          <p>What about the final segment, business user solutions. Here we have adopted a different strategy. We wanted to be as quick as possible, the number one in this segment as well because it's fast growing. We had the unique opportunity to acquire the leader Business Objects, the leader in business intelligence, the size of U.S. $1.25 billion for product revenue. And now you can see that the combined entity is the instant market leader with 17%. The market data coming from IDC, roughly 15 billion, grows 9 to 12%. And if you look to the three segments, Business Intelligence, that's where the portfolio of Business Objects kicks in. That's more or less their portfolio. They are the leader here.</p>
          <p>Governance, risk and compliance is coming from SAP exclusively. We are the perceived market leader. We have launched this category first to the market. Enterprise performance management is a combination. Both parties have something, and we combine our portfolio here.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look forward, we would first ask ourselves, and you ask what is the potential SAP has; and it's a pretty simple view. We have three dimensions. We can grow. We can attract new customers. That's obvious; we have now 46,000 and 20% of our order entry is coming from new clients who are a significant piece, so we can more or less get a larger piece of this cake.</p>
          <p>Where? Yes, the midmarket, I said it already, 45 billion markets, so it's worth to go there. Great companies where we are very successful; 3.5 billion opportunity, fast growing; and we should not forget the services industries. Now we are transforming into a services society, so they become more &#x2013; they grow more and more, have more users. That is something where SAP will focus as well. We guess it's a U.S. $14 billion market.</p>
          <p>And then we have two dimensions, we can &#x2013; these are &#x2013; let's say, make the cake a little bit bigger and putting something on top or something underneath &#x2013; more users, more functionality. And you see it in our price list; we price per user, we price per engine &#x2013; engine is obvious because if you automate more and more, there are no users. But we bring value to the client and we want money as well; so therefore both.</p>
          <p>From the user side, three segments; Business Intelligence definitely, that's the reason why we did this acquisition. We believe today 15% of employees in the company have access to really Business Intelligence, and it will change in the future, our estimation is in the next five years up to 50, so that 50% of the employees have access to Business Intelligence. We should not forget packaged software is successful, but many, many clients have still custom made software. They program a lot themselves around. That's now getting better for us with this composition environment, with the services, with the tools, so we believe that we will get more and more users in this space as well.</p>
          <p>And then finally, we try to reach users where their natural home is; so some of them are living in the office space from Microsoft, some are living in the office space from Lotus, from IBM; many of them are using a smartphone and using this more and more also to touch Business Intelligence, and there is areas where with the cooperation with Microsoft and IBM on the one hand side and going more into the mobile space, we will, let's say, attract users to drill down to the information giving from SAP. Functionality, the engine price list read something like meters, barrels produced, revenue, all those things.</p>
          <p>There is an ongoing consolidation of the application landscape. We believe in the Top 2000, this is a market of roughly 10 billion. I have already highlighted the space of the new performance optimization solutions, business intelligence. And finally, there is an integration market with integration tools. I have said that SAP NetWeaver is an integration platform. You have seen the standalone 330 million. This is a huge market where we are just a little bit in, but we can get most of this market. So, that brings us to a slightly different view in particular for the financial market. And I think both L&#xE9;o and Werner will use this later as well.</p>
          <p>If you look to SAP, not so much from, let's say, how we strategically put our acts into the different portfolio basket, but you, from the outside, you will see more or less three slices. It's our big piece, the established business, which will continue to be the foundation of our business; highly profitable organic growth, double-digit. We will outperform the market with this segment, and we expect further operating margin expansion, no doubt.</p>
          <p>But we have prepared for the future, and we add two large different segments. One is Business ByDesign. As we said not just a new product, we open an entirely new market organically. So we pay the bill every month for what we are doing here in 2008, 175 to 225 million euro. We will build the infrastructure for the volume business in '08 and '07. It was about having the product volume ready, that's done. And we believe we end up with 1000 customer engagements at the end of '08. And then we'll ramp up the business more and more in terms of top line, but also bottom line so that the revenue potential of 2010 is about 1 billion.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we have the business user solutions, now encapsulated in this new entity, SAP Business Objects. 2008, we will do all the integration, the product road map, everything and then we believe after '08, this entity will grow faster than our established business. It's a faster growing market. And please have in mind, both segments have, by definition, today a by far lower margin. This will move up, and therefore the entire margin should improve significantly.</p>
          <p>The final point, and I think it's important, all the investments we are doing in these two segments, Business ByDesign, business user solutions, have a positive impact on our established business, and I will explain why with two final slides.</p>
          <p>Let's start with Business Objects. If you look, at a first glance you would say now, what they are doing as they get 25,000 &#x2013; 30,000 customers from Business Objects which are non-SAP customers, and what will they do with them. First answer we want to extend this market. We'll continue to sell in the non-SAP markets. Therefore it's a standalone entity. So this is black thing that comes in addition.</p>
          <p>Second, we can now combine both. Now we have best Business Intelligence, we have best business process platform. So we can create a new category of applications which we called closed-loop business performance optimization that you can only do if you have both in place. That will help us to sell into the installed base.</p>
          <p>Midmarket, Business Objects has a lot of partners in the midmarket. They have packages for the midmarket. They have information on-demand, we will just leverage these and bundle it into our offerings.</p>
          <p>Business process platform, they cannot contribute, but we will build a complementary business intelligence platform, which you need to cover the entire space.</p>
          <p>So industry solutions, they have a very strong presence in industries where SAP is not that strong. For example, financial services, telecommunication and retail; we can leverage that. And please don't forget if you have the best Business Intelligence capabilities in-house you can push the suite even forward and come to really operational analytics, embedded analytics in the suite. So there is more than just covering these additional segments.</p>
          <p>And by the way the same is true for Business ByDesign. Last year we were focusing very much on this new, or exclusively, on this new market we want to open for us. Now, where we know it's more about go-to-market, more about the business model, but less about the product, we can extend our view. It was obvious from the beginning that Business ByDesign is a good vehicle for smaller business partners of larger entities to take it and to have interconnectivity network readiness out-of-the-box, because we come more and more to seamless processes across enterprises that's important for the small businesses as well.</p>
          <p>We can extend this. We can now start offering it also for small subsidiaries of large groups, which I think everybody believe we will do at some point in time. And the design is very modular. That's very important, both from the technology side and from the application side. So we can take certain modules, certain pieces, not the entire product, certain pieces and reuse them to bring new innovation extensions to the large enterprises as well. And that means the benefit is obvious for clients as these out-of-the-box integration on a business level lower TCO for us that we can increase share of wallet, but that we have definitely lower R&amp;D investments.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me conclude. We believe these are our three advantages. I always believe we have more, but let's bring it down to three. We are the market leader for all the key segments for large and mid-market, and in particular now for these very important business user applications. We have a very balanced and rich portfolio of opportunities because we are strong in all geographies and all industries which is particularly important in a more volatile economic environment, and we have a natively integrated product portfolio. We have not assembled our product portfolio by buying it piece by piece from the market which we believe in the mid to long term is an important strategic and competitive advantage. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's continue with more detailed financial analysis, and I will jump right away here in the highlights &#x2013; financial highlights for the full year 2007. You see that software and software related service revenue increased by 17% on a constant currency basis, but you also see that we provide double-digit growth since 2004 with regard to software and software related service revenue. This is heavily supported by a strong double-digit increase on the software revenue side, also with 18% here in 2007, and L&#xE9;o will go into more detail in his presentation from a regional perspective and also from a market share gain perspective.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating cash flow, you see that we achieved more than close to 2 billion in operating cash flow, and free cash flow being 1.4 billion. So the difference here is investments in capital expenditure, and we announced beginning of the year that we would achieve 2 billion, that's what we achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating margin, you see that we ended the year with 26.7%, but if you look into more detail here, we would have to add back 30 basis points for the currency and additionally 120 basis points from the investments of accelerated investments in Business ByDesign, so the margin of the underlying established business is above 28%, it's at 28.2%.</p>
          <p>If you look to the group total revenue in detail, you will see, I mentioned before, 17% on the software and software related side at constant currency driven by &#x2013; software revenue growing by 18%, but also support revenue on a constant currency basis increased double digit by 15% and subscription revenue even increased by 46%, in line with our expectations regarding the subscription revenue.</p>
          <p>If you look to the service side, you see we have a growth on constant currency by 4%. This is in line with our expectations. We have limited growth on the consulting side, that's what we want to achieve. We derive the consulting business more from a profitability perspective, and we have a strong increase, also double-digit on the training side, which is a highly profitable business for us.  So here it makes sense to grow double-digit year-over-year. So total revenue increased from a constant currency perspective 13%, and we achieved for the first time the 10 billion euro benchmark.</p>
          <p>If you look to the currency impact, we talked about this from a rate perspective, you see the absolute numbers. If you look to software revenue I think the currency impact was on the top-line 124 million. If you go to software and software related service revenue, it's 260 million and if you look to total revenue it's even more than 360 million, which was the impact from the currency.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating income, it's 129 million and the impact from the margin perspective as I mentioned before was 30 basis points. If you look to the income statement that's one point I would like to highlight, that's the inclusion of income from discontinued operation, net of tax is 14 million that's our TomorrowNow business, where we indicated, by towards the end of last year, that we want to discontinue this, and we're looking to sell this business throughout 2008. And this is in a consequence from U.S. GAAP that we separated from the continuing operations, and put it into a separate line item into our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Some additional supplementary information about the finance income first. You see, we have an increase in interest income here, which has two reasons, number one, we were able to achieve high interest rates by roughly higher by 80 basis points, now being at an average of 4.3%, number one and number two, our average liquidity is a bit lower than last year, roughly 300 million lower, so the average we had in throughout 2006 was roughly 3.1 billion euros.</p>
          <p>Other financial income and gains and losses from investments were impacted in 2006 by an appreciation of our derivatives related to the STAR hedging. This was an amount of roughly 7 million. And the second reason for this swing here from positive 2 to minus 10 is that we had higher write-ons of minority investments in 2007 compared to 2006, and this was at an amount &#x2013; this higher amount of 5 million. But there is no need to worry, the total write-down did not exceed 10 million. I think the exact amount was 9.7 million.</p>
          <p>If you look to the tax rate, we achieved a 32.2%. It seems as if we would have here an increase from a pure U.S. GAAP perspective, that's true. But we have to keep in mind that our effective tax rate of 2006 was impacted positively by non-recurring tax benefit of roughly 85 million, and this represented roughly 3.2 percentage points. This came from settlements of various tax audits throughout the world. And if you add this back, the comparable tax rate would be 33.1%. So, we have a reduction here actually of 110 basis points on apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
          <p>Finally, as an additional information, our acquisition-related charges in 2007, this is 61 billion euros. And if you would strip this out, then you would come to a operating margin of 27.3%. So, this is actually worth the 60 basis points, and we need to refer back to this when we talk about the guidance for 2008 which is based on non-GAAP numbers.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating expense, first of all, from a gross margin perspective, you see that on the product side, our software and software-related service side, we have a margin decrease of 110 basis points, and 50% of this relates to the investments in Business ByDesign. And this would mean that we have a reduction of 60 basis points year-over-year, and this reduction is mainly due to the fact that we have an over-proportional increase in our purchased licenses which is driven by three factors; number one, software, where we sell to our customers software like Adobe, Mercury, RWD, from other software vendors; and number two, database; and number three, what also is included in this software and software related service costs are the &#x2013; is the amortization of acquired IP. When we do acquisitions different into this part of the P&amp;L and, of course, leads to a reduction of the product margin.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look to the professional service, then you see here a reduction of 20 basis points. If you slip out the investment, accelerated investments for Business ByDesign, then we have an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. I think this is going into the right direction, although we have invested heavily in additional head count in &#x2013; mainly in the consulting area, we added more than 1200 consultants throughout 2007 in order to match the demand from the market. And I think this has an impact on the billable utilization in the year when you hire because these new consultants are not productive from day one onwards leading to this picture.</p>
          <p>If you look to the gross margin for product and service as a whole, we see an increase here and this is balanced out by the Business ByDesign investment, and you can recalculate this. This is true that even if you see a reduction on both sides, you see as a whole an increase because the product-related margin has a much higher impact here.</p>
          <p>If you look to the cost from an R&amp;D sales and marketing and G&amp;A perspective, then first of all you see that we stayed flat with regard to R&amp;D expenses to total revenue here being 14.2%. We have to mention that this is impacted by 30 basis points from the accelerated investment in Business ByDesign, so we actually see on an apples-to-apples comparison excluding these investments a reduction of R&amp;D expenses to total sales by 30 basis points. This goes into the right direction.</p>
          <p>If you look to sales and marketing, I think also Business ByDesign's investment into this new product and business model accounted for 40 basis points here, and the remaining part of the increase is related to additional hirings in the sales and marketing arena, roughly 1,260 additions on a worldwide basis, nearly 100% related to sales, not on the marketing side. And if you look to the split, 50% of this relates to the Americas and the remaining 50% of the additions relate to Asia-Pacific and Europe, both 50-50. So in both regions roughly 300 additions.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A stayed flat, although I strongly believe that we have here potential for further improvement. So, in 2007 flat compared to 2006, with the clear ambition to decrease this going forward.</p>
          <p>If you look to the investment now by Business ByDesign, you see that we have invested 125 million in 2007. This is completely in line with our own expectations. And in 2008 what we intend to do is to invest an additional 175 to 225 million into this new product and business model. If you now add both up together you come into a range of 300 to 350 million, if you add both numbers. That's -- or we might see a spillover of spending into the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Remember, beginning of last year we said we would do these investments over eight quarters. We didn't start right in the beginning of the first quarter of 2008.  So if you look to it from an eight-quarter perspective, that it can be that we will have as I said before a bit of investments also in the first quarter of 2009.  But I want to make one thing clear right now here, we will never exceed this 400 million we gave us for -- as a ceiling for these investments.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, you see normal structure, no big changes. The total assets increased by 9% and I would like to go into detail with regard to two or three items here. The first one is our equity ratio, still very strong with 63%. We achieved a further two days reduction in our DSO, which also led to an operating cash flow of nearly two billion here.  As I mentioned before, that's an increase we anticipated for 2007, and you see the capital expenditure here with roughly 400 million.</p>
          <p>If you look to the development of the Group liquidity, you see that we had Group liquidity by the end of last year, so it's 2006 now, of 3.3 billion, we went down to 2.8 billion. And you see, the bridging here. First of all we start of course with the operational cash flow being roughly 2 billion, then capital expenditure 400 million, then acquisition 670 million. This accounts for seven acquisitions we conducted and concluded in 2007 excluding of course Business Objects -- that's a 2008 event -- and this includes OutlookSoft, this includes Wicom and also includes SAP Arabia where we terminated an exclusive partnership and are now in a position to do the business on our own.</p>
          <p>We are the first company &#x2013; software company in Saudi Arabia which is allowed to sell through through an owned legal entity software in this market. And I think this will help us to get more out of this market, and I think L&#xE9;o will come back to this in his presentation. Then the dividend is 565 million, and finally the repurchase of stock share buyback, and I have a summary here for you.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we bought back 6.9 million shares, worth of roughly 250 million, as we indicated beginning of the fourth quarter. We spent now in total 1 billion, and we have 48 million in treasury stock. And this accounts for roughly 3.9% of our outstanding shares. We will continue with share buyback activities right now. We said in our press release that we would at least invest 500 million through 2008 for share buyback activities.</p>
          <p>We have in 2007 canceled shares, 23 million shares if you remember, and that's something we will reconsider when we have bought back more shares. This 48 million shares we have in the treasury stock now roughly matches the number of outstanding options. And if we exceed this, then we will cancel again shares, but that's something we will discuss and need approval of our boards.</p>
          <p>Here is the head count situation, I think we added 4,600 &#x2013; a bit more than 4,600 people to our base on an FTE basis. Thereof, roughly 500 are coming from acquisitions. So, actually we're a bit higher than we guided for &#x2013; you remember we started with 3,500 beginning of the year, then in October we said we would achieve roughly 4,000 employees if you exclude acquisitions. And now we are at 4,100, if you exclude these acquisitions, and here you see the allocation. And from a regional perspective, it is quite balanced with a strong focus on Asia-Pacific, which is our growth region number one if you look to the growth percentages. And here of course, also related to low cost locations, India and China. And you see also here the indication for R&amp;D and support, what we hired in offshore locations.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me come to the outlook. We expect for 2008 non-GAAP software and software-related service revenue to increase by 24 to 27% at constant currency, and non-GAAP refers to the exclusion of a non-recurring deferred support revenue write-down from the acquisition of Business Objects. I think this is normal procedure if you look into our industry. And if you then strip out the SAP business excluding the contribution of Business Objects, we expect to contribute 12 to 14 percentage points to the growth of 24 to 27% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>If you look to the margin side of the house, we also guide here on a non-GAAP basis the non-GAAP operating margin at constant currency. And this includes number one, the non-recurring deferred support revenue write-down from the Business Objects acquisition and excludes acquisition-related charges. And we expect this to be in a range -- the non-GAAP operating margin at constant currency in the range of 27.5 to 28%, and the comparable number for 2007 is 27.3 as I explained before.</p>
          <p>This operating margin includes the impact coming from the accelerated investments in our Business ByDesign model and it is a range for 2008 between 175 and 225 million in 2008. The projection also includes an effective tax rate for 2008 in a range of 31% to 31.5% and this is based on U.S. GAAP income from continuing operations for 2008.</p>
          <p>And if you compare the guidance format here -- the guidance format between 2007 and 2008 -- let me summarize the differences. First of all, we look for non-GAAP measures on the software and software-related service side as a difference to 2007. If you look to the top-line and if you look to the operating margin, you see number one, it is based on constant currency; number two, it is also a non-GAAP operating margin which excludes number one, the non-recurring deferred support revenue write-down, and number two, the acquisition related charges.</p>
          <p>That's all from my side and I want to hand over to L&#xE9;o.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much Werner. Good afternoon. Let me start by taking you through our strong and profitable growth in our established business. In 2007, we delivered outstanding results as you can see with our established business and it remains the foundation for our profitable growth going forward as well. Software and software related services revenues grew 17% at constant currency for Q4 and 2008. And software revenues, pure license, grew 18% at constant currency for Q4 and also for the full year.</p>
          <p>We delivered 16 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth which I think is an outstanding performance in this industry, and it's organic, and even more important is the fact that 2007 marked the fastest growth we have achieved since the boom year of the year 2000. We have therefore achieved the highest share we ever had in terms of market share. We now stand at 28.4%. It's the highest that we have achieved. Our lead over our next biggest competitor is bigger than ever. We have a 12 percentage point lead over them. We are the market leader in every region, I'd like to insist on that, and in almost every industry.</p>
          <p>We continue to see very strong competitive run rates against our competitor. We run at about 80% run rate and just to illustrate that area specifically we announced at the end of Q3 a 100-day program that has an objective to have a 100 Hyperion replacements in the SAP customer base. We overshot that target and we achieved 111 replacements.</p>
          <p>We see a very good mix of new customer wins compared to the base established business and the installed base. We have 21% of our business coming from new customers based on order value and 31% based on number of contracts, which is a very good measure if you take into account the small order value that you get from SME.</p>
          <p>Besides of the above we also laid the foundation in 2007 for additional future profitable growth opportunities, essentially of course the launch of SAP Business ByDesign and all of the work that went into the acquisition of Business Objects.</p>
          <p>In order to give you some color on the various regions, let me start with the Americas, where our product revenue to use the term that saw the &#x2013; in the Americas more than doubled in the last three years and in 2007, we saw yet again double solid digit growth with 17% and 16% respectively quarter and the full year. We have a very healthy mix in the U.S. and in the Americas between a robust large enterprise business and growing volume business, a growing midsize business, and in the U.S. specifically, we continued our solid double-digit growth path with plus 16% in the highly contested, highly competitive market where we continue to win based on a very simple thing &#x2013; we provide more value to our customers.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we have now delivered 21 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. I think that is an unheard of performance in this industry. But I am also very happy to share with you that we have very strong growth in Latin America, in particular driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and in Brazil. Some selected customer wins, so that, just to put some color on this, the U.S. Navy that's a fourth quarter large win, Sara Lee as well, Tyco, Magna Services, Petrobras in Brazil, GCC Cemento in Mexico, Comg&#xE1;s and CTEP in Latin America, just to name a few.</p>
          <p>In EMEA, our home market so to speak, we continue to grow very solidly in double digits with a strong performance across the entire region, with 14% growth in the quarter and in the full year. We have continued very strong demand from the installed base, but we also gained in significant terms new customers, that's very important as we want to expand our footprint in Europe as well.</p>
          <p>We had outstanding performance in Russia, in France, and in Nordic, and just for your information, Russia is now our fourth largest country in terms of software. It's quite important to remember when we talk about global economy and things like that.  We had a great performance here in Germany, where we grew by 7%, which was at the higher end of our own expectations and as Werner has already mentioned, we have now our own operations in the Gulf, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and we have great opportunities there; we already started with some good traction. We have some new key customer wins there, one is Saudi Arabia Airlines, and the other one is a partnership with the Egyptian government, which was translated into a license agreement with Egypt Post.</p>
          <p>Some selected customer wins in Russia; we have Informgazinvest, RUSAL; we have in France, Veolia, Printemps, La Poste; added in Nordic, LEGO, Nokia, and Ericsson. In Asia-Pacific we had a very, very strong quarter. We grew by 32% in the quarter, an extraordinary good performance, which therefore results in a full year of 24% growth. We were able to continue the transformation we started in 2006 in Japan, and Japan delivered a very good year; it resulted in a strong 21% growth number; it's driven by our value approach in that market as well. You'll remember we talked about the turnaround and the transformation for Japan for quite some quarters; you can now see it's a solid trend. And very important of course to mention, China and India shine with high double-digit growth rates. In India and in China, we are the strategic platform of choice of large and midsize companies and the ecosystem is helping us to drive the business in these countries. Both of these countries came in with very high double-digit growth; India, by the way, is our fastest growing market worldwide.</p>
          <p>Some selected customer wins in these markets, China Tobacco, China National Chemical, Aluminum Corporation of China, Sharp, Yamaha, Toyota Tsusho, Tata Motors and United India Insurance.</p>
          <p>Maybe a little bit of color now on BRIC, we don't report BRIC as such. When we spoke about Brazil, about Russia, India, and China, maybe a few words about Brazil as well; fast growing markets, one of the industries that we really drive very well in Brazil that helps to support our growth happens to be banking. And as you can see, not every bank necessarily in the world has such a large exposure to subprime.</p>
          <p>We are also the market leader in 20 out of 24 industries. We have a very balanced and a very healthy growth in these industries, including our focused ones. It is in fact our industry focus that helps us to drive our established business forward. And the ones that grew the fastest &#x2013; the industries that grew the fastest in 2007 were oil and gas, consumer goods, and utilities. But, as you know we're also putting lots of emphasis on some focus industries like retail, banking, and public sector, and I will give you some information on those as well. We are by now the global market leader in 20 out of the 24 industries we compete in, and we want to actually widen that footprint.</p>
          <p>The reason why we are successful is pretty simple. We have deep industry expertise; we provide deep mission critical industry functionality. We have very strong customer relationships which are based on the fact that not only our products but our entire go-to-market organization brings with it lots of industry competence.</p>
          <p>If we look at the focused industries, over the years we talked many times about the fact that we wanted to expand in banking. We have achieved that; we actually grew significantly in banking in 2007, high double digits, and we have won a number of very important, very strategic banks, Lloyds TSB, for example, and Nationwide in U.K., M&#xFC;nchener Hypothekenbank here in Germany, Standard Bank in South Africa, just to name a few.</p>
          <p>More or equally importantly than these direct wins, we have established strategic partnerships with four very important banking partners: Mysis, SunGard, Callata&#xFF; &amp; Wouters, and CSC to whom we provide our banking platform so that they can add their own software on these platforms and provide that to their customers. It is important for two reasons, (a). It expands our go-to-market and our footprint in banks, and (2) back to Henning's point early on, it is another way to actually monetize our platform because that is an indirect fashion on how we get more users to our platform in the banking industry.</p>
          <p>Public sector continued to grow double-digit as well and some very important customer wins, the U.S. Navy, I mentioned early on, Egypt Post as well, the Ministry of Finance in Singapore and the Ministry of Finance and Economy in Greece, but we are also very proud of the fact that U.S. Postal went live with our HR system; it's a landmark event. We actually went live with 700,000 employees on that system which is a quite a performance.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, retail, you know, that we have been focusing on retail for now quite sometime and we have achieved yet again double-digit growth in 2007, it is now the third year in a row. In fact, we have doubled our retail revenues even more than doubled over the last few years. We are now the clear market leader in this industry. And some key customer wins here, just to name a few Wal-Mart, it's a some small U.S. retailer; Marks &amp; Spencer a well-known English brand; EDEKA, Best Buy in the U.S.; X5 that's the largest Russian retailer who was in <mark type="inaudible" />, Printemps in France and of course METRO as well .</p>
          <p>If we look at the segments, large enterprise had another very good year. We did really well and we did really well not only in actually booking and getting the license revenues in. We actually closed 11 Global Enterprise Agreements at the end of 2007 which shows that we have a real edge in establishing strategic relationships with key customers. In Q4, we closed an additional three. I can mention two of these three names; its Lockheed Martin in the U.S., and Nestl&#xE9; which means that in 2007 we achieved 6 GEAs and that's the number we wanted to achieve. So, we are exactly in line with our own expectations.</p>
          <p>We maintain a balanced order entry structure. If I look at a percentage of deals above 5 million euro we achieved 24%, last year equivalent number was 21%. While the number of deals below 1 million euros stayed stable at 41% shows that we have a good balance, and if I look at what's happening in SME, we are the clear market leader in this business. Our market share is 36% which is a tremendous achievement. SME is about 30% of order entry on a rolling full quarter basis in 2007. We added 7,400 new customers in the SME space, 6,500 came from the channel. Business All-in-One is now running at about 11,350 customers, that's 18% more than last year, and Business One 17,780 customers to be very precise, that's 37% growth.</p>
          <p>The indirect channel is picking up very nicely. We saw revenue growth over 31% and Henning already mentioned this, SAP Business ByDesign we now have exactly more than 150 customer engagements and we have recruited exactly more than 50 partners to this business.</p>
          <p>Now there is an ongoing debate that we have usually when we talk to you about the whole issue of migration and how do we monetize our established basis. And it's very important maybe to talk about this for a minute or two.</p>
          <p>If you look at the slide, you will realize that today less than 10% of our order entry is generated with pure migration. So you wonder why do we bother, I will explain to you later why there is such a great monetization opportunity every time we actually migrate a customer.</p>
          <p>In fact, I would even go as far as to say that migration isn't, to a fair degree, the foundation of the profitable growth of the installed base, because once we have migrated a customer, the rest comes from up-selling and cross-selling and the expanded usage of the SAP software in that customer and that's where the really sustainable and profitable growth is coming from. It actually, or probably one of our biggest asset, is the large install base that we have and the capability that we have to sell to that base more and more software.</p>
          <p>And if you look at these rather simplified slides and I'll just walk you through it very quickly, I am sure you will understand. If a customer started out in life with SAP with the R/3 product, which was an ERP product, migrates to SAP ERP the first thing that happens is ERP as Henning already mentioned that early on, this service enabled, usually you get more users for an ERP system if it's the modern service one than the old R/3.</p>
          <p>Typically the next step is that customers actually expand more functionality i.e. they migrate from the ERP only usage to the whole business suite. That's per definition more pleasant to us. We drive this by selling additional or specific industry solutions. So it's either an add-on or it's a pull &#x2013; but it's in any case more revenue. Given the fact that we ship the suite and ERP was NetWeaver we can then start to expand the usage of NetWeaver outside of this pure SAP space, be it to integrate non-SAP applications with SAP, or be it to the usage of actual NetWeaver technology components in this whole environment, example, the portal that is revenue again.</p>
          <p>We can then take it a level higher as we also ship with the business suite and ERP in order to enable the services. The Enterprise Services Repository and now that we have created the composition capabilities of NetWeaver. We can now help customers to actually start to compose their own applications. We can start to replace home-made, self-made, self-developed applications as well by the way that is more revenue.</p>
          <p>And last but not least of course the business user solutions that could set on this entire platform. So as you can see very simply what happens by simply migrating a customer from our suite to ERP, we opened up numerous additional revenue opportunities you could might even say that would be worthwhile to give us the migration away for free, but we don't like doing that.</p>
          <p>What are the growth opportunities beyond the established business which has already been addressed by both Henning and by Werner. Of course, ByDesign clearly 2008 is the year where we're going to transform our Business ByDesign approach into a volume capability. We want to create a real volume processes. We are going to rollout into additional countries. Right now we are in Germany, U.K., France, the U.S. and China. We are going to try to go into 15 additional ones in 2008.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to build a partner network. We are trying to attract resellers, and we are trying to attract &#x2013; and usually, these are already existing partners &#x2013; complimentary content providers.</p>
          <p>And Business Objects, of course, I have little to add to what has already been said. It's clear that the combination creates huge opportunities for us, up-selling and cross-selling into the mutual customer base, of course. But I would also like to stress the large SME opportunity that we have here. Business Objects has a great reseller structure. We have one too, and by the way one of the things we have done may be announced in nine packages that those companies will bring to market, three of these lines are dedicated to the respective channels.</p>
          <p>What are we going to do in 2008? To wrap up, while we are well positioned for profitable growth in 2008 again, we will of course continue to drive the growth in the established business. We will benefit from the continued adoption we'll drive that very hard of our ERP 6.0 product for the reason, I just explained early on, also of course NetWeaver.</p>
          <p>CRM 2007 is a fantastic opportunity. It will attract lots of demand which will help to drive the machine as well. So we are very, very optimistic about that. And yes, we will continue to expand the large enterprise business. I know that people believes that there is nothing to be gained anymore in large enterprise, that is completely wrong. We can do up and cross-selling in that installed base. We can do lots of competitive replacements, we have done 800 by now, and there are new names to be won in strategic industries as well; we will go aggressively after those. We can gain them in the established markets and in the emerging markets such as the BRIC countries.</p>
          <p>SME is a huge greenfield opportunity. We are the market leader, that is true, but there is still so much to be gained there and we want to do this in an effective, professional, and profitable ways by pushing the volume business there.</p>
          <p>And last but certainly not least, we will focus of course into achieving a successful and profitable leveraging of the acquisition of Business Objects. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you, L&#xE9;o. We now have time for Q&amp;A. Again, as a reminder for those on the Internet or on the phone, please do send us questions by email to investor@sap.com. We make sure we take a lot of questions from the web. It's almost a standard tradition here for the Frankfurt kind of event that we give the first question to a Frankfurt-based participant. I haven't asked you before, but I am sure you have a question, so I would like to ask you Hanners Lies  (6135) to open-up the discussion.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; good afternoon. Let's start with a more general question, because I think there is the strongest concern of the market regarding SAP is concern about the economy. You have given us a rather detailed guidance, but we would like to hear a little bit what are the assumption of SAP regarding economy and impact of your business and so on, and what else you said &#x2013; so far you have not seen that your customer intend to cut in any way their budgets, but maybe you can give us more the general view of the work you have based on your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's two answers to this, and the first you referred indirectly from all of us, that is the demand is there. At least at the moment, we're living in time today, in all regions. From L&#xE9;o we have heard that in particular Asia is pretty &#x2013; yeah, you can say bullish. If you look to the category where we are working, IT is not IT, you know, it's &#x2013; we are not in IT services, our service business is pretty small. We are not in the IT consumer space. So what we are delivering is fundamental for successful companies to weather the storm is in good and as well as in bad days. And this capability to deliver beneficial solutions in bad days has increased in the last three to four years.</p>
          <p>One of the issues &#x2013; not issues, but one of the challenges we had in 2002 and 2003 was the customer saying we like the products but they are not flexible enough, if something happens in the market, to shift strategy completely. And this was more or less the &#x2013; the reason why we invested from 2003 until more or less today, 2007, to completely change the architecture you've seen this for more vertical application side-by-side to a more horizontal layout structure where we have this platform, which stands for integrity, stability, volume efficiency, this is a machine running and the layer on top which stands for flexibility, innovation etcetera.</p>
          <p>And if you remember three years ago we always said, okay what we will achieve is that somebody, a CEO, whoever, can shift his strategy more or less on the flight.  And I think we are ready on time because our product portfolio is on such a business process platform, composition environment is out, but for my side most important our customers are following us. So what does this help you if you are sitting there was the best possible, let's say next generation applications, but customers still sit on the old stuff. And in our case, and I think this is a big achievement, people are not valuing enough we have moved our installed base significantly if you look to the figures. And therefore we are pretty confident in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the mean time we got a lot of questions already from the web. I would like to take two of them. The first one it's more a product related question coming from Charlie Di Bona, Sanford Bernstein, referring to the new business model. I assume he means SAP Business ByDesign, one of our new businesses. "You indicated the new business model was a work in progress. Can you give us an update, especially regarding the partner strategy and how your incentivize them?"</p>
          <p>And as a second question, I would like to take the question we got from Michael Briest. It's a question to Werner; "can you please elaborate a bit on cost synergies, ideally by line item" &#x2013; I don't know whether we want to go that far, "And do you expect restructuring charges?" And similarly a question to L&#xE9;o, "Can you please elaborate on the Business Objects and SAP sales force alignment, and how to incentivize cross-selling?" And maybe Henning, I think you will probably take the first question on the business model, the question from Charlie Di Bona?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but the second part was partly for L&#xE9;o too. Yes it's indeed work-in-progress, Charlie.  As we indicated, first step in a new business model is a new product. We are a product company, and we are building new business models on new products.  That's key because we had this new business model in mind when we designed the new product, which by the way is one of the reasons why it's called ByDesign. And the new business model was that we are not splitting between the product supplier SAP, and the service suppliers that are implementing etcetera.  But we believe we can only bring TCO significantly down, if we start looking to the entire life cycle from how to discover the opportunity, how to increase sales, which is more in a trial system mode here, how to do implementation, which is done more or less in a hosted mode. So, we are doing the work which might be a consultant on site and later on we do the operation. So, therefore, we have it in our hand to bring TCO down to 10% as we promised; that cannot be done over night. I think that's a big, big task, but if we achieve it, I think it's a big competitive differentiator. So, therefore, we go now for the second phase, and we ramp up the machine, because we know the product is ready for this business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and that gives me a great lead-way to give the answer Charlie on the second part, it is a machine. And because it is a machine, we need all of the moving parts of the machine to really come together, so you can't really isolate partners from the infrastructure from the call centers, from the telesales, from the web environment etcetera, etcetera, or the partners can't really do the job either. But specifically talking about partners the strategy has not changed. We have a mixed model, customers can access and can engage with Business ByDesign via the web, via the phone, via any modern telecommunication device there is. They can come to us via partners, they can come to us via resellers, and in fact they can come to us via our direct sales force as well. So that's moving along well. What we are trying to do is we are trying to respect the economic model of our partners and not get them to engage too early into the ByDesign investment phase, of course there is one. So we ramped them up as we ramp up the rest of the machine, that's why these things take some time, but it is going well. And we have good feedback from the partners.</p>
          <p>And just to continue on the question regarding Business Objects and SAP on the sales side, we have spent elaborate time between the two companies to align our sales models. We actually went almost account by account, have re-planned those, have reallocated the sales forces. You know that Business Objects will be run as a independent unit inside SAP with their own sales force, but what we have done is we have created a mapping of the accounts, engagement models per account have been defined. There are some SAP people who have now joined the BOBJ re-organization to bring some of our sales methodology there as well. So &#x2013; and of course we launched on day one, nine common products with the two sales organizations will sell in parallel as well, so we actually feel very confident that we're hitting the ground running. Werner?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Michael and Mark you had questions related to cost structure, cost synergies, and the hiring in 2008.</p>
          <p>Before I answer these questions, let me spend a minute on explaining what we exclude as acquisition-related charges. I think it's important that you understand that we have a very clear definition what we exclude, and everything else will not be excluded. And the acquisition-related charges will include the amortization of intangibles, and this has two components acquired in the business combination, and acquired in the standalone acquisitions of intellectual property. That's what we always do. We have acquisitions where we simply buy intellectual property, at SAP.  We did in the past and might do it in the future, number one. Number two, we exclude expenses from purchased in-process research and development, so in-process R&amp;D is the second component which will be excluded from the operating income, operating expense base. And finally, its restructuring expenses and these restructuring expenses have to meet the following conditions: number one, incurred in connection with the business combination, that's very important, and secondly, it must qualify under SFAS 146 before we can include it and consider it in our non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>Having said that, coming back to the cost structure, if you look to our cost structure, I think the flexibility we have is at least 10% of our overall operating expenses, that's the first part. The second part is regarding the cost synergies. I think if you look to the combined organization then we have clearly identified synergies on the third-party side especially if you put together our purchasing power as a combined organization that we are then able to reduce the overall purchasing expenses by better leveraging the third-party expenses. On the personnel side that's the second area. Personnel side because we of course will look into the combined organization and see whether we can leverage what we have rather than using what we have in the budget as additional hiring for 2008 and thirdly of course also on the infrastructure side aligned with what we do on the IT on the facility side. If we look to the hiring for 2008, based on what I said before, we anticipate that we will add roughly 4,000 people to the overall base we had in 2007</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I think we'll take another question here in the room in Frankfurt. Mr. Klusmann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to the guidance for 2008, I mean I'm kind of like trying to find out like the 12 to 14% you're guiding is exactly the same number you had for 2007. I guess you're not expecting the same year as in '07 like if you go through your model or your match, like &#x2013; where do you think we'll see the most changes?  I mean will we see more business coming from the existing customer base or will it be more new customer base? Will we see more SME business? I mean pretty much ever since you show us the chart, how much SME is, is round about 30% or no clear acceleration here. Will be more subscription, I mean, where do you think we're going to see more growth in '08 and where will we see less growth in '08?</p>
          <p>And then a second question would be on Business Objects. I mean if I look at your target of 24 to 27 including Business Objects, if I do the math right, that means that you expect for Business Objects standalone a growth between 5 and 15%, which to me seems quite aggressive, I mean considering that there will be some integration problems and probably not everybody is happy in the organization and so on. Maybe if it is something, Werner, maybe you can give us an idea where you see or what do you expect from Business Objects in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, why don't I try to give you first an answer on the growth expectations for 2008.</p>
          <p>The honest answer is probably all of the above. So, we expect good continuous business from our established installed base, which is what I tried to indicate to you early on by showing you all of the up-sell and cross-sell capabilities that sit in our installed base. From a regional perspective, it is pretty obvious that Asia-Pacific, Japan will be the fastest growing region, but if you want the BRIC countries they'll pull their weight in as well, no question about it, but in fact we do expect that all regions will come in at double-digit, also the Americas, also the U.S. for that matter. SME will continue to outgrow. The reason why it stays at 30% by the way, is purely the law of large numbers; you need to sell lots of SME to compensate for one very large transaction in the large enterprise base, but from a volume perspective we will see lots of growth coming from the SME. And from an industry perspective, we will continue to drive both the established industries of course, but we will continue to push hard on the focus industries because that's also good business and that you will see coming to SAP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, might be, I can answer the second one. There are definitely some assumptions in it. The range is a little bit broader than your math, we can might be find out if it's the same. So, at the lower range we &#x2013; in the worse case expected plus five but are seeing a little bit minus. So therefore, the range is broader and is more realistic than you thought. So we &#x2013; we see we have all options of more or less flat up to significant growth. The question is, that is a little bit difficult in this case, how you value it. We will definitely split in ways that we acquire products from Business Objects and that's more or less what we later on will say, is the business coming for Business Objects because that's the acquired business you are after, you want to know what is organic and what's acquired.</p>
          <p>Please have in mind that the Business Objects entity has also some SAP products so there's synergy from combining the products. And what is very difficult to look from outside, is the synergy that's coming from L&#xE9;o's operation. That means if an experienced sales force like that from L&#xE9;o is pushing Business Objects products to the installed base. That's a little bit difficult there. So therefore at the end of the day if the assumption was what can we do with business product &#x2013; with product acquired from Business Objects. That's it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Another question here, Mr. Rode.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm Marc Rode with MainFirst. Maybe two points; one, when you talk about Business ByDesign, you talked about the 150 customer engagements and the 3,000 registrations. Can you give us an idea what your plan is for 2008 with regards to the 3,000 to turn into engagements and potentially even put a number next to it? And coming back to the non-cash charges, mostly I guess non cash with Business Objects, you gave earlier on 190 million for deferred revenue write-downs and in process R&amp;D as one-off indication. And you gave, I think it was 210 to 230, in terms of recurring. Plus then as a third number you talked about synergies in the range, I think it was a minimum expectation 300 to 320. I am not quite sure if all those numbers referred to 2008. And just to clarify, could you give an update on those three items?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Might be I answer the first one, it's pretty simple. We have only given this number not to give you a feeling about how many we want to convert, but that you are seeing that we have started already with the volume processes at the very beginning. I could have said 300 and then you would have said, it's not volume it's the beginning; that was the only indication. I think it's fair now not to speculate about the figures you're asking for. I think we have huge spreadsheets where we have all these machine written down and we will monitor this in future very carefully.  But I guess honestly that we will learn during 2008 what the exact figures are and then we will start to communicate once the machine is running. You should not talk about those things once you build the machine, you should do it if it's running and we will do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding these acquisition related charges, I think I explained in connection with the guidance that the write-down of maintenance would amount to roughly, approximately 180 million, and I hope you understand we have not completed the purchase price accounting. So any kind of infer with regard to the amortization of intangibles in the write-down expenses from purchased in process R&amp;D. And this will be in a range of roughly 210 plus 30 million for Business Objects. According to the business case we have set up; but the actual numbers will then be provided during our Q1 call where we will show you how the PPA at the end of day will result in acquisition related charges, and it's not yet completed. But I do not think that the numbers will differ materially from the one we provided to you. And I think if you look to &#x2013; side of SAP, that we had 60 million in 2007, and I think comparable number for 2008 would be roughly 80 million acquisition related charges for SAP on a standalone basis. So you can calculate this together for your model.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I answered the question with regard to the synergies already. I think what we indicated when we announced the acquisition was a number on an annualized basis and we have embedded all the synergies we think we can realize in 2008 into our guidance and I think I do not need to go into further details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think we can take two questions from the web. The one is from James Dawson, Morgan Stanley referring to your mid-term outlook. Can we expect the business user segment to outperform the growth rate of the established business already in 2008? Probably not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we have just discussed it. If everything goes perfect for business user and not so good for the established one there might be, I don't hope so. Because I would prefer more that we come to the high end of the established, so that one then it will be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe then a clarification question, we got this several analysts, Adam Wood, Ross MacMillan, Neil Steer referring to the constant currency operating margin guidance. I think it would be helpful if we could provide the average U.S. dollar exchange rate that corresponds to this constant currency margin guidance. And I'm not sure whether we can give that, but they ask for, whether we can indicate what the margin guidance would have been if today's foreign exchange rates prevailed throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think let me explain how this works. The exchange rates we use to calculate a constant currency growth rate will be the ones we had in 2006 and average by quarter. So, the average exchange rate by currency in the first quarter is then used to calculate the &#x2013; to translate the revenue and cost on the &#x2013; in the local financial statements, in local currency into euro. So, that's the only rates which are secure now, because we know these rates and I don't have all of them in my mind now, for the first quarter 2006, second, third, and fourth quarter. But what I had agreed with Stefan that we will put these on our webpage, so that you have exactly the exchange rate we used, the average exchange rate we used in the fourth quarter of 2006. So, you can calculate the translation effects out of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you refer to 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have more time for questions in the room. I can see one Elizabeth Buckley, and then Heinz Steffen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Just to clarify once again on the synergies, do you expect revenue synergies in 2008, given the risk of revenue attrition for BOBJ sales into non-SAP platforms?  That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second question comes on NetWeaver.  It looks like the growth rate actually came down a bit in the second half relative to the 50% growth we saw in the first half '07. Could you just talk a bit about what you're seeing there in terms of demand trends?  And also how you see the consolidation that we're seeing among your peers affect your growth potential in 2008?  And any acquisition plans that you may have in the Middleware space?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Might be we can split between us and L&#xE9;o might be &#x2013; is commenting on our competition. I will say something to acquisition and to the other topic. Look, there are good reasons that we have given the guidance in a way we gave it. We can give hundreds of details, but later on we have to fulfill hundreds of components of the guidance. I think we give enough, and there is room for a lot of speculation, what is better and less, but I think the guidance is a good and ambitious guidance and keep it like that.</p>
          <p>From the acquisition point of view, we have a lot of them applied; I think we are determined to make Business Objects acquisition success. So, that's our number one priority in 2008. We will continue with organic growth. We don't believe that we will change in our strategy, but &#x2013; there is always a but &#x2013; as you have seen with Business Objects, there are sometimes opportunities &#x2013; unique opportunities. We are not going for everything, but in this case, we could become the instant market leader immediately in a segment where we have not so much overlap &#x2013; 10% overlap of the product. If such an opportunity is there again, we would consider it, but don't expect me here to speculate about those opportunities. Okay L&#xE9;o.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the competitive situation in the market hasn't really changed that much. We are competing on a daily basis with the same competitors. Nothing really new has happened there. On the contrary, with the consolidation driven by one of the two procurements in a certain sense even simpler. You know in advance against whom you are going to compete. Interestingly enough, I think our competitor is focusing a lot, on what is left of the installed base. I would &#x2013; I can easily understand that after we have managed to convince about 800 of their customers to move to SAP, I would also try to first of all protect my install base and not compete too much on the other stuff.</p>
          <p>Even though it is clear that the vast majority of the new deals that are happening are all competitive, we have a very high win rate; we win about 80% of the deals, and that's a positive thing. We will continue to fine-tune our competitor skills first from a product point of view and then from a go to market point of view to make sure that we can stay competitive. And on the SME side, it's basically the same story; we compete against true global players and a host of local players, and that's growing as you can see reasonably well as well. But of course, you should never say that you have won this kind of a situation; you always want to be better yesterday &#x2013; tomorrow than yesterday.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And NetWeaver is actually growing very strongly, having indicated the number of install &#x2013; of installations that are up and running. We are adding about a 1000 a month; that's a huge number. We compete against other providers of this kind of an environment. We have our particular strengths, and I do not expect &#x2013; actually no one expects that a given customer will always have only one platform &#x2013; why should they? And therefore, this market has lots of potential in it, and we'll continue to compete very successfully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the next question is from Heinz Steffen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Are you presently satisfied with last year's performance of Business Objects? I mean, in respect to EBIT margin? And in respect to your guidance for 2008, how much of the total EBIT margin can be contributed by Business Objects? I mean, what type of business &#x2013; of EBIT margin you have recommended to Business Objects?  That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, can you explain the Nestl&#xE9; deal? If I remember correctly Nestl&#xE9; already bought in the past all the latest and the upcoming product, and I'm not quite sure whether this was in euro or their market was around 120 million. So why should Nestl&#xE9; now buy again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we answer the second question first, because that is actually a perfect illustration of our model. So, you are absolutely right, Nestl&#xE9; did buy everything SAP had to offer in the year 2000; it went so well that we actually reached the limit of that contract sooner than expected. So not only will they renew that relationship, they want actually to expand it. There was a expiration date to that contract. We have now a new extension of that so that all new &#x2013; new things that we will develop will flow into this contract as well. And the footprint has been widened so that you have engines, more users, and it's a classical illustration of the type of business model I tried to illustrate early on. And once you are in, and you start to replace, you just keep on widening the relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Might be, if I comment in addition, you see how important it is that we have declared some years ago, we want to have 50% of our revenue from new products. If you can't show such a flow of innovation, I don't think it would be &#x2013; then it's tougher then L&#xE9;o to sign such a deal, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, a little bit explanation why we do what we are doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and with regard to the margin, first of all the results of Business Objects which were published yesterday show very strong top line growth, total revenue 20%, on the product side it's 18%. If you look to the margin on a adjusted non-GAAP basis, it's 17%. It's of course lower than SAP's margin, but I think that's one of the advantages we have now as a combined organization to really look for these cost synergies, implement them, and then increasing the margin of this business unit, that's exactly what we intend to do.</p>

          <p>No, that's what &#x2013; that's not what we want to disclose, I think we have one margin for the entire company, it's the same as on the top line, and I hope you understand that we put everything together, all the different parts of our business, the established business, Business ByDesign, and then Business Objects, business user organization and then come up this one guidance from a top line perspective and from a margin perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I am looking to my watch, we have been discussing for almost 90 minutes, I think we can take two final questions. I will take the one from Ross MacMillan here on &#x2013; by email, and I saw earlier question from Knut Woller . May we start with Ross MacMillan, Jefferies first, he &#x2013; it was a clarification on the investments on &#x2013; the incremental investments on Business ByDesign and Werner you referred to the potential spillover in 2009; how should we think about maybe additional incremental investments in Business ByDesign beyond 2008? And maybe it's just a clarification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we disregard the potential spillover into 2009, there will not be any incremental investments in Business ByDesign beyond 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; greatly answered. Thank you. And now we have one final question from Knut Woller, UniCredit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Knut Woller from UniCredit. Thanks. Just regarding your hiring &#x2013; looking at your hiring, it seems that R&amp;D has peaked because it was down year-over-year. So, should we expect R&amp;D spending as a percentage of revenues to come down to the 12% that we have seen &#x2013; it always 12 to 14%, and yes, in which timeframe?</p>
          <p>And second, regarding sales and marketing, that was significantly up in '07 and so I just want to understand regarding your SSR guidance, some 12 to 14% unchanged compared to the start last year. Is that a bit cautious, or where do I get the math if I look at your sales and marketing hiring significantly increased for '08? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will answer the R&amp;D question. Yes, we have promised several times that R&amp;D will peak &#x2013; wasn't sure if it would peak in '07 or early in '06. You have seen now its flat in '07 compared to '06 and it will definitely go down in '08. It's too early to give an exact prognosis how fast. That depends on many things in a market. But I think it's clear it will go down in '08, and it will go down further in '09 there is no doubt about that. How much we will see. It depends a little bit of the overall business you know, and the opportunities in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe I'll try to answer the second part of the question regarding the guidance and the hiring and sales and marketing. We hired in sales and marketing in 2007 in order to make sure that we were not leaving any part of the portfolio uncovered, in particular when you talk about things such as NetWeaver and some of the technology elements that are in NetWeaver, that investment has paid off, will continue to pay off in 2008 as well. And as you can see, by hiring all of these people we also managed to grow very significantly in some of these new markets where a lot of the hiring did occur.</p>
          <p>The average selling price in these markets is slightly different from other countries, so that we have a slightly different margin mix, but that will level out over time. So, that is the explanation when it comes to the hiring. And when I look at the guidance of 12 to 14% in constant currency for the established business that is an ambitious strong guidance and I'm confident that we can deliver that. We're working very hard with all of the people that we have hired.</p>
