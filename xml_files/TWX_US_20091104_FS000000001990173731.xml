          <p>Hello and welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Candy . Good morning. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing the results for the quarter and the other updating our 2009 business outlook. Before we begin there are two items I need to cover. First, I refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These schedules are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.</p>
          <p>Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements either as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>With that, I turn it over to Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Doug. And hello everybody. As you read this morning we have good news for you today. We're executing very well in spite of the tough environment. We're raising our guidance and we're on track to complete the AOL spin this year. We're making a lot of progress towards our longer term strategic priorities so I'm increasingly confident that we're well-positioned to deliver steady and attractive stockholder returns in 2010 and beyond that.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter results were better than expected in spite of the advertising climate and difficult comparisons in film and networks versus last year's high performance. Adjusted OIBDA in our content group held flat in the quarter and is now up 2% year-to-date. This strong performance was broad-based and coming from HBO, Turner and Warner Brothers.</p>
          <p>As you saw this morning in our business outlook these results gave us the confidence to raise our full year outlook for 2009. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.05. This even includes as much as $100 million or about $0.05 a share in new restructuring charges at Time Inc. that we announced today. I'll tell you more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>For the first time we've also provided an outlook for just our content group, adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.75. That's up around 25% on a reported basis versus last year and it's at least a mid-single-digit increase, if you take out a big legal reserve we had at the end of last year. We provided guidance this way because we're confident that we will complete the AOL spin this year. This separation is an important milestone for both companies. It will enable both AOL and Time Warner to focus even more on our core business, moving each of us towards our ultimate goal of improving our return on capital.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we'll stay focused on increasing returns in two ways. Growing our profits and allocating our capital to the best risk-adjusted returns. To boost profit growth, we're focused on the key operating priorities that I've talked about before. First continue to leverage our scale, our brands to deliver high quality content consistently; second, to keep improving efficiency of our operations. Third, expand internationally. And fourth, continue to drive the development of business models to capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology. We're making progress on each of these objectives every quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our great content. I've talked before about our firm belief that hits are growing in value even as consumption keeps fragmenting. I've also told you that we think it is possible to institutionalize success in a hit-driven business. We do that by capitalizing on a virtuous cycle of scale distribution, brands, and creative and managerial talents. One of the best examples is Warner Brothers, whose consistency and return profile may not be fully appreciated.</p>
          <p>Warner's is having another fantastic year. It's currently ranked number 1 at the box office. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover are two of the four highest-grossing films domestically in 2009. Even recent releases like Where the Wild Things Are, Final Destination and The Informant have all exceeded expectations. And we're very excited about upcoming films, particularly Sherlock Holmes and Clint Eastwood's Invictus, coming out before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, although we're releasing fewer movies this year, we're on track to match or exceed last year's domestic box office gross of almost $1.9 billion. Our TV production business has also had a great year with 12 new shows ordered by the networks and 14 returning shows. That makes us the leading provider of broadcast TV programming this season. Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory are now the top two comedies on the networks' schedules.</p>
          <p>And in the light of the scarcity of comedies, they are two of the most valuable shows on television. These results aren't just good luck. This year will mark the eighth time in the last nine years that our studios have led the domestic box office. We've have the number 1 share of the home video business every one of those nine years, and worldwide we produced eight of the top 15 grossing films ever, while no other studio has produced more than two. And we have more of the top running franchises than anybody.</p>
          <p>In TV, this year will mark the 18th time out of the past 23 years that we've been the top producer of broadcast network programming, and all this without owning a major broadcast network. Sometimes this track record is overlooked because there's a perception that film is inherently a low-return or volatile business. That's certainly not true and hasn't been true for Warner Brothers. I can tell you that Warner Brothers' return is well above its cost of capital, excluding the asset write-up time of the AOL/Time Warner merger.</p>
          <p>Just as important, Warner's level of profit consistently surpasses its peers by far. This year will mark the ninth straight year that it's generated in excess of $1 billion in annual adjusted OIBDA with a very high cash flow conversion ratio. In fact, despite the softness in home video overall this year, Warner's is on pace to record its highest profits ever this year. Based on the unparalleled track record of our studio under Barry Meyer and Alan Horn, we have every expectation that Warner's will continue to lead the industry in the next years coming up.</p>
          <p>The second priority I mentioned is improving the efficiency of our business. As you know, that's been a focus of ours since I took over as CEO last year. Many companies have reduced cost during the downturn, raising questions about how fast expenses will grow as the economy rebounds. We set out to reduce our expenses structurally before the economy faltered. So we intend to keep our fixed cost base down, even when the economy improves.</p>
          <p>We're continually looking for opportunities to make ourselves more efficient. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we expect to incur as much as 100 million in restructuring charges at Time Inc. in the fourth quarter. Last year we undertook a broad-based reorganization of Time Inc. to centralize our domestic magazines into three clusters.</p>
          <p>The restructuring we're announcing today is much more targeted, most of it occurring in our news group. We believe that much of the downturn in magazine ad revenue has been cyclical. Readership is still strong. In the United States, 85% of adults read magazines. That's unchanged over the past decade. In fact, readership in the 18 to 34 demo is actually growing.</p>
          <p>Magazines still offer advertisers unparalleled reach and relevance. Every week more consumers read People than watched the American Idol finale and more people read Sports Illustrated than watch the World Series. At the same time, however, consumers are changing the way they access news, sports and business information.</p>
          <p>They want immediacy but our research shows they also place increasing value on the depth of analysis. So besides reducing costs, there are a number of things we're trying to achieve through this restructuring. We're aiming to increase the consumer utility and at the same time the financial sustainability of some of our key brands.</p>
          <p>For instance, we're reducing the frequency of Fortune magazine while investing more in the quality of each issue and focusing our reporting even more on the largest and most important companies. We'll also promote much greater sharing of editorial and management resources across the news group and that will both improve efficiency and enable a more fluid allocation of resources to the biggest and most topical issues. And as we have done, we'll continue to take a hard look at non-strategic and less profitable types. We expect the restructuring will pay for itself in expense savings starting next year.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to touch on the last priority I listed, developing new business models that capitalize on changes in technology and consumption. I think that one of our most important jobs is to make sure, wherever possible, that new business models are additive and not cannibalistic.</p>
          <p>One example is our support of TV Everywhere, which is progressing really quite rapidly. We have several trials underway with major distributors and several more pending, with commercial launches expected soon. Many other programmers have also signed distribution agreements and many are involved in all of these tests.</p>
          <p>All of us are working with several third parties to develop open authentication systems that could be used by any distributor and by any program. We've already made tremendous progress toward a single sign on for consumers that would enable consumers to move between multiple unaffiliated websites without reregistering, making TV Everywhere a completely seamless user experience.</p>
          <p>An analogous example is the way we're approaching e-readers in the publishing business, where we've also been working hard to help launch these pilot models. We view the emergence of e-readers as a critical opportunity for magazines to migrate their dual revenue stream model to a digital environment.</p>
          <p>There's no question about consumer willingness to buy quality content on their iPod or on their Kindle. With the coming wave of new devices with new features, we think that will only increase.</p>
          <p>On the advertising side, a large screen color device with new functionality, including support for video, would provide an even richer consumer experience and a compelling advertising buy.</p>
          <p>At the top of the call I talked about two ways that we intend to drive returns, profit growth and capital allocation. Before I turn it over to John, I'll remind you of how we think about our capital.</p>
          <p>Our first priority is always to make sure that we've taken advantage of all internal investment opportunities, which usually offer us the best returns. We already do that today, but we still generate significant free cash flow.</p>
          <p>And after that, we look to allocate our excess capacity towards returning capital to shareholders and where appropriate, to acquisitions. As you know, we currently pay a meaningful dividend. We intend to maintain this same dividend after the AOL separation and we would like to grow it over time in line with underlying business trends.</p>
          <p>I also view a steady, consistent stock buyback as an important complement to the dividend. As you saw this morning, since we resumed our buyback in May, we repurchased almost $1 billion worth of stock.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to evaluate potential acquisitions against the three hurdles we discussed before. First, strategic value; second, execution risk; and third, any deal must offer an appropriate risk-adjusted return relative to alternative uses of capital, including buying back our stock.</p>
          <p>At Time Warner we know that capital allocation decisions are just as important as operating performance in driving returns. We take this responsibility very seriously. Our goal is to consistently produce earnings per share growth that exceeds our operating income growth.</p>
          <p>We should, in turn, exceed our revenue growth. That will require both strong operating performance and careful stewardship of the balance sheet. Through this approach, coupled with our ongoing dividend, we're committed to delivering consistent and superior returns to our shareholders over the long term and with that, I'll pass it over to John.</p>

          <p>This is, Doug, actually. It's come to our attention that there are some sound problems on the call. If you can bear with us, we're actually going to try dialing back in. Please stay on the line. We'll be back to you, hopefully, very shortly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jeff. Apparently the sound coming out of the telephone company was fairly garbled and I hope that we're sounding all right to you now. If you would &#x2013; anybody who hears distortion in the line, please email as you did before. We apologize on behalf of the carrier and I won't repeat all my remarks for your benefit and I'll pass it to John Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Good morning everyone. As usual there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my remarks. First slide contains several financial highlights. Coming into the year, we had several goals that we wanted to accomplish in the face of a difficult economic environment. First, to deliver strong relative financial performance by focusing on our operations. Second, to complete the spin of Time Warner Cable and third, to maintain a strong balance sheet while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing returns to shareholders. With only two months to go in the year, we are on track to deliver on or exceed each of these goals. Through the third quarter, our content group's adjusted OIBDA is up 2%, despite an over $500 million drop in advertising revenue.</p>
          <p>As Jeff mentioned, this performance has allowed us to raise our full-year outlook. From a structural standpoint, we're not only completed the separation of Time Warner Cable in March, but we're also on track to spin out AOL by the end of this year. So as you might imagine, it's been a very very busy year.</p>
          <p>And our strong free cash flow generation has left our balance sheet in terrific shape. Our leverage ratio is below two times despite increasing investment in our businesses and providing a higher direct return to shareholders. We're currently on track to return about $2 billion this year through both dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Moving over to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial highlights, just a couple of things to point out here. We knew coming into the third quarter that our year-over-year comparisons were going to be very difficult and while this quarter was our most challenging of the year, results were actually quite a bit better than we had anticipated and we saw upside come from the strong performance of our film slate, an improved advertising environment, and continued focus on costs. Revenues declined 6%, which reflected a 12% decline in advertising. Note that more than half of the total revenue decline was a result of the continued drop in AOL subscription revenue and the negative impact of FX.</p>
          <p>Advertising revenue declines actually improved somewhat sequentially and our content group revenues were down only 3%; that's the smallest decline so far this year. Adjusted OIBDA was down and that was primarily due to continued challenges at AOL and our publishing division, as well as an almost 700 basis point drag related to pension, FX, and restructuring charges. As I mentioned earlier, content group adjusted OIBDA was down 1% for the quarter but up 2% year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding revenue declines and the impact of unfavorable FX and higher pension expenses, consolidated margins were relatively flat compared to last year as we continue to focus on cost management across the company. Our content group's margins were up again in the quarter as a result of margin expansion at each of our film and networks divisions. And lastly on this slide, our adjusted EPS was $0.61 in the quarter and we've now generated $1.51 year-to-date through September.</p>
          <p>Let me move briefly onto each of our divisions and I'll begin at our networks. Advertising revenues were almost flat to the year ago quarter. Domestic entertainment networks posted another quarter of low-single digit growth, but this was more than offset by continued softness at our international networks, including the impact of unfavorable FX and the difficult comparisons at our domestic news operations.</p>
          <p>Please recall that our domestic news ad revenue was up 19% in the third quarter of last year. Subscription revenue growth reflected the consolidation of HBO Latin America and higher affiliate fees at each of Turner and HBO. Unfavorable FX remained a drag in the quarter. The decline in content revenues this quarter was largely a result of lower ancillary sales of HBO's original programming.</p>
          <p>Last year included the sale of the final season of 'The Sopranos' into syndication and this revenue decline was offset in part by the effect of lower-than-anticipated home video returns of roughly $25 million.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond 2009, we are optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will again boost content sales. In addition to higher revenues, adjusted OIBDA of $1.1 billion benefited from lower marketing and news gathering costs and the consolidation of HBO Latin America. As expected, year-over-year margin expansion was more modest this quarter as compared to what we experienced in the first half of the year, and that was a result of higher programming expenses at Turner, which reflected the timing of our original programming launches in the summer. So that was planned for. Other cost declines offset the higher programming expenses, and through the third quarter, our networks adjusted OIBDA is up 11%, with 200 basis points of margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Scatter is pacing very well, with pricing solidly up double-digits above upfront levels right now. However, we expect advertising revenue to decline in the fourth quarter and that will be due to the lower upfront pricing, even more difficult comparisons at our CNN division against last year's U.S. Presidential election, and to a much lesser degree, recent entertainment ratings trends.</p>
          <p>Turning to our film group. As Jeff described, Warner Brothers is having another standout outstanding year. Going into this quarter, we fully expected our films' adjusted OIBDA to be down year-over-year and that's due to at least three things: the first is in games, tough comparisons where we had two highly successful Lego-branded releases last year.</p>
          <p>Second, a continuing softness in the home video environment, and third, the negative impact of FX as Warner brothers is our most international division. However, the film slate performed quite a bit better than what had we expected, resulting in film actually posting a small 1% OIBDA growth rate in the quarter. Expenses also continue to run favorable to a year ago.</p>
          <p>In fact, excluding restructuring charges of $85 million this year and $130 million in 2008, margins have expanded by over 150 basis points year-over-year through the third quarter at our film division. We also continue to expect very strong results in the upcoming fourth quarter as our successful summer films Harry Potter and The Hangover will be released on home video. We also have promising theatrical releases in the quarter, including Sherlock Holmes and Invictus.</p>
          <p>Moving over to publishing, difficult advertising conditions continue at this division, with ad revenues down 22% in the third quarter. That was an improvement, however, versus earlier quarters in the year and we expect that the fourth quarter will show even more improvement. Bookings have been generally improving. In fact, based on current bookings, food, auto and beauty categories are now pacing to show year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter and that is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Subscription trends also continue to improve relative to the first half of this year. About a third of the subscription decline was driven by unfavorable FX, with the rest a result of lower domestic newsstand sales and the lingering impact of lower renewals during the height of the credit crisis. Similar to last quarter, renewal rates have improved from the lower rates experienced at the height of the credit crisis. Management is also continuing to focus on costs here, but the magnitude of the revenue declines pushed margins lower in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see additional improvements in the pace of revenue declines due to easier comparisons and improving business fundamentals. Fourth quarter results will also reflect a charge of up to $100 million and that's tied to the restructuring initiatives that Jeff described a little earlier.</p>
          <p>Moving over to AOL, we saw only a slight improvement in advertising trends in the quarter, down 18%. That compares to a 20% decline in the first quarter and a 21% decrease in the second quarter. Looking at the components, AOL Media, which includes both display and paid search remained soft. Display declined less than the overall category with domestic advertising showing a sequential improvement relative to the second quarter. We continue to see declines however in paid search revenues from Google, which fell 24%. As has been the case in recent quarters, the decrease is primarily due to lower query volume and lower click through rates on the AOL client. Additionally, cost per click at certain properties continued to be adversely affected by algorithmic changes made by Google. The biggest sequential improvement came from our third-party network, where year-over-year revenue declines improved substantially relative to the second quarter of this year and that was due to higher demand from brand advertisers.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the rest of AOL's results. Subscription revenues continued to decline as AOL lost 438,000 subscribers in the third quarter. That's the lowest quarterly subscriber loss since the start of the transition to a free service back in 2006.</p>
          <p>Margins declined both year-over-year and sequentially as continued cost declines were not sufficient to offset revenue declines. AOL is currently weighing some additional restructuring plans, but pending those steps, it will be challenging to materially reduce its fixed-cost base much further. Even with meaningful additional restructurings, however, we expect AOL will face margin and earnings pressure for some time in light of projected declines in high-margin subscription and search revenue. Year-to-date, AOL has incurred $83 million of restructuring costs and that includes $10 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The next slide, which I'll just touch on briefly, shows our corporate expenses, which were essentially flat year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our business outlook. As both Jeff and I previously mentioned this morning, we raised our 2009 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $2.05 and as Jeff described our new outlook now takes into account anticipated restructuring charges of up to $100 million in publishing.</p>
          <p>We're also providing a full-year outlook for the content group and because of our expectation that AOL will be spun off before the end of the year, and if we meet that goal AOL will be reflected as a discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements following the spin-off and will no longer be reflected in our adjusted EPS figures.</p>
          <p>We expect content group adjusted EPS to be at least $1.75. That also includes the fourth quarter charge and that's off a base of $1.42 last year. So that's up around 25% or at least mid-single digits when you exclude 2008's legal reserve.</p>
          <p>This outlook obviously implies a significant increase in fourth quarter adjusted EPS relative to a year-ago, but please recall that last year's fourth quarter, it includes both the $271 million legal reserve, as well as $160 million of restructuring charges at publishing.</p>
          <p>Moving on to free cash flow on the next slide, which highlights the detail, our cash generation remains quite strong and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow this quarter now above $3 billion year-to-date. Through the third quarter our conversion ratio was over 60%. As expected, this is lower than last year's third quarter as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations in working capital.</p>
          <p>Our cash taxes have increased due to the reduction in our NOLs and recall that our working capital benefited last year in part due to the writers' strike. You can also see from the slide that we're pacing favorable on CapEx and product development and we expect those trends to continue throughout the end of the year as well.</p>
          <p>The next slide looks at our net debt. We ended the third quarter with $10.4 billion in net debt and that's about flat with the second quarter. That's because our free cash flow that I just discussed a little earlier was offset by our ongoing dividend, our share repurchase program and the repurchase of Google's 5% stake in AOL. And as I noted earlier, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet while both fully investing in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders. Our strong free cash flow through September has allowed us to accomplish each of these goals.</p>
          <p>We've invested more in our businesses this year than last year and as of today we have returned around $1.6 billion to shareholders this year. This includes both the dividend and nearly $1 billion in share repurchases. We ended the quarter with about $7 billion of cash on hand. However, as I've discussed before, we don't intend to operate at these types of cash levels over the longer term and, in fact, we expect cash to decline by at least $2 billion this quarter due to a debt maturity later this month. And I'd also point out that we don't plan to shift debt over to AOL prior to the separation.</p>
          <p>So once we spin AOL, our leverage ratio should be around two times and that's a little closer to our long-term target of about 2.5 times. Leverage will also move probably a little bit higher in the fourth quarter as a result of our continued returns to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. So that concludes my proactive remarks and as always, thanks for listening in and again, apologies for the audio difficulties.</p>
          <p>Let me turn it over to Doug and we'd be happy &#x2013; Jeff and I'd be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Credit Suisse. Good morning. I just have one question on the Turner Cable networks that comes in two parts. I think it was John, you mentioned that some of the entertainment ratings are a little soft. So maybe, Jeff, could you talk a little bit about what the plans are to address the issues and maybe what the issues are specifically. And then the second part is, you indicated that scatter pricing is up double-digits versus the upfront. Could you just share with us what scatter pricing is doing on a year-over-year basis?

          <p>At Turner Entertainment Networks we have seen some rating softness in September and October and we're not happy with it, but let me give you the context for it because both those networks are having a very successful time generally and Turner's having a great year.</p>
          <p>Ratings can vary over short periods of time and we think that September and October were anomalies. We had different &#x2013; basically different programming and it amounts to different comparisons last year in the sense that the programming lineup that was on TBS/TNT had fewer premieres of original episodes in September and October than it had last year. We ended up with three fewer Major League Baseball playoff games in 2009 versus '8.</p>
          <p>We had fewer new series on the key comedy launches at TBS this year and we didn't have at TBS any network premiere movies in October, whereas we had two the prior year. Now there is &#x2013; so those are essentially scheduling that will move around and some will show up in the current month.</p>
          <p>On acquired programming, we're watching that carefully because sometimes it takes a while for new acquired shows to find an audience and some of our newer acquired shows haven't had as much of an out-of-the-gate burst as previous year launches have.</p>
          <p>And in addition, to that, we're making some changes and expect some improvements. TNT, for example, just acquired Southland from Warner Brothers and that is a pretty big statement that TNT can air a critically acclaimed show that broadcast networks' dropping audiences and economic structures can't any longer support. Lopez Tonight, George Lopez, is launching next week on TBS and we think that is going to be quite a big change in late night. And Ray Romano's Men of a Certain Age is premiering in December.</p>
          <p>We are also making some scheduling changes for our acquired series in terms of when they air. And the NBA season is starting strong. The 2009 and '10 NBA season began with its most viewed opening night in the history of the NBA. It was up about 40 to 45% from last night &#x2013; from last year's opening night double-header. So this kind of September/October ratings weakness would have an impact if it was a sustained trend, but we don't think that it is. And whatever effect it will have, I don't think it's likely to be large and it won't be immediate.</p>
          <p>On the question of scatter, I think what you're asking is how is the scatter this year versus the scatter last year. And basically, in the fourth quarter what we're seeing is scatter up mid-single-digits over last year's. In fourth quarter scatter we're seeing up mid-single-digits over last year's upfront and compared to last year's fourth quarter, scatter is stronger. But it's offset a little bit, not much, by the fact that the upfront for everybody was down slightly from last year.</p>
          <p>So scatter on scatter year to year is up somewhat. Scatter versus upfront is up solidly as you heard from the peers that reported in the last few days versus basically up in the double-digits. So it is true that business is booking a little closer to air than usual. So visibility's limited, but we're seeing basically upward pressure.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I just want to clarify one thing, because I might have confused myself, but in terms of characterizing up versus not up. Scatter versus upfront is up solidly. It was in my remarks, basically strong double-digit and scatter versus scatter is also up.</p>

          <p>Hi, from Morgan Stanley. Good morning, guys. Jeff, I wanted to ask you about the film segment. When you look at the two businesses there, Warner Brothers TV, Warner Brothers Film, how you think about just sort of the secular growth of those two businesses. Obviously, the revenue mix in film is changing a bit as we go through changes in the home video market and on the TV side, international syndication's been a big opportunity. How do you think about putting capital to work in those two somewhat different businesses? Do you think the cost structures in each are appropriate and where are the bigger opportunities between the two, maybe bigger challenges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a big set of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the long-term home video outlook, I think the home entertainment environment is stabilizing and will continue to next year. The retail environment is still challenging. There's a little less shelf space at some of the big retailers are putting to DVDs and home video. But I think we're going to see the pressure on physical sell-through moderate a bit.</p>
          <p>We do expect continued growth in rental electronic sell-through, VOD, and Blu-ray, and we think that the net contribution ratios will increase due to the higher margin digital elements of home video. Staying on film, we've been saying, which we were saying in our remarks, if you could hear mine through the tech difficulties, we've been seeing very strong and consistent performance, partly because of the really long-term advantage that Warner has built in having so many franchises, partly because we have streamlined the slate to fewer releases with big economics tied to them. So on film, we basically are very optimistic about, in our case, unlike every other studio, very consistent performance of film slates year to year and we think that will continue.</p>
          <p>If you go over to television, we've got a production business going very strong despite the challenges in some markets. It really is, if this answers your question, a high-profit business for us and it's lower risk than film to the &#x2013; but you don't want to overproduce into what the envelope of buyers is, which has something to do with broadcast network TV. And we all know that the business has changed a bit, but gradually over the years as the broadcast networks look towards in-house programming, but that has worked out and this is not new, as an advantage for us, because we are the supplier of second choice to all four of the big networks and we increasingly have a buy &#x2013; pressure &#x2013; demand coming from cable networks. Some of them are our own but not only our own.</p>
          <p>If you go to your &#x2013; I think you asked a little bit about syndication and overseas. We've got a pretty healthy market for our network series production overseas. And on the syndication business, we're fairly happy with what we've been able to do to the extent that syndication, if it's true, it's not clear what will happen. If it goes vertical to in-house supplies, we've got a pretty good position and it's not a huge part of our revenue business. So all in all, I would give you a summary on television that says we think we can continue to grow it and continue to produce fairly consistent earnings and cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the risk of making a longer answer slightly longer, I do want to just add on from a capital deployment standpoint. We do think a lot about the absolute level of capital that we are committing to this business. And we feel like we are at or about the right range at this moment in time with the right split between theatrical and TV and we're going to continue to focus on improving the returns in the studio business, and it's going to not only come from top line growth, but by also managing the operational efficiency of the business. So let me just give you one example.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons why Warner is having such a great year this year against the backdrop of a tough home entertainment environment is because they've done a phenomenal job this year of cutting out costs in our home entertainment division. And if you just think about the initiatives that they've undertaken, they have cut SG&amp;A double digit percentage over a year ago level. They've cut marketing and improved the efficiency of marketing spend by even more as a percentage of total spend and I don't feel like it's really impacted their sell-through units. And they've taken a much more stringent approach to their shipment of goods, which has resulted in lower returns, which you've seen us make some slight adjustments to our returns reserve, all of which is a reflection of improved profitability against the business and we get &#x2013; we got to continue to take that approach.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sanford Bernstein. I have one for John and Jeff, you guys could choose it. What I'm trying to figure out is kind of the core expense growth rates for your domestic Turner Networks and domestic HBO, first two quarters of the year. What has been the core growth rates, let say for Turner and HBO separately, first two quarters of the year? And what is the sustainable rate into the future on an expense basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could take a crack at it and Jeff can fill in where I missed something. But, you know the one thing, Michael, and I think this has been a consistent message with us all along, which is that, it's always, we would caution against looking at particular quarters and we're really managing the business over annual cycles.</p>
          <p>And so we had really favorable expense trends in the first half of this year and a lot of it was tied to two things. Number one was sports, where we had lower amortization of sports costs this year, versus the year-ago quarter &#x2013; excuse me, versus the year-ago first half of the year and a lot of that fell in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And then we also had a lot of our original and newly acquired programming airing and broadcasting in the third and fourth quarters of this year. So we would see a natural lift in programming costs more on the third and fourth quarter side.</p>
          <p>I think generally speaking, though, if you think about just the way that we're trying to run the networks, and that's true for each of Turner as well as HBO over the longer term, is to try to have expense growth be contained at a percentage that's lower than revenue growth. I think we've been doing that. We're on track to do that again this year. We expect margin expansion at each of HBO and Turner and I would continue to expect to that see going forward in 2010 and beyond, although, again, just we can be lumpy or volatile within years, just in particular quarters. So hopefully that helps.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thank you. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. It looks like you recently expanded your cable network footprint in Japan as well as Central Europe. So can you help us think about your international expansion strategy in the cable networks and how large of an investment do you intend to make over the next year or so? Which brands could see the most expansion? Do you intend to develop any new brands and where in the world, what parts of the world are of most interest to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. We have been looking to grow internationally but in a targeted way. We're essentially, in general, focused on either the fast-growing regions, which would be, if you're doing geographic, Latin America, Eastern Europe, India or the fastest growing sectors within even developed economies, which essentially would, because those are slower growing in the long run. Those sectors would essentially be some local production and TV networks.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we've done and let's use CME and HBO's recent activities, we have been buying in our partner shares in HBO, which is No. 1 wherever it operates and it operates across Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia, and we're now in a majority ownership position in all of those. That'd be one.</p>
          <p>Two is we have worldwide launch and distribution of most of our big, recognized networks, CNN, Cartoon, HBO, a little more Turner Classic Movies, less consistently TBS/TNT. And what we've been doing, CME being an example, is in targeted regions buying into those network companies that we think are ones that can be leaders in both broadcasting and multi-channel cable satellite broadband distribution. CME is one of those and we got in a position where we have a pretty good participation in the economics of it now. And we believe we have a fairly good position if we were to acquire a larger stake in it or manage it in a more coordinated fashion with Warner, Turner, HBO and other kinds of channels.</p>
          <p>Last, I would say there's a fairly long established and increasing every year effort at Warner's to do local production of films. We're one of the larger producers, net negative cost plus distribution, of local language films in Europe, South America, and Asia. And we have now started a unit for TV series and format production as well. So that is essentially the current scope of what we're doing international.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for the question. When you think about AOL, obviously John's comments were that they were pretty disappointing in terms of the lack of improvement and you're kind of running out of major cost cuts. And I'm just wondering, you seem very confident in continuing to move forward with the AOL spin. How do you think about the prospects for AOL post-spin given the environment? How should people be thinking about that entity as a separate entity given the difficulties the business is clearly having? And then two, just a quick follow up on the whole concept of franchises. You've got this Sherlock Holmes, just curious what your long-term rights to Sherlock Holmes are if that is successful. I think you've got Happy Feet II coming in 2011, and do you have all rights to follow-ups to The Hobbit if that works in 2011 as well? Just would love to get some color on kind of upcoming franchises that you might have. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rich. On the franchise question, I think we have all those. There's some complexities with The Hobbit in terms of who's got what. We have about half of it at this point but everything else we have.</p>
          <p>On your AOL question, basically AOL has lot of scale and they've got some very successful consumer products inside the AOL experience. They've &#x2013; essentially the new management has identified several opportunities where AOL has competitive advantages and they're going to do a road show in the next couple of weeks which I think will provide everybody a lot more insight than I should give on this call.</p>
          <p>Essentially they're focusing on core strengths in web content, communications and ad monetization and the key areas are to expand their content properties, some of which really do have lead position against all the competitors. To pursue local content initiatives and mapping opportunities, they've got some fairly lead share communication offerings that they want to enhance. And as you know, they have a very strong and leading third-party network for ad sales, which admittedly there are a lot of competitors in that now, but that is a significant platform on which to build.</p>
          <p>So if you take that and add to it the cash flow from the subscription business and some of the fairly advantaged user habits that the subscribers to AOL have in terms of traffic use and monetization, they've got those building blocks on which to compete in the new company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add, I think the first part of your question asked about our commitment to continuing to spin it out now. We remain fully committed to complete the spin because it's our firm view that AOL is going to be better off being on its separate footing as opposed to being part of Time Warner's. So there's nothing as it relates to the state of business that would &#x2013; it would be enhanced by virtue of continuing to remain part of Time Warner. And one of the decisions that we made in terms of our initial balance sheet capital structure of AOL, basically sending it out debt-free, is we want to make sure that AOL is in the best position to succeed and we want it to have more than adequate flexibility as it moves forward to be able to make the decisions that it needs to do it to right-size the cost structure of the business and continue to make the right investments going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I'm with UBS. My question pertains to the relationship between Warner Brothers television and the Turner Networks. Specifically you spoke to moving Southland, which was on NBC over to Turner. The question is, it seems like a logical progression for a show like Southland. Why hasn't it happened more in the past? What will it take for Southland to work? And can we expect more changes like this in the future? Are there some synergies between owning those two entities that can be taken more advantage of going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, first of all, I agree with the idea of the question. I think the premise isn't right. We're the number one company right now and have been for a while at buying and selling programming to ourselves. So it's not why hasn't it worked better? It's why haven't others done it as well as we have? And that's essentially why we've got the number one position in program sales to other people's networks and to our own. We buy about 25% of Turner programming coming from our own company Warner's and Warner's is selling about 25% of our sales out to Turner.</p>
          <p>Similar numbers for HBO. And you can't really be number one as consistently as we are in both the film side at Warner's and the series sales side at Warner's unless you are both selling to everybody that's in the buyers' market, meaning all the other networks, and optimizing your sales to the leading network company, which is us. So I would just urge you because I keep saying it and I hope everybody kind of checks it and realizes that the numbers substantiate it, that you can't have, which is why our competition doesn't have, the kind of consistency and the high level of earnings unless you can do both.</p>
          <p>And so the most recent examples are Mentalist and Southland. Huge hits from Warner's onto the broadcast networks and/or critically acclaimed. There are some very high-profile examples of times like Sopranos when we made a decision to sell the program for a lot of money to another network.</p>
          <p>Not, in other words, having had it on HBO and not sold it to Turner, which we could have. But we frankly thought that Turner could buy more appropriate programming for it and we could sell Sopranos for more money to A&amp;E, which is what we did. So we basically will continue to optimize that. And the good news for us is because we've got the leading basic networks and the leading pay network, we can be the advantaged buyer. And so that when we sell to ourselves, we'll do it and not have any kind of subsidy problems.</p>
          <p>But as the leading seller, we absolutely need to keep alive the other customers, which are the four broadcast networks, some other cable networks, because that's the only way between them and our own networks that we can keep the lead level of sales in both theatrical and TV. Just to finish, because I hope you can tell, I'm a little focused on this point and have been for more than five years, we basically have more franchises than any other company, if you look at films. And part of the reason is the way that we mix internal buying and external buying.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Deutsche Bank. You just actually mentioned, Jeff, the need to keep your broadcast customers alive and it's sort of interesting. It tails into my question. I'm interested in your view as to whether the balance of the negotiating leverage between Turner and HBO and their paid TV distributors is or might be shifting. I ask that because the broadcast TV groups are dramatically expanding their retransmission consent compensation.</p>
          <p>CBS started the process, of course, by asking for cash. But Fox and soon ABC are going to be pushing that up to the $0.75 a sub level. When I ask the cable and satellite companies how they're going to manage through that, they all say they're going to be much tougher on cable network rates, drop networks, pay lower prices, or no price increases. And so I'm wondering as that wave hits the beach, how do you feel about your position with HBO and Turner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel it's getting stronger. So, we think the big must-have big reach networks will gain bargaining leverage in coming years. I think what &#x2013; some of what I think that you're asking, if you're conveying what some of the distributor level companies are saying, I would not agree with, which is that they're essentially &#x2013; and this is good and it's also the direction of public policy in Washington, they are competing with ever more distribution choices. So telcos, cable and satellite, broadband and all of those as they compete need the strong, identifiable brands like CNN, HBO, TNT and so forth.</p>
          <p>So if you have the strong and lead brands in those categories with a lot of reach, you're going to see the leverage go up. If the issue that we're talking about here is whether an attempt long waited for by broadcasters to move to some retrans consent is going to be increasing rather than weakening competition for strong cable networks, I would vote with the cable networks, not the broadcasters. And I would just cite the record-low share for broadcast networks, which is now down into the mid-20s; cable being at its highest level, broadcast now being at its lowest.</p>
          <p>And as you know, the economics of those things, they're basically unable increasingly to finance and schedule compelling programming. So I think we have a very clear view on it. And I would just finish by saying it may be possible for distributors, cable satellites, telco to do some efficiencies in their program buying to weaker networks, but I think what you'll see is a bigger separation between the strong branded networks, which is what we have, and some of the niche weaker ones that were frankly carried in the past by momentum, by their ownership by broadcast companies that were essentially porting retransmission from broadcast over to some associated co-owned cable network and I think that's what happened.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. Barclays Capital. Jeff, I just have one more broader industry question for you if I may. It sounds like there's an increasing concern out there that media measurement isn't keeping up with new technology for viewership of content, both on TV and online. So maybe could you just talk a little bit about what the concerns are in the industry exactly and what the goals are that you have for the new coalition, the SIM coalition that's been formed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the entire network industry simply wants to keep the measurement technology and practice, keep it up with the reality of consumers watching. First of it all, on-demand, so in delay. And secondly, across multiple devices, both of which things are not that easily or well-measured by the old sample-based viewing that Nielsen has done.</p>
          <p>Now Nielsen knows all that and is trying to upgrade and modernize and improve their methods and I think everyone welcomes that. What the industry, the network and show-producing industry wants to see is to have them move forward, which they're trying to do, and to investigate any other methods, including census-based methods that use either set-top boxes or obviously broadband views of video are highly trackable, just like everything on broadband is highly trackable and you can do those things on more of a minute-to-minute interactive and targeted basis.</p>
          <p>So I think it's just a natural effort by the industry as consumption and platforms change to keep the measurement capabilities up to speed with what's happening in all these different methods of distribution.  And it obviously would strike everyone that if you simply had one entity doing that, you're not likely to get as much innovation as if you have several doing it.</p>
