          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Simon Property Group Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cathy, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's call to Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to Simon Property Group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion.</p>
          <p>Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that our call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, February 3, 2012.</p>
          <p>During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website in the Investors section.</p>
          <p>Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We reported FFO of $1.91 per diluted share for the quarter, which represents an increase of 6.1% over FFO in the fourth quarter of 2010. FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.650 higher than the midpoint of our increased guidance range provided in October of 2011 with our third quarter results.</p>
          <p>These results exceeded the first call consensus by $0.01 per share, and we have now met or exceeded expectations for 30 of the past 32 quarters which is an eight-year run. This quarter capped off a great 2011 for SPG. Our FFO growth per share was 14% for the year, expected to be amongst the highest of all the REITs. Our FFO of $6.89 per share was $0.365 higher than the midpoint of our original guidance provided in February of 2011.</p>
          <p>For our malls and outlets, total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $536 per square foot, up 10.7% from $484 as of December 31, 2010. Occupancy was 94.8%, which was 30 basis points higher than the year earlier period and 90 basis points higher than the end of the third quarter. The re-leasing spread for the rolling 12 months was $5.20 per square foot, a positive of 10.5%. Our re-leasing spread continuous to grow at a steady pace as deal quality continues to improve. Resulting &#x2013; the following resulted in our comparable property, net operating income growth of 4.5% for the quarter, which had a positive impact from overage rent and our year comp NOI growth came in at 3.4%.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end, we completed several property transactions. We dissolved our joint venture with the Macerich Company and exchanged our 50% ownership interest in six malls and one community center with them for the ownership interest in five malls and one community center. No cash was exchanged other than customary net working capital adjustments. We disposed of our interest in three properties, Gwinnett Place, Factory Merchants Branson and Crystal River Mall. And these transaction led to a reported gain as disclosed in the financial statements.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, we invested approximately $1.8 billion in acquisition activities with the acquisition of one property and the acquisition of initial ownership interest or increases in ownership interest in 12 properties. For the full year, we disposed of our interest in 10 malls, three outlets, and one community center for a total value of $550 million.</p>
          <p>And during January 2012, we acquired an additional 25% ownership interest in Del Amo Fashion Center, which now increases our ownership interest to 50%. We're extremely excited about the upside potential from this transaction, given the redevelopment opportunities that exist there. And also in January, we sold our 49% interest in GCI, which is our Italian interest &#x2013; investment. As a result of this transaction, we no longer own any interest or any assets in Italy. We received aggregate proceeds of $378 million for our equity interest and we report a gain in the first quarter of 2012 associated with this transaction.</p>
          <p>On development, we opened one new development in the fourth quarter, Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia. It's a 100% leased. Initial sales are very good and we plan on working on Phase II of that development. We also have, as you know, two new outlet projects under construction in Merrimack, New Hampshire and southeast Houston, Texas. Both will open later this year. We currently have 23 renovation and expansion projects under construction in the U.S. with completion dates scheduled for 2012 and 2013, including  which is the major restoration of Opry Mills, which is scheduled to open March 29th of this year. We're very excited about that event; it's been a long, long tough road to get that mall back to where it will be a very productive asset for us.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we spent approximately $400 million in new development, redevelopment, and renovation activities. We have identified 20 new development expansion and renovations where we expect to begin construction in 2012. Three that I want to highlight importantly in our premium outlet projects, first, today in fact or maybe yesterday, depending on how you're thinking about Korea's time zone, but we marked the groundbreaking of a 240,000 square foot outlet center in Busan, in Korea, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2013, will be our third project in Korea. We also will begin construction in April of our 360,000 square foot Phoenix Premium Outlet Center, which will open in the spring of 2013. Additionally, we plan to begin construction of our 360,000 square foot premium outlet in Toronto this spring with our partner Calloway and that will open in summer of 2013.</p>
          <p>We're seeing very good value creation opportunities in these new developments and redevelopment projects and we are anticipating spending $1 billion in 2012 with all the activity that's going on. That estimated rate at this point we anticipate being approximately $1 billion in 2013 and $1 billion in 2014. As always, as construction commences, we'll detail all the costs, returns and timing for these projects in our supplemental reporting package.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the capital markets. As you know in October the fourth quarter, we closed on our new unsecured revolving credit facility; that increased our revolving borrowing capacity to $4.0 billion. This facility can be increased to $5.0 billion during its term and can be extended to October 30, 2016 at our sole option. The base interest rate is LIBOR plus 100 basis points. On November 10th of 2011, we completed a $1.2 billion senior note offering, which resulted in historically low coupon rates and effective yields with an average weighted all-in yield of 3.6% interest for eight years, which we were very pleased to do.</p>
          <p>And let me turn to our dividends. In the fourth quarter, as you know, we increased our &#x2013; in fourth quarter of 2011, we increased the quarterly dividend of our common stock from $0.80 to $0.90. I'm pleased to announce another increase in the dividend today from $0.90 to $0.95. Our quarterly dividend now has increased 18.8% since the third quarter of 2011. This puts us on a trajectory to pay dividends of at least $3.80 per share in 2012.</p>
          <p>This morning we also released guidance for 2012 of $7.20 to $7.30 per share. This guidance includes the near term dilution resulting from our sale of our GCI business, the proceeds of which have been utilized to pay down short term floating rate debt currently until the capital is more permanently redeployed. It also reflects downtime at some of our better assets that are undergoing major redevelopments in 2012, including but not limited to the Fashion Mall at Keystone here in Indianapolis, Southdale Center, Dadeland, Quaker Bridge and Walt Whitman Malls to name a few. And it also reflects the impact of expenses we will incur in connection with the development of our proprietary consumer marketing initiative.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of last year, I recall that my conclusion addressed concerns voiced by some about our ability to grow in light of our size. We generated funds from operation of an aggregate of $2.4 billion in 2011: a record for us and the industry. This represents an increase of nearly $320 million over our 2010 FFO. By comparison, by our standards, we have only researched 15 U.S. REITs that in fact have an FFO greater than $320 million in 2011. We will continue to grow our company and deliver excellent results. Our common stock once again outperformed in 2011, generating a total return to our stockholders' 33.6% as compared to the RMS return of 8.7% and an S&amp;P return of 2.1%. We have now outperformed the RMS for the last 11 consecutive years and have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 10 of the last 11 years as well.</p>
          <p>We're very well positioned for 2012 with a strong portfolio, irreplaceable assets and a very attractive pipeline of new and redevelopment projects. We look forward to another strong year and our focus remains on enhancing long term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>With that, we're ready for any questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well. My first question is maybe for Rick. Just in terms of JC Penney's announcement of their main street concept in the 80 to 100 branded shops that they're thinking of introducing into their department store boxes. Rick, I'm just keen for your thoughts on what you think the overall impact might be on the mall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me just take a step back. We obviously are very excited about anything that will make our properties better and we want all of our tenants to be as good as they can be. And certainly Ron Johnson and his new management team have energized all the constituencies based on the introduction of the strategy and we hope they can implement it.</p>
          <p>As to your specific question, the concept of having the in-store shops is certainly not a new one. And if you walk our mall and walk the existing vendor matrixes of our department stores, you're going to find dozens of retailers that have wholesale presence in the department stores along with very robust inline full price specialty stores in our malls. Just an example: Nike, Sketchers, Coach, Sephora, Bare Escentuals, Kiehl's, Art of Shaving, I could go on and on. So the answer is that we don't think it's going to be a particularly negative impact and we hope it's going to be a lot stronger to enhance the market share of our properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just make it even simpler than that. He's a great retailer. We think it will be great for the mall environment. We look forward to working with Ron who we know well during his &#x2013; both his Target days and his Apple days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And, David, just regarding your Capital Shopping Centre stake, there was some related party transactions announced regarding land in Glasgow and an option on land in Spain. I understand that you're sort of now a passive investor in that REIT, but I'm just keen for your thoughts on those transactions and whether or not that changes the way you view owning the stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a very good question. Needless to say, I think we're in &#x2013; we were disappointed in the Spain transaction. Doesn't &#x2013; I think the company needs to focus on improving the UK shopping center environment and its centers. And even though the transaction is not overly material, I think it's a bad use of management's focus to go ahead and spend time in Spain.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, we all know what's going on in Spain in terms of unemployment retail sales and certainly as a large real estate owner we understand that we want to look at things on the long-term basis. But in my humble opinion, this management team has no business being and pursuing projects outside of its native territory in the UK.</p>
          <p>And it is &#x2013; puts doubt into me the strategy that the company's undertaking. Obviously, I don't have to reiterate how they viewed our offer and whether or not they acted in the best interest to shareholders. At this point, I think we have the better argument in that case and I'm waiting for an explanation as to why and in fact they're pursuing &#x2013; looks to me like just a divergence of focus. Whether or not it'll impact our stake, it's too early to tell, but I am waiting for some kind of explanation from the management team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Michael Bilerman, just one quick question. You talked about cost relating to proprietary customer marketing initiatives. And it sounds like that's all the Simon groupon type stuff that a lot the customer data and technologies of that you've been doing, can you just elaborate a little bit more about sort of what you intend to spend and sort of timing of when things will come to fruition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, the spend &#x2013; we have allocated in our budget a spend that &#x2013; I don't want to get too specific, but there will be an investment that we will spend. We'll have some &#x2013; obviously, we're going to be expensing all of this, so there's no capitalization of it. It's not going to change the materiality of the company. And given the prospects of a successful creation of a product, we think it's worthy of the investment.</p>
          <p>Now, our goal right now, Michael, is to debut this product in the North East for the fourth quarter of this year. And there's not complete certainty that we'll do that just because it is complicated and we want certainly a handful of important retailers to join in our effort, but that's what we're anticipating to be. We would prototype this and debut it and up to five properties in the North East and look to see what kind of adoption or what kind of product acceptance we get and then tweak it from there. But that's the goal. The materiality of it &#x2013; materiality is in the eyes of the beholder. I will just say it's not going to detract overly, it's certainly more than a rounding error, but it's something that we want to invest in connecting with the consumer, understanding the consumer is I think critical to the future of mall ownership. So, this is where we're going to embark. We'll see where it goes from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just focusing on the anchor stores for a moment and maybe just back to sort of Quentin's question on J.C. Penney. As you think about sort of the leaders in the category and I guess you could put Macy's, Nordstrom and certainly the positive news on J.C. Penney. How are you thinking about potential closings over the next couple of years and perhaps capital that might need to be invested as some of the sales or market share erosions for others are declining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Accelerating, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our capital would have been spent and we show you every quarter all the activity we have. This is really an ongoing process. So over the years, we've replaced probably over 60 anchors from all the different consolidations and in virtually every case, the property ends up stronger and we've been able to generate good returns as a result of that process. We don't envision that this time period is going to be any different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're not concerned about the number of closings accelerating in the near-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; frankly, based on all the announcements from Sears that included none of our properties and Ron Johnson in his presentation reiterated his strong belief in malls and the significant opportunity that his stores have in mall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe just switching gears a moment. I mean, David, you mentioned the very strong performance over the last decade and clearly U.S. sales have recovered in more than some &#x2013; since the last downturn and your stock now at an all-time high. How do you think about sort of the best opportunities for growth or new investment over the intermediate term, say the next three years or so? And specifically, you've talked about Brazil, you've talked China and obviously, Europe's been in the card as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, Jay, it's absolutely clear to us that the best thing that we can do and why we added to the executive ranks here is redevelopment in our core business. And the &#x2013; we anticipate again, things can change and I think I am pleased that we got confidence coming out of the economic upheaval sooner than a lot of folks that this year, we're going to spend. I mean, always things take longer than you want and things flop from one year to the next and redevelopment and development.</p>
          <p>But this year, we're budgeting $1 billion, and it looks like we're going to spend $1 billion next year and these are all very high return on investment activity. So, to me, that's the absolute number one priority. We've got two new outlets &#x2013; we've got two outlets that are going to open this year, let's not lose sight of that. We've got the restoration of Opry which has been closed for, I don't know how long but too long, two and half plus years and we're starting construction in two outlets, Phoenix and Toronto in the next 60 days, as just example.</p>
          <p>And then we've got all sorts of expansions on the outlet side and the mall side. So, to me, that's the focus. I think you'll see something from us in Brazil, something from us in China but it won't be a big grand, huge, unique, big investment on either one. But I think you'll see us enter those markets thoughtfully. And we're out of Europe right now and I have &#x2013; at this point, I have no regrets from that decision. So, Europe is a different animal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. You timed it well. Just in terms of the starts on the premium outlet side, can you talk about the pre-leasing at this point and maybe, Rick, just sort of where you are on 2012 lease rolls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the outlet side, Galveston is frankly substantially leased. We expect to open that thing almost 90% with a great collection of tenants and Merrimack is opening in this year and we're frankly almost &#x2013; we're 95% leased there. In terms of our rollovers, we're about halfway through our 12th and with very good momentum in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. I &#x2013; can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dividend? I, for one, was a little surprised that you &#x2013; your Board chose to increase it again having increased it last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, it really boils down to simple calculus which is we are chasing our taxable income and it is likely that we're going to have to chase our taxable income all year. So, we're trying to do it in the most thoughtful way. We did listen to the marketplace about the special dividend. The world was less than excited about it. To me, $0.20 of cash is still $0.20 of cash but we listened and we're looking to chase our taxable income the rest of this year and then in the future. So, I mean it really just boils down to that simple calculus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's reasonable to expect there could be another review subsequently this year?</p>

          <p>We're &#x2013; it &#x2013; I think it's reasonable to assume that every quarter it's going to go under taxable income for any entity, any big company is complicated. And certainly in our case complicated because not only do you have taxable income from just the normal business but you've got acquisitions, sales. Obviously, we're going to get future depreciation from all the investment we're in, et cetera. But the fact of the matter is it's going to have to be under intense scrutiny each quarter from here on out the rest of this year and it's likely we're going to have to chase it a little bit this year and the good news it ain't going down.</p>

So, I think just from a macro point of view, I almost feel a little bit better about kind of what they're trying to do macro there.

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, one final question. I think it was on this call a year ago that you talked about the biggest decision you were going to be looking to make this year, i.e., in 2012 &#x2013; sorry, 2011 &#x2013; would be whether to really tap the capital markets. Now, I know you raised the $1.2 billion of unsecured and you look to your revolver but it didn't really &#x2013; the market didn't really kind of force that decision. How do you look at the world today, particularly in the light of Bernanke suggesting that &#x2013; or telling us that the Fed's going to remain on hold through the end of 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have the ability to be extraordinarily thoughtful and patient there. We have no capital needs really 2012 and 2013, if you look at our balance sheet, other than typical refinancing of mortgages which the market has gotten somewhat better at. And, look, if there is a transaction out there is when we'll factor something like that. But, right now even though the capital markets are attractive, at this point we don't see any reason to warehouse capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Steve. I'd just add one thing to what David said, which is we do, as an ordinary course of business, roll over a lot of secured debt, and we've been very active with extending duration and locking in rates, given the environment that we're in. And, in fact I just happened to look at this, this morning; our weighted average borrowing cost over the course of the last 12 months went down 20 basis points and on $24 billion of debt that's a pretty meaningful move. So, while the headline, large raise of bond proceeds we did just once in 2011, we were doing a lot of knick and knacking that around, rolling over our debt and it did affect the profile of the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just while I got you Steve and I'm sorry to take up so much time; I know there's a lot of other people waiting. But, today is the company where you want to be in terms of leverage? Or, do you consider yourself to be under-levered or whatever metric you want to use to think of your debt-to-equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly a broad question. I will say this, if you look at our coverages today, which are three times, and you look at the stability of the cash flow that was demonstrated during 2008-2009, I think the strength of the balance sheet is pretty evident and the stability of the cash flows have then demonstrated that. Typically, we &#x2013; we're going to naturally de-lever because of the cash flow that we generate absent a transaction. And, as David said, we have the opportunity given a transaction to be very aggressive in the capital markets with the way the financing environment is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I would just say there, I like de-levering, okay? So....</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>...it's not &#x2013; so I have &#x2013; again, we're good at doing deals and making money from doing deals. The spot that we're in right now where we can de-lever, invest in good real estate, is a good spot to be in and I like that position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In the process with Macerich of dissolving the JV, as you came to an agreement on the value of those assets and determining the appropriate split, can you just talk about the range of cap rates that were used to value the malls and what was the median cap rate of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I don't have those numbers right in front of me, but these assets were appraised a while ago and we basically used those appraisals as the basis.</p>
          <p>But it was much more simple than that. The fact is Macerich expressed an interest in unwinding the deal. We said, fine, suggest to us how you would do it. They came back and said, well, you can choose between the two pools of assets &#x2013; the one that they manage and the one that we manage. We looked at the real estate, we looked at the relative values, and we chose the pool that they were managing and it was really since &#x2013; the appraisals were done, I don't know, a year-plus ago when we were &#x2013; we had a discussion about the same kind of topic. At that point, it was just whether or not we wanted to proceed on the basis that they suggested, and we did.</p>
          <p>And, it's as simple as that and it wasn't a &#x2013; we didn't sit there and negotiate values. They gave us an option A and an option B and we chose option A and they were left to decide whether what they offered was good and we were left to decide whether or not what they offered was good for us. And, we're pleased with the outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just with regards to the sale of the GCI portfolio, I'm wondering if you could disclose the cap rate? And, can you talk about your IRR over the life of that investment? So, what was your undepreciated cost basis in GCI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll &#x2013; you'll see the gain in the first quarter. It was an okay deal; it was not a great deal. The cap rate sale based upon 2012 was around a 6.5% cap rate. We learned a lot. It was good experience; Auchan was a good partner. The reason we got out, we were more worried about the macro environment than they were. The redevelopment that was offered was less returns than what we wanted and we had a mutually agreeable way to unwind, very similar to Macerich; that's what happens sometimes. And, the cap rate was 6.5%. It was a highly levered entity. That's why we'll have dilution this year, I think Steve, $0.06, $0.07....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About $0.07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in our numbers. So, had we not sold it, we would have had guidance higher, but we think in the long run it was the right thing to do. It was an okay deal, not a great deal. I don't know what our IRR was, but the gain you'll see in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then just lastly regarding the debt coming due on Mills this year. You have the $655 million senior facility and then another I think $1 billion of mortgage debt coming due. Can you talk about plans for refinancing all that? Are you having preliminary discussions on the facility and would you expect any resulting changes to the partnership this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mortgage refinancing is all in process so we anticipate that happening. And, again you got to remember, some of those deals, Mills is &#x2013; TMLP, our partnership with Farallon, is a small partner in some of those assets. So, the gross number sounds bigger than what the actual TMLP's responsibility is. And, then if you look at our responsibility as half the owner of TMLP, it's even smaller.</p>
          <p>The senior and the mez debt, we are just starting discussions with the senior lenders; no issue there. We expect &#x2013; we've built up a significant amount of cash in TMLP to deal with any refinancing requirements. That's in process. We'll spend the next couple of months doing that.</p>
          <p>And the last one, look, you never know; partnerships sometimes are built to last a long, long time and sometimes they unwind in a very positive way. And I would expect that we'll have a positive outcome. It's been a good partnership and it'll either continue on, on a very good basis or we'll figure something else out.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Steve, I had just a couple of technical questions as it relates to Page 15. The interest and other &#x2013; interest and dividend income went down and we were under the impression that you were due a dividend from CSC. I'm just wondering if that's the case or there was a timing issue or is something else going on in that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's something else going on in it, Steve. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll also see a decrease in our deferred costs and other assets. I think we had mentioned on prior calls that we held some mortgages as investments on other shopping centers and those mortgages were paid back at their maturity date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're really bummed on that part.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, I just noticed that down on the other expense line item, the other figure jumped quite a bit for the quarter and is up pretty significantly for the year. Is there anything you can sort of talk about? Does that relate to any of these projects, David, that you talked about in terms of this consumer marketing initiative or is there something else in that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Steve. It's really a function and you'll see the line right above it on page 15 as well, the professional expenses was up quite a bit in the quarter. There were &#x2013; we've got a lot of transaction activity going on. Some of which materialized in the fourth quarter, some of which David alluded to as potential activity in 2012. And it's just a combination of costs related to those. Some are professional expenses, some are related expenses but they are all driven by transaction or potential transaction equity that we've got in the hopper right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; we have been using BCG to help us work, scope out, work on this initiative that we hope to prototype and debut in the fourth quarter and so some of those expenses are also rolling through that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to assume that 12-month numbers maybe inflated or you think those are good run rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think the 12 &#x2013; I think the fourth quarter number, Steve, is higher than what you would see on a run rate basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I missed it, did you guys &#x2013; I know you gave guidance, but did you give the same-store guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Steve, we really decided to change the &#x2013; we decided in 2010 &#x2013; if you go back in 2010, we decided not to do that any longer. Just to give you kind of the gross number and so the answer is no, we did not do that. And obviously we feel confident it'll be positive this year but we do not give that number out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just in terms of leasing spreads, is there anything you could sort of talk about in terms of how we'll progress throughout the year? I'm just trying to figure out if you kind of exited the year at a substantially stronger rate as you kind of go into 2012 and does that kind of 10.5%,11% number sort of have us kind of upward bias to it as you look into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did have positive progress throughout the year quarter-over-quarter in our spreads and we are seeing better demand as we enter into 2012. We've already made very good progress towards our 2012 renewals in the mall business. So we anticipate a positive bias in that spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and look, Steve, we &#x2013; I just want to &#x2013; the retail real estate business is still tough, okay, and we are grinding like no other time. And our results, our sales, our occupancy and our rents are all, obviously, very positive. But it is a grind and there are retailers that continue to downsize and continue to &#x2013; we continue to have struggles on leasing some of that space up and getting the market rent in some of that space. So we still feel positive about it. But there's still work to be done and it is not &#x2013; it's a lot of work to produce these results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my last question, could you just circle back on the Toronto project, I mean, you are pretty adamant you were starting that project and I realized just kind of have been a head-to-head competition out there. What can you sort of tell us about leasing or kind of the state of the site and, lending more details about that project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emphatically, we're going to start in the spring. So we feel we're permitted to go. We're finishing it up. Leasing, look, we're in a different spot than others in the outlet business. We have the &#x2013; we can rely on the experience and judgment of having 70 out, premium outlets, mills assets throughout the world. We don't necessarily need to pre-lease. We're pros. We're experts in this business. The answer is we've got real interest. We've got certain commitments and barring something unforeseen, both of those that I mentioned we will be starting construction. So we're a little different. We understand this business very well. We know the risks about starting construction, whether you're fully leased or not. We've done it in the past in the outlet business and we're good to go on both of these deals.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to go back to the dividend a little bit. I mean you've got, based on kind of where you are now, your FFO payout ratio is only 52, something, percent You've got a big portfolio as you burn through your depreciation days, you said you're kind of chasing taxable income and I kind of wonder &#x2013; I mean do you have a feel for it? I mean your guidance for FFO is relatively narrow. Do you have a feel for kind of where &#x2013; how much you might have to grow the dividend, if the dividend is going to be growing at a materially faster pace than FFO going forward short of a bigger deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Paul, it's an entirely appropriate question. And obviously, this is a great dialogue at the Board level. So it's hard for me to be really specific but based upon what I know, it's &#x2013; we're going to have to, I would think, continue to raise our dividend, the rest of the year. It doesn't give you guidance on how much and when, but we want a little bit more data coming in with the first quarter ops. We want to understand what if any transactions transpire or happen or what have you that may have some impact on that. But what I know today, obviously subject to a counsel with the Board, $0.95 will not be enough for a quarter to payout 100% of our taxable income.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you generated a lot of free cash flow right now and you kind of thought over the years to grow that after the dividend. Does &#x2013; I mean does this make it any more &#x2013; to make you anymore inclined to pursue deals? I mean, because obviously that's one side benefit of a large transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only &#x2013; look, not at all really because and I mentioned it early. We've got so much going on with the existing portfolio and all of the redevelopment and new development. And again, there is nothing wrong with generating the cash, increasing the dividend, delevering and just keep doing what we're doing. So, I feel absolutely no need or pressure to do any deal whatsoever. And I like kind of the model we've got. That's not to say we won't. If we think we like the real estate that we would get at the end of the day, but I am &#x2013; I don't like parting with our cash right now; I like reinvesting it in our portfolio. So, we're entirely pleased with what's going on here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on that note, you've got $700 million or so in &#x2013; what your supplemental talks about as being kind of renovation and expansion. It doesn't really say much about kind of which malls are being expanded but it kind of implies $70 million of incremental NOI essentially. I mean, do you have any color on kind of where that's coming from or any kind of big expansions that drive that? It just looks like sort of renovation but</p>

Obviously, we're working with the town on approvals. Those are just &#x2013; Nanuet is &#x2013; the mall has been shutdown, and we're going to start construction there. Finally, La Plaza, we're going to add a second level on. We've got major redos, new department stores, new food courts, examples with Keystone, Dadeland and Southridge in Milwaukee. Plaza Carolina has been &#x2013; several boxes have been added. So those are just off the top of my head. When we start construction, we put it in the 8-K and I think you'll see an addition to that disclosure as the year progresses.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just last question on occupancies, at the end of the year I think maybe not your highest number ever and are you reaching a point at kind of 94.8%, I know some of it's seasonally high but where you're sort of at a frictional math? How much farther do you think you can drive portfolio occupancy and if it's not much farther, does that mean you can start pushing rents harder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, yeah, you're right. There is the frictional number. This year will be a little bit interesting because we do have a lot of movement going on with the portfolio as you might imagine with all the development spending. So &#x2013; but put that aside, I think there's some improvement but I think now the focus is on improving the quality of the 95% that were leased. And we didn't have that luxury obviously in 2009, 2010 and to some extent 2011, we're still going to feel pressure in 2012 with certain retailers, but I think the focus now, hopefully, is to marginally improve that occupancy but it's really going to be taking the &#x2013; the existing occupancy may be stabilizing that as it is but really improving who's in the space.</p>

          <p>That's true. We've got sponsorship on our building that may have a big impact on our fourth quarter &#x2013; first quarter. But we're so focused on what we do. We have blinders on this for this week in any event. In fact, we're so focused on what we do that we forgot that the Super Bowl was this &#x2013; when I planned our Board Meeting and our earnings call, okay. We could have probably picked a better week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly, it sounds like in Europe, obviously, the macro situation didn't help any. But it sounds like the yields that you were seeing over there from your investments just were not meeting your expectation and the macro situation just sort of was the hair on the camel's back. As you think about Brazil and China, what are the returns or what are the return premiums over what you would invest at in the U.S.? What are you looking for in those different markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the development returns in Brazil are well-articulated and I think, in our view, in Brazil, what we would do is develop as opposed to buy there and I think you know the development yields that they are trying to achieve, the 15% kind of return on cost, would be where our focus would be. And China is &#x2013; we've got opportunities. I was over there in December, we're working on a couple of outlet deals but the number side of that equation, all of the kind of the financial due diligence is still in a work-in-progress, but if it's not a premium to what we do here, we just &#x2013; there's just no reason to do it. Even though you might argue that the NOI growth will offset that, I still want to invest at higher levels than I can hear. That's the frustration with say going to Europe and doing a lot of redevelopment, but we do see as we pencil out China and Brazil just like we have in &#x2013; seen in Japan, seen in Korea, seen in Malaysia, all of those are higher development yields that we would gather here &#x2013; garner here, I should say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So by implication then, when you were considering the Capital Shopping, then despite the low going-in yields that the U.K. command; from your underwriting you were seeing returns that were in excess of the U.S. is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was really referring to the new development, okay. I think what we saw there and again recall that our deal was subject to due diligence. We saw at the end of the day yields comparable to what we would pay here on acquisitions, yet once we got our hands on the fact that the management operations could be improved. And so I don't want to confuse development yields with acquisition yields. We saw kind of comparable acquisition yields in the U.K. comparable to what we would pay here.</p>
          <p>With supply issues, they are a lot different than they were here. So, on that basis, it was worthy of pursuing it to get to the point where we could validate that initial conclusion, but we weren't given access to the books and therefore we did not &#x2013; we did not make a formal full bid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just the second question is, going back to the dividend, EQR went to a policy where they pay the steady first, second, third quarter dividend with a true-up in the fourth. Is that &#x2013; as you guys contemplate the dividend, is that something that would be &#x2013; that you think would be helpful or would investors be receptive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, that's what we did in 2011 and the fact is the more we talk to people, the less they like it. So my view would be to try and not do that. Really create a dividend that equals taxable income and then as that grows your dividend grows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we would like to get away from the special dividend based upon kind of the true-up dividend which in our case was represented by a special dividend. We would like to get away from that and make it more what I said.</p>
          <p>Now, look, sometimes you never rule out if you sold $5 billion of properties and you had a big taxable income, you may &#x2013; there may be certain circumstances that you'd have to do that, but the fact is we would like to not do that and that's what we're going to try and achieve in 2012. But certainly as we catch up to our taxable income, we will get away from the special true-up dividend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...20, 30 bps, so the fact of the matter is &#x2013; and any development that we would undertake in Brazil, we're just going to &#x2013; we're going to cash fund. So we wouldn't use any leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is that &#x2013; typically would you go for a JV or by yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we're contemplating a JV, and that's probably likely how we'll do that. And in China as well, if we get to that point in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question. If I look at the sales per square foot increases in your portfolio, unconsolidated risks and consolidated. It seems like the &#x2013; your JV property has done a lot better, up 22% year-over-year versus your consolidated which is up only 9%. Still good but lowering your JV assets. So, how should we think about the opportunity for additional JV take-off in terms of &#x2013; are all the JVs at one point in time? Are they all opportunity for you? And broadly speaking, if you could talk about cap rates not deals specifically but for the best assets, where could we see cap rates for these assets and I guess kind of going down the spectrum on quality? Sorry for the long question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I would just say part of the difference between the growth in consolidated and non-consolidated, I think we can get a better answer for you on that and just the quality because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of it's mix change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mix change and that we put more &#x2013; we add more outlets in there now that we put Prime in our numbers but I think we stated 10 for that in any event. So &#x2013; but we can get you a better answer on that. So, I think the mix &#x2013; our mix in our wholly-owned properties is great and so there's no real issue between what's in our JV and what's in our consolidated. I mean just like in our consolidated, you have Roosevelt Field, King of Prussia, Forum Shops, Woodbury, all of the outlet business. So, put that aside, that's not to say we don't have some great JV assets but the basis are much bigger in the consolidated than in the JV. So, don't read too much into that.</p>
          <p>Now, going to your question, cap rates on A assets is &#x2013; got to be &#x2013; there's not a lot being done in that whole area but they continue to move slower given that the fact that investors believe in NOI growth for high quality retail assets. So, you tell me. I mean it's low. It's lower than &#x2013; it's in the 4s, maybe, if that helps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does help. And I guess one part of that question is, are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it &#x2013; I got that we'll be buying in the 4s so because you know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think there are people out there that would clearly buy in the 4s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, even for your A assets that you're managing something in the 4s wouldn't be a price that you would clear at for a takeout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I don't know. I mean we'd have to &#x2013; it would have to be something really, really unique to get to that. I mean King of Prussia, we did not get to that number and there's nothing like that asset, especially given its development. So, look, it all depends on the circumstances, but I do think there are institutional investors out there that would feel comfortable at those kinds of iconic assets to be in that level. Whether we would or not, it would take an interesting set of circumstances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We don't. We are really getting away from those kinds of specifics. We do it asset by asset to build up to our budget. It's -in our own budget, it's a slight improvement, but we don't give specific numbers, Jeff.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just while I got you guys, and on Sears just more &#x2013; obviously, more focus on Sears Holdings. You've the minimal &#x2013; de minimis direct exposure to base rent, but do you have an estimate of what your ultimate financial exposure is through co-tenancy rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; yeah I would just say we &#x2013; if we're &#x2013; if we do get to co-tenancies with retailers. We do in some cases and not really happy about it but we do do it. It's where that it's going to be tied to Sears operating &#x2013; usually, it's three out of four and something like that. But I would say that particular issue would be de minimis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to &#x2013; maybe if you could talk a little bit about your exposure there, is there a theme to it, if you will, where that &#x2013; maybe the majority of exposures and single or two story stores over there in malls of a certain sales production, just curious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our Sears portfolio, they are very well-situated in our better properties. We have obviously a significant numbers so that throughout the portfolio. But again, this is nothing new. I mean, this is &#x2013; we're working with Sears. We are strategizing if in fact the eventuality comes; you want to deal with it. We're lining up demand. There is happily substantial demand and we're just going to have to see how this unfolds to date.</p>
          <p>None of our stores have been impacted and we try to monitor their volumes and our portfolio as a whole is above average both in terms of gross volumes and sales per foot.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just last two questions. One is on Del Amo, are you be able to share maybe a cap rate or rough cap rate on that transaction and then maybe, Steve, can you talk about what you've seen changed in the financing market for, I guess let's say, second-tier market malls or those with below average sales production, any movement there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the second part of the question first, Jeff. We continue to see really pretty robust demand on the call them, lack of better term, the middle quality malls. And interestingly enough, it's come from the banks in anticipation of a restart of the CMBS market in 2012 and the ability to syndicate some of these. Pricing has been pretty decent and as I said, we've been out with two or three assets and the demand has been very good.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we &#x2013; Jeff, we don't do individual cap rate things in malls other than we really feel like we made a fair deal and the one that we'll be able to add value with as we move very aggressively on our redevelopment plans there.</p>

          <p>Yeah. The answer is usually, they come about when you least expect it. So again, we &#x2013; it's not a high priority but we look at just about every in any alternative. And the good news is &#x2013; but you got to be really disciplined when you have this ability. The good news is we could look at basically any real estate company in the world and decide whether or not it makes sense for us. So &#x2013; but it comes with that a burden not to screw up. So, what's better, you could look at every deal or you're in a position where you can't. I'd rather be in the fact that we could look at every deal but with that comes some discipline here that we better not make a mistake.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David, earlier you talked about some of the challenges that are still out there when it comes to leasing space in your properties or in the mall business in general. Can you quantify it for mall category, if you will? So, what do you observe at A malls versus Bs and Cs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, the risk in the A malls is really not a risk because if you do get that space back, you're going to &#x2013; you have plenty of demand to lease that up. But it is going to be in the kind of the &#x2013; however, you want to characterize, I hate listing malls, A, B and C, but it's certainly going to &#x2013; the pressure that we have as an owner will be on what people calls the B mall category.</p>
          <p>And it's surfacing because the tenants like the Gap, the Pac Sunwears of the world that are still and continuing to connect with the consumer. Again, I don't like naming names and pointing retailers out. That's only representation of a couple of retailers that in fact themselves have said they're closing stores. But the fact is that's where the pressure in the portfolio occurs and is occurring and that's what we're working to offset. If we get the space back on &#x2013; and the fact of the matter in a lot of A malls, retailers that are downsizing &#x2013; we're taking the opportunity to help with that downsizing by not renewing them in the A malls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Same with the B malls, who are the replacement tenants when a Gap or a PacSun exit the property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are a lot of people that are very aggressively growing their footprint and that leads to David's point. We're doing deals throughout the quality spectrum with LOFT, with Love Culture, Crazy 8, Zumiez, Tilly's, Cotton On, Francesca's, all of the &#x2013; Teavana, all of those tenants are &#x2013; H&amp;M, so we're doing with a lot of these tenants throughout the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And one other point that I want to make is, this $1 billion that we're spending in our portfolio is certainly giving us more attractive properties in terms of the tenants wanting to be in them. It's no accident when we're adding over 35 anchors in our portfolio when we're renovating 20 properties, when we're getting substantially higher growth that's making us have a better product for our leasing agents and that's hopefully going to bear fruit and enable us to deal with the space we get back from the tenants that are shrinking their footprint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. David, you talked earlier about how the joint venture with Macerich's carved up but I don't think you mentioned was there any consideration to selling those assets outright?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. The answer is no. Look, we're off on our own with each other so we never really talked about selling the whole portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's despite Steve's comments that the financing market for the mid-tier malls is coming back. I mean is that anticipated that you might end up selling them or selling more above and beyond what you just got from Macerich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fact that matter is the portfolio that we got, we think there's upside. So we're pleased with the outcome. We think we can move the needle on those assets and we have no intention at all of selling those assets.</p>
          <p>So look, we're going to still prune the portfolio and I think as Steve said that the fact that the financing market is getting better I think that will help us. It's been &#x2013; obviously that's been a challenge to sell kind of the smaller malls. But with respect &#x2013; specific respect to IBM, there's absolutely no desire or interest to sell those assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just switching gears, you had made some comments also that you guys are different, you don't need to pre-lease the start in your outlet construction which &#x2013; to me it sounds like kind of a shot across the bow to the competition, so I was just curious...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say &#x2013; I said we take a different approach. You used the word different, so I don't think I've said the word different but &#x2013; we'll have to go back I could be wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm just wondering. Can you talk about how retailers have been evaluating the multiple options in those markets that you've identified where there is competition and is it just a stalemate that kind of forces you to &#x2013; what it looks like go to do something &#x2013; do some spec development  in outlets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think every development is different. A lot of cases, the retailer is using the competitive scenario to drive down rents and we're seeing that a lot, and, so the retailers very adept, very adept, very skilled at using the leverage of competition to drive rents down.</p>
          <p>And in some cases they're sitting on the sidelines, saying, well, I want to be &#x2013; I want to have an outlet in this marketplace but you guys figured it out, they're on the sidelines. And in some cases they have faith in us. They want to go with us because we've got this knowledge base of all of these assets. And in some cases they want to go with the other guy because of whatever other reasons.</p>
          <p>So, it's all over the board, the fact of the matter is, we don't really pre-lease period. We're doing Nanuet and we've got &#x2013; that's not an outlet and we've got certain commitments from very important retailers. But are we're sitting there leasing up the small shop up to a certain percent to where we lease? The answer is no. We should be able to use our judgment and our experience on whether or not we can get something leased and at what rent. And that's just the way we operate, certainly not meant to be a shot across the bow for anybody. Everybody can do whatever they want. I have no influence on that at all. But that's how we operate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. But at what point do you end up actually buying the land? I mean is it fair to assume that you've actually purchased the land in Phoenix, in Toronto, in St. Louis, is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phoenix, we have signed the ground lease. I was down there, I don't know, was it last week or two weeks ago? I signed the &#x2013; it's a ground lease. We're on Indian land and by the Wildhorse Casino there. So that ground lease is signed. And Toronto, it's all documented and signed, the land closing is forthcoming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What type of delta is that when you ground lease something like that versus buying the land outright?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It tends to have a better return in a lot of cases. Obviously, when we're on Indian land, you can't really buy the land so that's how it works.</p>

          <p>I will take another retailer example; Williams-Sonoma was amongst your larger tenants five years back, and now roughly 40% of their business is online and about a quarter of their leases are expiring over the next two years. What I'm hearing from multiple conferences is that they're planning on trying to negotiate the rent on those expirations and if they're not successful, they just plan to move more of their business online. I just wanted to get your thoughts on it and if this is like indicative of a changing trend in retail in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe there's anything out of the ordinary with your example. Williams-Sonoma happens to have great real estate and great properties, and if their business strategy is such and their productivity is such that they cannot afford to maintain the space that they currently have, they're going to come in and offer us a rent that enables them to maintain their occupancy. If we don't believe that rent is fair market value, they're going to move out and we're going to replace them with somebody that has got a productivity and a business strategy that will enable them to pay what we believe is fair market rent.</p>

          <p>Hi. I just have a couple of questions on Del Amo. The &#x2013; obviously, a very large asset and I think David in your prepared comments you talked about a redevelopment or an investment in that asset, and I understood you have just recently increased your share in it. I'm just curious if you can tell us whether the $1 billion for this year and next year of redevelopment includes Del Amo, number one. And number two, if you could talk a little bit about your plans for that asset if you feel able to at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the $1 billion does not include for this year. Because we still think we are in a spot where we're going to use this year for 2012 to plan what we're doing and part of that depends on outcomes with certain discussions with certain stores. But it's a complicated asset. I'll turn it over to Rick to explain. We have lots of different options. It's complicated. It's probably better to show you physically than words, but I'll let Rick take it from there.</p>

          <p>Just very briefly, it's midway between Century City and South Coast Plaza. It's positioned to serve all of the great communities on the Pacific Ocean that have &#x2013; we have a trade area of 1 million people with $90,000 household income. So we believe there's an opportunity to add fashion anchors. We believe there's an opportunity to add some full-line anchors and completely redevelop the property. It's over 2.275 million square feet.</p>
          <p>So we've got a lot of FAR and a great market and we're very focused on bringing that forward and it's certainly going to be part of the capital spending that David talked about in 2013 and 2014.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The occupancy cost in the fourth quarter for the malls and the outlets was 11.8%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And really the way we price our real estate is a function of who is the tenant, what's the productivity of that tenant, what's the mall, what's the space in the mall. So we have a very focused process and all of those factors feed into it.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I know you don't like breaking up the portfolio in terms of performance, but can you talk generically about how the mall portfolio is performing versus the community center portfolio? And maybe thinking about 2011, 2012, is the gap any closer these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're both performing better than what we expected in 2011. The outlet business continues to have higher comp NOI growth than the mall business. But I'll tell you, I think we're generally pleased with both segments. And the gap is certainly less &#x2013; certainly has been reduced compared to 2009 and 2010 levels. I think that's safe to say that the outlet business was stronger in the height of the significant economic downturn. So that gap &#x2013; that growth rate gap has certainly narrowed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's fair between the traditional mall and the community center as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our community center, we don't &#x2013; you mean the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the mall business grows much better than the community center business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, okay. And then going back to non-core asset sales; can you just talk about generically about how big the potential pool of assets that you would like to sell over time is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think historically, this year we basically disposed of assets around $500 million. If we could continue to sell $200 million to $300 million, $400 million of assets a year in terms of pruning I think that would be the level that would be desirable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector, Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good afternoon, a few questions. If we could just start off I guess with the big picture. Rick, just wanted to follow up from our ICSC dinner in December. Can you talk about your more recent conversations with tenants, the retail sales seem to be stronger than expected, what is their latest view on these new store openings or new concepts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as David alluded to earlier, it's very much a tenant-by-tenant analysis. Sales were better. There were some pressures on margins. We've detailed earlier in the call a number of tenants that have very aggressive growth profile, and there are others that are retracing a little bit and reducing their footprint. Generally, however, the balance sheets remain strong. They are still generating cash flow and we're still able to drive demand from the types of tenants that we'd like to have in our properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess where do you stand on pricing power at this point? I know David said that business is still tough. Is it still a tough negotiation or you feel like pricing power is coming a little bit more back to your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is never a negotiation that is not tough. I mean, look, we're fighting over the same dollar and that's been that way for 40 years and it will continue that way. And ultimately, do we have some better power to look as the productivity of our properties get better as we improved our properties, as our occupancy gets stronger just fundamental supply and demand. There's virtually no new construction. That certainly plays into our strengths.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess thinking about your &#x2013; the budget and your guidance, I guess, David, your thoughts on the consumer, our economists keep saying consumer spending is going to slow second half of the year. When you guy &#x2013; when you thought about &#x2013; I guess when you finalize your budget, how are you thinking about the consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, our &#x2013; I think our budgeting is &#x2013; it reflects &#x2013; it's ground up, so it reflects the general nature of our &#x2013; the fact that we are cautious in how we put our numbers together. So, I think in a sense that reflects also that &#x2013; what's going on in the macro environment. The &#x2013; so, I think we take that into account. There's no guarantees in anything, but I do think we take in the fact that it is generally still a very cautious environment, we would &#x2013; we have a lot of work to do to make our numbers.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we always want to beat our numbers and we're at the point now where we're giving you our view of kind of what it is given what transpired with the GCI sale, et cetera. We always want to beat our numbers but we're generally cautious. So &#x2013; and I think that reflects the consumer. This year, you do have a certain &#x2013; added uncertainty with the general election and all that crap that follows with it.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, there are reasonable &#x2013; I mean, it's very confusing signs out there, but there's some reasonable ones, Jeff, you're aware obviously of what happened with jobs today. On the other hand, you see more layoffs that were &#x2013; have been announced over the last week or two. So it's &#x2013; my view, it's still a very confounding tough environment to kind of decipher through. I do know though that the program that we have in our internal investments will pay rewards for our shareholders in the future. So that, I'm not worried about and we would like to see better income growth and job growths. That would give us a cushion that we haven't been able to really have over the last couple of years even though we produced terrific industry-leading results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then I just want to clarify, David, you mentioned you're going to spend $1 billion this year in development, next year, $1 billion and I think you also said 2014. Is that strictly redevelopments, new Premium Outlet Centers and expansions at your existing Premium Outlet Centers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Yeah, that's all in. It's new development and redevelopment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But not &#x2013; just to clarify, not new malls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, unless you've got a site, you want to show us. We're &#x2013; the new malls, I still think are ways away. I think &#x2013; I still don't see a real demand for a lot of new malls. Nanuet is a good example. You could consider that a new mall in a sense but we put that in our redevelopment category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Brazil, should we be &#x2013; should we assume its full price and China premium outlets, did you say that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not say that and you should not necessarily assume that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with the Phoenix announcement...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On both fronts, Jeff, on both fronts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both fronts. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last question on Phoenix, I guess with your announcement, have you heard anything from your competitors on their sites?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I assume there &#x2013; our assumption is they're going to go full steam ahead. And we are going forward. We'll have no impact on what they do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, actually, I'm sorry. One last question. Do you still have the ownership stake in value retail in the U.K. and Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You do, okay. Anything with that at this point with the sale in Italy or you like that small investment, keep it as it is, or is there any chance to increase that or do anything more in the outlook front, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We like that investment. In fact, we have an investment at the holding company, more or less, and then there is investors in various outlets that, in some cases, are different than the investors at the holding company. And in fact, we just increased our ownership interest in two outlets at year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In value retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no worries.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to push a little more on Del Amo. Do you think that investment could be at north of $200 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it could be. It could be and if you want to see all the options, we'll let you spend &#x2013; it's at your own peril, but we'll let you spend time with David Contis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And he could &#x2013; we could actually use your help, Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it sounds like you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it will be at your own peril. It may take a long time, so reserve half the day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like you're talking to Fashion anchors. Are they positively inclined at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everyone acknowledges the importance of the market and the fact that it's not adequately penetrated under existing stores. Obviously, we're now in an environment where people are considering more capital investments and we're optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then prior to my meeting with David Contis, is it still going to be done in phase? There was one time I thought you would focus on the northern end first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will still be done in phases based on when we can get the right critical mass and right now, we're focusing on what &#x2013; how we're going to start it. But it is again a very big project, so it is going to take a number of phases and a number of years to bring to fruition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just shifting gears slightly, in terms of the Outlet business, I'm wondering if like the malls are the higher end ones doing better than the more moderately priced ones or Outlet's strong just throughout the price point spectrum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say they're generally strong but the tourist outlets are the ones that are really kicking ass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
