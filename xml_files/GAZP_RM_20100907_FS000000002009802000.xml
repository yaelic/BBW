        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you again at yet another teleconference dedicated to the Publication of the Consolidated Financial Results of Gazprom for Q1 2010, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>My name is Andrey Kruglov, I'm the Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee and the Head of the Finance and Economics Department, and I would also like to introduce my colleagues who are attending this teleconference call together with me.</p>
          <p>So today, we have in attendance the Head of the Department for Economic Valuation and Pricing, Elena Karpel; the Head of the Consolidated Reporting of the Department for Accounting, Mikhail Rosseev; and also the First Deputy of the Head of the Department of Marketing and Liquid Hydrocarbons Processing, Alexander Mikheev; as well as the representatives of the Department for Foreign Economic Operations, the Finance and Economics Departments and our colleagues from the Accounts, and also the colleagues from the Department of Economic Valuation and Pricing.</p>
          <p>So I shall comment on the macroeconomic situation in the market and will introduce the operational results of Gazprom while in the second part of the presentation, Mikhail Rosseev who is the Head of the Consolidated Reporting Department, will give us a few more details about the results of our financials. And, as usual, we have prepared the slides which have been uploaded to our Web site and the ones which you, alongside with the presentation, can follow.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention to slide number 4, which demonstrates the highlights. And that is that currently we are observing the Russian economy recovering and principally this boosts the level of attraction of the Russian corporate securities. But at the same time, we believe that recently the market has been responding quite sensitively to various reports about the production of shale gas and various competition on the part of the sale of the liquefied natural gas through Europe.</p>
          <p>Continuing the topic of sales, I'd like to note that during the 7 months of 2010, they have exceeded by 11% the results of the previous year. Besides during Q1 of 2010, we have witnessed substantial increase of the throughput of gas through our gas transportation system which also confirms a gradual recovery of the demand for gas in our traditional markets.</p>
          <p>So speaking about the results and the recovery of the Q1, we are seeing very strong financial results of the company. The money from the operational results basically amounted to RR 483 billion in Q1 2010. Very considerable reduction of the debt burden, whereas net debt to EBITDA went down by almost 30%, while the correlation of net debt to the adjusted EBITDA went down from 1.3 to 0.8. The net revenue which is to the shareholders of the company went up 3 times, up to RR 325 billion, while the net cash flow amounted to RR 264 billion having grown nine-fold compared to Q1 2009.</p>
          <p>Now we can see greater detail in terms of our results and for that purpose we can go the next slide. Like I've already noted, the Russian economics have been demonstrating this year quite a high rate of growth within the GDP, and have been quite nicely recovering after the crisis of '09. Positive contribution is being made by the dynamics we see in the global energy market. Low level of the government debt, which is less than 9% of the GDP, contributes to the stability in the national market economics.</p>
          <p>So within the next slide that is where we're going to consider two broadly debated current topics which is pricing and the potential for the supplies of the LNG and the production of the shale gas in Europe. So let's move over to slide number 6, please.</p>
          <p>So in terms of production of shale gas in Europe, it is going to be restricted because of several structural and environmental reasons. Besides, the cost of the production of shale gas in the U.S. already now considerably exceeds the cost of the production of conventional gas. And taking into account complex technology for its production and various peculiarities of the region, the cost of the production of shale gas in Europe is going to be considerably higher than in the U.S. And according to some estimates, this cost may exceed 2 to 3 times what we know in the U.S. &#x2013; in the European market.</p>
          <p>So far, we haven't seen any substantial amount of detailed geological analysis being done, so the outlook for the production of shale gas in Europe remains to be theoretical. As far as the supplies of the LNG are concerned, currently supplies of liquefied natural gas in the first place are substituting the declining production of gas in the North Sea and that is taking place under the contracted prices without much affecting the spot market. Beside, I'd like to note that with the exception of the UK and Italian market, the volumes of the supplies of LNG to Europe in the current year have practically remained at the level of last year.</p>
          <p>As far as the traditional pipeline gas is concerned, upon the very same slide, in the bottom left hand corner, you can see the price dynamics for gas on the German border compared to the UK and the U.S. spot markets. And as it may be seen in the chart, on average, during 2010, the gap between the prices has shrunk compared to '09. And this in fact, we believe, is something which creates a favorable environment for the supplies of the pipeline gas and respectively for the principles of pricing, which we are currently adhering to.</p>
          <p>So in the next slide, you can see our physical volumes. And it is evident that in Q1 2010, the trend has sustained for the recovery of production of hydrocarbons which started back in the middle of '09. The growth of the production of gas amounted to 16% compared to Q1 '09 and as opposed to Q4 of 2009, similarly we witnessed a slight growth. Production of oil hasn't been growing at the same pace compared to Q1 '09. It grew only by 7% while the production of the gas condensate grew by 3% compared to Q1 '09.</p>
          <p>And on the next slide, which is number 9, you can see the overall balance of our gas transportation system. This chart reflects the physical movement of gas through trunk pipelines rather than commercial operations. Nevertheless, one may note the normalization of the overall system compared to the anomalies of Q1 '09. Following the growing demand, production also grew and the underground storage is operated in a normal regime while the main drivers of the volume was towards Europe and the former Soviet Union countries.</p>
          <p>The next slide, and I'm sorry for the mishap, the previous slide was number 8, so 9 &#x2013; it is number nine, it reflects the sale of our gas in the main markets during first quarter and it is visible that they've been demonstrating growth both in terms of volume as well as the money earned compared to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>The exception was only in the European market where the growing volume of the sold gas was about 39% during the year. However, a substantial reduction of the average sale price led to the fact that the revenue generated in this market went down by 22%.</p>
          <p>And compared to Q1 '09, as far as the domestic market is concerned, we're witnessing stable growth of revenue through the growing tariffs instituted by the Federal Tariff Service and that led to the growing average sale price for gas as well as through the growing volumes of the gas sold by 10%.</p>
          <p>The revenue from the sale of gas to the Former Soviet Union countries grew during Q1 2010 compared to the similar period in 2009 by 10.5% through the growing volumes.</p>
          <p>The next slide represents the dynamics for the volume of the gas sold within the Gazprom's main markets. The sale of gas in the Russian market during the seven months of this year exceeded the previous period results by 6%. Now speaking about the price environment, one can note that the Government is following the established plan for raising tariffs and changing those within the current period. So, we still are expecting that there will be stable growth for gas prices.</p>
          <p>The situation in the former Soviet Union countries market remains stable. Considering the results of the seven months, the volumes of sale of gas into the former Soviet Union countries exceeded the amount sold by 40% compared to last year. After we have reviewed the amounts of gas to be sold and the prices to Ukraine, we have the reason to expect Ukraine to stay true to their commitments. We're continuing to follow the market-based principles with Belarus and Moldova, and so we expect the gas prices to continue growing. As we have stated previously, we expect that we're going to switch to the market-based pricing principle with these countries following the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>And as far as the most profitable market is concerned, the European market, the amounts of gas sold &#x2013; within these seven months by 11% exceeded the results of last year. But at the same time, taking into account the complicated situation in the market and, as a result, our main agreements with the main counterparties in terms of the postponement of the take-or-pay commitments to a later period, we expect that the volumes of sale of gas within 2010 shall remain within the last year's margins.</p>
          <p>Now, I shall remind you of the flexibility of our long-term contracts which envisage that in case of the lower volumes of the sale of gas rather compared to the take-or-pay principles, we will receive an advance payment for gas not taken. And our current outlook is based upon the average gas price sold to Europe in 2010 in the amount of approximately $308 per 1,000 cubic meters. According to our estimates, the demand for gas in the European continental market shall rebound to the pre-crisis level by 2012.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to pass the floor over to my colleague who represents the Department for Accounting and the Head of the Department for Consolidated Reporting, Mikhail Rosseev.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, dear ladies and gentlemen. Andrey Kruglov in his presentation noted the factors which affected us in terms of the positive changes within our main segments, which is the gas sales, but you can see upon slide number 12 that during the reporting period, a very substantial positive result from the sale of gas also were derived from the sale of the gas and oil processing, as well as the sale of heat and power.</p>
          <p>So that comes from the revenue of the gas processing and which grew by almost RR35.8 or by 60%. This can be described or explained by the growing sold volumes which primarily come from the operations of Gazprom Neft Group which accounts for approximately 82% from the general volumes of sales from the Gazprom Group in terms of the processed liquefied hydrocarbons.</p>
          <p>So the growing sales from the power and heat grew by 38.5 or 38.6%. So the growing revenue from &#x2013; within this particular segment can be explained by the fact that we included into the consolidated reports such subsidiaries as TGK-1 starting from Q4 '09, as well as the growing revenue from the sale of heat and power related to the operations of the previously acquired assets in the power sector such as Mosenergo, OGK-2 and OGK-6, sales from which grew by approximately 32%.</p>
          <p>And you can also see upon this slide that some substantial positive results in the operations of the Group came from the exchange rate dynamics in terms of the foreign currency to rubles which will add to the growing revenue during this period in the amount of RUB202 billion.</p>
          <p>Let us now move over to a review of operational costs, amongst the kind of results which as a rule are of the most interest to those who follow our operations.</p>
          <p>Upon slide number 13, you can note that our operational costs during the three months of 2010 grew compared to the similar period last year by RR 65 billion or 12%.</p>
          <p>So you can note that certain substantial influence over the operational costs came from the exchange rate difference, our loss from that in terms of operational line items by 31st of March amounted to RR 125 billion compared to the similar period last year. And this particular change primarily comes from the reduction of the U.S. dollar/ruble exchange rate within the reporting period, as well as with the remaining exchange rate compared to last year.</p>
          <p>And taking into account a very substantial influence from that particular indicator over our operational results, we have separated it and currently reflect it as a separate line item in the overall itemization of our operational costs within our reports.</p>
          <p>The next element within our costs that I would like to draw your attention to is our costs for the acquired gas which went down by RR 125 billion or 58%. This decline primarily comes from the reduction of price and volumes that we acquired from Central Asian producers.</p>
          <p>The next one is our costs for the acquisition of oil, which will reflect within the line item of acquired oil and gas, went up by RR 125 billion or 114%. And that particular growth is related to the growing global oil prices as well as with the growing volumes of the oil acquired, primarily because that is related to the operations of the Gazprom Neft.</p>
          <p>The next point in terms of the overall cost picture is the labor costs, which during the reporting period grew by 38% and this growth is explained by a number of factors, which have led to an average growing wage. Sorry.</p>
          <p>And the first factor, which one should mention is the growing overall head count within the group, which occurred because of the main operating entities as well as through the Gazprom Neft acquiring new assets as well as because of the including into our consolidation perimeter of the TGK-1 company.</p>
          <p>The next factor is the indexing of wages within our main operating entities which is taking place according to the concluded collective labor agreements and prospectively are staying in level with inflation.</p>
          <p>And the last factor which I'd like to note is the writing-off of the previously capitalized within our reserves of the costs for wages which is related to the usage of gas from the underground storage.</p>
          <p>On the tax side, apart from the tax profit, our taxes grew by RR 25 billion or 50% and the growth in this particular line item occurred because of the growing MET tax and that is related to the production of oil which grew approximately by RR 47 billion. And that particular growth was related to a growing rate within the MET, which is related to the global oil prices as well as the growing operations in terms of the growing volume of the oil produced.</p>
          <p>Our costs for the transit of oil and gas grew by 22%, which was the result of the growing costs for the transportation of gas through the Ukrainian territory. And amongst other costs I'd like to specifically note the growing costs for the transfer of electric power because of the consolidation of new assets and certain growth of costs within the R&amp;D line because, again, of the growing volume of this work and additional consolidation into our perimeter of TGK-1 company.</p>
          <p>Up on the next slide, which is number 14, we are representing the results of another factor which is affecting us on a continuous basis in terms of our results which is the changes in the structure of the group and within the reporting period this particular fact is something that we don't very regularly reflect in our reporting. So we decided to show the way we reconsider, the way the Gazenergoprombank is reflected in the overall facts and data.</p>
          <p>As basically you may note in March 2010 the Board of Directors of the Rossiya Bank and Gazenergoprombank have approved merging of the Gazenergoprombank to the Rossiya Bank and as a result of this, while preparing the financial reports of Gazprom Group, there are active commitments that we had having classified basically in terms of the assets and liabilities as assets intended for divestiture.</p>
          <p>And you at the same time can note that the most substantial result in terms of the divested assets were noted within the overall debt level which went down by almost RR 2 billion as well as the financial assets and liabilities which went down by RR 49 billion.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to finish my part of the presentation and pass the floor over to my colleagues from the Finance and Economics Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much to Mikhail Rosseev and now, dear ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite you to move over to slide number 15, where one can see the review of our debt. As a result of a consistent financial policy, the main ratios of creditworthiness are being maintained at an acceptable level for the company during the past several years. A stable level of debt burden is being maintained despite the diversification of our business within the oil and power sectors, as well as despite the influence of the global financial crisis and the fluctuating oil prices.</p>
          <p>The decrease of the external borrowing allowed us to reduce our overall debt down to RR 1.3 trillion by the end of Q1 2010 and at the same time the net debt didn't exceed RR 1 trillion. Another factor which contributed to the reduction of the debt was the way we changed reflecting the commitments of Gazenergoprombank.</p>
          <p>The overall debt to EBITDA ratio went down to 1.2 and so we're expecting that the debt burden of the company within 2010 shall continue going down. This particular figure may amount to approximately 1 or a little bit more than that, by the end of the current year. The cash flow from the operating &#x2013; operational activities to the capital expenses, as you can see upon this slide, has substantially grown, primarily because of the growing profit from our operations.</p>
          <p>In summarizing today's presentation I would like to note the following things. In the beginning of 2010 we witnessed various trends in terms of economics improving themselves in the regions which are our key markets, which in many ways predetermined the growing volumes of gas sale compared to the previous year. And that became a very positive effect which contributed to our growing sale of gas despite the average sale prices declining in Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of the domestic market the growing tariffs which are instituted by the Federal Tariff Service and the growing sales volumes enabled us to grow our revenue from sales by 47%.</p>
          <p>A very substantial contribution into the overall growing revenue was made by the sale of oil and the processed products, the refined products. Our power business also demonstrated substantial revenue growth which, yet again, confirms the importance in our ability to diversify our business operations. And the concerns related to a possible influence, negatives ones coming from the shale gas and upon the structure of the European market, at this point in time turned out to be exaggerated.</p>
          <p>Control over the operational costs and the favorable dynamics in terms of the exchange rate between ruble, euro and dollar, as well as the associated revenue from the companies within the group perimeter, allowed us to increase our net profit. The positive trend within the reduction of the debt level continued during Q1 this year and we are expecting for this level to continue going down by the end of 2010 once we've finalized the year end result.</p>
          <p>So this concludes our presentation and I may finally say that the company continues to generate a very strong cash flow. So these are the main conclusions following the presentation and the materials that we've announced covering Q1 of 2010.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention and so now myself and my colleagues will be ready to answer your questions. The time that we have allotted for that particular part of today's teleconference is 40 minutes.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Andrey Gromadin [JPMorgan]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, and congratulations on the good results, and thanks very much for the presentation. Andrey is having two questions. The first one is a very brief one. You demonstrated a good outstanding, the net cash flow results in Q1 as result of which the overall debt level went down to approximately $33 billion. In your presentation you are saying that the net debt to EBITDA by the end of Q1 is somewhere at the 0.8 level. So we've noted that. He also noted that this level is going to go down by the end of the year. Could you please specify at which level we might expect by the end of the year your net debt to EBITDA to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are currently forecasting the same figures which we've announced during the Gazprom Investor Day, which was in the February this year, where we stated that our debt in &#x2013; denominated in the U.S. dollars by the end of 2010 would amount to approximately 44 billion, which is approximately RUB1.3 trillion. Respectively the EBITDA figure will follow suit and will be somewhere about 43, US$45 billion, which respectively gives us the reason to assume, like I've already mentioned in my presentation, that the net debt to EBITDA will be approximately 1 or maybe just a little bit more than that. So overall debt to EBITDA, 0.8 times. Net debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the second question, about exports. You mentioned that your outlook, in terms of the volume of sales are going to remain at the level of '09, which means that we should expect somewhere about more than 158 billion cubic meters of gas. Additional question refers to the Central Asian gas. How much of it are you planning to buy from the Central Asia this year? And about pricing, which part of it is going to be sold at spot prices? And based upon share of the spot prices, the price that you mentioned as the average annual price, $308 is estimated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would ask my colleagues from Gazprom Export to answer this question, Mr. Averkin, who is the Head of the Gas Export Department in the European market, as well as Mr. Mikheev Alexander from the Marketing Department, who is the First Deputy Head of this Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our plans for export into the European countries are concerned, as was correctly mentioned by the end of the year, we are expecting approximately the same result as was in '09, which was about 140 billion cubic meters. As far as the spot component in pricing is concerned, principally speaking, respective percentages is confidential information. And I would say that within the $308, that includes also the volumes of gas which we supply to the U.K., which is almost completely is related to the indexing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now about the Central Asian gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as the Central Asian gas is concerned, we're not expecting any particular news. But nevertheless, we are planning to buy from Turkmen not more than 11 billion cubic meters and that can be explained during the past few years the sale market for that gas has declined substantially. So that was why we've reduced down to 11 billion cubic meters, the acquisition of the Turkmenian gas. As far as the Uzbek and Kazakhstan gas is concerned, that will remain at the level of '09. So no news here either. But we also have a new supplier of gas, which is Azerbaijan from which we expect to buy at least 0.5 billion cubic meters of gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Maxim Moshkov [UBS]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions, if we may. The first one is related to the program that the company has for this year and for next year in terms of certain adjustments that are being planned. Could you please tell us what is it? Second question about Sakhalin II project. It is evident that indeed the company started earning some serious profit from its involvement in this project. And so the question is how much money was earned in Q1? And to what extent Sakhalin II is a sustainable source of income for you? The third question is what was the price that the gas was sold to Ukraine at during Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of our investment program for 2010, we are scheduling for the next meeting, the management committee specifically at which we are going to consider adjusting our investment program. And in the meantime I'd like to say that we haven't yet finalized any figures. I can simply state that the overall level of investments in 2010 will be approximately, and I would like to underscore approximately, RUB800 billion out of which the capital spend will be as we expect a little bit more than RUB650 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of our priorities, as they used to be, will be the completion of the Bovanenkovo field, construction of the gas pipeline at Bovanenkovo-Ukhta, Gryazovets-Vyborg, Dzhubga-Lazarevskoye-Sochi, Zapolyarnoye, Urengoy. And so these are all of the projects which we see and continue seeing as priority. They remain. Now as far as the second question is concerned, which is Sakhalin II, I would ask my colleague Mikhail Rosseev, to give you an answer. And in terms of your third and final question with respect to Ukraine, we will have Alexander Mikheev giving you the answer. So let me pass the floor over to Mikhail Rosseev.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As can be seen from the 12th note to our consolidated results, our share within the financial results of this company during Q1 amounted to approximately RUB9 billion. Of course these resources were not immediately accounted for as money on the book. But besides, within these particular projects, there is also a partial refunding of the resources that have been previously invested by the shareholders, because of a change of resources of funding. But in terms of volume you can't compare those to the overall volumes of the group. They are quite significant compared to the other sources of funding, but in terms of operational activities, they remain quite modest, I shall say.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the earnings derived during Q1 from the Sakhalin Energy Company, they amount to approximately RUB10 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the third question, the sale price of gas to Ukraine during Q1 &#x2013; the average in Q1 was $304.16.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my question is about the cash flow results, and particularly changes in the working capital figures. We have foreseen that this change was about 117 billion, out of which only 43 billion is explained by changes in the receivables most probably? And as far as the VAT and export duties are concerned, is it possible to receive more details with respect to the remaining 74 billion? And more specific question, is this increase in the receivables or the decrease rather in the receivables and the increase in the payables rather related to money being paid by the European counterparts by way of the advance payments under the take-or-pay contracts in as far as the gas not taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You noted quite correctly in terms of this change that we show and that's related to the receivables from customs and the VAT rebate. Apart from that other factors which changed our working capital coming from the payables and the crude commitments, primarily because of the growing commitments from the contractors about RUB11 billion, an additional RUB11 billion coming from the growing advance payments, primarily received and related to the supplies of gas.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I can mention that slight growth in terms of the liability because of the banking group also because of the additional gas taken from the underground storage. We've RUB26 billion is where our material reserves are decreasing as well as the other working assets, because of partial divestiture from the banking group as well.</p>
          <p>And additional RUB22 billion in terms of growing tax liabilities, is simply because of growing current liabilities, as simply as that.</p>
          <p>And so if all of this is to be added together, that will give you the overall changes in our working capital position.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Lev Snykov, VTB Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question. Thank you very much for the conference call. First the question is to Mikhail Rosseev, and that is just a slight clarification with respect to the Gazenergoprombank. Do I understand correctly that the payables and receivables of the bank previously were reflected in the respective line items in the Gazprom reports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is the figure for the volume of the export duty which was received as part of the rebate for last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is quite a specific sort of an issue. And I would like to make it a straightforward answer so as not to confuse myself. So the net rebate on the Central Energy Customs amounted approximately RR 9.9 billion. At the same time the reduction of the liabilities that the Central Energy Customs had to Gazprom by also offsetting the current payment considering the growing liabilities that those were during the previous period amounted to approximately RR 30 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so this question is how much the company is expecting to receive during second quarter in terms of the export due to rebate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not, frankly speaking, ready to give you an exact figure for Q2. Our expectation is that it will continue going down, also with the current duty payments being taken into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is about the investment program. What will be the main reason for the investment program, or the volume within the investment program, growing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This comes from adjusting our schedules and plans, adjusting the commissioning deadlines as well as additional review of the number of investment projects.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Alex Burgansky, Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, two questions. Firstly, it is about the price for gas in Europe, which in Q1 in the report is shown as $287 for 1,000 cubic meters. To what extent it is comparable to the figure which is 308, as shown as an average one within the outlook for the rest of the year, or this figure, 287, may not include certain other elements which are part of the long-term gas supply contracts. The second question is about the free cash flow. You've demonstrated very positive free cash flow in Q1 this year. So I'd like to find out what are the company plans to utilize these funds. Is the company planning to permanently continue reducing its debt burden, or also pay out the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have Mikhail Rosseev answering this first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our reports we disclosed the average estimated prices which are being defined by taking the revenue and dividing it by volumes. And here, one must take into account that the exchange rate is also interesting because the average contract price is fixed at the point in time when the operation is done. And we then recalculate it to the average price. So that is the first factor, which is technicality. The second factor which also you need to take into account and that is that a certain amount of our sales we do in the European market where we &#x2013; I should say are basically doing it largely according to the current prices rather than the long-term contracts which on average reduces the average price, which we disclose in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is the precise volume of gas which was sold at spot prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not disclosing this information. Now in terms of the free cash flow question that you've raised, the free cash flow has been used to finance the company's current operations, which include our efforts to reduce the debt burden, funding our investment projects, as well as the dividend payment for last year. But if what you had in mind was the dividend payout intended for next year, this will be seen by the end of the year once we've finalized the year, as well as once we've finalized the profit which is intended for the dividend allocation. And specifically the size of dividend is being calculated once the profit result is identified. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Karen Kostanian, Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question &#x2013; several questions, specifically about the delayed consumption amongst the European consumers. Could you please specify what it was exactly the volume which was delayed? Is it the difference between 160 Bcm, which you mentioned in the beginning of the year, and 140 Bcm that you are mentioning now?</p>
          <p>The second question related to this one is, what is the period of time for which this consumption is being delayed until which period in time your consumers can additionally take the volumes? And what is the amount of the advance payment that you receive? And what happens to these advance payments, if during this period certain volumes are being taken and thus price changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the delayed volumes specifically are concerned, we're not disclosing the exact figures. But there is no direct relationship between the figures of 160 and 140 volume because we're simply talking about the European consumers reducing their overall consumption.</p>
          <p>And speaking about the timeframe for possible delays, we are considering this as the crisis period. And thus, we believe that that might continue for about 2 to 3 years. And as far as the advanced payments are concerned, which we received, and specifically let's say about &#x2013; during 2009, that is approximately US$1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much do you expect in 2010? Can you disclose this figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a bit premature to try and quote any specific figures, because the situation might strongly depend upon what we might see in the fourth quarter this year.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. We're now coming to our final question. And I would like to apologize with those who wanted to ask a question but haven't had time.

          <p>Two questions. The first one, is it possible for you to comment upon the situation with the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline, where potentially the control over this particular section can go to the gas systems Polish company? And what is the way that Gazprom is intending to resolve this situation in Poland? And my second question is, is it possible that other assets, Gazprom's assets in Europe like the currently constructed Nord Stream, could they be susceptible to the similar risks which are related to the process of the further liberalization of the energy markets in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the question. We will have Elena Dirizhina answering this, representing the Department for Foreign Economic Issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for this question. Yes, it is indeed a very delicate and complex issue, because it is related to a forthcoming enactment of the Third Energy Package. At this point in time, Gazprom is involved in bilateral consultations with the Polish counterparts, and also is involved and trying to resolve it as part of the energy dialogue between Europe and Russia. So we're seriously looking into the issues of how our interests could best be protected, where of great significance are the previously concluded intergovernmental agreements which envisage such interest to be protected. So we are involved in this particular effort at a very high level.</p>
