          <p>Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2008 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Brian Roberts, Steve Burke, and Michael Angelakis.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me refer everybody to slide number 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.</p>
          <p>And now for opening remarks, I will pass to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marlene, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased that we are off to such a good start to mark the first quarter results and the beginning of 2008. We made several changes since the end of last year and you will hear great detail from Steve and Mike about them. But taken in total, Comcast delivered healthy growth across almost every metric that includes revenue, operating cash flow, and free cash flow growth. We also had a very strong quarter for unit additions, particularly in high-speed Internet, where we added 492,000 subscribers, and Comcast Digital Voice [CDV], where we added 639,000 new customers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In our last earnings call, we laid out financial priorities. We described a number of steps that we were taking to drive performance in a challenging economic and increasingly competitive environment. And this first quarter's performance demonstrates that this operating strategy is working and we are confident that our outlook for 2008 is quite achievable. We are striking the right balance, focused on profitable growth, while at the same time continuing to make investments in our network and in our products to improve our customers' experience. We believe this is absolutely critical to the customer value proposition, to our competitive advantage, and the best way to create long term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we also continued to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We invested $1 billion to repurchase 2% of our shares outstanding in the quarter. And on April 30, we made our first dividend payment of $185 million.  The combination of strong free cash flow growth and continuing buybacks resulted in free cash flow per share of $0.23, up 64% from last year. Over the last 12 months, we have bought back approximately $3.6 billion of our stock and we are on track to buy back the remaining 5.9 billion under our share repurchase program by year end '09.</p>
          <p>So in the first quarter, we executed strongly against every one of our goals. We remain laser focused on continuing to do that throughout the rest of the year. And with that, let me take you deeper with Mike Angelakis and Steve Burke to cover the numbers and to provide an update on our operations. Mike?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. Please refer to slide 4, which highlights our first quarter consolidated results. The first quarter results are in line with our expectations and are driven primarily by strong operational results in our Cable and our Programming segments as well as the consolidation of the Insight cable system.</p>
          <p>The company's consolidated revenue increased 14% to 8.4 billion and consolidated operating cash flow grew 15% to 3.2 billion. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, our consolidated pro forma revenue growth was 10.3% and our consolidated pro forma operating cash flow growth was 11.5%. Our reported net income for the first quarter was 732 million or $0.24 per share. The quarter results for both this year and last year include gains from the dissolution of our Insight and Texas-Kansas City partnerships. Excluding these gains, our adjusted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.19 per share.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the quarter increased 59% to 702 million, reflecting higher operating cash flow and slightly lower capital expenditures of 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>With pro forma cable revenue growth of 9.8% and pro forma cable operating cash flow growth of 9.3%, our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations. A significant portion of the quarter's positive variance in our consolidated results was generated from other segments, particularly Programming, which has not only benefited from improved viewership trends but also from the timing of some marketing and programming expenses.</p>
          <p>It is early in the year. The environment is challenging. We're about to head into the seasonally slow period for our business. Nevertheless, we remain comfortable with our full year guidance and are pleased with our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Let's review our revenue results in more detail. Please refer to slide five. Pro forma cable revenue for the first quarter of '08 increased 9.8% to 7.9 billion. Our growth in the quarter reflects solid unit growth in high-speed data and CDV. Video revenue growth of 5% reflects price increases offset by continued promotional activity and the effect of a larger portion of our subscriber base in bundled plans. In the first quarter of 2008, 18% of our customers were now in the triple-play bundle.</p>
          <p>High-speed data revenue grew 12% in the quarter, reflecting strong unit additions and stable ARPU on a sequential basis. Phone revenue increased 65%, reflecting strong unit growth. However, phone revenue would have increased 110% if we excluded the decline from our circuit-switched business. With 66,000 circuit subscribers remaining, we expect to be essentially out of that business by the end of second quarter. We are also starting to see traction in Business Services with first quarter '08 revenue of 120 million, up 37% versus last year. Steve will spend more time discussing each of the products later in the call.</p>
          <p>Cable advertising revenue increased 6% in the quarter. However, there was an additional week in this quarter's results as well as an increase in political dollars. If you adjust for the additional week and exclude political, revenue would have decreased approximately 5% for the quarter, highlighting the fact that this business continues to feel the impact of a softer economy, particularly in the auto and housing related categories.</p>
          <p>The Programming division continues to show strong momentum as revenue increased 20% to 363 million in the first quarter, due to higher viewership, higher distribution revenue, and higher advertising, which also included an additional week.</p>
          <p>Comcast Interactive Media, which falls into the Corporate and Other category, also saw strong revenue growth this quarter, particularly driven by the Fandango acquisition, but also the result of increased revenue from search and display advertising.</p>
          <p>Please refer to slide six. The company's consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased to 3.2 billion, an increase of 11.5% for the quarter. Pro forma operating cash flow for the Cable division increased a healthy 9.3% to 3.1 billion, which was slightly less than the 9.8% growth reported on the top line. Therefore, our first quarter '08 Cable operating cash flow margin modestly decreased to 39.7% from 39.9%. The principal drivers of this slight margin contraction were our anticipated increase in marketing. Given the solid results in our unit growth, we would expect to continue to invest in marketing throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Another area is our continued investment in Business Services, which also negatively impacted margins this quarter. Total Business Services expenses nearly doubled this quarter, driven by an increase in head count and an acceleration in marketing for this recently launched service. We are also investing more to improve the overall customer experience, including both in customer service and in our technical operations.</p>
          <p>Despite these increases, we continue to see benefits of our scale on the cost side of our business. For example, we are extracting operating efficiencies in our CDV cost structure and our direct costs per subscriber continue to decline.</p>
          <p>While we're still operating in a challenging economic and competitive environment, we believe several operating strategies we implemented are beginning to yield positive results. For example, we saw a marked improvement in bad debt expense, particularly compared to the third and fourth quarters of last year, driven by higher use of credit screening and behavioral scoring. Bad debt as a percentage of revenue was roughly the same level in this quarter as it was in the first quarter of last year. We are also experiencing some improvements in churn. While churn across most of our products is still slightly higher than year ago levels, our strategy is working, resulting in sequential improvements from the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, our Programming division was a meaningful contributor to this quarter's consolidated operating cash flow growth as the Programming division's OCF increased 76% from 65 million in the first quarter of '07 to 113 million this quarter. In addition to strong Programming revenue growth, Programming operating cash flow also benefited from a delay in some marketing spend as the timing of several new programming launches are now scheduled for later in the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to be very pleased with the Program division's continued growth. However, this was a particularly strong quarter and although we expect the Programming division results to remain strong, we would not this level of growth to continue throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Please refer to slide seven. As you can see, we are building on the increased disclosure for capital expenditures that we provided in our fourth quarter earnings presentation. In both this slide and the press release, we have taken historical capital expenditure categories and allocated them into either growth, maintenance, or discretionary areas.  As I discussed last quarter, we believe this better reflects how we manage our capital allocation.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures for the quarter were 1.4 billion, down approximately 4% compared to pro forma capital expenditures of 1.5 billion in the first quarter of '07. Consolidated CapEx as a percentage of revenue decreased this quarter to 17.1% from the 19.6 in the first quarter of '07. The timing of CapEx will vary from quarter to quarter and as such, we remain comfortable with our full year guidance for CapEx as a percentage of revenue declining to approximately 18% for 2008 from 20% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Consistent with historical trends and our expectation, cable capital expenditures continue to be predominantly growth oriented and directly tied to revenue generation. During the quarter, we added approximately 900,000 digital set-top boxes, approximately 75% which were for advanced digital services such as high-def and/or DVRs. The total number of boxes deployed in this quarter was slightly lower than last year. Please remember in the first half of last year, particularly in the second quarter, we were accelerating our deployment of digital boxes ahead of the July 1, 2007, regulatory deadline. However, capital spent on CPE increased by approximately 50 million this quarter, reflecting an increase in the average cost per set-top box due to the higher cost of cable cards and separable security. In addition, we added 639,000 CDV customers during the same timeframe, the CDV related equipment being the second most expensive component of CPE.</p>
          <p>Please refer to slide eight. Given the continued growth in our operating cash flow and the stable allocation of our capital expenditures, we generated strong free cash flow of 702 million this quarter, an increase of 59% over last year. On a per share basis, we generated $0.23 of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 64% over last year. In fact, our free cash flow would have been $100 million higher except for a one-time payment for long term programming rights which for accounting purposes impacted free cash flow but had a de minimis impact on operating cash flow. Free cash flow generation is clearly a priority for the company, and we are on track to achieve our full year target of at least 20% growth in free cash flow this year.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned many times, we also remain committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our newly established dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly 2%. This equates to the company returning 142% of free cash flow to shareholders in the first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased approximately 3.6 billion of our stock, reducing shares by more than 5%, and returning 137% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Additionally, we paid a quarterly dividend on April 30, totaling 185 million or $0.0625 per share. As of March 31, we had 5.9 billion remaining in our current stock repurchase plan with a goal completing this program by the end of next year. When you factor in the buyback and the dividend commitments, our return of capital targets equate to over $8.4 billion by the end of 2009, or a total of 16.4 from 2005 through 2009.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we remained focused on maintaining our investment grade rating as our financial strength is a critical asset in these difficult credit and competitive markets.</p>
          <p>So while we are pleased with our first quarter results, it's still early in the year and we are about to enter the traditionally slower period. Nevertheless, we remain confident about our full year guidance as we believe our targets are realistic and achievable.</p>
          <p>Now let me pass the call to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Zeroing in on the Cable business, we're pleased with our results in the first quarter.  I think it was a solid quarter and a very good start to 2008. We made a number of adjustments in our business plan at the end of 2007 and the good news is they're working. We moved to a more aggressive marketing plan. We have new packaging with double and single-play offers. We are targeting by geography and competitor more than we were before, and we've improved our credit and collections procedures.</p>
          <p>As we continue to execute on this plan, we are also working to ensure success beyond 2008. As slide 10 shows, our business plan contemplates investing in a number of initiatives to extend our competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>The first is bandwidth reclamation, which for us primarily means converting to an all-digital platform. The idea is to capture over 40 analog channels and use that capacity for more high-def, local channels, and faster Internet speed. We are beginning this reclamation process this year. We should start to take all-digital migration in about 20% of our systems by the end of this year. Our primary near-term capacity tool is this all-digital conversion, but we are still testing switched digital, and believe it will play a significant role in our future.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our VOD [Video on Demand] capacity as well and should have 1,000 high-def choices in most systems by the end of this year and eventually we will roll out Project Infinity, which is our codeword for having a massive amount of video stored in our VOD servers.</p>
          <p>As we recapture bandwidth, we will roll out DOCSIS 3.0, which is our way of increasing high-speed data speeds to up to 100 meg. We have launched this wideband product in the Twin Cities and plan to launch in about 20% of the country during this year. We think this is very important because about two-thirds of our net adds during the first quarter came from DSL. We think with wideband and DOCSIS 3.0, we have an opportunity to gain share with this increased speed.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to invest in the Commercial business and this investment is starting to pay off. As Mike mentioned, our revenue increased 37% in Commercial Services in the first quarter. We are also very optimistic about the future of interactive advertising and have launched a venture with the other MSOs to exploit this opportunity on an industry-wide basis.</p>
          <p>Moving to units on slide 11, in the first quarter, we lost 57,000 basic subscribers and gained 494,000 digital subscribers. Video revenue grew about 5% during the quarter. Our basic subscriber performance varied significantly by geographic area with many regions posting gains and some in particularly competitive areas posting losses. Our digital penetration hit 65% in this quarter, so we're well positioned to start to take more markets all digital. 450,000 of our digital subscribers added advanced services this quarter, either high-def or DVR. We generate good returns on these services.</p>
          <p>As a final point on video, in addition to recapturing bandwidth, we also think that as the country moves to all-digital in terms of the broadcast business, this could create a real opportunity for us to gain new customers. There are over 8 million people in our footprint that don't have cable or satellite and receive their broadcast signals over the air. Many of these people have analog sets and they are going to need to do something. We think we provide a very efficient and attractive option for these people.</p>
          <p>Moving on to high-speed data on slide 12, we had a very strong quarter with 492,000 net adds. Our high-speed data penetration is now over 28% and this business keeps growing nicely. Our DSL conversion rate continues to grow as well. 68% of our new high-speed data customers this quarter came from DSL, up from 55% in the first quarter of 2007. Our new double-play and economy packages are working well. The economy tier is making the phones ring, and two out of three callers take our flagship service when they call about our economy product.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing real traction with our higher speed Blast service. In fact, more people take Blast than economy. We think we're getting the mix of our high-speed data service right. Looking ahead, we think there is plenty of growth left in our high-speed data business. We are particularly excited about DOCSIS 3.0, and the ability to shift share from DSL, and we have speeds that are 5 to 10 times faster than the competition.</p>
          <p>As the next slide shows, we had another strong quarter for our telephone business. We are now the number four phone company in the country. We have over 5 million customers, which is a great result considering that we really launched this business just nine quarters ago. Our penetration is now 11.5%. As this graph shows, we have consistently added over one penetration point per quarter for our phone business. And obviously if we keep this up, we should be over 20% penetration in the next couple of years. As this business grows, we're making good progress taking costs out of the business. As Mike mentioned, our direct costs are declining. In fact, they declined 40% during the quarter versus the quarter a year ago and we think there is room for further efficiency.</p>
          <p>Today, about 18% of our total video customers now take all three of our products, which is double the 9% that were triple-play customers last year at this time. Later this year, we have exciting new product enhancements for our phone service. We think the momentum on this business should continue for some time to come.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14, as we've grown each of our businesses and added new features, our ARPU has increased from $87 in the first quarter of '06 to $107 in the first quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we are off to a strong start in 2008. The adjustments we made to reflect the challenging environment seem to be working well. We are focused on balanced growth, increasing RGUs, and also generating good increases in OCF and free cash flow. Our results for the first quarter make us confident that our full year targets are both realistic and achievable.</p>
          <p>When that, let me pass back to Marlene for some questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Steve.  Operator, please provide us with the instructions for Q&amp;A.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, fantastic quarter; two questions. One, could you be a little bit more specific about how much you have changed your marketing dollars and what your plans are for the rest of the year on what the message is, so just a little bit more on marketing?  And second, Mike, could you just talk a little bit about your target leverage and what you might do with excess financial capacity, whether it's acquisitions or areas of investment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I start, Jessica; marketing was up about 20% in the first quarter, and we have a variety of messages going out. We have a campaign called "More, More, More," which really highlights the fact that we have a lot more high-def programming that people really want on our VOD servers. We're also doing a superiority message called "The Slowskys" on high-speed data. And increasingly, we're doing double and single play promotional offers. So, it's really a mix of all three but we're spending about 20% more than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second part, Jessica. I think we've said numerous times our target leverage is really between 2.5 and 3 times. We really want to maintain our investment grade ratings. And when you look at this year and next year and the commitments we've made regarding the dividend and the buyback, we will be a net borrower just in terms of the dividend and the buyback, which we think is pretty aggressive. So any additional investment we make, we will still have to add on in terms of borrowings, but our target leverage has been &#x2013; we're maintaining that 2.5 to 3 times level.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jessica. Operator, we'll take the next question please.</p>

          <p>Your next question will be from the line of Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning guys. I think I have two on &#x2013; Steve, as you move towards all digital or starting to roll out all-digital towards the end of this year, could you talk about the set-top box plans, what you think relative to the current separable security, I think it's a 100 &#x2013; $125 a set-top?  What do you plan to go to market with on that front, and any update in terms of timing of when that might be ready?  And then a little more on the double-play; I'd be curious how much of your footprint are you out there marketing that product and what's the success level in terms of up-selling people to higher tiers as you roll that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question first. In terms of the double-play, that's essentially everywhere. It varies by market in terms of how it's expressed and how heavily as a percentage of the total marketing mix the double-play represents, but it's pretty much everywhere. Roughly half the time when someone calls in for a double-play, we get that person to buy up and buy more than just the offer that is being advertised, which we think is a good percentage.</p>
          <p>In terms of the all-digital plan, it will be a mix of existing boxes and then starting in the fourth quarter, a reliance on something that we are calling the DTA, which is a Digital to Analog box, a very simple, inexpensive box that costs less than half of what our low-end boxes have traditionally cost, and we will be rolling that out pretty aggressively in the fourth quarter. What we said is we're going to begin the rollout in 20% of our markets during 2009 &#x2013; 2008 and then to a lot more markets in 2009.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will be from the line of Craig Moffett of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning; a question for Steve, if I could. Steve, you're taking about 11 times as many phone subscribers right now as you lost video subscribers, but 9 times as many broadband subscribers. Both of those are much higher margin businesses than video. I know you are reinvesting in Commercial, but can you talk about where you think the margins in this business might go over the longer term as the Commercial business starts to equilibrate with its longer term margin trends and the marketing has reached its steady state for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the way we look at it in terms of the amount of phone customers versus video. Obviously, we would like to gain video customers every quarter. I think with the competitive situation being what it is, that is not going to happen or at least not likely to happen unless some extraneous event occurs like the country's digital transition in February of next year. But to us, if we lose 57,000 basic subscribers and gain 630,000 phone subscribers or 490,000 high-speed data subscribers, that's a pretty good tradeoff.</p>
          <p>I think there is no question the broadband business has a higher margin. I think if you fully load up phone, you could argue at this point in time whether that is higher or lower margin than video. But the real answer on margins I think is that there are so many things going on in the marketplace right now. We mentioned we are increasing our marketing spend. We are doing new kinds of promotional offers. We're trying to react to different types of competitive factors. And therefore, we don't really see or at least I don't really see a major expansion in margin even though we may be getting into some businesses that have higher margin prospects. I do think there is a pretty good chance our margin for this year will end up being higher than our margin was in the first quarter. That is the typical pattern. That happened last year. That happens most years in the cable business. But the notion that because we are getting into higher margin businesses, the overall blended margin of the company is going to grow dramatically, I don't think that is likely to occur.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Brian. Let me just add one other point. The way we are &#x2013; I take your point on the tremendous disparity between wins and losses in terms of units. I look at it in another way. Rather than focusing on margin, I think you should look at how we are delivering multiple products and that we've been able to diversify the revenue stream. So this is not about basic video anymore. The real goal is that we put the marketing plans together, back to the first question about how we're looking at marketing, how we adjusted from the second half of last year to the beginning of this year. And that's what has been able to take ARPU from $96 per average customer up to $107 in the last 12 months.  I view that as a pretty bullish statistic to be looking at in terms of your future prospects.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks; good morning. It looks like you guys took some real flow share on the broadband side. Can you talk about what the drivers were behind that? Was it the marketing spend do you think or what kind of contribution did you get from the double-play?  Also, are there any early insights into the DOCSIS 3.0 rollout in Minneapolis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of DOCSIS 3.0 in Minneapolis, I think it's really too early to tell. We are still at the stage where we are making sure that the technical side is working and we are not as aggressive as we could be with that product.</p>
          <p>In terms of high-speed data net adds, I think it was a lot of different things. The first thing that really struck me is the fact that 67 &#x2013; 68% of our net adds came from DSL and that number is up from last year, and that number continues to climb. And so what you're seeing I think is a number of people go from dial-up to DSL on a one-year or two-year basis, promotional basis, and get frustrated with the fact that speeds are slower than cable and then come to cable. So that's the overarching good trend and we want to put our foot on the accelerator and accelerate that trend with DOCSIS 3.0.</p>
          <p>The second thing is we launched this economy tier, which allows us now to compete and have a price in the market that's much closer to DSL traditional pricing, and that's working really well. What's happening there is that we're getting &#x2013; the phones are ringing and again, it's very similar to the double-play going to triple-play. The phones ring and half or two-thirds of the time, you can get the person who is calling to go into a higher level package. So the economy tier I think is doing its job well. And interestingly, we have a product called Blast, which is a faster product than our flagship and Blast subscriptions are dramatically outpacing economy. So we think we have the right tradeoff there.</p>
          <p>And then the final thing is marketing. We are doing more single product messaging with the Slowsky turtles about high-speed data than we were a year ago. So all of those factors I think are what caused our high-speed data number to be higher than I think most people thought it would be.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you talk specifically about the customer service and field initiatives you've implemented over the last couple of quarters and what impact that they've had on some of the key metrics that you use to measure performance in those functions? And just following on that, can you also talk about how much of your call center resources are onshore versus offshore and if you think there is an opportunity to improve service and/or reduce costs by increasing the offshore part of that mix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just start with that one of our priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year was to begin an overall program to improve the customer experience. It's not just where the calls are answered or answering calls because actually I think we are doing pretty well making progress on that part. It's network reliability. It's the end-to-end experience the customer &#x2013; each individual customer gets and what individual service they get and their feeling about that. And it also has a lot to do with the work volumes because we added 15,000 employees in the last 12 months &#x2013; sorry, 18 months, and getting the training and getting people settled in. And I think we've made some good progress. It's early in the year.</p>
          <p>I think just all the statistics that we review constantly are all &#x2013; and our network engineering team is doing a great job. We've made lots of changes and improvements to our own internal way of operating. There is a lot of detail behind that. We as you know do something in excess of 300 million phone transactions a year and truck rolls and everything else. I think we are very focused on this and I am pleased at a big picture level that it's beginning to take hold. Part of it is simply having ramped up from, as Steve said, 5 million phone customers from a standing start in a little over 2.5 &#x2013; 3 years. That creates a lot of work and now we've caught up to ourselves. We still are adding a lot of units, but the machine is I think functioning quite well.  Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add, some of the metrics we look at in terms of reliability and service are getting much better. And node health, which is the percentage of nodes which are healthy, node health is much better. Our contact rate, the number of our customers that contact us on a monthly or quarterly or annual basis, is starting to come down. It had been climbing as we launched the phone business. And then churn on a sequential basis is down for all of our products. So those are the type of things I think that put facts behind all of the good initiatives and the good efforts that we're making to improve reliability.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning; just two quick questions. The first is Commercial CapEx I think roughly doubled year over year in the first quarter. Is that roughly the right rate of growth we should expect for the balance of the year? And Mike, a question for you; I think you alluded to a $100 million programming investment that impacted free cash flow in the quarter but didn't hit the P&amp;L. Can you just give as little bit more color on what that was? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take both of those, Spencer, thanks. On the Commercial CapEx, I think where we are in the first quarter is a good indication of what each quarter will look like. Clearly CapEx will have some lumpiness and variation, but I think it's a good indication.</p>
          <p>With regards to free cash flow, an accounting aspect, we paid $100 million for a very long term programming rights transaction. Our free cash flow definition actually has that $100 million negatively impacting free cash flow for this quarter, where really that rights deal is amortized over the long period, which is 25 years. So it is a bit of a one-time hit and I just thought it was important that folks recognize that free cash flow although performed well, on a little bit of an apples-to-apples basis performed even a little bit better.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess my first question is on the wideband rollout. I think Steve mentioned the Twin Cities. I wanted to get a sense of what the trends there are, the kind of business plan that you have for the wider rollout of wideband, and what kind of economics that we can expect from that product as you roll it out.</p>
          <p>And separately, also on Project Infinity, my presumption is that the majority of initiative there is going to be on addressable advertising. So I wanted to get a little bit more sense on how you can quantify that upside. And related to that, are you planning any e-commerce initiatives around that Project Infinity as you continue to ramp that up?  Where would you see the opportunity from e-commerce on that platform going in addition to the advertising component? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the DOCSIS 3.0 rollout, it is too early to really tell what's going on in the Twin Cities. We are very optimistic that DOCSIS 3.0 and the ability to offer 50-meg or even more in terms of speed is really going to be a very big competitive advantage for the whole cable industry, but Comcast in particular. And our plan is to roll DOCSIS 3.0 or equip systems for DOCSIS 3.0 in about 20% of the company; it might be little bit higher.</p>
          <p>And the economics of DOCSIS 3.0 are very attractive because actually the equipment, the CMTS equipment in the head ends for a certain amount of capacity is less expensive than the existing equipment. So to the degree that you are rolling out capacity, DOCSIS 3.0 capable equipment is really a very good investment. And then the customer-premises equipment, the eMTAs [embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters] and cable modems, will cost a little bit more in the beginning but it's not a big number. What really is important to us is the ability to get hundreds of thousands of more customers from DSL because we're going to have those speeds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Project Infinity, we really have two projects and you might be linking them a little bit. One is interactive advertising, e-commerce. We call that Project Canoe, so we have a lot of names. And Project Infinity is really designed to say &#x2013; taking that new wideband platform that you asked about and Steve just described, coupled with the storage costs and server capacities and all that coming down. Over the next couple of years, are we going to be in a position to be able to credibly make the claim that you can go anywhere, any video you want on your television set or your PC, the best way to get it is through Comcast.</p>
          <p>And so product superiority, I think is something that we have to maintain, something that we have as of now, and that is why I think we had the kind of quarter we had. I think that's part of the marketing answer. And I think as we create those platforms and people begin to interact more and more with their television, as they now do with their PC, it puts us in a position to deliver an advertising platform and an e-commerce platform that across the industry, not just Comcast, that will allow for targeted ads. The work that we are doing on the infrastructure side, getting the industry banded together, getting to 1,000 high-def choices, having VOD server capacity, standardizing the platform, all that is in the CapEx numbers that you are seeing and in the plumbing side of the business. And I think in my opening remarks, it's that duality of the here and now of the results coupled with how do we stay focused on product superiority.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning; so a couple of quick questions, the first on your wireless strategy. I think there was some speculation in the press that there was a potential JV between Sprint, Clearwire, and the cable companies. It seems that that announcement has been somewhat delayed. I was wondering what kind of hurdles there would be to that sort of JV, and is that indeed your wireless strategy.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on day-and-date, Time Warner said yesterday that they are very excited about rolling out Warner Brothers content day-and-date on VOD with DVD. I was just wondering if you are going to be rolling that out nationwide if you've seen other studios do the same thing. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on wireless, there's really not much that we can say on any market speculation, but what I think we can say is that really our focus has not changed. We've consistently said that we don't believe we have a competitive disadvantage today in the cell phone business and the text messaging business, that really our focus is down the road; should we and will we be wanting to be in a position that we can extend services outside of the home, create new features that integrate that are compelling to the consumer. And to that end, we've hired some folks to help us in our wireless thinking and navigating through the variety of options that we continually get thrown our way. But we are going to be very disciplined and capital efficient, try to come up with structures if we do something that will make a lot of sense. Beyond that, I don't think there's much we can say.</p>
          <p>So on day-and-date, we've been having day-and-date with the majority of studios in three of our markets representing somewhere around 10% of our company for the last &#x2013; I don't know, 18 months or so, maybe two years. We think the Warner Brothers move is really a smart one for Warner Brothers and it's completely supported by the research that we've done in terms of what happens in a market when a studio releases films on a day-and-date basis. It's net accretive to the profitability of that film's windowing; and we are hoping other studios follow. I think there are a number of studios taking a wait and see approach. But it really makes sense I think to give people what they want when they want it. So there is an inevitability in the air in terms of day-and-date and we're really happy Warner Brothers took the step they did.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two, first for Steve. Can you just talk about the philosophy on this new DTA strategy? From what I've read, it seems that while it's a low-cost solution and maybe a good way to digitize the network, there are limitations on the ability to up-sell given I think it's a one-way component. So could you talk about how that fits into your broader way of improving efficiency on the network? And a question for Mike, very quickly on the government stimulus package, you mentioned something in your press release. Was there any benefit in the quarter or is there something coming for the rest of '08? Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the D-to-A philosophy, I think it's important to remember that we're over 65% digital with two-way boxes today and that number, the 65, is going to go up. So when we start taking markets to all-digital, we'll be call it 70% in most markets. And then of the remaining 30, there is a portion of those people who have lifeline service and those people are not going to get any digital coverage because the channels that we will be reclaiming they don't receive. So the percentage of people that we are talking about because we and everybody else in the industry have put so many boxes out has gotten fairly small.</p>
          <p>In many of the remaining homes, we are going to put two-way boxes into those homes, if we believe for a variety of reasons that makes sense. But the D-to-A boxes to get the cost down, you're correct. Those are one-way boxes. They have no guide; they have no ability to access VOD, but we think they are perfect for additional outlets for someone's third television set in the kitchen. We also think they are perfect for someone who says look, I just want my television channels. I really don't want VOD. I really don't want to subscribe to HBO or Starz or Showtime. So for cost reasons for many customers, we think those D-to-A devices make sense.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the second part, Vijay, with regard to the stimulus package. There is absolutely no impact from the stimulus package in the first quarter. We will begin to see an impact in the second quarter and the rest of the year, as really the stimulus package allows us to reduce cash taxes. What we're going to do next quarter and beyond is articulate exactly what that impact is so that number one, you can see the transparency of the stimulus package, as well as we are keeping our free cash flow definition on an apples-to-apples basis. So we will begin to show that next quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wondered if you could give us a quick comment on what you're seeing in the Pay-TV category from a subscriber perspective. So we saw very strong subscriber adds from the Bells. We saw growth in basic from Time Warner Cable yesterday, and actually better than expected basic trends from you guys this morning. Is it because you're marketing more effectively against satellite or is there an improvement in growth in the overall category? Any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with the housing market the way it is, it's in my opinion unlikely that the overall pay market is increasing. I don't know; there might be people who would differ with that opinion, but that would be my sense.</p>
          <p>I do think what's happening and I can really only speak for Comcast is that when the economy started to weaken, we had a number of variables in our business three or six months ago that we've now made adjustments to address. And so credit and collections we're doing differently, more flexibly than we were. This is a very price-sensitive time. I think in the pay television business and you got to be very careful how you manage that, manage your offers. Increased marketing I think is important when you have competitors that are marketing. So really I look at the trends that improved for us this quarter as being the result of the adjustments we made three or six months ago. The good news is, when you make ten adjustments to a business and nine or ten of them work and you see that in the marketplace, it makes you confident that you got it right. And that's how we feel now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to conclude by saying I think we are off to a solid start. We will continue to stay focused on getting that balance right that Steve just talked about and the question it implies which is, how much on video, how much on other products? We've been spending a lot of time on product superiority. I think that's taking hold, more operating efficiencies, and returning capital to shareholders. So we will talk to you soon.
