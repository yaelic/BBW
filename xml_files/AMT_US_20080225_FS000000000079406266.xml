          <p>Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the American Tower Company fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Powell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's conference call regarding our preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial information. We'll begin with comments from Brad Singer, our Chief Financial Officer, who will then turn things over to Jim Taiclet, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. After these comments we will of course open the call open for further questions.</p>
          <p>However, before I turn the call over to Brad I'd like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. And examples of these statements include statements regarding our full-year 2008 outlook, the evaluation of our potential tax related adjustments to our financial statements, the timing of our filings Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and any other statements or matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may fact us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release and those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 and any of our other filings with the SEC. We urging you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances. And now I'd like to turn things over to Brad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. Before we get started on our result I'd like to highlight that we are reporting only selected financial information for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007. In today's press release we announced that the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of certain non-cash tax related items on its financial statement including potential adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities. A significant portion of the evaluation was undertaken primarily as a result of the settlement of various bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation, which was approved by the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result we are unable at this time to provide complete financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007 and accordingly all financial information presented on this call remains subject to the completion of our analysis and the completion of our year-end audit. However we believe that the financial information released today would not be affected by the potential non-cash tax related adjustments and that the adjustments will not have an impact on our historical revenues, adjusted EBITDA, cash flows from operations, or pre-tax income from continuing operations.</p>
          <p>The Company intends to report its complete financial results and file a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 as soon as practicable. While we anticipate that we will be able to file the Form 10-K within the 15-day period permitted, due to the complexity of the analysis and depending on the final outcome of our evaluation we may need up to four weeks to prepare and file the Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>American Tower successfully completed the year, delivering strong operating performance while continuing to invest in its ongoing operations. We ended 2007 with record levels of revenue, gross margin, and free cash flow and in a strong financial position. For 2007 our top line revenue growth, gross margin, and free cash flow met or exceeded our expectations, marking the sixth consecutive year that American Tower has met or exceeded the Tower revenue, gross margin, or operating profit outlook that was provided at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter total revenue increased 12% to more than 378 million and 11% for the full year compared to 2006. Our performance was driven primarily by organic revenue growth in our Rental Management division, which increased 12% to over 370 million for the fourth quarter. Our Tower gross margin increased 14% to 284 million for the quarter. In the fourth quarter we achieved our largest quarterly commenced new business in our history, which was over 125 million of annualized revenue, which excludes any escalators. Please note that our fourth quarter revenues include approximately 3.5 million of positive non recurring items that were not included in our previously disclosed outlook related to non-cash straight-line revenue adjustments and a cash settlement from one of our customers.</p>
          <p>Our expenses included 1.5 million of non-recurring negative items resulting in an unforecasted positive contribution to gross margin of 2 million. For the full year 2007 our results are approximately 23 million and 24 million above our initial 2007 Tower revenue and gross margin midpoint outlook provided to investors in late 2006. Our total selling, general and administrative expense was 46 million including 11 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Our SG&amp;A expense also includes approximately 3.2 million of cost associated with the historic stock-option review and related matters which includes 1.5 million of net expense related to the anticipated settlement of the class-action lawsuit. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, our fourth-quarter Tower and gross service margins less SG&amp;A increased 16% to over 253 million. For the full year, 2007, our Tower and service gross margins less SG&amp;A grew 13% to 980 million. Our operating income for the quarter increased 38% to 101 million from the prior year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled 47.4 million. During the quarter we successfully completed the construction of 66 towers and two in-building installations with momentum through a solid pipeline of domestic and international new builds -- new tower builds going into 2008. The average un-levered day one return on new towers and in-building projects was approximately 15% with strong prospects for additional tenants likely to further increase our future returns on invested capital.</p>
          <p>In addition to our construction activities we acquired 181 towers during the quarter for approximately 23 million. For the year, we built 152 towers and completed the installation of 17 in-building sites, which was below our original expectations. In combination with the 293 towers we acquired during the year we added a total of 462 towers and in-building units to our portfolio during 2007, which produced initial returns of approximately 13%. We also increased our land purchase activity, acquiring 13 million of land in the fourth quarter and over 44 million for the year.</p>
          <p>With our strong revenue growth and disciplined capital spending and cost control we produced approximately 540 million organic free cash flow for 2007. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operations less all capital expenditures. Please note that the free cash flow calculation include a 111 million of discretionary capital spending on construction of new towers and in-building sites, land purchases, and capital to redevelop existing sites for additional tenant demand.</p>
          <p>We are refining our 2008 outlook. We continue to anticipate levels of commenced new business to be higher than 2007 levels. We are raising our initial 2008 revenue guidance by approximately 12.5 million at the midpoint of our outlook. We expect incremental Tower revenues to increase by approximately 120 to 140 million, offset by an approximate 25 million decrease in the non-cash straight-line revenue. As we discussed in our last earnings call, the decrease in straight-line revenue is the normalized decline that would've occurred in 2006 and 2007 without the multiple ten-year extensions which were signed with our national carriers and that we previously disclosed relating to increased straight-line revenue in 2006 and slightly increased straight-line revenue year-over-year in 2007.</p>
          <p>On a cash basis we anticipate Tower revenues increasing approximately 8 to 10% and 6.5 to 8% on a GAAP basis inclusive of the straight-line effect. We anticipate converting approximately 80 to 90% of incremental Tower revenues to gross margin. In addition to typical inflationary levels of increase in SG&amp;A we expect an increase of 4 million related to our international expansion effort. Based on the strong levels of customer demand, we anticipate 2008 Tower and Service gross margins, less SG&amp;A excluding non-cash comp, to increased 95 to 120 million for 2007 excluding the reduction in straight-line revenue of approximately 25 million and 14 million in costs incurred related to the historic option review in 2007.</p>
          <p>We have increased our capital spending expectations for 2008. As a result of several initiatives focused on our tower construction pipeline, we now anticipate that we will build between 300 to 400 new towers in 2008. In addition, we expect to increase our land acquisition activities and are targeting investing 40 to 60 million. We also anticipate our redevelopment efforts will be greater primarily driven by our activity in our international markets. As a result we increased our outlook for total capital spending to between 185 and 215 million. If we are successful in executing our build plans and land repurchase initiatives, our capital spending may increase beyond our current outlook. Our financial position remains solid due to the strength of our operations and fundamentals of the wireless industry.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 8.9 million of our shares pursuant to our stock-option purchase program for approximately 385 million with an additional 4.3 million shares for 164 million subsequent to the end of 2007. As a result we have repurchased over the past year and a half a total of 2.2 billion representing over 57 million shares. We will update investors on future share repurchase plans when we complete the review of the non-cash tax related items and file the appropriate documents with the SEC. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders if we do not have a productive investment opportunity in our core tower business. With spring training beginning last week, we look forward to 2008 as the Red Sox begin to work hard on defending the World Series title and we continue to produce industry-leading results. I will now turn things the Chairman and CEO of American Tower, Jim Taiclet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brad. In light of the excellent operational results that Brad just reviewed I would like to first highlight for our investors on the call and express my deep appreciation to our managers and employees both in the US and our international markets. These are the talented and energetic people who make the sales calls, find the towers, draft the lease documents, make the ledger entries and do the many, many other critical tasks that enable our company to deliver this kind of performance. Our company, our whole organization, is poised for a strong year of growth in 2008. As reflected in our updated guidance we anticipate 2008 will be one of our strongest years of commenced new business.</p>
          <p>Importantly we believe this growth will also have the most diverse and evenly proportioned spread of sources that we have experienced in the company's history. In the US we expect meaningful contributions from all four national carrier legacy networks, both Leap Wireless and MetroPCS as they roll out their Auction 66 spectrum and from a portion of the initial planned WiMAX deployments by Clearwire and Sprint. Moreover, we anticipate an active year in both Mexico and Brazil from a number of carriers including Claro, Vivo and Oy, all of which have secured additional licenses in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In sum, we feel good about the scale and scope of our new business in 2008. There are also a number of trends evident in wireless that we believe will support strong demand for tower space well into the future. These trends reinforce two continuing themes: the ever-growing importance of mobility in telecommunications and the industry's drive towards greater bandwidth and speed.</p>
          <p>As for the growing role of mobility, there's mounting evidence. In 2007 wireless minutes were well in excess of wired minutes and the trend lines continue to diverge. The country's two largest telecommunications companies, AT&amp;T and Verizon, have publicly stated their dedication to wireless services and have recently taken some notable steps. These include AT&amp;T's successful launch of the Apple iPhone and its purchase of 700 MHz spectrum in advance of the current auction, and Verizon's announcement of LTE as its directional technology choice for the future.</p>
          <p>And even while wireless penetration and usage rates continue to grow, it is evident that it's critical that wireless carriers of all types seek to protect and grow their revenue base. Consequently, carriers continue to invest in marketing, handsets and network quality to keep their existing customers and are striving to keep churn to a minimum. Yet another example of these types of innovations is the premium unlimited usage plans recently unveiled by three US national carriers. Ongoing network investment will be required to offer these types of plans with competitive signal quality and coverage. So while mobility is becoming more and more important, a second theme is the advancement of all the elements necessary to take us from a 2.5G to a 3G, to a 4G world in US telecommunications. Just as it took a wide range of industry players to bring the wired Internet from dial-up speed to today's multi-megabit speeds it will take a broad array of technology, hardware and software companies to develop widespread mobile data services in the three plus megabit per second range.</p>
          <p>Major investments in technology, hardware and software are all necessary to advance wireless speeds and bandwidth towards today's wired high-speed Internet offerings that are available through cable modems and DSL. We are now seeing the leading players in the technology hardware and software industries making major commitments to investing in wireless products and services.</p>
          <p>To mention just a few prominent examples, on the technology front is Intel with its WiMAX challenge to the 4G aspirations of QUALCOMM and the GSM Consortium. With respect to handset hardware, Apple's entry with the iPhone is a landmark event that could encourage additional consumer product leaders to focus on wireless devices. Regarding software, Google's recent activism in the wireless space should facilitate bringing not only its own resources to the industry but that of independent application writers as well. And while technology hardware and software are all essentially advancing towards 4G, the capacity and motivation of the wireless carriers to invest in their networks to deliver the requisite speed and bandwidth are crucial.</p>
          <p>Carrier economics will drive these investments and as voice service matures wireless carriers are likely to increasingly look towards high-speed data services for future revenue growth. Verizon and AT&amp;T both appear to be committed to an LTE upgrade path over the next few years and Sprint and Clearwire are already doing trials and deploying higher-speed WiMAX markets.</p>
          <p>Prices for 700 MHz spectrum in the current FCC auction are exceeding expectations indicating that this spectrum is a valuable enabler for a widely offered high-speed next-generation service. For tower companies, the deployment of 4G networks would lengthen and strengthen the demand for tower space. Both 3G and 4G networks drive augmentations of existing cell sites and they drive new cell sites required for the more dense networks that will ultimately will be necessary to deliver these types of services. And so the most important strategic and investment question for American Tower is; will the wireless industry move towards deploying high-speed services for broad consumption in the US over the next five to eight years?</p>
          <p>We believe the answer is yes. We see the major pieces coming together, carrier financial strength and business motivation, sufficient spectrum availability, enabling technologies from inside and outside the current OEMs, consumer-friendly handsets and bandwidth-hungry software applications such as music and social networking. Consequently, our company's strategy remains steady, seek to add quality assets to our portfolio both in the US which will remain a strong center of gravity of our company and in select international markets. Continuing to improve the operational performance of our assets by maximizing revenue growth and maintaining disciplined cost and CapEx control. And finally, maintain financial flexibility with reasonable leverage and a diversity of financial instruments and tenors.</p>
          <p>Our strategy we believe enables our company to prosper in a range of economic and capital market scenarios. We're confident that our business will perform well in 2008 underpinning our increased guidance for the year and we also expect that our strong balance sheet will provide the access to capital to invest in our business and once our full financial statements are completed, readdress our historical practice of returning excess capital to shareholders. Thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today and at this time Brad and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple questions for you, probably start with a couple for Brad. On the guidance, can you kind of update us as far as what gave you the comfort to take the guidance up? Was it the leasing activity that you talked about seeing some pretty strong stuff in fourth quarter? Was it the 180 towers that you guys have bought since the end of the quarter? And also on that 95 $120 million number you threw out there, was that on cash EBITDA as far as year-over-year growth? I was trying to compare that to what the last guidance you gave for '08 was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me take them in order. What gave us confidence to increase the revenue midpoint, was a combination of both things. It was primarily due to new business, we had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, the best in our history and in terms of what was signed. It's based on the pipeline of what we have signed and how we are running and then the acquisition was also a portion not quite as much as the new business but it did contribute to it. And so it's all those things that really plays into taking the numbers up, but we feel that based on where we are today that those numbers are very justifiable and gives an appropriate outlook.</p>
          <p>With respect to -- it's not adjusted EBITDA, it is gross margin less SG&amp;A and adding back non-cash comp which could be construed as a proxy for adjusted EBITDA but not by name. What we had last time was really to make it cash based is we only, we took it as a GAAP number so to speak by factoring in the $25 million decrease. Here we just took everything down to a cash level and that's the numbers I got it to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that 95 to 120 million excludes the 25 million non-cash straight-line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And adds back and also deducts the 14 million in stock option review costs &#x2013; so it's apples-to-apples since we had none in 2008 we should take it out of our gross margin less SG&amp;A adding back non-cash comp number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question for you, with the review of the tax asset and liabilities, any expected change to your net operating losses? Or can you just kind of update us as far as how large is your NOLs right now and when do you think that will carry you through in terms of not being a significant cash tax payer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. This is not a tax issue, so to speak, as it impacts our tax NOLs. This is a GAAP issue in terms of how they're accounted for. So I just want to differentiate that the actual NOL itself that we would be utilizing in our tax returns, we don't anticipate a change in, as the work stands today. And so what you are really dealing with is how is it accounted for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your NOL should carry you through? How much do you have left -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have about 1.7 billion of NOLs, and that should carry us through this decade and maybe a year or two beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the final question for you is, I think, Jim, in your comments, you mentioned update to the stock buybacks would be after the year-end audit. How's that -- why the delay in kind of updating your thoughts on the buyback program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg we'd rather just get the financial statements out so we can implement a 10b5 program. To do it the opposite way would not enable you to do a 10b5, plus you just want to have good statements out there that go all the way down to net income before we make any announcements on equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it really is more kind of the program method that you guys have used as far as doing the program in the past.</p>
          <p>10b5 program That's correct. Because what happens is our natural blackout periods, Ric, begin prior to when you end the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a March 31st, and then we have a natural blackout. You need to sign those programs up and put them in place to be able to be active prior to the blackout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. Great. Thanks guys.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions. I guess first, if there's an update in terms of specifically what's going on on the ground in India and Latin America in terms of the relative investments you're making there versus the US. And the second part of the question would be if you look at the acquisition opportunities, because of your balance sheet and the market environment we're in and also given your outlook for how you feel the future is going to play out in terms of site co-location demand, is this the time to really accelerate the M&amp;A activity, whether it's building out more of a portfolio in Latin America, the US, or, you know, again you've talked about Indian the past? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Mike. It's Jim. Well, first of all you've already heard Brad talk about, you know, raising our expectation of tower builds, right? So the most sort of controllable activity in our most mature markets, US, Mexico and Brazil, we're already moving ahead with a higher build plan, so that's the first point. Second point, I just want to start by reiterating that we expect the US tower domestic operation to remain the center of gravity for the company for the foreseeable future, and it's -- I think you know, it's 87% of our revenue base today. But to complement and further diversify that existing revenue base, we're evaluating a range of investment opportunities on a number of dimensions you guys have heard us talk about before; country attributes, asset quality, growth prospects, and you can be assured that the historical discipline that we've applied when looking at investments in the past, we're also applying them today as we actively evaluate new international markets. And so we don't have an announcable transaction today, Mike, but that's, you know, the consistent theme of how we're approaching this.</p>
          <p>Where are the opportunities? I think you named two of the top on our list, and I'll start with Latin America. Again, we have existing operations. We have customers that are common in those two countries, Mexico and Brazil and additional countries, so we've got a very strong focus on adding potential countries in Latin America and expanding in-market as we've already talked about. India, we've got a team on the ground. They're assessing the opportunities today. You haven't seen us act in some of the auction situations. That's been purposeful on our part. We've been able to see them, and we've decided not to participate.</p>
          <p>So just what we ask is give us some time. We will either make a revenue-generating investment in the near to mid future or a we'll decelerate some of our SG&amp;A investment in looking at these things. So we don't have anything today, Mike, but, again, that's the consistent way we're looking at it, and everything's on a risk-adjusted return, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow up, can you give us a little more description as to where the 180 towers were that you acquired? Was that US? Was that Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those were primarily Latin America and kind of consistent with how our dollars were spent this year, which was 30% of our acquisitions were US-based in dollar terms, and 70% were international. The returns that we averaged were roughly between 13.5 and 14% initial returns un-levered on that money.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I had a question about tower cash flow margins, sequentially, I think the trend might have been down a bit from 3Q to 4Q, wondering what drove that? And then with respect to just activity on the ground in Mexico and Brazil, can you comment on the activity of kind of the legacy carriers and then you mentioned new license build-outs. Can you give us just a little bit more operational color for each country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. This is Brad, I'll start, and then I'll turn over the Latin America question to Jim. The reason for the sequential decline was, if you remember last quarter, we had one-time items that were fairly substantial, so we had a $4 million one-time gain in revenue, and we had a $2.5 million one-time benefit in expense. So those didn't exist this quarter, and -- you know, that's a fairly significant one-time that causes margins to go up when you reduce expenses and you increase revenue. In the fourth quarter, we also had, you know, just operationally when you strip out the one-time items, it's usually a pretty -- it was a heavy quarter for R&amp;M as we do certain year-end projects that are finally done, and then we also had a little bit of up tick in non-cash ground lease expense related to some of the buyouts that we have been doing or extending of leases because we do extend a lot of our leases. If they have 20 years to go, we extend that sometimes another 20 years, and so you have to then increase your straight-line over that period of time. So those are the major drivers in terms of the sequential gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and, Jonathan, it's Jim. When it comes to Mexico and Brazil, we're going to see a lot of activity from our existing carriers, especially out of Usticel, combined now with UniPhone in Mexico, also sort of a run-rate level of business from Telcel and Telefonica and Nextel International too. And then there is a few new WiMAX and fixed wireless players in Mexico, probably modest, but beneficial nonetheless, MVS, Axtell, and Telmex, the wired phone company, is actually getting into some fixed wireless projects as well. In Brazil, Claro and Vivo, which are American Movil and Telefonica affiliates respectively, both acquired additional spectrum to give them nationwide coverage, so they'll be doing some build-outs there. Oy acquired a new license in Sao Paulo State and also there's a new carrier called Unicel that's gearing up to do a roll out in Sao Paulo also. So those are the sources of much of the new business, this coming year in Mexico and Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then of the 70% of new tower builds that are international, what's then the rough mix respectively as well as maybe for '07 between Mexico and Brazil of that 70% in other words?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Our whole goal is really to extend out anything we have, even though it's a small subset of our ground leases.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In the release, you mentioned looking at a range of economic and capital market scenarios. Obviously you're going to need to get the financials out, but with your strategy of the prudent financial leverage and the diversifying of the capital structure, can you discuss some of those scenarios that you're seeing, particularly capital markets and how that's going to weigh on your considerations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You know, we finance ourselves in three primary markets, which is the securitization market, the bank market -- and that's relationship bank, not the term B, more broad investor market -- and then the typical corporate debt markets which are bonds. The securitization market is very challenging and very volatile with very few new issues and spreads that have gapped up dramatically and well beyond any historic levels that's been seen. That market may take time to ultimately settle out, and it may never settle back to where it was since that was really where the securitization market was at a historically tight levels.</p>
          <p>So that puts us towards the bank market and the bond market. Both are open to us. I think the key is to be selective, especially in the bond market because that is -- there's opportunities. We can use our good credit ratings to issue, but you just don't want to do it in a period which you have a lot of volatility. So you just wait your time and move forward. The bank market, we also have very good relationships with all our banks. That's a market that is again open. There's a finite amount of capital in the bank market. I don't think our current facility is at that finite amount of capital; but again, you can go up, but you only can go up so much. And that's how I would portray it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think as of year-end we had 825 million outstanding. There was a $1.25 billion revolver, so you've got a little over 425 million in there -- a little less actually because there's a few letters of credit that count against it, and so that's where we ended the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last point of clarification, I think you mentioned in your guidance that you are assuming about $9 million of expenses in your SG&amp;A for international business development. I don't think you -- had you previously disclosed what that was? I am just wondering if that changed with the update to your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should not have. Maybe a million, it wasn't -- I think it's below a $1 million that changed from our November budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Brett, in the past we didn't break it out, it was five-ish million I think the number was in 2007 going to 9 and we just wanted to give you visibility to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question, you said the buyback that you currently have is substantially complete. Are you actually going to complete that even if you haven't completed your tax review or is that actually on hold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we've completed 2.2 billion as of -- 2.25 billion and what our typical practice, we don't discuss timing of our share repurchases because we do them under 10b5, so we don't really veer from that practice because a lot of our plans are usually under automatic execution.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two real quick ones, Brad, just in terms of the expectation for the four weeks for the 10-K, obviously we've made estimates before about getting re-statements done and the time it takes and so I was just wondering just if you could kind of give us some comfort level on your estimate for that four weeks would be appreciated? And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a quick question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a quick one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the timetable where we expect to file a statement, unlike -- the reason the last time this got delayed or last time we made estimates concerning the stock option review, that was a different type of issue, different type of review. This is an isolated issue, we've done a ton of work over the last few weeks to get our hands around it and nearing completion of that. And then it's working at valuing the materiality of it and what do you do, you'd be on the shorter end of that timetable if you don't think it's material and if you do think it's material, you'd be more towards the longer end. But hopefully even inside of that, but I think because of that it gives us a decent amount of confidence that estimate was created with our auditors and reviewing of where we are in this process and so I think we feel that's a pretty good number. If nothing is certain in life, but we do feel pretty good that that timetable is a pretty good timetable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Thanks. And I mean just the second question again, it's more on this related theme of the credit markets, et cetera, so I'm just looking back from three months ago to today, the capital budget is way up, obviously you've shared some good reasons why you want to spend that money, but it is a very -- kind of a sharp increase just over a handful of months. Obviously you guys continue to remain at the very low end of the leverage range, borrowing costs are way up, we were kind of expecting a buyback announcement, but obviously that's going to come in a few weeks presumably. But I guess as I sit here I just wonder if given the overall more conservative nature of American Tower when it comes to the balance sheet, is it prudent to kind of just think about you guys maybe pulling in your horns a little bit from the standpoint of leverage and getting too aggressive on stock buybacks in the current climate? Or am I reading too much into kind of the recipe of things that we're seeing come together this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're reading too much into it would be my initial statement. If you look at our money that we put to work, that we raised guidance, we're raising the number of new builds, we're also buying a little bit more land, our returns; acquisitions and new builds, are about the same, it's 13% un-levered. That's day one, they do grow and you add more tenants, pretty good numbers. Our credit costs, while higher than they were three months or six months ago, they're not that much higher. Our bonds trade above par, that's a 7% bond. So implicit as of Friday it was below a 7% rate. Our bank, when you swap out debt, the banks with LIBOR, you get 3% LIBOR and it's plus 75 basis points, under 4% money. If we were to raise new facilities it would cost more, but not dramatically more because LIBOR has come down. So all of those things you have to take into account, the securitization market is what it is, as I noted, not accommodating right now and it may not be for quite a long period of time. But we don't feel we're capital constrained from that, you just have to be thoughtful about when you enter the market and that's the key.</p>
          <p>So if we have good returns and we're putting money into these productive assets, that makes a lot of sense. Our share, it's clearly better to buy more at lower prices than at higher prices. So our shares have come down more than our borrowing costs have gone up. So again, it's a pretty good recipe for putting money to work and that's how I portray it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you at all incrementally more gun shy about moving the leverage back up into the middle of the range to take advantage of the fact that the stock is down harder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a relative discussion of share price. Where we have moved over the last three quarters is up towards kind of the 4.5-ish range on an LTM basis. Even if we held it there, because we generate close to 600 million of cash flow even after all these projects we highlighted, you still have -- where you see what our EBITDA grows, if it grows 100 -- or I'm sorry, our gross margin is up, SG&amp;A is adding back non-cash comps, you get another 500 million or 600 million, so even to hold it steady, you're at 1.2 billion. So even moving up or down you have a lot of capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Hey, Richard, it's really two parts, I think you nailed both of them in your question, which is, it's the contracts we have signed, which are money good and then it's what are anticipated based on talking to our customers that they're planning to spend and really this market stays specifically identified working with them . So could those change? They could. Are they material to our guidance? Not particularly, and so that's how I'd portray that in terms of the impact, whether WiMAX comes to fruition in markets that they've discussed with us, or they don't.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the M&amp;A environment in the US? I know that you acquired a lot of towers in 4Q outside, but wondering if maybe there are some sizable opportunities still left in the states or if it's now pretty much down to mom-and-pop? And then just following onto one of the previous questions you talked a little bit about the cost of borrowing coming down faster or not rising as fast, wondering if that's still the same for M&amp;A, are you seeing the costs of M&amp;A now down more than the costs of borrowing have increased? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Jim Taiclet. The major sources remaining of towers in the US we have talked about in the past, they're T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, the public tower companies. There is no public indication that any of those are available or on the market at this point in time. That takes you down to really if you want to call them mom-and-pop, multiple hundred tower-type businesses down to the 10s and 20s. They're almost always "for sale", but have we seen prices diminish dramatically over the last couple quarters? Not necessarily. So again, we're being prudent, we look at the opportunities, we apply our risk-adjusted return based on the quality of the assets and we move or we don't move. Again, you didn't hear us talk about major numbers of acquisitions in the US in the fourth quarter, so that's probably an indicator for you.</p>

          <p>I would also -- the only thing I would add is on the small private company side, what we have seen is several deals pulled because they could not get the value they were asking.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a follow-up on an earlier question, if Clearwire were to accelerate their builds back to the initial 30 million pops that they had targeted from the 6 million that they're targeting now, I'm wondering what that would mean for your guidance, if it would even be material? I'm assuming the discussions you're having with them at the moment are only on the 6 million that they're now targeting for this year? And I'm also wondering if you have a preliminary estimate of what the unlimited plans could do to demand over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Jonathan, it's Jim. If Clearwire were to sort of reinvigorate its build plan. That the lead-time of doing that, getting people deployed into markets, doing site acquisition in conjunction with us, et cetera, would lead you to sort of back-end of the year lease signings and maybe some commencements, so it wouldn't move us past the top end of our guidance, even if they re-engaged into the $30 million pop build-out. But it would be helpful and we'd love to see it. Second question, the unlimited plans from some of the major carriers that have been rolled out, they're at the high end, which is a good thing, meaning if you're going to charge people 99 bucks a month, you're going for the quality subscriber, they're going to expect quality network service. And again it should support their CapEx budgets to deliver that service over the next few years. It won't be a dramatic spike, doubtful, but will it again lengthen and strengthen what these major carriers are going to invest in their networks to compete with each other? Yes.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Two quick questions, can you comment on '08 free cash flow guidance? I noticed you didn't update that and since you had updated revenue and gross margins, I'm wondering why they don't seem to flow through to free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason for that is when we do free cash flow we usually incorporate our estimate of interest expense related to any share repurchases, so you have all the elements if you want to assume from our last outlook, the interest expense prior to any announcements if we do announce another share repurchase, then you can just have all the building blocks. And you can just move up the cash from operations based on the increase in our guidance and decrease it by the CapEx that we put in it. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes, that is helpful. One other question I have is given your accelerating rate of ground lease acquisitions, can you tell us what percent of your towers are now on land that you own and where that number might be in a year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The percent is right around 16 or 17% and that's all domestic so it's higher if you put that percentage over the domestic portfolio because we don't buy the land in Mexico and Brazil currently as land costs are passed through to our customers. So the numbers across that percentage is probably a little bit understated relative if you see our peers, because their portfolio -- because they don't have 13% of their portfolio international. And that's how I portray it. Was there a second part to that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, oh, yes, and where you might see that number in a year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, again &#x2013; the varied range of what it costs us per piece of land really is varied from what we're paying ground rent so you can assume let's say you pay $100,000 a site, that's going to move somewhere between 400 and 600 sites into the portfolio and on top of what we have and we have almost 23,000 sites.</p>
