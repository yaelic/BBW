          <p>As David said, our momentum in customer growth is translating into top, and importantly, bottom line financial performance.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the key reported numbers. These are in line with the expectations we shared with you in November at our Investor Day. Total revenue has grown 1.1% to $12.4 billion. This reflects the benefits that come from growing our customer base and investing in strategic opportunities like network applications and services.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew 3.7% to $4.8 billion. This result is a result of top line growth and a reduction in operating expenses &#x2013; productivity initiatives and reduced impairment charges are the main drivers for the reduction in OpEx. The EBIT growth is strong at 7.9%. Accrued CapEx was $1.7 billion in the half or 13.8% of sales and free cash flow was $1.8 billion. I'll come back to these numbers and the drivers of half-on-half growth shortly.</p>
          <p>We have announced another $0.14 interim fully franked dividend. Finally, we have provided half year growth rates for total revenue and EBITDA on a reported and guidance basis. The guidance basis has been adjusted for the impairment of L Mobile and the impact of the ACCC final determination. There is a reconciliation of these adjustments at the back of the financial highlights document. On a guidance basis, revenue was up 1.2% and EBITDA increased 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Let's move on and have a look at the product revenues. This chart gives you an overview of the product revenue movements in the half. It highlights the trends we spoke about at Investor Day last November. Mobiles growth is particularly strong. In the first half, we saw $430 million of incremental mobile revenue. This more than offsets the declines in Sensis and PSTN. The Sensis decline is exaggerated by the timing of the distribution of the Perth Yellow Pages book. Revenue from this book will be recognized in the second half of this fiscal year. Last fiscal year, it was recognized in the first half. We expect this change will boost our second half revenue by $53 million. We have also seen strong results from NAS and retail fixed broadband. As David will discuss, both of these are strategically important.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let's look at the customer growth momentum. This chart shows the trends in terms of customer growth for our key domestic products. Mobile revenue is driven by customer growth across all mobile products. As David said, we added a total of 958,000 mobile customers this half. Within the postpaid handheld category, we've seen consistent growth with 338,000 customers added, and for the first time, we have split out what we call Machine-to-Machine services. We are seeing very good growth in this category with 86,000 services added across the half. Retail fixed broadband customers are also growing well. This is largely due to the success of our T-Box, T-Hub and Bundled Fixed Broadband offers. Another 206,000 bundles were added in the first half. Retail fixed broadband growth of 106,000 is also very pleasing, given we were losing customers in this category a couple of years ago. PSTN line loss continues to be managed well. We have not seen the acceleration of line loss in recent halves, again, of indication of our bundle strategy.</p>
          <p>Let's look at our domestic performance. Today's results show our domestic performance is improving. Our customer sales and service group is the cornerstone of our domestic business. It includes our Consumer, Business and Enterprise &amp; Government segments. As you will see, this group is driving profitable mobiles growth across all segments. Telstra Consumer country-wide is showing strong mobiles growth across postpaid, prepaid and mobile broadband. Mobile services revenue is up 14.4% in this segment and customer satisfaction is up 7%. The current economic environment is impacting the SME market. Although Telstra Business has reported a revenue decline in the first half, we do expect improvement in the second half. Telstra Business is also seeing improvement in customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Strong mobiles performance is also reflected in Telstra Enterprise and Government. Mobile services grew 13.5% in this segment to $513 million. Both Telstra Business and Telstra Enterprise and Government are reporting strong growth in network applications and services. For example, this revenue increased 12.6% in Enterprise and Government and 38.8% in Business.</p>
          <p>Let's look at productivity. Before we take a deeper dive into our expenses, I note our productivity program delivered benefits of $456 million this half leading to an overall decline in reported OpEx. As Robert Nason highlighted at Investor Day, there are 27 major programs contributing to simplifying our business and improving customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Last August, we said we expected productivity benefits to exceed the 2011 figure of $622 million and with $456 million achieved so far, we are making excellent progress. These productivity benefits provide us with the opportunity to invest in customer growth and growth businesses. Business growth of $233 million shown on this chart covers these opportunities. This includes investments in NAS with the iVision acquisition last year and also in international, we now manage the restructured Reach business.</p>
          <p>Let's take a closer look at reported expenses, with total OpEx declining by 1% in the half, fixed costs across the combined labor and other expense categories are down. Variable costs have increased slightly as a result of customer growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to labor, the adjusted growth rate for labor expenses is just 1%. This adjusts with three items. Firstly, the significantly lower 10-year government bond rate has resulted in an increase in long service leave and workers compensation provisions. This impact is $126 million increase in labor expenses in the half. Secondly, conversions of service contracts to labor expenses added another $43 million and offsetting this is a reduction in redundancy expenses of $78 million.</p>
          <p>As for directly variable costs, there has been a slight increase in the first half as a result of customer growth. This category increased by 0.4% or just $13 million on a base of $3.1 billion. Other OpEx declined by 7.5% or $202 million. This includes lower service contracts and agreements, which decreased by 11.8% or $141 million and lower impairment charges.</p>
          <p>While we're looking at group level expenses, I do want to point that out that we have not disclosed any NBN related expenses or revenues in our reporting. We'll commence this once the agreements are completed. Looking further at labor expenses, we manage our labor workforce costs using direct labor and labor substitution. Labor substitution expense is in the other category and is down. In aggregate, labor and labor substitution expenses have decreased by 1%.</p>
          <p>This is a solid outcome given rate pressures inherent in labor and the investments we are making to grow new businesses. Investments to support growth in NAS which includes last year's iVision acquisition as I mentioned earlier and the restructure of Reach in Asia are costs we have incurred this half, not in the first half of last year. However, we do believe there is room for further improvement. We are targeting future declines in labor and labor substitution expense as we further simplify the business.</p>
          <p>Okay, moving on to product profitability. In the last 18 months, we have seen strong revenue growth and customer growth in mobiles, which is translating into margin recovery and profit increases. EBITDA margin was 34% this half compared to 29% this time last year. Mobile EBITDA has increased by almost by $350 million year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our go-to-market strategy is now heavily skewed to MRO offers. This skew has aided margin improvement but the improved churn and steady postpaid ARPUs are key drivers. Fixed broadband EBITDA margin increased from 33% to 37%. This is largely due to customer growth translating into financial benefits.</p>
          <p>IP and Data and PSTN product EBITDA margins remained consistent with prior periods. Looking at Sensis, Sensis margins have declined as expected as we invest in the digital transition for this business. Margins are impacted by the following: Yellow print revenues have declined more than expected, digital demand is taking longer to monetize, and the initial costs of transition have been higher than we expected.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to the EBITDA margin decline is the deferral of the revenue attributed to the Perth Yellow Pages book I mentioned earlier on. The EBITDA impact from this is $47 million. If we adjust for this timing difference, Sensis EBITDA margin would be around about 30%.</p>
          <p>Okay, looking more closely at mobile profitability. We're seeing a very efficient management of this business. EBITDA margins improved by 5 percentage points in the half. There are several major drivers of this. Firstly, ARPU trends remained stable. In the critical postpaid handled category ARPUs remained steady at just under $64.</p>
          <p>Secondly we are managing churn effectively as shown in the middle box. Postpaid handheld churn has fallen to 13.2%, a significant improvement on fiscal 2010 when it was about 16%. This does result in lower cost of goods sold, lower customer retention activity and fewer mobile customers leaving Telstra. Thirdly, we are seeing less subsidy and more mobile repayment offers. As I've said previously we are now more skewed towards mobile MRO contracts. Across all mobile activity in the first half, 23% of that activity was MRO sales, this is up from just 11% a year ago.</p>
          <p>The zero dollar MRO volumes continue to account for a very small part of our Mobile business, just 3% of total mobile activity in the half. In summary, the settings of steady ARPUs, lower customer churn and more MRO at a time of customer growth is a good business outcome.</p>
          <p>Okay, turning now to cash flow and CapEx, which are being closely managed. Cash flow is down half-on-half by 11.1%. This is due primarily to the proceeds from the sale SouFun in the first half of last year, which boosted the previous corresponding period by a net $288 million. If we exclude this, cash flow was up 3.6%. Accrued CapEx of $1.7 billion in the first half is 18% above this time last year. However, we have invested CapEx to support wireless demand and cloud computing capability in the first half. CapEx is also being closely managed in process improvements as way to a smooth yearly profile, which eliminates the costs associated with peaks and troughs in the program.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to the next slide, I wish to mention depreciation and amortization, which decreased by 0.8% to $2.2 billion. Okay, looking at our financial settings, net debt and financial parameters are in very good shape. This half it was a $20 million decrease in net borrowing costs arising largely from a reduction in average net debt.</p>
          <p>Over the period we remained well inside the comfort zones of our key prudent financial parameters set by our board. Whilst there was a small increase in gearing, the parameters continue to reflect the strong balance sheet. This should be reassuring to shareholders during these times of volatility and of financial market pressures. Telstra continues to generate substantial free cash flow, which comfortably covers our dividend and interest commitments.</p>
          <p>Okay, now turning to guidance, which is reconfirmed. We are guiding for growth across top and bottom lines with low single digit growth for total revenue and EBITDA. Given the performance of the business in the first half, we are tracking well towards these outcomes. In regards to the impact of regulatory price changes, the fixed access determination, mobile terminating rate changes and the removal of PSTN exemptions that have occurred since issuing guidance, will be normalized. The estimated wholesale impact of these changes is a reduction in revenue of approximately $116 million. The EBITDA line will decrease by approximately $25 million as a result of these changes.</p>
          <p>We are guiding for CapEx to sales of around 14% and free cash flow of between $4.5 billion to $5 billion. The $0.28 dividend noted at the bottom of the table will be a fully franked dividend.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what I'd like to do now is just to go and look at a little more detail about our priorities and give you a bit of a sense of how we've gone over the last six months. As I said, what's so important about strategy is you can actually results and actually relate what we're doing to real financial outcomes. So, let me just guide you through each of the four priorities and then I'll wrap up at the end.</p>
          <p>As you know, our first priority is about customer satisfaction and we are seeing an improvement, but as I did indicate, we still have a long way to go in terms of getting where we want to be. We continue to do a lot of work in this area. As you can see on the chart, just a large number of areas that are just right across the business about changing the way we do things.</p>
          <p>But let me just pick up on three, Telstra bill, an important moment in your life when you move house and also a little bit about social media. So we launched the new Telstra bill in the last half and that was for consumer customers, such an important moment when you actually get your bill, clarity on the bill, how it looks, how it feels, and the response has been very positive in terms of how people reacting to that. That was an enormous amount of work to actually get the new bill out, a lot of IT work, a lot of work in the front of the house to get that done. These are big changes.</p>
          <p>In terms of moving house, as you know, that's one of those moments of truth in terms of your relationship to your Telco provider, how moving house experience goes. We've changed that process a lot. We now are proactive in making outbound calls to see how people are going and the day they're going to move, try to coordinate all the bits and pieces from your voice service to your fixed broadband, and including, hopefully your cable TV FOXTEL service.</p>
          <p>Have we got it right completely? No, but it's a lot better than where it was before, so that's been very gratifying to see. But these are the sort of things that people really can see tangible changes around. And as you know, we've put in a 24/7 sales and service support call centers, which was, what, nearly a year and a bit ago. But now we've moved on to social media, so we have people monitoring 24/7 what's on Twitter, what's on Facebook. And we engage in the conversation so we can get ahead of concerns or commentary that is going on in the online world.</p>
          <p>These are big changes. They've changed the way we're perceived. But the real question is are they making a difference, because you can do all these things and if it doesn't make a difference, you really say well, what's the return to shareholders. Well, I'm pleased to say at the end of the half, call volumes were down 28%. We went through a little bit of that in October. That makes a big change in terms of greater service, in terms of the front of the house, cost, et cetera.</p>
          <p>TIO complaints reduced to 24%. I've said repeatedly, TIO complaints are right at the end of the process, but they are an indicator about how we're going. And what probably is more a tangible result is our churn rates have probably at one of the lowest in the world across mobiles and PSTN. However, we want to get to a point where customers are not just satisfied but they become promoters or they recommend Telstra to other people. We want them to become advocates for Telstra. That's a big change.</p>
          <p>So we're moving now to implement the net promoter score or net promoter system, and that will become a measure of advocacy. Now this is a big change for this company because it really means every metric, every part of the company has got to change the way they measure. So it's about a customer outcome, not necessarily an internal metric. But we have a lot of work to there, we've just began that and Robert Nason's team is driving that, and this will probably take a couple of years to drive out, but this is a big change for this company. So that's customer sat.</p>
          <p>Secondary is being, as you know is around customer growth. And as I've said, really good to see the continuing growth because customers are what you want. If you lose your customers, you lose the revenue. So we're seeing some really strong result. It's been great to see the new customer sales organization headed by Gordon come together. That's been a big change, a very focused sales team who are really there to look after the customer, represent the customer.</p>
          <p>And we're seeing some good synergies across the enterprise segment, across the small business, what we call "Telstra Business", and the consumer segment. And that has resulted in really strong results, 3.5% growth. Really strong. And that's driven by strong mobile revenue and the customer growth we talked about.</p>
          <p>Also as you know, we did roll out the LTE handset, the new HTC device and it is just selling like hotcakes. It's going very well. We've sold 100,000 dongles already and it's become the third most successful handset in our range within just a few weeks. So I mean we put the dongles into the market and then we put the handset. So that's been very strong.</p>
          <p>In Fixed Broadband, ARPUs are now at a similar level as they were in 2008. That's a big change and that's in the midst of very strong competition. So this has helped to drive a 5.8% increase in our retail fixed broadband business.</p>
          <p>It's a very important area, PSTN. That slower decline is so important as you're offsetting the growth you've got in mobiles and broadband so managing the PSTN revenues is very, very important and that's been really well addressed by our focus on bundles and our customers like the bundles and therefore, that's really helping avert the line loss we had traditionally seen in the PSTN business. So the other important thing to remember is that bundled customers sign up for a longer period as well. So that helps in the churn area.</p>
          <p>And in the IP space, IP Access revenue continues to grow and this will be a $1 billion business this financial year. So very strong customer demand is driving this growth and that's a very good position to be in as you go into the NBN world. So that's the second area.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the third area around simplification. As you know, in the simplification area, it's all about three things: customer experience, process improvement and productivity. I've already mentioned the customer experience. Let me talk about the other two, process and productivity. We have an enormous internal program to work to simply and improve processes right across this business.</p>
          <p>We wanted to break down the company from the silos, which often customers see, to look at it as an end-to-end process so the customer just sees Telstra. Very important; we want to look it from the customer's perspective. So we've now got people looking at billing, service assurance, customer management, product development and many more areas to look at that customer centric view of process.</p>
          <p>But of course, the key thing is does that drive through to productivity? Well, I'm pleased to say we're seeing some good results coming out from our key metrics. As I said, fewer customers are calling our contact centers. More of our customers are transacting with us online, in fact that's going very well. Bad debts as a percentage of sales revenue have come down and we have increased our marketing efficiency through pulling all the marketing team together and it's great to see how the marketing team under Kate McKenzie is really making a difference.</p>
          <p>So, we have seen good improvement in labor and labor substitution productivity. As Mark mentioned, we believe that labor and labor substitution costs will continue to fall in absolute terms and that's our objective. This will further improve the outlook for productivity as we go forward. Our focus has got to be on continuous improvement in operational excellence in running such a big company like Telstra.</p>
          <p>So now, let me turn to the fourth area around our growth portfolios and I wanted to talk to each of NAS &#x2013; Network Applications and Services, International and also the media portfolio. As you know, NAS is all about managed networks, outsourcing of networks and also what we call professional network services. These things like implementing unified communications and security services. And as I mentioned earlier on, we're starting to see some really good growth in this area. Half revenue was up 19.4%. But what's more gratifying is that the sales pipeline is very strong, so that's &#x2013; when we talk about pipeline, we're talking about the number of opportunities that we're engaged in, in the market at the moment and we see about $1 billion of contract value currently being decided in the market. So that's a very good sign. And over the last six months, we have won some really good business at South Australia Health and Origin Energy, and these are big contracts that sort of have long terms associated with them. So Brendon Riley and the team are doing a great job in this area. But within this area you've got to focus on revenue growth and profitability. Margin is very important and the team are doing a great job of looking at that. So that's the NAS portfolio.</p>
          <p>In terms of Telstra International, we had double-digit growth in the international portfolio in the half. CSL New World had an encouraging six months. Revenue in local currency grew at 12% and they added 167,000 new customers, so CSL doing well. In terms of the Reach demerger, or when we bought the Reach assets back into Telstra, we've really had a lot of work going on in that area and it's going well. We now have new carrier licenses in India, Singapore and Japan. But I do want to stress they are for international POPs carrying international carriage. They're not about becoming a carrier in those countries, just to give clarity on that point. And in China, as I've said before, we will continue to actively manage our media assets and rebalance this portfolio over time, which we continue to do, and as we move through each of those properties in that market.</p>
          <p>So now, lastly, let me turn to the new digital media business. I'm delighted to have Rick Ellis, who's now been in the job now for three weeks and he's now pulling this new unit together. As I said at Investor Day, this is responsible for the end-to-end media capabilities in Telstra. Let me just run through what they are. The Pay TV business in FOXTEL, the IPTV business with T-Box, the small and medium business advertising business in Sensis, our online business in Trading Post, our ISP in BigPond and then also our advertising business in MediaSmart. So, it's quite a large or a very large portfolio, and it is a very strong mix of assets.</p>
          <p>Rick and his team have already embarked on a strategic review of all these important assets. But let me just stress, what the digital media team is focused on is integrating all our digital products together to make them available through multiple platforms or on multiple platforms and through multiple channels, so that you can include mobiles, tablets, home entertainment systems and the Internet because that's the new world that we've moved into. So Rick and the team are working through that now and we're excited about the possibilities as we move forward.</p>
          <p>But as I mentioned at Investor Day, we are still going through this transition at Sensis to become a digital media advertising business within the small and medium business market. Since that date &#x2013; update we gave you in October, we're coming to the end of the non-Metro campus, where we do the Metro campus and then we go to the non-Metro area. And we're very pleased to say that we're seeing stabilization in the sales results. So, our sales team is now more familiar with the products they're selling and how to represent them to our customers. So the sales process is a lot better than it was six months ago. But as I said, and as Mark mentioned, there's still a long way to go in this transformation. It's a big shift to digital marketing and it's really moves a lot faster than we had expected in this year.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, over the top level we have able to cover for that faster decline but this is having a significant impact on Sensis. And also our sales mix is shifting &#x2013; Yellow print revenues are declining, more than expected, so we're having to really address that Digital Media opportunity. And I'm pleased to say that the value packages we're offering to our businesses are being well-received. So they like them, we've just got to get better at how we sell them. So demand for our digital products is growing. But we've just got to be vigilant as we go through this transition. And it's good to see that we're seeing growth in the Digital Yellow and Digital White as well.</p>
          <p>So as you go through the transition, you've got to really drive productivity. And so we're taking a lot of action to get costs out of that business. And we've come a long way in transforming our products, the customer experience and of course the back office, which is where you process each ad, the Yellow Pages ad, the Print ad or the Digital Media ad.</p>
          <p>So while we still expect high-teens revenue decline and around a 30% EBITDA decline this year, we think that we've got the parameters right as we look forward in this business. Now, remember because this is a three-year transition, each period we do a really deep dive on how the business is going. And we're about to head off into the second year, which is really driven by the metro campaign that starts at the end of this month, early March. And as you go back into the metro market, we'll get a better sense of how we're going and so I'll be able to come back to you at the full year results to give you more color on how the business is traveling. So just in summary, while there's some puts and takes, we think we are on target and know what we're doing in this portfolio. Across the three growth areas, two going well and one which we have more work to do with.</p>
          <p>So that's the four key priorities, now let me just talk about an area that's very important to us and we've not talked about before, which is sustainability. As you know, over the last two years we've been on a journey to change Telstra, really from the inside out. How to make it faster, easy to do business with and just simpler, and that's a big job and we're not declaring victory but we're very encouraged about where we're at.</p>
          <p>So our corporate sustainability activities are also a key part of this story because we know that corporate sustainability helps drive value in many different ways for our customers, for our staff, our people, our investors and the many stakeholders that we do business with. And we do business with a large number of companies right across Australia.</p>
          <p>So for the last six months we've deepened our focus on sustainability and I'm glad to say that we've appointed a new Chief Sustainability Officer, Tim O'Leary, and he's really driving this program right across the company and pulling together a greater focus. Around four key areas, firstly around business responsibility, secondly, around the environmental impact the business has, also around being a good employer, which is very important and also how we participate in the communities in which we do business.</p>
          <p>You know you're always reminded &#x2013; is important that it's real and sustainability really comes to life when we think about the efforts of our people when there is disasters. Now I've talked about this before, but you just think about what's going on in New South Wales, floods up in North New South Wales now or in Southern Queensland and you really see what sustainability means to a company because it's enormously challenging, because you have these disasters and you've got to get access to infrastructure and you've got to keep your people safe at the same time and there's a great tendency that people want to jump in and fix things and yet, we have a great responsibility to our people.</p>
          <p>So the field techs really do extraordinary work. I mean they really are in many ways the heart and soul of this company. You know whether they're dealing with water, mud, flooded or nonexistent roads, submerged electrical wires. It's incredible what they have to deal with just to keep those services going. But year after year they prove what a great contributor to the community Telstra is.</p>
          <p>So we have this sort of unique dual role in sustainability. Firstly, as Australia's &#x2013; one of Australia's largest companies, we play an important role but also our services play such a critical role in these moments of great importance to the nation. So sustainability is very important to all the people in Telstra. It's very important to the board and also to me personally.</p>
          <p>So let me just summarize the four key messages for today. Firstly our strategy is delivering value for customers and for our shareholders. Our results are on plan. We're doing what we said we would do and we're delivering value as I said for customers and investors. And probably most exciting we still have a lot more to do and that gives me great hope about what we can even to do better in the future.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we're making good progress on the four priorities and specifically around changing the customer experience, so important for us. And of course, we need to keep doing this every day, every interaction with our customers.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, our strategy is proving to be resilient. It's a difficult global market environment but we are traveling well through that. This is reflected in our guidance, which remains unchanged. And then lastly, we are working to conclude the SSU. Negotiations are before we come back and discuss capital management with you hopefully in the next quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, a good set of results. We're on guidance. We've done what we said we'd do. Delivered over 1% revenue growth. What's very gratifying is to see the very strong customer growth. Nearly 1 million new mobile customers joined us in the last six months. Now, that's at 2.5 million over the last 18 months. So that's very encouraging.</p>
          <p>And of course, we continue on our journey around customer service. Very, very important to us. Not everything covered but just good, steady progress. Still a lot of work to do but we're pleased that a lot of the hard work we're doing is just going to show some results but not yet victory but definitely heading the right way. So why don't I open it to questions from here? Happy to take any comment and Mark's here to help on any of the financial questions as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...I'm just wondering if you could talk to the impact on businesses that might have to utilize it and also whether or not you think all these &#x2013; just being subject to a lot of regulatory policy in the last few years, just whether do you think they were all necessary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitchell, part of the telecommunication industry is about regulation so it just goes with the territory. I mean, what we want is consistency and a more stable environment so that we know the parameters in which we work and that's really has always been why we have entered into the NBN agreement and what we're trying to get done through this next round. In terms of the declaration of wholesale DSL, look, we've known this has been around for a while. We're working it through the ACCC. However, we've got some pretty good foundations in terms of our LLU pricing which we've already had a determination on and also in terms of spectrum sharing pricing. So I think that it will work through. We've got to get the mix of the parity between wholesale and the retail pricing is what the commissioner is wanting to look at and I think that between Warwick, Tony, Warren and a number of other people we have good engagement with the agency but more work to be done.</p>
          <p>In terms of timing, we hope over the next sort of near future, is probably the right way to put it, obviously there's a lot of detail to work through but we're very well-engaged with them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. I realized you haven't made a decision yet on or weren't you considering until all the NBN's wrapped up. It was asked in the analyst question about this concept of a special dividend, which has always been an anathema in Telstra days past. So just in conceptual terms, would that &#x2013; is that one of the three part of capital management tools you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John we always look at all different ways we can give value back to shareholders and we have used special dividend back in mid-1990s. We did some special dividends, so it is a possibility, but I've made no comment about special dividend being the way we're going to do it. We've made no final decision on that.</p>
          <p>The key thing we've got to consider is franking credits within that as well. Because that's a very big consideration to our retail shareholder base that all options are on the table. The board has gone through many options, but they have not yet made a decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up one point of clarification. You were asked earlier about job numbers and I think the company put on 400 people in the first half and you made some comment, it will be a different story in the second half. So, I'm thinking that means you're going to be getting rid of people in the second half, is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I didn't say that. I say that as we go through the simplification process with a company with what 43,000 full-time employees probably another 25,000 who work with us and even hire with our partners. We are moving workload around enormously. We're building new businesses. We're driving simplification in the core business every day. So every quarter and every half and every year has different characteristics.</p>
          <p>So all options are open to us as we go forward. And we will &#x2013; we are absolutely committed to reducing the costs of running the business. We've got to do that in terms of the dynamics globally in our industry and in Australia and for the company. So, we've got to do that and we'll look at every avenue to do that while still giving a good customer experience and therein lies the incredible challenge of what we're working on. But we're making progress. We're taking costs out as well as seeing service improve and that's what we've got to do and it's all about efficiency, about doing things better, doing it right the first time not having either to ring us twice. Just if you ring just once that saves money that's what we're focused on and Robert and Brandon and the whole team. But we're making no commentary about numbers at all but we're going to continue to drive costs out of the business.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lucy Battersby from The Age and Sydney Morning Herald. I was wondering if you can give us some idea of the geographic distribution of where your mobile broadband subscriptions have come from. Because I understand that quite a high proportion of is people in regional and remote areas who don't have access to fixed broadband. And I was wondering if you've done any modeling on what impacts the NBN being built in those areas will have on your mobile broadband numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we looked at the NBN transaction, we've always looked at the mobile broadband, fixed broadband mix. So, Mark in his modeling went through that. But Lucy, you've got to remember this is 10 years &#x2013; 10 years we're talking about and a 20-year profile in terms of what we've looked at. So in the bigger scheme of things it's very, very small. It is not a significant component and what we're seeing is that they're very different products. If you think about what the home will look like in the future, we're enabling a whole a new digital future about how people get entertainment, how they interact with each other, about what they do, how they transact. And that's one experience in the home and other experience is about when you're on the move and how you integrate those two together.</p>
          <p>So we do see enormous opportunity for people having multiple products going forward and that's our focus. And I think that will continue because you think about how you live and how I live, that's the experience you want, just having a fixed broadband service will not be enough. You will need a wireless broadband service; you'll have a tablet, you have a smartphone, your car will be connected, you'll be getting entertainment across all these multiple screens. That's the world we're going to. So I think to try to interpret the future in terms of our lens today is not getting to the real opportunity.</p>

          <p>Telstra has seemed to have been in camera with the sporting bodies this week, trying to lobby the government. I'm just wondering if you are joining in with them on that and also a potential appeal to the original ruling. But the cross-platform digital strategy which you said your digital area is going to be doing, does the current ruling actually benefit that? And given the ruling, how you go &#x2013; how you'll approach your negotiations with the NRL and V8 this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Lucy, that's a lot of questions in there. Firstly, we were there with the AFL in the original court case. So I think you should take that as &#x2013; we're there. Secondly, we think that the government's announcement yesterday to do an inquiry in this very important area of law, we've got to get clarity on it. It's important for the sporting right code. It's important for us, got to have clarity and it is not clear today. We are pleased with the contract we have with the AFL, we'll continue to look on how we drive value out of that as we go forward. And to your last question, we're still considering just exactly what our options are at the moment, but we will &#x2013; we are in close dialogue with the AFL and NRL.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're expecting savings from being relieved of your Broadacre Greenfields responsibility. How's that working out? Are you actually getting some of those savings or are you being called in perhaps to provide service onto your USO obligation on an interim basis? And secondly, although you're still waiting for the SSU, have you made the ducts available to NBN Co. and it's been contracted yet, and if so, how's that working out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Quite technical questions there. In terms of the Greenfields area, look, it's early days of work through the NBN. I mean it's very clear about our responsibility and NBN's responsibility. And if we can help out, we're very pleased to help out, but it's on a commercial basis. I think you should really talk to NBN about how they feel it's going and also to the constructors. We remain available to help at the right time and other than that we're pretty happy where we're at.</p>
          <p>The second part of the question was, are we making our ducts and pits available to NBN Co. The short answer is, we're already in doing some build because we've lot of work we've got to get through. We have obviously made the ducts and pits available in Brunswick and a few of the side areas and now the NBN Co. is just getting sort of ramped up with each fiber service area. So we're in a good position at the moment. So we're working through, lots of work to be done in that area as you know.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. <mark type="ph" /> John McGowan from the FIN Review (43:26). Could I ask you about your Telstra decision to oppose NBN's special access undertaking and the rationale behind that in the context of you trying to &#x2013; awaiting approval for the SSU? And can I also ask about the leadership uncertainty in Canberra whether you believe that's impacting business in general and specifically Telstra?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of our coverage on the SSU, look we're just trying to help create a stronger equitable environment in an NBN world. So we did it in a very positive &#x2013; if you actually read it, it's a very positive document saying hey here's some changes that we think that you should look at. Very happy to take you through the details. Tony, maybe you can talk to John later on. But it's more about creating maybe this is a long term environment we're going &#x2013; regulatory environment. And so we wanted to get some thoughts on the record about how to do it. I think some of the press have interpreted us being very negative. That was not the intent at all just like Optus have put recommendations up, many of the operators to try to create this new world. So that's what we've done here.</p>
          <p>Now your second question is about the politics. As we've repeatedly said in the expansion memorandum we're business people. We've got to plan for change of governments, change of policy, change of technology and I cannot be influenced by whatever is going on good, bad or indifferent in Canberra. All I can be is responsible to shareholders and the contract we've done irrespective of any changes, we believe was in the best interest of shareholders and no matter what happens because we've got enough safeguards in there. We've got the natural hedge because we hold the copper network should it not happen. So we're very comfortable where we're at and I have no comment to make about the politics of Canberra.</p>

          <p>Hi there. How are you doing? I just wanted to ask a question about mobile customer growth. I mean, you've obviously thrown everything out these last 18 months. You're at sort of 3.2 million mobile customers? When do you reach the limits of that because obviously the fixed side is just in secular decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it's correct to say we've thrown everything at it. We have a very clear strategy around investing for profitable growth and that's what we do as business people. But yes, it's very gratifying to see the growth of 958,000 customers, nearly a million, in Australia and another 160,000-odd in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>And while the market's there, the market opportunity is there, we will continue to accept customers onto our network when we have competitive offers, we're making no forecast on that. While we offer a good product, hopefully with a good, better and improving service at a competitive offering and the growth comes, then we're delighted about it. And we will continue to do that as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. David, look, as a former senior executive at IBM, I just wondered it seems that the network application services business is very much what Lou Gerstner was trying to do with his move into services. Is this &#x2013; am I right in seeing some similarities there? And then have you drawn any inspiration from him?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I draw inspiration from many people, Tony. The short answer is yes and no. Remember, Telstra's had a very strong set of services around the core network going right back to when we had a joint venture between Telstra and IBM and the Advantra Division. So in one sense it's not new. There's a maturing of the market, and yes, I'm not convinced that this is &#x2013; it's not necessarily an IBM strategy. It's about what our customers need and in a very complex set of communications environments and large corporates, they are asking more and more for companies to come and manage that for them.</p>
          <p>And also, they will pay us to give an integrated service that's based on service levels in the enterprise market, in the business market and interestingly, in the consumer market. Now remember, I mean just to draw &#x2013; IBM never was in the consumer market with services but we offered Telstra Plus which is a service when you ring up, you can get special help on your broadband service, which is a chargeable service. And so we will continue to offer those sorts of offerings for our customers if it creates value and that's what we are very focused on going forward.</p>
          <p>And yes, we do think there's good market growth there but I should also caution, it's very different to an IT services world. Very different characteristics. And one of the dangers some Telcos around the world have got into is thinking that network apps and services is like IT services, it is not. Because this is around the core network assets, how you create value for customers in that environment, but we're very pleased with the result.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you we're seeing stories every day about companies getting hammered by the high Australian dollar. I've seen the ForEx impact in the result but talking across the business, both operationally and strategically, what does a high dollar do to or for Telstra?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not significant to us, Mel. Obviously, our buy price of equipment offshore which mean we got a big capital budget but I couldn't tell you exactly the amount that is from offshore but that's one area, of course, handsets we buy which will come in offshore it depends on the individual contract how it's been written. And then of course, our stronger results in international are probably a bit understated in the Australian dollar sense. So that's the only two areas. We'll do in the vicinity of $1 billion and a bit out of our international business and of course that gets discounted with a stronger Australian dollar.</p>
          <p>So that's the two key areas so we're not as exposed as many other large corporates in Australia but there are some benefits and a little bit of downside to the top line, but of course for us in the international business, the bottom line is pretty much the same. So, no, we're not as impacted or as exposed.</p>

          <p>Hello. I missed that, sorry. I just wanted to follow-up, just a question that Lucy asked about the sports rights. Can you just &#x2013; safe to say that you're not going to walk away from your AFL mobile and online rights agreement after the decision that was handed down in the court?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first there's a lot of water that's still going to the bridge. But the bottom line is that we have a long relationship with the AFL and I know that we'll continue to drive value from that contract.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you can't say that today, right, that you're not going to walk away.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just another question, just with the 950,000-odd mobile growth, can you just talk about the performance of your network? I think you touched on that in your investor briefing in terms of how you performed with those extra customers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it performed very well, but when you add 2.5 million new services over an 18-month period, that's an enormous amount to cater for. But thankfully, the network's been very well architected and it is doing very well. And the key thing is that whenever you look at our network, it's &#x2013; there could be hotspots at any one period but we're pretty quick to fix them up when they happen. So no, we're very pleased with the performance of the network</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is yes, but can I confirm that with you? I mean, look, there's a large number of people. It's just actually the mechanics of have they physically signed but we have a lot of opportunities so I can get you the detail. I think, yeah, I'm pretty sure there's one but can I confirm that to you, Lucy. I'm sorry. But we know there's a lot of demand.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Yes. I just wanted to ask on the capital management. If you could quantify it a little bit, some of the analyst estimates are quite broad in range. There's everything from sort of an $800 million buyback in the second half to $1 billion by the end of 2014.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="ph" /> Ann (57:35). Back on to the network application services division. The almost 20% revenue growth for the half is obviously pretty impressive in the light of the wider company. What's your perception on the future growth rates as in the coming year and after that and in order to support that, what sort of investment is required and what level of investment is required?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly, look it's really great to have the nearly 20% growth in that. But it also very gratifying to have 11% in mobiles as well, so I think we should keep those two growth ones well positioned. Look, we have great opportunity in the network application services business. We think there's strong double-digit growth opportunity going forward and we will continue to look at that and hopefully be successful in the market. But as you would understand, there are some quite chunky bits of business that really make it very dependent on winning these bigger contracts. So if we can do that, I think the future is very bright.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just to clarify again on the capital management, in the investor briefing you said hopefully an announcement would be made in the next quarter. Does that mean &#x2013; will it necessarily coincide with the annual results or once the ACCC deal is finalized, do you anticipate making an announcement sort of weeks after that or?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>John what's important is that once we get the SSU done then we've obviously got to have a board meeting to get that clarified.

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>However, we will be taking questions right here in Melbourne and also on the phone. We will start here in Melbourne. We have three questions so far. So over to you Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Eary from UBS. Just three questions. The first one is, could you give us an update on your thoughts in terms of spectrum? Obviously, there has been some discussions with the department behind closed doors. I'm just wondering if you can sort of give us your thoughts in terms of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one was you talked about obviously the growth in NAS and you talked about profitability. I don't know if can give us a feel in terms of how profitable that business is, given that's becoming a key revenue driver. And then the last one, in terms of Sensis, obviously, 30% margins full year is obviously is a lot lower than probably what was guided previously. Can you give us a sense of where you think these sustainable margins are there in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Richard. Let me take one and three, and I'll get Mark just give you a view of the NAS profitability. Firstly on spectrum, look, the renewal should be concluded very shortly, nothing surprising in there that we hadn't planned for. And of course, you've got the digital spectrum coming up, which won't be until early next calendar year because they'll start the process. But there's nothing in the renewal that you should be concerned about. We're just waiting for the government to just finalize the last little bit. So that's where we're at with that one.</p>
          <p>In terms of Sensis, it's actually &#x2013; I'm surprised to hear that it's not where we have guided. It's pretty much where John said at Investor Day. We've had the book of the recognition of that just from the first half, and the cost to come out in the second half, So we think that we're traveling pretty much as we thought we would in October. The big question is for next year and just at the moment, I just don't think we can give you a sense until we've gone through the metro area because that's such a big area to really give a sense on. So the full year, we'll give you a greater picture, but it would be early to start forecasting too far ahead.</p>
          <p>Do you want to talk to NAS profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Just on NAS profitability. The margins in NAS are lower than traditional business obviously. We are improving our margins in that business as we get critical mass, so building up that revenue pipeline and getting the efficiencies to run critical mass. Importantly, tonight though, is in that business it's low capital intensity, so return on invested capital is a lot higher than traditional business. So there's that balance between EBITDA and margin and return on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any numbers you're willing to expand around Mark not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think not today, no. We sort of, as I've said, building up that margin profile. So not today, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just with regard to the spectrum payments presumably that they get finalized, are we still of the view that that's debt funded rather than cash funded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be funded out of debt. We'll borrow for the spectrum requirements, and we have plenty of capacity on the balance sheet to do so.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just Richard, just clarify on Sensis what you might have misheard David earlier and misread the slide. We're talking about 30% decline in EBITDA not 30% margins approximately for the year so it's an important point when you run &#x2013; when you have the maths.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good pick up. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian Martin of RBS. Just a question on the revenue trend, which is holding up quite well because of the growth in subscribers, book very well run there. But average revenues are a bit if a problem, aren't they? Particularly PSTN, subscriber decline's only 3.5% but average revenue down 6%, which you largely attribute a part of that to the final access determination? Does that wash through in the half year or the next full year? And therefore do we get to back a bit more stable average revenue in the fixed slot in the PSTN side?</p>
          <p>Secondly is there a risk that you might see something similar with fixed broadband because that average revenue has held quite well but you're going through this discussion with the ACCC about how you ensure equivalence and there's this question over what basis those &#x2013; also prices might not be regulated at, so there's a risk there. And thirdly in mobile, which also the average revenue has held up reasonably well, but isn't that going to dilute quite significantly with that growth in machine-to-machine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me have a bit of that and I'll get Mark to add a little more color as well. Look, we're very pleased with the Mobiles. But yes there is a continuing category mix within the Mobile portfolio and some of the new machine-to-machine have a lower ARPU but are still very profitable. So I think we've got to make sure that while ARPU is very important we look at the profitability and you saw the profitability half-to-half improved which has been very good. The ARPUs in the Mobiles business are pretty good right across. We're obviously seeing these decline in the mobile broadband area. But remember you got pre and postpaid mix in there as well.</p>
          <p>And also you got the tablets mix in there as well. But so we're pretty pleased; we're pretty much on where we wanted to be. Fixed broadband, yeah, look, you're right, Martin, in a sense that great result, but until we work through the declaration on DSL, which we're hoping will be reasonable, there's always that risk. But we're feeling as we go into that reasonably comfortable. We've already got the LLU prices out there. We know what the spectrum sharing is and we've always had the wholesale DSL prices out there. So we know the parameters. We're working within that area. Remember in DSL, it's also about what products you're adding on all the time. It's not just a straight data usage and the access fee. PSTN, look, yes, there's a bit of wash-through there, but not losing as many customers is really important. Getting them on to the bundle has been our really important focus and being reasonably competitive in the market as well. And of course you've got different operators in the market at different prices. Do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The access determination and the exemptions, so the PSTN exemption change that has come through recently, that will wash through this year, largely. So that should wash through on a...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...very briefly, stable environment as far as the traditional fixed line pricing goes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so that, yeah. So retail access is rather constant. It's the calling that's dropping off. We have got about 1.5 million on what we call subscription plans that sort protects that base and we've got 1.25 million on bundles. So, we move more to a subscription type offer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Christian Guerra from Goldman Sachs. Three questions for you. Firstly, on Telstra Business, you talked about the fact that I think you said revenues went backwards in the half. And I would just like to understand whether that was cyclical or usage related, and, if it is cyclical, where you're actually seeing it; which sorts of products are you seeing the hit?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Mobile margins sort of recent history &#x2013; in recent history your peak has been around 35% in terms of mobile margins. Just wondering what the outlook is for mobile margins into FY 2013 and FY 2014 given that the rate contracting issuethat  you're going to face sort of at the end of this calendar year and into calendar 2013. And thirdly on NBN, I'd like to better understand and follow the OpEx and CapEx and also the revenues through the course of calendar 2012 and calendar 2013. I just want to understand whether or not there is a mismatch there. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay. So let me take the first one on Telstra Business. On mobile margins, I'll give &#x2013; you want to pick that one? And then I'll talk about NBN. So yeah, look, we've had a 0.5% decline in revenues in TB but actually, competitiveness has been very strong. We think we're at least holding our own through that period. But we have seen a decline in the mobile ARPU primarily.</p>
          <p>We've had a little bit of decline PSTN but it's been really in mobile ARPU just as it's washed through the pricing we had in the market. We think that it's poised for a renewal as we go forward but on the half, it's definitely been a struggle. We came out of last year. We saw a slowing growth, mainly in that mobiles area and then we're now sort of hopefully washed through. So that's sort of the key area in the TB business. The number of customers is still very strong, been good customer growth.</p>
          <p>Will, do you want to add anything else on it? I think that's pretty much it in terms of how we're going.</p>
          <p>Gordon, would you like to add something? Well, get up just so you get a good answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's important to note that we're actually taking share in TB both in the fixed and mobile space to take a couple points of share on the mobile side in terms of revenue share and that's important. Secondly, in terms of the recontracting mix, our ratio is, particularly in consumer, we've now managed quite aggressively in terms of about a 1.1 ratio from recontract to acquisitions so you talk about the storm next year on recontracting. Well, we're already living that storm this year, given some of the growth in prior halves as well. So I think we're going to see some of that discipline within Telstra Business as we look at underlying profitability in mobile and as we return to growth and more aggressive growth in mobile and tougher business over the next half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So lots of work going onto that area. In terms of NBN OpEx and CapEx profiles, we've said that NBN will be within 14% CapEx to sales and we're doing work now and it's all within that profile. We will be giving you a briefing after this SSU. We just want to get that behind us, Christian, before we come and give you too much more detail but it's within the profile of everything with all our planning. So it's included and we'll give you some more color on that. We obviously know it intimately and Brendan and the team who are building. Also, we're getting our systems ready for NBN work because we're now buying &#x2013; we're a wholesaler so doing all those changes. We've got them underway so we're ready to hit the market at the right time. But we'll give you that color at a separate briefing, okay?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Laurent from JPMorgan, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three questions as well. Just on the Mobile side an area of focus has been sort of the prepaid side and I was just looking at the trends there. There's some customer growth but ARPU remains and in fact was actually down 5% year-on-year and still 10% below that of your main competitors. So what's happening in the prepaid market? What are you seeing?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the cost side. I noticed employee costs are up byt 6% year-on-year and there is an element of cost transfer with service contracts but still even you should normalize for that they'd still be up. So I'd like to understand your picture on the productivity gain that's supposed to translate into employee cost savings at some point? And lastly on the PSTN side we're seeing a decline of 9% half-on-half so that's at the rather high end of the historical range. Just a follow-up on Ian's question if you're seeing sort of a bit of a tipping point as well in PSTN usage if there's anything that's a bit unusual than what we see in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Laurent so let me &#x2013; so I'll handle prepaid. We'll put the chart back up on the costs because you do understand the costs, there's a couple of one-offs in there and then between Mark and I we'll handle PSTN. So firstly on mobile prepaid I thought you were going to say only a 10% difference between us and our competitors which we actually think that we've done very well in the prepaid market. However the prepaid market has declined which is what you are really alluding to. However we have performed very well in the prepaid market and we're seeing good performance in that business.</p>
          <p>We've refocused the business. We've got a dedicated group now in that area and really tidied up the channels. So we're pleased about the growth we've seen and but it is a tough market, but we continue to do very well. Do you want to add anything else on that Gordon, but I think that's pretty much the key things, because Gordon has been driving <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:22).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall prepaid market, I think, we're just waiting to see the final numbers. It's probably declined half-on-half &#x2013; on a year-on-year basis by about 7%. And we believe we're growing in a declining market, probably taking the lion's share of volume. I think if we look at the month of December, we probably have moved to a position where we're now number two, where we were in the past number three thereby distant 10 points of revenue market share. So we really have seen some very positive revenue growth in a declining market.</p>
          <p>I think we'll see the pull-through of revenue in the second half and the strong pre-pay overall performance in a declining market. We have seen positive net subscriber growth in the half, and if you recall in the prior half we were the only operator to actually to grow our net side of the base and all other competitors declined, and we think that trend will continue... well we're waiting for the final numbers. But we believe that trend will continue for each one as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Gordon. So let me just quickly readdress the PSTN and Business outlook. 9% down in terms of revenue, but remember <mark type="ph" /> ESIO (1:14:50) decline is really nowhere near as pronounced as it has been. As Mark said, we are seeing this rebalance, usage is really the key determinant in terms of that driving down. But as we put these bundled products into the market, we're seeing some good stabilization there. But no, look that's sort of in line with what we anticipated, Laurent. I think you're probably going to see that sort of decline going on just as usage changes but the bundles, churn levels lower, keeping the customers must be our priority as we go through into an NBN world. Do you want to add anything else to that Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not on PSTN other than the final access determination does have a slight impact as well..</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's right. But it's sort of not. So do you want to pick up on &#x2013; do you want that chart back up or you're okay?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Laurent, it's important to understand the employee costs have a $126 million hit as a result of lower government bond rates. I won't bore you with the accounting. But basically we discount our forward liabilities for long service leave and workers' comp about a 10-year bond rate. The 10-year bond rate dropped from about 5.21% to 3.67% over the half, so a substantial drop. And so that means we have to restate our provisions, which goes to the expense line. It's non-cash. It's simply balance sheet to P&amp;L, but that did have a significant impact of $126 million. There was also $43 million associated with conversions that were previously in the service contract line, now up in the labor line. So they are the two major elements. It's really important to understand that because the underlying trend is actually quite good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And Laurent, I'll just give you a little bit more flavor on this because as we bring consultants in, which is all about a very intentional strategy, really build our IT capability. We did not want it external to the company. So you get that sort of move. Over the period and we brought Reach in, iVision in, so we've actually had an increase of 400 people. So when you look at that less the salary increase and you get to a negative 1%, it's actually a very strong result just taking those anomalies out because we do look at this every week, looking at what the dynamics are and of course the NAS business is pulling through some other people as well but we've got to keep driving this. So, yeah, headline, you say, "Gee, what's going on?" I asked the same question but underneath it it's actually a pretty strong story. But if you need more detail on that we can just take you through later on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:35).</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question from the phones, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Vikas Gour from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please, Vikas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just three questions for me as well. Firstly, the wholesale broadband agreement, just wanted to know what the key issues are from your end and if that's likely to have a major impact on the NBN payments. From a Sensis perspective I was also just trying to get an understanding from the slide, it said it's a three year transition program. Just wanted to know whether you can start to &#x2013; whether you can expect to see revenue and potentially earnings growth from FY 2015 onwards.</p>
          <p>And also lastly on capital management, is it likely to be dependent on current broadband policy? And is political certainty a big caveat on capital management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Vikas, right the wholesale broadband agreement. Yeah, look we're making good progress on this and remember it's just the 12 month short term contract that we're just working through at the moment. So we're just tightening up a couple of points there. Stuart Lee's doing a great job. So it's imminent I think but we just need to work through the final bits. So no big drama there. It has no impact at all on the SSU at all. It's just, we've just got to do this, it's just like any other contract we negotiate and we think it's important just to get the settings right as we go forward. Sensis three year transition, and yes, I mean, our hope as we go through this, but it's a big change. And if you look at every Yellow Pages business in the world they have gone through a similar transition and then they get to a flattening of revenues and then they work through their margin improvement.</p>
          <p>We've just got to look at the dynamics in the Australian market as we move through to digital and that's why the metro campaign is so important to us, just to see how we're tracking. But if the size of the non-metro campaign are any indication, we think that the three year period is about the right period to start planning for it.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the last question, could you repeat it? I just didn't get all the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital management, are there any caveats around political certainty or otherwise...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, it's &#x2013; first of all, SSU, get that down and done, then we can talk about capital management. And remember we've always said that when we went to the market with the expansion memorandum, we said look there's this natural hedge we have. And so, we're pretty comfortable should there be a change of policy, change of government, change of technology.</p>
          <p>We're pretty comfortable as we go forward, but we obviously look at it but let's get the SSU done then the board will decide on capital management and then we'll come forward and so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Three questions from me. Just back on Sensis. Even adjusting for the <mark type="ph" /> first (1:20:45) timing issues, the EBITDA decline is quite aggressive, so just, if you can just identify where you expect to be able to continue the pull costs out of the business in terms of whether it's labor or other costs, and specifically within labor which areas? On NAS, could you just give us some color as to which products and segments are actually driving the growth there and what you really see is the key opportunity? And on CSL, you spoke about solid growth in terms of subscribers for the half, how does that fit into the portfolio? Would you consider divesting it given the strong results you're seeing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, maybe you can bring the Sensis chart up for me, so I just want to give you some color on the Sensis. So, on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, can we bring the charts up please, on Sensis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. The ones we went through. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the cost out, remember the first half we had a bubble from the end of last year to this year just as we settled in iGen, process all the digital media ads and also the new print ads into the new system. So, we had a big bubble of cost that came through end of last year, first half of this year. And you can already see the action we've taken both at the end of last year and the first month of this half. And you can see that we're working of the labor side there very hard.</p>
          <p>We've also taken a lot of the corporate services back into the Telstra. So that's been a big part of our change and we're just driving greater efficiencies and now the productivity is back to the levels before we changed to the iGen product. So there, we are pretty clear on the cost profile for the half and we &#x2013; by this stage, you know your revenue profile and you know your cost profile in this business. So, you've got pretty clear run through the half. The big question is as you go into Metro for next year. So, and as I said on the chart here which is about the 30% EBITDA decline, which is less than what you've seen in the first half because of timing of revenue recognition. So that's the first one. I'll get Mark to talk about the NAS color.</p>
          <p>CSL, wonderful, it's doing very well. When you ask me are we a seller, it always depends at what price. But no, we've got no intention to sell it at this point. It's performing strongly and we'll continue to look at options as we go forward and we want to see if we can grow the portfolio. But again, so you don't in any way misunderstand what I'm saying, we're not about to go and buy big properties throughout Asia. We're looking at organic growth, how we can leverage our assets in Asia to go forward. I want to be very clear about that because sometimes people write things that we're about to do things that we're not. So I hope that gives you some color there. NAS, in terms of the areas of the growing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll throw it to Brendon for some more color. But at the headline product level, managed data networks is growing strongly. Unified comms, another area of growth. Hosting, cloud hosting, another area of growth. We've got a bit of a kick-up with iVision. So iVision's brought some capability in but I'll throw it to Brendon who manages that group to give some more color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So just adding to what Mark said so, so very strong growth in intelligent networks, cloud and unified communications. So they're all up very strongly and taking share in those segments. And then we continue to see very strong growth in working with our major corporate clients on taking their internal spend around networks and services and externalizing that to us and working on sort of major integration initiatives. So and if we're looking forward on the pipeline, the pipeline's strong in all of those areas as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, come back here to Melbourne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Tony Wilson, Evans and Partners. A couple of questions, Mark, one for you. Just the shift to MRO plans, the big push on those plans has had an accounting impact in terms of profit benefit of the current period and last period. Could you give us an indication of exactly what that benefit is? You made reference to zero dollar plans, but I think that accounting benefit extends to all the MRO plans. And what proportion of funds that are now sold, or plans that are now sold, are actually MRO plans?</p>
          <p>And a second question, just in relation to the FOXTEL-Austar merger, if that is to go through, there will be undertakings or certain undertakings placed on the two groups. So I'm just wondering what undertakings or what impact those undertakings could have in terms of your participation in FOXTEL and just how you deal with that in relation to bundling product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get Mark back to handle the MRO, I think, but just a top level. MRO is a mix. A lot of people think there's some accounting within <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:26:10). It's actually about getting a more balanced portfolio. But let me get Mark to take you through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, first of all, MRO we've had for 10 years. David and I actually brought MRO into the market 10 years ago at mobile. But what is new is zero dollar MRO. So it's zero dollar MRO, it's about low tens of millions [of dollars] of impact. That's the order of magnitude. So relatively immaterial. In terms of the benefits of MRO, it does allow customers to choose higher-end handsets and make a contribution. So it's an important part of their go-to-market offers. So the way we look at it, the zero dollar which is new, it accounts for, as I said, 3% of total activity. The MRO in total was 23% of total mobile activity. So once again, we have a balance of offers in the market and MRO is just one of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Any undertakings we make, we take very seriously.</p>
          <p>Look we obviously wanting FOXTEL to be successful and we think the Austar transaction is in the interests of FOXTEL business. At times, the commission looks at flow on impacts around market dynamics and price to consider the impact of what our position could or could not be. But no, we're very conscious of that and there's nothing there at the moment that we would think constraints either the Telstra side or would constrain the FOXTEL business.</p>
          <p>So it's a fine balance but yes we do discuss it a lot, Peter as you'd imagine and Rick's learning all about it already. So but no, at the moment we think that we can hopefully meet the commissioner's requirements and get on with the deal because we think it's in the interests of FOXTEL, the industry and we can move forward.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. I just got two questions. Firstly on this 4G/LTE discussion, any indication on how much could it cost for the upgrade or what do you think is a fair price for the spectrum? And also if the 700 megahertz pricing is not compelling, can you guys extend the rollout on the 1800 MHz? I just want to clarify that.</p>
          <p>And secondly sorry just go back to the ARPU trends, your wireless broadband ARPUs are down to $32 at the moment. I was wondering any reason why these can't continue to drop further? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sachin, right. See if I got all of those questions. Firstly, the price of the digital dividend spectrum, we hope as low as possible but it is an auction. So look, we can't comment on that today. The &#x2013; you can look at global trends, what we've seen in Europe which we &#x2013; our guys are very good at managing that. So we'll work that one through.</p>
          <p>Your question around, if it was too expensive, say we couldn't get access to it. Do we have other options? I'm delighted to say, I think Mike Wright is probably one of the best mobile engineers in the world and I think he always has options. So we will continue to look at that. So one of the things in this industry you never want to be dependent on any one technology or one outcome.</p>
          <p>And in terms of ARPU on mobile broadband, as I said before Sachin, there's a whole lot of factors in there. You've got postpaid dongles, you've got prepaid dongles and you've got the tablets. The tablets are running about, what, an $18, $20 ARPU roundabout because a lot of people offload to Wi-Fi. Prepaid is obviously a lot less than what you get on postpaid. Postpaid ARPU is going pretty well. But there is pricing pressure in that market. However, what we're more interested in is actually the profitability per megabyte we carry, a la why we went to LTE. And we're very pleased about how that is performing because one of the things that is more important than anything else, we've got Moore's Law working about, we have to carry more data at a lower cost. It's all about the profitability of that business, and that's what we focus on more than any particular ARPU number. And I'm pleased to say with Warwick Bray, with Mike, we manage this very closely.</p>
          <p>Now to give you some color here, I mean it's a big job we've got. The amount of data I think doubled again in the last 12 months on the network. We're managing every cell very tightly within the &#x2013; so we get good performance right across the network and the network continues to perform exceptionally well relative to any other network so we are very pleased about how that's going. But as we talk through this we can give you some more detail. And if you want anything Mark?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just a couple of comments. Thanks David. We exited the full year 30% odd revenue decline &#x2013; sorry operating decline on that product, so it's actually better than that now and also what's important to me and the company as David said continue to grow both revenue and contributions. So that's how we manage that business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Fraser McLeish from RBS. Go ahead please, Fraser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, two from me. Just firstly on mobile pricing and in other words the mobile pricing environment I guess. You've seen Vodafone obviously raise the price of one of its low end plans, you guys have pulled back a bit on your iPhone subsidies. Is that a signal you think there's a more rational pricing environment out there? That's my first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're allowing you three today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll do that. Second one is around "Project New", just where you are in sort of realizing the cost savings from that ,you know the $456.5 million obviously is a very strong result. Is that the sort of high watermark because you've done the easier stuff? Or can we sort of see savings maybe in that sort of region for a few periods to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take those two then. Look, on mobile pricing, look, we watch it very closely and we think it's important that there &#x2013; we want it to be a rational market. Three player market, usually that's what you find. However, we've always said that we'll remain competitive. We already, and always have said our coverage and our reliability and the latency on our network is the best, so we sold the premium. But at the moment, we feel like it's steady as you go but every month and every week is a different week. And so you have to be very vigilant, but the size at the moment are reasonable. Do you want to add some in that, Gordon? Gordon's sort of close to the day-to-day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just in terms of mobile and the growth but also the profitability of mobile, one of the big changes over the last six months or 12 months has been how we managed our mix. And so I think we have some &#x2013; we've seen a shift to higher value plans. We talked about a significant shift half-on-half at Investor Day where we now see over 71% of our plans that we sell in-market are above the $59 price point. It's really a dramatic shift in the mix. which drives good profitability, good ROI on our overall investment. And I think you'll see a trend towards managing the mix more aggressively by our competitors as well. They're making price adjustments at the lower price points. They're driving less inclusions at the higher price points. So I think we're well positioned to continue some of the momentum we've seen in the first half that we're encouraged by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And look, the other thing for the first time we've split out our machine-to-machine, it's starting to become not significant but the early signs. We did what, $40 million. So it's going to be about $80 million or $90 million for the full year &#x2013; very low ARPUs but very high profit. So we think this, the growth in terms of the number of ins or services on the network will continue to grow very quickly and as Gordon rightly said, every product category have got slightly different characteristics. So that's it. I'm not sure that any of the team would say there was any easy low-hanging fruit within Project New. But it has been a lot of hard work but, yes, we've got to continue down this track. I don't know, Robert, do you want to comment at all about the next 12 months? So, I think that we, obviously have a lot more to do and we would hope that we just keep moving at around this rate. We've got to really, because that's part of the nature of our industry as we go forward. Do you want to add anything else to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark might want to comment on that, not Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's plenty of opportunity. We see the same momentum going through the second half so it's not all a matter of low hanging fruit, there's still plenty of opportunity. I mean, we see us continuing momentum at a similar rate in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's the big message, Fraser. I think if you talk to anyone inside Telstra, they feel it every day. Simplifying the business, changing processes, doing it differently is a real focus of ours going forward, so more to come.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is Mark McDonnell from BBY. Go ahead please, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much for the call. I have three questions about the P&amp;L. Firstly, in the revenue area there was a handy increase in the other sales category and there's a footnote there that says that that includes $58 million from HFC cable usage, $38 million CCP. I'm just wondering if you could clarify that in relation to your broadband investment or for some other factor and whether that's sustainable?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in respect to the OpEx, I note the comments, David, where you said you thought labor costs would be able to be reduced, but I note that your employee head count has increased; domestic full-time has increased in each of the last six-months periods and total workforce has increased in the last six months. So, are we looking at a decrease in the total number of employees or change in job function and a reduction in average salaries? Or what are the factors that would lead to a lower labor cost in the context of a higher workforce?</p>
          <p>And my third question is in respect of the tax rate. You had an effective tax rate of 31.8% this time compared with 33.1% last time. I'm just wondering if that is due to any one-off factors or is that sustainable or are we going to see the tax rate revert back to something close to 33%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks, Mark. Let me take number two and then I'll get Mark to look at the other revenue, he can explain, and also the tax rate because the NPAT's up a lot and obviously that's &#x2013; we didn't highlight that because there's some factors there. Look what I said and I thought I stressed it, it was labor and labor substitution would reduce in absolute terms. I didn't say labor because there's too many moving parts in our business because we bring &#x2013; sometimes we in-source which goes into the labor line and sometimes we push more out in terms of partners.</p>
          <p>So, the only way to really look at productivity and absolute labor is to look at labor and labor substitution because I could come in here and show you a 10% reduction in labor just because I outsourced everything, and that's not true, just like the other way, sometimes the labor, internal labor goes up and yet our labor substitution has gone down. So it's labor, labor substitutions that we are seeing a decline in and is our focus to get absolute decline in year-to-year. So I hope that sort of tidies that one up, because we had what another 400 people join the business in the last half, and there's a whole lot of reasons why. And that'll be a very different scenario in the second half. Now in terms of other revenue and tax rate, I'll let Mark handle that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with tax. The tax line was primarily driven by an underprovision in the prior period, so simply underprovision which gets reflected in this period. And in terms of the revenue, that's the &#x2013; a long-term agreement we've had in terms of the use of our HFC cable with FOXTEL. It has certain triggers around the revenue share we get from that. And there's nothing more than that in it, so it's basically the existing agreement we have with FOXTEL, where they use of our HFC cable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions for me, one on the free cash flow. So first half free cash flow $1.7 billion and you've reiterated the guidance. So I just want to know how you're going to get to the $4.5 billion to $5 billion in the second half, whether we're going to see CapEx pull back or there's other &#x2013; something else we should expect in the second half is question one and then question two, I think I remember David saying that 1.6 billion (sic) [million] mobile net adds last year would be very difficult to achieve again, but it does seem you're on track to that again this year. And I just wondered if you could give us your view on the second half and how you see the mobile market progressing? And then just on the mobile market, I was wondering if you could give us the first quarter, second quarter split so we can dissect the impact of the iPhone 4S in that contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll give a brief comment on cash flow then I'll pass to Mark and I'll get Mark to do number three to the splits of the quarter. But just an overall comment on cash flow. We are very confident about the full year. There's some one-offs in there in our CapEx profile and it's quite consistent with other profiles we've had in half-to-half. But I'll get Mark take us through the detail there. Yes, I do stand corrected. I didn't necessarily say, think that we could do $1.6 billion (sic) [1.6 million], not that I'm forecasting that. Look, the thing that we've decided is that if the market opportunity is there, we'll go after it when we're driving good profitable growth. So that's really the key determinant. At the moment we think that the business is performing well, customers appreciate the value of the network and we've got a great product portfolio in terms of the handsets. So there's many things that are going well for us. So we will &#x2013; if the opportunity is there, we will go after it. 950,000-odd to 1.6 million, I don't think we're making any forecast. But look, if you look at it, I think that we're tracking pretty well for the second half. The January trading's been pretty strong, which has been good. And so let me get Mark to talk about cash in more detail and the profiling and also the mobile numbers. ForEx had a big impact obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. CapEx, I would look at last year's profile, it was similar. So last year, we in fact were high. CapEx was very high. Cash flow this year once you strip out <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:03) as I mentioned earlier. So these sort of things apply. We generally have a run up on that CapEx program around June, which flows into cash in the first few months of the fiscal year. We'd also run up our inventories and debt is in the channel, so as we distribute inventory into our channel late after Christmas, that does impact cash in the first half and also traditionally collections have always been stronger in the second half.</p>
          <p>So as David said, we're very confident of the second half profile and you just have to look back to last year to see how that works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're going to look at first and second quarter splits on sub growth, did you have that or do you want to come back to that one?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is Digby Gilmour from CLSA. Go ahead, please. Digby?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much guys. Firstly on Sensis. Can you please give us an indication of what percentage of Sensis revenues are now online in total? And just a concern, six weeks trading post year end, has the revenue run rate improved or maintained?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on EBITDA guidance, from a high level, low-single digit FY 2012 EBITDA growth for fiscal 2012 based on what you just reported implies, the second half EBITDA flat or even slightly down, just wondering in your minds what would drive this? Is this revenue falling away, perhaps the mobile revenue growth falling away, or cost benefits starting to slow or is guidance basically an easy beat?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on direct COGS, just wondering, should we expect these to fall away in the second half given the lower termination rates and maybe mobile commission subsidies, et cetera, just any color there around the COGS line would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll do one and I'll give Mark numbers two and three on the EBITDA profiling. Firstly, in terms of the digital Yellow and digital White, we would now be &#x2013; we're probably getting up to 25% of our revenues thereabouts and growing just on double digit, so moving along pretty well. As I said, the more &#x2013; the better question for trading on Sensis, because it's such a back-end skewed business with the way you put the books out. It's not so much about the revenue flows. It's more about how your non-metro area sales went because that's a better indicator and it's right on our forecast for the year.</p>
          <p>So, that, the good thing there is it's traveling as well as we have expected it to. We've still got probably another week just before we close out non-metro. Then we go into metro. So trading is as expected. So that's where we're at with that. So do you want to take EBITDA and COGS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So in terms of the growth profile for EBITDA, it's more about last year than this year. So, last year in the first half we had a write-down of our Octave investment. Second half, we recognized a gain on the Reach integration and we also had a stronger second half performance last year. So obviously coming off a stronger second half of last year and as I said, there was an accounting gain booked in terms of the Reach integration. So that's what really tempers the second half looking at the full year impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we're doing as best aswe can. On the COGS and the question around mobile terminating rights. The COGS question is actually, Gordon, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:47:00) and I can talk about the other bigger thing of COGS. So COGS is really driven by what opportunities are in the market. And as we've said before, if the market opportunity is there, we'll spend the money, if it's not, we'll pull back. But Mark, our terminating rates change because that's the difference from the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our second half, it's around about $78 million impact in terms of the revenue impact. We get slightly positive on the EBITDA line because of we're a net outpayer. So that all is a second half impact. So obviously the revenue line will be tempered and we'll have a slight kick on the EBITDA line, and that is excluded for guidance purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's why we're saying single digit on both, low single digit.</p>

      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sameer Chopra from Merrill Lynch. I had three questions. First one, David, there was some press report through Jan talking about the dividend opportunity at Telstra. And I was wondering, has the board already made up their mind on capital management and is it just a question of announcing into the market once you've completed the &#x2013; once ACCC's given you approval? So that's kind of first question, if the board's already decided and you're just waiting for the deal to get closed.</p>
          <p>Second one is just on depreciation. Depreciation has been running ahead of CapEx. I think it's just down to show signs of maybe falling back down towards CapEx? And I was just wondering if this is now a trend we should expect? Are we going to see D&amp;A get towards $3.5 billion-type level? And the last one is just on Mobiles if you can perhaps describe where you're seeing your strongest demand? I was trying to figure out at which sort of price point, where is the kind of the sweet spot for Telstra?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sameer on the dividend what the position is that we have confirmed the dividend for two years. There was a speculative piece written of special dividend that was &#x2013; the word special was never mentioned in the interview so I'll be very clear about that. The board has reviewed capital management. They have made no decision on capital management. It is subject to the SSU. But it is a constant topic on the board agenda as you would expect but no decision has been made on that. That will be subject to getting SSU done and then moving forward but well across the detail. Mark, do you want to handle depreciation?</p>

          <p>Okay just on D&amp;A, we do expect the current level to remain in the short term. We are coming off the back of some significant CapEx three or four years ago in the transformation so in the short term, we're seeing D&amp;A at similar levels.</p>

          <p>And then where is the sweet spot with Mobiles? Well that's a big question, Sameer. Look, it's &#x2013; the network coverage and the capability of the network continues to be such a major differentiator for us and that's what we continue to invest in. And so it sort of touches just about all the product offerings we have in the market. We have as Gordon talked about we had good performance in prepaid. We've had a strong 4S performance. We're having strong performance right across the smartphones. I think I'm not sure I'm just looking at Gordon, are we putting out anything on the plan types sort or about where we're &#x2013; at the volume we're seeing. I think we've got very strong on 4S as we go forward. Mobile broadband going well. I think that sort of probably gives you enough of an indication there.</p>

          <p>But pretty much across the portfolio really, it has been good. So I think that's it Sameer.</p>

          <p>We'll take the last question please, operator.</p>

      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The last question is Laurent Horrut from JPMorgan. Go ahead, Laurent.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking another one. I just wanted to touch on the capital structure. I've noticed in the half, the debt &#x2013; then gross debt actually has increased quite a bit. Not that I think you're over-geared by any standard. But it has gone up and your leverage ratio has gone up a bit. Just a general question on, how do you think about the level of debts in the migration to NBN? Would you want the overall sort of level of gearing to go down? Are you comfortable with that level of gearing going through NBN?</p>
          <p>And a subsequent question on that is, where are you on franking? I think you've got a negative balance of $89 million as of December. Are you still having to prepay tax to fully frank the dividend and if so, for how long? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mark's got that one on the capital structure. I mean the debts up a little bit and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the debt profile basically follows our cash profile. So obviously first half cash is not as strong as second half. So you'd expect some rebalance there. In terms of our parameters, they are set by the board, but we're very comfortable with those parameters. They're very important in the current environment for us to maintain an A credit rating. It does give us access to capital markets bringing such a strong balance sheet, underwriting such as that. So, we're comfortable with that and the board will continue to reassess as we move through the NBN phase. And just on franking, we are &#x2013; our franking balance we manage closely and we are forecasting a fully franked dividend or guiding a fully franked dividend this year and expect similar going forward. So...</p>

          <p>Yeah. So franking very important and &#x2013; okay so...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No look, I think I've said it all. Thanks for coming. We've got a more lot more work to do, but it's pleasing first half results and we'll keep at it. So, thanks very much.</p>
