          <p>Good afternoon. I'm Oleg Maximov from Troika Dialog and this is the NOVATEK 2009 IFRS results conference call. We have two speakers with us today; Leonid Viktorovich Mikhelson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board; and Mark Gyetvay, Chief Financial Officer, Member of the Management Board and Member of the Board of Directors.</p>
          <p>And now, Mark, over to you to start your presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, shareholders and colleagues, good evening, and welcome to our full-year and fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I would like to thank everyone for joining us this evening and extend our sincere gratitude to Troika Dialog and their oil and gas analyst, Oleg Maximov, for organizing and hosting our annual conference call.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with specific details, I would like to refer you to our disclaimer statement. During this conference call, I may make reference to forward-looking statements by using words such as plans, objectives, goals, strategies and other similar words, which are other than statements of historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>As we begin the year 2009, it was extremely difficult for us to imagine a positive outlook for the year, let alone achieve stellar financial and operational results. The financial markets were in turmoil. The economic outlook was pessimistic and natural gas markets were glutted with excess supplies as demand contracted from the lingering economic crisis.</p>
          <p>This past year proved to be a special year for NOVATEK in our corporate history as we successfully navigated through one of the worst economic crisis on record and clearly demonstrated market that the investment decisions we made over the past few years have paid enormous dividends.</p>
          <p>Our investment and strategic decisions during the past year proved the resiliency of our business model, and combined with the prudent and conservative financial policies we have adopted, we continued to remain as one of the lowest cost producers in the oil and gas universe.</p>
          <p>When we spoke towards the end of 2008, we mentioned that it'll be extremely difficult for us to provide any meaningful production guidance for the near-term, but we were confident that the overall mid- to long-term trends for natural gas, both domestically and globally, were favorable, and as such, we will continue to invest capital to expand our production and processing capabilities to meet expected future demand.</p>
          <p>We continue to hold this positive view for natural gas and believe that many of our industry participants hold the same view despite contrarian comments by the market experts. We make capital investment decisions through various business cycles and remain highly focused on cost controls as we believe these key elements are crucial for creating shareholder value over the longer term.</p>
          <p>The capital investments we made over the past several years to expand production and processing capacity and to add operational flexibility to our business model paid immediate dividends last year as we're able to take advantage of the market situation to sustain our production and profitability.</p>
          <p>It is important to understand that our capital investments span many years and that we are not guided by a short-term mentality. We need to continue investing in capital to grow our business and have the capacity to meet demand in any market circumstance. We're fully utilizing all the natural gas capacity that has been added through these capital investment decisions so far in 2010.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we also made various decisions to sustain the viability of our business to remain profitable and to continue implementing our development plans in accordance with our strategy, goals and objectives. Last year, we were faced with difficult and challenging decisions concerning the economic tradeoff between netbacks and volumes. And we have demonstrated throughout 2009 the decisions we made were economically advantageous to NOVATEK as the financial results attest.</p>
          <p>We have worked diligently throughout the past year to improve the specific netbacks on the traders and remote points contract, and this aim was achieved by improving the netbacks from RR667 per 1,000 cubic meters to RR875 per 1,000 cubic meters or by 31%. Although the average realized prices for total end-customer sales were still lower by 4.2% versus our ex-field sales netbacks. Our overall netback improvement was achieved through a shift in deliveries to regions where the aggregate distance delivered under the renegotiated contract was reduced by approximately 1,100 kilometers throughout the third and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>We have not extended its contract with sales commenced in the 1st of January, 2010. Therefore, all volumes sold were revert back to the wholesale traders category. The rationale underlying our decision to tradeoff netback margins versus production volumes was a completion of the first few stages of phase 2 development of Yurkharovskoye field, which allowed us to significantly increase our liquid productions at this field by approximately 66.9%, culminating in a combined increase of liquid productions from our core fields of 475,000 tons or by 18.5% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The ability to optimize production flexibility within our core fields served us extremely well during the difficult market period. During 2009, we produced approximately 74% wet gas as compared to 61% in 2008, thus supporting the aforementioned growth in our overall liquids production. We will continue to invest capital in the next several years to further optimize our production capacity and enhance our operational efficiencies such as the decision to add another potential 7 billion cubic meters of productive capacity to our Yurkharovskoye field during 2010.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we increased our natural gas production quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year by 14.7% and 2.6% respectively allowing us to maintain daily gas production of 96 million cubic meters per day or slightly over 3.4 billion cubic feet per day during the quarter. Equally important, we were able to continue increasing our liquid production quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year by approximately 30% during both periods.</p>
          <p>This point is especially noteworthy considering the strengthening of the commodity prices and improving netback margins. More specifically, we increased natural gas production at the Yurkharovskoye field by 53.6% during 2009 while at the same time significantly reducing our third-party purchases because we now meet the majority of our demand through internal production, although we will continue to selectively purchase natural gas from time to time to compliment our marketing options.</p>
          <p>For liquids, we managed to significantly increase our unstable gas condensate productions on the Yurkharovskoye field by approximately 595,000 tons or by 66.9%, again reiterating the successful implication of phase 2 development activities at the field.</p>
          <p>When we look back at 2009, I believed this past year without question a defining year for NOVATEK as we certainly demonstrate the resiliency of our business, expanded our production, penetrated new commercial markets, reduced our controllable operating expenses and achieved record growth in our resource base despite the periodic skepticism we heard throughout the year.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we grew our natural gas production by 6.3% and our liquid production by 18.5%. We expanded our proved reserves under the SEC and PRMS cases by 1.9 billion and 2.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent respectively. At year-end, our proven reserves estimate appraised by DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton under the SEC and PRMS reserve reporting standard totaled 6.9 billion and 7.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent respectively. We achieved a nine-fold or 898% reserve replacement rate as well as increased our reserve to production life from 23 years to 29 years under SEC proved reserves.</p>
          <p>For natural gas, our reserve replacement rate was 958% and our reserve to production life is 30 years. Our three and five-year reserve replacement rates are 431% and 315%. Our lifting and production costs continue to remain as one of the lowest in the global oil and gas industry. Our reserve and play cost for 2009 was approximately $0.55 per barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>We penetrated new commercial markets by delivering stable gas condensate to the Asian-Pacific region, namely China, Singapore and South Korea. This expansion will allow us to better manage our increasing volumes of stable gas condensate and optimize our netbacks.</p>
          <p>And during 2009, we made a significant acquisition of a 51% equity stake in Yamal LNG, the holder of the South Tambeyskoye license area, which will serve as a future platform for production growth. Since the successful IPO in July 2005, we have managed to increase our production by over 60%, expand our resource base by 2.3 billion barrels equivalent or roughly by 50%, as well as expand our reserve to production life from 25 years to 29 years. These are phenomenal achievements for a company of our scale and size ,unmatched by any other company in the global oil and gas universe, and clearly warrants NOVATEK to be a core holding in global portfolios, not just the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We, like most companies, are subject to a vast array of macroeconomic events over which we have no direct control. Fully understanding this limitation, what we were able to achieve and navigate through this turbulent period by making sound investment decisions, reducing unnecessary costs, maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving liquidity. I believe these core objectives were achieved in 2009 as demonstrated by our positive financial and operational results in both the fourth quarter and full year.</p>
          <p>We will continue to operate in a financially responsible manner and we will certainly use this past year as a learning experience for our future business decisions. The economic situation on the domestic market has clearly shown signs of stabilizing, particularly as the past year progressed. And more importantly for natural gas, it appears that we troughed around the period of May to July corresponding to traditional seasonality patterns and then began recovering volumes during the latter part of the third quarter and most definitely in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I believe this pattern of volume recovery aptly correlates with the signs of economic recovery in Russia as well as the start of a colder than normal winter. If we study the consumption patterns for natural gas in the domestic market over the past three years, we can note a clear drop-off in demand back to roughly 2007 levels with the consumption patterns tracking closely for both the peaks and the trough periods.</p>
          <p>The stronger growth in economic activities in the third and fourth quarters 2009, and for that matter, so far in 2010 combined with a colder than winter season has allowed us a continued growing production. We should view these factors as positive signs of domestic demand recovery. We have continued to grow our natural gas and liquid productions in 2010 to reach levels of &#x2013; record levels of production per day.</p>
          <p>Natural gas consumption during the first two months of 2010 are trending higher than 2008 pre-crisis and 2009 levels. Even though it is too early to predict the extent of economic recovery, we believe these initial signs are encouraging. And if the consumption patterns remain, we believe we have the potential to return to pre-crisis levels as early as the end of 2009 or 2010, excuse me, or some time in 2011.</p>
          <p>We will continue to appraise the market on the demand of natural gas as the year progresses, particularly as we wind down the winter season and enter the traditional lower consumption patterns in Russia.</p>
          <p>I would like to now focus the part of my discussion on a few other issues of concerns aside the demand of natural gas that has been voiced over our business prospects, changes in our shareholder structure, capital expenditures guidance, the Yamal LNG project amongst other, before I revert back to discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>We have repeatedly stated that we share a very normal and constructive working relationship with Gazprom. We have worked and we'll continue to work very closely with Gazprom in many aspects of our business, whether it's our combined lobbying efforts, providing inputs into the Russian gas balance, working together on technical issues or through regular board meetings. This constructive relationship at all levels of management is very important to our company and we look forward to working closely with Gazprom's management on a variety of issues, including but not limited to the development of the natural gas prolific region of the Yamal Peninsula. So, any comments to the contrary should be taken with a high degree of skepticism.</p>
          <p>There are also a number of recent rumors circulating in the press and amongst the analyst community that I'd like to offer our comments. The latest to these rumors has Gazprom potentially purchasing Sibneft Gas amongst other assets. And the purchase will be affected through the swap of a portion of NOVATEK's shares with Gazprombank. While it is our general policy not to specifically comment on rumors, there are some general comments that I can make on this matter.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we do not believe that Sibneft Gas is a core asset to the bank and more of an asset of interest to Gazprom. Therefore, we will not be too surprised to see Gazprom execute this swap because I believe the bank would be much more comfortable holding NOVATEK shares, which are on the list approved by the Central Bank for funding purposes and our shares are more liquid since they are actively traded.</p>
          <p>The other important point I'd like to stress on this matter is that Gazprom is presently a minority shareholder of NOVATEK and will most likely stay as a minority shareholder even if they use a portion of the shares in the rumored swap. Under any of these circumstances, we do not believe this rumor transaction has any negative consequences in NOVATEK or our rights to access to transportation and construction or for general business operations. Most definitely, it does not signal any change in relationships or dispute between our management nor does it signal any concerns or problems regarding our shareholder structure.</p>
          <p>NOVATEK is operating in the natural gas markets in Russia for over 14 years and we believe we have built a stellar reputation for being an efficient producer and reliable supplier of natural gas domestically.</p>
          <p>Another question that has been raised lately has to do with the changing shareholder structure of NOVATEK. Last year, Volga Resources or its affiliates, which I will refer to collectively for this conversation as Volga Resources, increased its respected equity in NOVATEK to approximately 18.2%. Subsequently, Volga Resources filed with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Services of the Russian Federation to potentially increase their collective holdings in NOVATEK up to 23.49% and this request was approved.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it is safe to assume that Volga Resources will continue purchasing equity in NOVATEK up to the stated limits as the most recent transaction demonstrates. We view the participation of this large shareholder as positive for NOVATEK and all of the shareholders and we actually do not subscribe to any of the negative comments regarding the minority shareholder rights or changes to our corporate governance resulting from the change in our shareholder structure.</p>
          <p>We have seen the overall strengthening or stabilizing of crude oil markets from a period of high priced volatility. Despite being significantly lower than the peak of July 2008, the prices have solidified for all three benchmark crude oils that we tracked.</p>
          <p>We have historically operated in a volatile pricing market and we'll continue to do so in the future. However, we believe we have taken corrective steps to protect our netback margins through market channel and customer diversification, continued negotiations for the reduction in certain export and transport tariffs and through risk management practices like hedging when we deem this to be a reasonable option.</p>
          <p>Presently, the liquid markets have been trading in a reasonable commodity pricing band trading in the range of $70 to $80 per barrel for the past eight to nine months, which strengthens product netbacks for deliveries to our key markets. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, we sold a portion of our stable gas condensate to the Asian-Pacific region. And throughout the remainder of the year, we continued to increase our commercial trade to this important consuming region.</p>
          <p>We dispatched nine tankers to the Asian-Pacific region during 2009 versus none dispatched in 2008. The combined volume sold to the Asian-Pacific region was approximately 529,000 tons making this region second to volume sold to our biggest market, the United States.</p>
          <p>The flexibility of our commercial sales approach and the high quality of our products provided us with the opportunity to shift our sales channels and diversify our consumer base. There was a dramatic improvement in our netback prices per ton in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the fourth quarter 2008, and to a lesser extent, the netback we received relative to the third quarter of 2009. This was obviously driven by the strengthening of benchmark crude oil prices in the fourth quarter 2009 as well as the contraction in discounts during the period.</p>
          <p>Last year, we successfully negotiated reductions in both the export duties for LPG and a reduction of real tariffs for the transportation of a stable gas condensate and LPG. During 2009, we significantly increased our LPG exports by approximately 350%, largely to capitalize on these concessions. But I believe more importantly, Russian LPG became much more competitive on the export markets with the reduction of the export duties.</p>
          <p>To continuously expand our LPG markets, we launched our wholly-owned subsidiary, Novatek Polska on the 1st of January 2010, and we will continue to look at new opportunities to expand our commercial reach, penetrate new markets and selectively diversify our marketing channels.</p>
          <p>Our customer mix and geographical penetration has and will continue to have a strong influence on the average real life prices we received for natural gas. Our primary goal is to continue expanding our market share in the domestic market and we believe that growth will continue to materialize in the power sector as new capacity is added and the Russian federation continues to recover from the doldrums of the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>Last year, we won new &#x2013; two new power customers, INTER RAO and OGK-1, through a competitive tender process and we effectively began marketing natural gas to these customers on the 1st of January 2010. Unfortunately, we feel it is premature to speculate about new business opportunities or customers at this particular time. We believe we are positioned to capitalize in any new market opportunities that may arise with the added capacity we've launched over the past several years and the primary location of our fields relative to the transportation infrastructure. We will continue to highlight any changes in our commercial marketing plans and strategies as the usual course of business on our conference calls.</p>
          <p>In May 2009, we acquired a 51% equity state in Yamal LNG, the holder of the license for the South Tambeyskoye field. This was a significant transaction for NOVATEK as we believe this field will serve as a future production platform for the company in Yamal Peninsula, as well as allowing us to continue growing our core natural gas business and expand on our resource to this.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we achieved some immediate milestones in moving this important project forward. We extended the South Tambeyskoye license from 2020 to 2045. We began the process of remediating some of the infrastructure problems that were acquired with the asset. We had our independent petroleum engineers, DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton, appraise the reserves for the field, and we established the data room for international oil companies to evaluate the information on this field. So far, the interest expressed for this project has been very high, and we look to continuing our dialogue with the IOCs in this respect.</p>
          <p>Another question we often receive is regards to the timeline for the production of potential LNG from the Yamal Peninsula. We will continue to study the global market and LNG from Russia as well as the current supply picture. We're confident that global markets will have the capacity to absorb cargos of LNG from the South Tambeyskoye project when production commences from this field. However, it is too premature at this stage to discuss any concrete production for capital expenditure plans for this particular project. We will continue to provide more information on Yamal LNG through periodic updates, conference calls and our strategy presentation.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we spent approximately 18 billion, excluding the acquisition of the Yamal LNG stake, which is 43.8% lower than what we spent in 2008. We were able to negotiate on average a reduction in capital expenditures of approximately 30%, which partially explains some of the differences, but the change between period also relates to completion of significant projects in 2008. In 2009, we spent approximately RR11.4 billion on the Yurkharovskoye field development, a roughly 64% of our capital expenditures, and added approximately 7 billion cubic meters of new production capacity.</p>
          <p>We continued with the construction of a gas condensate pipeline from Yurkharovskoye field to the Purovsky processing plant in 2009 as well as added new LPG storage tanks. We expect this important pipeline project to be completed and operational sometime during the second half of 2010. We also continued with our development program at the Yurkharovskoye field, and recently added three new producing wells to our production well stock.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we completed and launched a 40,000-ton methanol plant at the Yurkharovskoye field, which combined with the initial 12,500 ton plant we launched in 2007, should reduce ongoing operational expenses such as purchases and transportation. In 2009, we also launched our LPG scrubbing unit at the Purovsky processing plant with a capacity of 1.3 million tons with this unit, being the first of its kind in Russia. It allows us to produce the highest quality of LPG, meeting all of the stringent European Union standards.</p>
          <p>We continue to expand our capital on exploratory programs and completed a number of projects. In 2009, we drilled approximately 4,200 meters of exploration drilling and ran 310,000 square meters, a three-dimensional seismic. The 3D seismic was run mainly at the Yurkharovskoye field and the new Yurkharovskoye license area and will be used to position the drilling of exploratory wells in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Overall, NOVATEK's geologists discovered new &#x2013; nine new hydrocarbon layers, including one gas condensate and oil layer, at the North-Yubileynoye field, one gas and gas condensate layer at the Raduzhnoye fields, and seven condensate layers at the Yurkharovskoye field. We also received confirmation from the Natural Resources Ministry of the Russian Federation to convert four exploration licenses to production licenses for fields initially discovered in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter of 2009, we managed to increase our natural gas production by 1.1 billion cubic meters quarter-on-quarter or by 14.2%. This was largely driven by the traditional peak season, but it also somewhat represents a gradual recovery and overall economic activities within a country and the colder than normal weather, which has persisted so far in 2010.</p>
          <p>We managed to increase our full-year gas production by approximately 1.9 billion cubic meters or 6.3% and our liquid production by 475,000 tons or 18.5% when most our international peers experienced the opposite results in the respective businesses. However, our full-year sales volume for natural gas were slightly down by 1% due to an increase in natural gas injected into the underground storage and the reduction of purchases from third parties.</p>
          <p>For stable gas condensate, we had a record quarter in terms of tankers dispatched to the export markets and volumes sold. During the fourth quarter, we dispatched nine tankers to all three major regions and landed an additional two tankers in transit for a total of 11 tankers or approximately 652,000 tons realized as export sales in the quarter. If we compare quarter-on-quarter, we increased our liquid volume sold in the export market by approximately 185,000 tons as well as improved our average netback for stable gas condensate by approximately $35 per ton.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, for LPG sales, we increased our export volumes by approximately 15,000 tons or 14.6% and correspondingly increased our average realized netbacks by approximately $70 per ton.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2009, our total liquids sold increased by 498,000 tons or by 18.9%. From a commercial marketing perspective, we managed to demonstrate to the market that we're able to move our hydrocarbon products despite the economic slowdown. We will continue to review our hydrocarbon value chain to determine how best to optimize our product netbacks across diverse regions and markets. As mentioned previously, one of the steps we recently took was to form a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland to further facilitate LPG sales across this key market region.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we managed to significantly increase our proven reserve base under the more conservative SEC standards to approximately 6.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 431% reserve replacement rate over a three-year average. We also maintained a good ratio of proved developed producing and proved undeveloped reserves. At year-end, we had 4.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at proved developed producing and 2.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent for proved undeveloped represented a combined reserve and production life based on 2009 production of 29 years.</p>
          <p>With the change in regulations on reporting in the company's reserves under the SEC rules, we decided to increase the overall transparency of our oil and gas reserves in a separate section of our management discussion and analysis. We felt that our investors and analysts would find this additional information more informative, as well as provide some additional disclosures regarding our probable, possible reserves under the PRMS reserve reporting standards.</p>
          <p>We expect to remain one of the lowest cost producers in the world among our global oil and gas peers with our strong focus on cost controls, our prolific fields, and the positive movements on resource base year-on-year. Our commitment to remain a low cost producer is embedded in our operational and financial decisions as well as our strategic plans to continue growing our resource base and expanding our processing capacity.</p>
          <p>We believed that being a low-cost producer provides us with numerous benefits and allows us to survive and/or prosper under a variety of market conditions. Moreover, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to add incremental reserves in the most cost-effective manner making NOVATEK one of the most unique oil and gas companies in the world in this important oil and gas industry metric.</p>
          <p>We operated our Purovsky processing plant at approximately 57% of its capacity throughout the year with a total output of 2.1 million tons of stable gas condensate and 760,000 tons of LPG. We dispatched 36 tankers for the year at the Port of Vitino of which 23 were destined to the United States, four tankers each to Western Europe, Singapore and China and one tanker to South Korea. We had no tankers in transit at the 31st of December 2009 as compared to one tanker at year-end 2008 and two tankers at the 30th December 2009. Total goods in transit at year-end were approximately 111,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Our share of natural gas at the production of total revenues decreased quarter-on-quarter to approximately 55%, whereas our stable gas condensate grew from 24% in the third quarter to roughly 30% in the fourth quarter mainly due to the number of tankers sold in the period combined with strengthening liquid prices.</p>
          <p>Overall, our average realized prices across all products except for the domestic and export crude oil prices increased quarter-on-quarter, but were slightly lower for a majority of our liquid hydrocarbons as compared to the full-year 2008. As for netbacks we received in 2009 versus 2008, we were very pleased with the results we achieved throughout the year especially considering the difficult market environment we faced.</p>
          <p>For natural gas, our end-customer netbacks, excluding traders in remote plains increased by 2.2% whereas our ex-field netback realizations increased by 7.2%. As I previously mentioned, we stated we should increase our netback realizations throughout 2009 for those volumes sold to traders in remote points and I believe we have successfully delivered on that commitment. For natural gas, we achieved the highest netbacks during year for end customer volumes sold in the fourth quarter, exceeding our full-year and third quarter netbacks by 3.2% and 2.1%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Our combined average realized price we receive for end customer sales increased by 4.9% between the third and fourth quarters 2009 and was 13.3% higher year-on-year. Our total netbacks realized for the year was lower than 2008, mainly due to the shift in sales to traders in remote points. As I mentioned, going forward, these sale volumes have reverted back to the wholesale trader category effective January 1st, 2010.</p>
          <p>Our operating expenses for both the full year and quarter-on-quarter increased in relation to the growth of our business in 2009. Our operating expenses quarter-on-quarter increased in absolute terms from RR13.6 billion to RR16.1 billion, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues. For the full year, our operating expenses increased by RR 9.2 billion or by 19.6% and grew as a percentage of total sales from 59.2% to 62.4%.</p>
          <p>We continue to effectively manage our operating cost throughout 2009 relative to the overall size of our business. The most significant increase for the full-year and quarter-on-quarter was the growth in our transportation expenses which is clearly explainable by the switch between the wholesale and end costumer sales and the overall growth in liquid volumes sold. Taxes and other income also grew period-on-period and year-on-year largely due to the volumetric nature of this expense item.</p>
          <p>As we continue to increase both natural gas and liquid production volumes during the periods, our corresponding tax obligations increased. For general and administrative expenses, we managed to tightly control our costs throughout the year as one of our key steps to reduce controllable expenses during the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>Even though we've slightly increased our G&amp;A expenses for the year and quarter-on-quarter, we believe this rise in our expense line item was insignificant and possibly reflects management stability to manage cost in a variety of market environments.</p>
          <p>As a result of these factors enumerated above, our EBITDA and net profit margins improved throughout 2009 and were relatively in line with our overall guidance and historical norms. We believe that this was an exceptional achievement for the company considering this difficult period and it is a strong testament to resiliency of our business operations.</p>
          <p>We managed to increase our earnings per share sequentially each quarter during 2009 and more notably by a 13.9% to RR8.5 per share versus RR7.5 per share in 2008. Our balance sheet and liquidity position continue to remain strong throughout the year and we ended the year with a positive working capital position.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned throughout our previous conference calls, we do not experience any major nonpayment issues throughout the year including the fourth quarter. We paid close attention to our debtor balances in 2009 particularly in light of the potential non-payment issues, due to deteriorating liquidity issues stemming from the economic crisis. As a normal course of our business, we will continue to closely monitor customer payment patterns and our credit terms and conditions to minimize any negative financial impact or exposure.</p>
          <p>On a long-term debt and short-term debt, it's completely manageable in respect to our cash flow generation and we expect to repay approximately RR13.8 billion of debt this year. We maintain an ongoing dialogue with our banking colleagues and report quarterly to our credit rating agencies on liquidity matters. None have expressed any concerns about NOVATEK's ability to repay debt or sustain our present liquidity. In fact, we repaid RR3.4 billion on our syndicated loan in January 2010 as per the loan maturity schedule.</p>
          <p>We remained free cash flow positive during 2009. We achieved record financial and operational results for the fourth quarter 2009 and we are extremely pleased with the development on NOVATEK and the way we conducted and managed our business during the past year.</p>
          <p>We did everything possible to preserve the profitability of our business. We maintained strict focus on cost control and we tested the ability of our commercial operations to sustain positive netbacks in one of the most difficult periods we have operated in, since the inception of our company.</p>
          <p>I would like to conclude by thanking all our valued shareholders for your confidence in our management and your continued belief in NOVATEK. Our senior management will do everything within its control to ensure the continued success and growth of NOVATEK and to preserve our profitability and financial soundness. I believe our track record since we've been public in 2005 and the solid financial and operational results we achieved in the fourth quarter speaks volumes for our ability to navigate both through good times and turbulent periods.</p>
          <p>We have outlined a strategy and vision for the company, which we are committed to realize and we will be updating our corporate strategy later this year. The cornerstone of our success has been, and will continue to be, our execution of our strategy. Despite some contrary comments, we read about from time to time, we are absolutely committed to inherent the best practices in corporate governance and transparency, and we are fully aligned with the interest of all our shareholders' stakes. Our reputation in the market is very important to all of us.</p>
          <p>NOVATEK is an extraordinary company with extraordinary prospects. As I mentioned in my closing statement for last year's results, I stated that I am certain that we will come out of this crisis in a much stronger position, as a result to the prudent decisions we have undertaken, our discipline towards cost control and the capital investments we make. I believe we met these challenges and are a stronger and a more focused company as a result.</p>
          <p>I would like to end my portion of the conference call and open the session to question and answers for both Mr. Mikhelson and myself. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this portion of the conference call will be conducted in both the Russian and English languages.</p>
          <p>Therefore, please allow time for simultaneous translation if your question is in English and for those questions asked in Russian, please repeat your question in English for the courtesy of our listening audiences. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Question and answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take questions in the order received or we will take as many as time permits. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now take our first question from Mr. Lev Snykov of VTB Capital.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. Thanks for the call. I have a couple of general questions. First of all, considering that there is a major improvement year-on-year in your CapEx versus cash flow, do you have any internal thinking or internal targets on free cash generation going forward and potentially some increase in free cash yield or dividend payout, again, as a pure internal target?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be on Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye field, like if you could say in a bit more detail, what's the process now and what are the parties involved in any kind of negotiation on &#x2013; with investor development on Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye field and about potential partnership with any foreign companies? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question and Mr. Mikhelson will answer the second part of it. In terms of CapEx versus cash flows, as I mentioned, we're still in the growth mode and we'll continue to invest capital. So we don't &#x2013; we don't expect to publish any sort of internal guidance in respect to returns or cash flow generation. We are still investing capital and we will continue to do so in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>As for the dividends, we're in the process now of finalizing the recommendations from the Board of Directors. And once that is approved at the Board level, we'll take that to the general shareholders' meeting in the latter part of April. So with that, I'd like to pass the question over to Mr. Mikhelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the South-Tambey field is concerned, as Mark mentioned already, it is a bit premature to make any forward-looking statements, and so I would definitely adhere to this statement as well.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We are currently negotiating with a whole number of companies, which have demonstrated their willingness to act as our partners in this project. But so far, we haven't yet arrived at a stage where one would be ready to sign any binding documents.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Speaking about the field itself, one should mention that it is currently in a state of a very good advancement in terms of the stats of the state and geological exploration and does not require any additional spending on this particular point. But it is very important for the company during this stage to come up with the most optimum plan for completing for this preliminary stage and get ready for it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And so the leadership of the company, at this point in time, views as its most important objective to put together the feasibility study for the project, which will subsequently produce a competitive product for the market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And so within this year, we are facing the task of completing the so-called pre-FEED and also define and make our decision in terms of who our potential partners might be.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We are looking very optimistically at this project and believe that within the timeframe of 2015 to 2020, the product from this particular project is going to be very much sought after in the market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three questions please. Mark, can you please confirm that you stopped deliveries to traders in remote points from January 2010 and do you plan to go back to this mechanism in future?</p>
          <p>Second question, you said that you managed to attract INTER RAO and OGK-1 on the basis of a competitive tender process. However, Gazprom said in the middle of January, during their investor day, that the terms of your contract with OGK-1 were less favorable than the terms of the regional contract with Gazprom. Can you please comment on that?</p>
          <p>And for the third question, you said in interview to PRIME-TASS or Interfax about one month ago, that after you expand your production capacity to 51 billion cubic meters later this year, you plan to utilize that new capacity in full during the winter. Can you please comment on that, whether it was mistranslation or misunderstanding or whether you indeed plan to produce 51 billion cubic meters in annual terms during next winter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer question one and question three, and then I'll let Mr. Mikhelson answer question two. I said it twice in my text that the answer is yes. We have stopped deliveries to traders in remote points effective the 1st of January, 2010. And I will never say that we won't go back, but right now, we don't anticipate going back to that types of market.</p>
          <p>The third question asked on terms of the 51, yes, that was a misquote. I never said it that we will produce 51 billion. I just said, with the capital expenditures that we plan to initiate in 2010, we will add another 7 billion cubic meters of capacity, representing approximately 51 by the end of the year, not production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the second question is concerned, I do not feel that I'm in a position to appraise the level of attraction and the terms and conditions of the contracts which Gazprom previously had with OGK-1 and INTER RAO. And I do not know how the management of Gazprom company that you're referring to is able to appraise the terms and conditions of the contracts that we have with these organizations simply because this information has been and is confidential.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] What we are able to share, and I will get that the ultimate indicator is the sales netback that we're enjoying in our domestic market, and simply because OGK-1 and INTER RAO stations are located in different regions, I can simply state that approximately average netback prices are in line with an average netback that's within INTER RAO, OGK-1 and the rest of our consumers.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And another thing that I can add about this issue, many years ago, back in 2005 as well as in 2006, we used to tell investors that because of the internal price graph as a result of the Federal Tariff Service, we are projecting the diminishing &#x2013; ratios in terms of our gas sales. This process is continuing. And what is important is we are remaining profitable and very competitive in our domestic market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you for the call. I actually have two questions. First question regarding the gas production volumes, as far as I recall, the previous guidance for this year's production was 10 to 16% increase. However, the volumes are up 18% year-to-date. Do you consider it possible to revise the production target afterwards?</p>
          <p>And on the second case &#x2013; and the second question is regarding Novatek Polska. Do you have any operational or financial targets for the subsidiary for 2010 and beyond? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Okay. I don't remember that we quoted any incremental percentages of growing our production in 2010. And I would like to say that it is not very indicative considering the current period, looking at the production volumes during the current period. Currently, this is &#x2013; actually the third month is coming to an end, which is the end of a very cold winter. And as Mark was telling us about '09, we've enjoyed a more than 6% growth in '09. We certainly expect that the amount of output in 2010 is going to be stronger, and this certainly depends upon the future winter season and between 2010 and 2011. It also depends upon the volume of underground injection in terms of what Russia will do in 2010.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] With respect to the second question, which is about the growing volumes for the Polish market as a result of establishing the Novatek Polska, I'd say that our main objective and our main task is not convert the volume, but rather to achieve a stable market position and an ability to reach out to the end consumer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have couple of questions for you, please. The first one, you mentioned that you will be moving away from selling to remote traders. I just wonder what will be the breakdown between end users and wholesale customers in the first quarter 2010, so you're going back to roughly for 50-50 or we'll see a slightly different breakdown. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second one, regarding your cost, on the transportation side, given regulatory increase in gas transportation tariff, I think it's around &#x2013; I might be wrong here, I think it's around 12%, 15%. Would you expect a similar increase for your gas transportation? And also what sort of inflation do we see elsewhere in terms of transportation of your liquids, for example, on the export domestic markets? Do we see also double-digit increase in global terms or is it better?</p>
          <p>And on the labor side, wages, I've seen a reduction in direct wages in the fourth quarter of last year, a relatively surprise reduction in payroll expenses on the direct wages side. Why did it happen and what other wage increase did you implement, say, from the start of this year, if any?</p>
          <p>And the last question if I can on South-Tambeyskoye field, I do understand correctly that the field is actually a strategic field; and as a result, for the development of the fields, you must &#x2013; the state control company must develop the field or is there a different rule applied to South-Tambeyskoye? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was about 50 questions in two. So I'll try to keep the first part relatively short. I would say &#x2013; you have to look at the results so far, to date. We have managed to control our cost, simply stated. I don't think it makes any sense to go through each specific line item right now and talk about whether it was in our slight reduction in payroll or transportation, et cetera. We provide that level of detail in our MD&amp;A for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Mark, sorry to interrupt. The real question is about this year. I'm asking whether transportation expenses will go up in line with regulatory increase and whether the wages did go up on the 1st of January this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Leonid will answer the questions on the government and the tariff. But in terms of the mix, previously, it was 50/50. I don't expect that to stay the same. It's probably more consistent than what we saw in the fourth quarter or second half of the year when we made that shift over from traders in remote points. So I suspect it will be about 70% to 75% in customer sales, 25% to 30% as the wholesale traders. I'll let Mr. Mikhelson answer the question on the tariffs and the South-Tambeyskoye field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the tariff issue is concerned, you are definitely familiar that the Federal Tariffs Commission as of January 1st has raised the domestic gas prices and similarly raised the tariffs for transportation as of January 1, 2010. But what is important to bear in mind that internal tariffs, price-wise, grew slightly higher than the transportation tariffs. And as far as we are informed, this particular trend shall continue. In other words, the profitability of more remote markets will longer term be equalizing with the profitability of the adjacent market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the South-Tambey field is concerned, indeed, this is the field with strategic reserves and the anti-monopoly agency, according to the law on foreign investments, in case it deems necessary forward these issues up to the government commission, with respect to both the NOVATEK shares and the entities in question, which are willing to become owners of this asset. We are sending notifications to this body on a timely basis, and therefore, we do not see any complications or difficulties for NOVATEK.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for a very detailed presentation. I have two questions actually. First one, regarding dividends, when should we expect any news on second half '09 dividends, given that they're registered to participate in the company's AGM will close in on Monday.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on INTER RAO and TGK-11. Also taking into consideration that INTER RAO with the control over TGK-11, do you discuss with INTER RAO potential increase of the volumes delivered to INTER RAO, OGK-1 and probably TGK-11? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Very soon, we're going to have a meeting of the Board of Directors, which will be recommending the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders' respective dividend payout and after these decisions are made, we will definitely make them all public, but the 13% of the profit [inaudible] somehow envisages the company's ability to slightly increase its dividend payout. As far as the second question is concerned, we have signed a long-term supply gas contract to the INTER RAO and the OGK-1 generating stations in the amount required by them for their stable operations. In case they would plan to increase consumption at these stations, we would be also in a position to meet this demand.</p>
