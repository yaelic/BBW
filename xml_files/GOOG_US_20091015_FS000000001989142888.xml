        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's third quarter 2009 earnings call and conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer and Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management.</p>
          <p>After we cover a few housekeeping items we'll start taking questions from the moderator pages we did on the last call. Also this call is being webcast from our investor relations website located at investor.google.com.

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With that we're going to take as many questions as we can accommodate the remaining questions and I will start with a question from Mark Mahaney from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How can a company with 22 billion on the balance sheet and cash generate negative net interest income? How about cutting out the hedging program and buying back stock? That's a huge negative drag on your ROI. Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mark, thanks for the question. It's obvious that the consequence of the last year is pulling through on OI&amp;E. So just to give you how we're managing it is, as soon as a couple of quartering ago, we were all in very conservative portfolio in order to protect the cash given and the economic situation.</p>
          <p>Since then, we've actually revised our investment strategy and have agreed to an investment portfolio for the long term, and we're in the process of actually moving out of the very conservative position we are &#x2013; we were, and &#x2013; but there's an impact obviously because we're doing this on a gradual rollout basis.</p>
          <p>We could not move &#x2013; we're not a money manager in the sense of moving money in and out of billions of dollars on a daily basis. That's not the business of Google, so our business is going to be to build a really good portfolio that ties back to the objectives that the committee and the Board set, which clearly much better than just staying on day to day sovereign backed securities.</p>
          <p>So that's going to take a couple of quarters to roll out. In the meantime we're on the operating income side you're paying the price for it while we're migrating. We recognize that. But I would separate that. So we'll fix that. It's just going to take a couple of quarters, and that's going to be fixed, and then we will not be in a position we're in today.</p>
          <p>I think that overall though I'm really pleased the fact that we have protected our assets so well over the last year. On the flip side &#x2013; on the hedging side, I think that our hedging is an insurance policy, and if you look at the &#x2013; again last 12 months, it's served us so incredibly well that we have &#x2013; there's a really good case to continue to invest the dollars we've put there, and as volatility comes down, the costs are also going to come down, so hopefully that will also benefit us.</p>
          <p>So the net of these two things I think that we have a very balanced strategy. I'm not saying, I'd love to be exactly where our kind of target portfolio should be. But we have to do this in a disciplined manner, so it's going to happen over a couple of quarters. And then from there we'll be in a much more regular state. So from that perspective I think you're right that the third quarter kind of illustrates a transition period.</p>
          <p>In terms of the last point of your question I think Eric mentioned it very clearly on the call. So that's how we think of OI&amp;E and it bound to change over the coming quarters. So that's for your &#x2013; thank you again for that question because it's an obvious question to ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question is from Brian Pitz from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you broadly discuss Google's strategy regarding search distribution deals. Do you think you have reached enough scale into distribution to not overpay for these deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk about the first part, Brian. Thank you again for that question, because I think the first part of the question is the heart of the matter, which is, you know, we look at every distribution deal we can, because it's good for the ecosystem. It's good for everybody &#x2013; everybody makes money when you have a good distribution deal. And in that context all we want to make sure is, you know, we have also discipline at making sure when there's a deal it's a win-win.</p>
          <p>And I wouldn't comment that in the past anybody overpaid for anything. There may be deals in that behind sight didn't make sense, and needed the restructuring, but that doesn't mean that somebody overpaid. So in my mind, right now we have a really good strategy of making sure that every partner we can bring on Board is a good partner, and we've just got to make sure that everybody wins at it. So I'm actually &#x2013; I'm quite pleased that the way that this is going and we hope to have even more partners in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The next question is on the tax rate. The tax rate was 21%. How should we think about the tax rate going forward from Imran Khan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Imran. Sorry. Pardon me for this cough I had. Tax continues to be quite elusive for many of the analysts that have models because of all of the factors that are at play in taxes. So FX is a big issue for our taxes and also the hedging program and how it flows through the tax effect. So, you know, we're pleased to have 21%, but we really can't comment about the future because it's so dependent on these big variables that will affect us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. The next question is from Heath Terry from FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that mobile search volumes grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a sense of monetization levels of global search query versus their traditional search query and what kind of trends you're seeing in global search monetization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Heath this is Jonathan. We don't really comment specifically on the monetization statistics versus &#x2013; mobile versus desktop. I can certainly say that from a search traffic perspective, our search traffic volume is being very nicely driven on mobile by smartphone adoption. In some markets like in Japan mobile searches are growing twice as fast as desktop searches over the last year or so.</p>
          <p>Eric mentioned that advertisers are seeing value in taking advantage of new Google ads products, and I think in the long run mobile is really going to emerge as one of those. I think right now what we see is that advertisers are typically just extending their campaigns into mobile and they're not doing as much customization with campaigns on he mobile side because there's not as much volume. But as the start seeing more volume, they'll customize the campaigns better, which will make the whole ad network work better.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing we're seeing is that display seems to work very well on some of these devices. And I think that's because of the level of engagement that a user has when they're staring at a cell phone and actually seeing a display ad. They tend to notice it more. And unlike, when they're on a desktop machine, they're less likely to click away from it. So there's much more of a dynamic of portion engagement with display. So I think we're quite optimistic there and optimistic about AdSense on the high-end mobile devices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. The next question is from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How is the company managing the growth of vertical search platforms, particularly in the retail category, EPM <mark type="ph" /> and so on? And should we expect more direct investment in vertical areas such as Base, Product Search, Checkout or more horizontal approach? Jonathan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The strategy certainly depends a lot on verticals. So Product Search and shopping is certainly one where we're particularly focused at the moment. We're continuing to improve the shopping vertical. We launched the find nearby store, which is the first local shopping feature, recently. We're also trying to have a much more visual shopping. OneBox, if you type in Chrome, toaster, you'll see the shopping OneBox and how that works.</p>
          <p>We're doing well with Checkout as a payment platform there. And I think we're starting to get more focused on some of the other verticals. We've always done well in images. You're certainly aware of the work that we're doing in books. We've made more progress with health. We just launched the poison control OneBox. Real estate, finance and travel are also other areas that we're going get quite focused on. And obviously, we'll also continue to improve Google horizontally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. The next question is from Colin Gillis [Brigantine Advisors].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk to the value of mobile clicks compared to desktop clicks and specific verticals where the value is much higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you cover that already in a previous question, Jonathan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the dynamics are very different, if you think about it. And it all relates to the probability that the user is actually going to consummate a transaction. So if you're searching locally for a restaurant or a coffee shop, then the value of a click is different from a desktop, and in some cases you don't get credit for the click because the user just walks in the store. And so I think we're still sorting some of that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. The next question is from Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is pretty commendable that Google is not micromanaging its business based on margin percentages. That said, should we think about the business from the standpoint of a cash flow dollar target, three, five, seven years out, or sustainable cash flow growth rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that -- let me just give a bit more comments, Jeetil, on what I said on the previous call, which is obviously we have the focus of the company is on innovation, innovating products that actually serve users and benefit also our advertisers, and so from that perspective.</p>
          <p>The only point we wanted to make on the previous call that is worth restating is if there was an area where we needed to invest heavily in the short term, in order to really fuel growth in a specific area, we have the means to do it, and we &#x2013; Google wouldn't kind of worry for a quarter, a couple of quarters if it really was the right strategic decision to kind of say, what's going to be our percentage margin impact?</p>
          <p>We're here to build businesses. And in that sense you have a positive mindset of instead of being stuck in margin land, which is what most companies live in, we can actually be in the land of capturing opportunities. And for us that's so much more powerful.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, just for an illustration rather than to make the case for one, if android continues to have all of the runway that it's having right now, you go from one, as Jonathan and Eric talked, one handset with one provider in one country to the staff that we shared with you a bit earlier, like 25 countries, 30 handsets, or whichever was the reversal, maybe the reversal but it's so much more &#x2013; if we had to kind of invest in those areas, and the question became, well, what's going to happen to the percentage margin, we'd never have that question.</p>
          <p>And that's why I think that we answer the question the way we did. I think that clearly Google is generating a healthy amount of cash, and we really are pleased by that. And that gives us the strategic degrees of freedom to actually do the kind of things that Eric talked about a bit earlier.</p>
          <p>So that's really how we think about business. Its about growth, its about users, and its about partners or advertisers. And that's how we think about the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Patrick. We're going to take the next question from James Mitchell of Goldman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the sharp sequential improvement in revenue, did Google also sharply increase bonus accruals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Patrick, again. We had had to do some additional accrual simply because, James, I think that's a good catch and many of you always ask us about these kind of bonus accruals.</p>
          <p>In Q3, the performance was such that we had to do a bit of a catch up on accruals, and that's what we meant when we talked in our comments that part of the quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses went to that as well. But it also went to a couple other items that I mentioned, like real estate and equipment. So, yes, absolutely, we had to have some accrual impact on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. The next question is from Ben Schachter, Broadpoint AmTech.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When can we expect to see the CPA model more broadly deployed on google.com?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. I guess I'm going start again, because I was speaking to myself on mute. So the conversion optimizer product is actually a CPA pricing model, and we're using it pretty broadly. I think we announced this quarter that it's managing over a billion in annual spend. And it's driving pretty good results for the advertisers. They use it to get more conversion and manage it to a lower CPA. We're running some experiments that I think some blogs may have picked up on CPA based pricing models, were some product focused advertisement. And these are generally running on the Google affiliate network on Google.com, but I can't comment much on, on how that is going until it launches a little bit more broadly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. The next question is from Wayne Chang of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The greater willingness to add more head, staff in investment company, could you comment on how aggressive that ramp may look like in 2010, and are there distinct areas you are looking to for more talent, i.e. display mobile video etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's Patrick here. What the bottleneck becomes finding great talent that should with the culture. And so we've ramped our hiring practices in our pipelines. We hope &#x2013; so we are &#x2013; we  won't give you specific numbers, but what I can tell you is, we are ramping up our pipelines to make sure that we have access. And we also think that in this kind of economic environment there's a great opportunity to actually get great talent as well, so we should capitalize on that as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Where we're going to invest them? I think Eric made the point that he hopes to have a 50% kind of engineering and then 50% everything else, so it's just a rule of thumb that we use that because this is an engineering driven company with innovation in its core, it's really important that the bulk of the hiring we're looking for is in the engineering talent, and they will be applied to all of our priority areas, and they, yes, include display mobile video, but also search because search continues to be the next billion dollar business as well. And we have such a healthy agenda on that one as well. So that's how to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Heath Terry of FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of advantage does the DoubleClick ad exchange offer over other ad exchange both from a competitive standpoint and from the standpoint of advertisers and publishers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Jonathan again, and hopefully you can hear me. We're really focused more on our own customers needs I think than others, specific competitive sake per se. We think there's a huge opportunity, as I think we've told you about to create this open ecosystem where buyers and sellers can meet and transact.</p>
          <p>One of the exciting features is, that we're actually able to do and that seamlessly integrate AdWords, advertisers and AdSense publishers and all of the DoubleClick, advertisers and publishers which has been part of the vision from the acquisition at the beginning. We're also trying to get very, very fast in real-time, so you actually have real-time bidding for buyers, real time yield management across all of the publisher channels and helping things clear properly. So we're very, very optimistic about how things are going there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jonathan. Perhaps the next question we can take from Sandeep Agarwal of Collin Stewart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What were the trends for search spend by small and medium advertisers during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. I think in general we saw fewer macro economic effects with the small and medium sized advertisers from the beginning of the recession than we saw with large advertisers. Larger advertisers, I think were faster to cut as the recession bean and they were stronger and faster to rebound as things came back. So the main trend that I think we saw that characterized the last quarter was the larger advertisers coming back. Patrick, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. I mean, that's why we emphasized it, because you'll remember we discussed in Q1 and Q2 how the big advertisers pulled back out and the SMB, small and medium businesses were holding their own, and what really we saw in Q3 was the big advertisers and depending on the verticals again depending on the geographies and not everything is same everywhere, but for -- these are the ones that made quite a significant difference in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the next question is from Richard Fetyko of Merriman Curhan Ford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are your intentions with the acquisition of <mark type="indiscernible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again if use the -- rather than to give you a specific answer, I mean, I think that if you -- if I was an analyst, kind of thinking through our own models, right, the next billion dollar of revenue doesn't require linear hiring and finance. So it really is about innovation. So I think that you can think through our organization and think through, if be really want to focus in the areas of engineering and the areas of sales, and support, then it tells you, you know, really where we're going to focus our hiring. And then obviously there's a number of other areas that we'll continue to grow just because we have &#x2013; with more businesses you have complexity of more businesses, so you do need the more lawyers, you need &#x2013; just  more of that. But the real bulk of it is really focused on the engineering community and sales and support community that really drive this eco-systems, so that's how we're thinking about it.</p>

          <p>How much of your sequential growth was driven by Ad quality improvement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we don't tend to break that out. We had a very good quarter from Ads quality perspective. U know I can tell you the significant things that we did, the biggest things probably in order or close to order were the UI tweaks that we did to the search results pages. We changed the maximum width, decreasing the spacing between the search results and the right hand side ads on widescreens. So with that it is increased click through rate on the right hand side ads. And I think we did that some time around the second week in August. We also some significant data improvement like site links, that basically allow additional links to categories and deeper advertisers of a site, which you could see, if you run a query maybe on something like Chevy, you'll see the Silverado, the Malibu, you'll see more information that would increase click-through rates. We also did some more work on showing more good ads and expanded match but we don't give a specific sense of exactly the percentage that that resulted in. The more significant of the changes occurred in mid-August.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jonathan. The next question is from Doug Anmuth at Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As the dollar has weakened, how are you thinking about your hedging program? Will you scale it down going forward? Was it declining quarter-over-quarter cost of hedging in Q3 due to less volatility or less exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Doug thanks for your question. Let me answer in kind of two, three different ways. First is, clearly the less -- there was less volatility in Q3. And we had taken, you will remember in Q2, because there was so much more volatility in Q1 and Q2 we're taking a lot more because of FAS 133 of these hedging costs through the P&amp;L at that time and therefore less volatile in Q3, the combination of less volatility and already taken big write-downs created less expenses for the quarter itself. So that's one piece.</p>
          <p>Going forward, right if -- international revenue continues to grow, I mean it will create more exposure for us, and in that sense it will require more attention on the hedging side. But that's how they think about the second part of your question. In the question of are we scaling it back? We scale it back, clearly not in the sense that when you look at all the benefits we gained last year from this program, it is seen as insurance. It's managed as insurance, and therefore, there's no plan on scaling it. Having said that, there is a plan for review it on a constant basis and formally annually as we build our plan for the board and we go back. If there is areas where we can actually be smarter in terms of more deductibles, if you have less volatility or like there is a science to this, right and we are running an optimum, it's not a blind exercise. It's running an optimum curve or its actually a specific point where we're trying to manage to and you try to minimize the cost obviously for the maximum benefits. And that's how we're thinking about and that's what we'll manage going forward.</p>
          <p>And then in general about the dollar weakening, I think that there may be, for anybody who has a perception that the dollar is going to continue to weaken over the coming two, three, four years, if you made that case, then you'd say, well, you don't need your hedging program. And that's the danger that every hedging program falls into which is people will say why are you investing this much this quarter into a hedging program that has no benefit because I know the dollar is going to weaken and then the next thing you know we have a crisis like we had last year and then they say, hey, where is your hedging program? So, it is insurance, its part of doing business in a business like ours, and I'll refer you back to the very first two points I've made which is its about finding the optimal point, making sure that we're kind of finding the best economic value for these hedging programs and then it will be driven a lot by the market itself and the exporters we have. But there is -- we're putting a lot of science into this obviously.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you. The next question is from Wein Cheng <mark type="ph" /> of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you comment on the level of monetization changes to YouTube and future thoughts on aligning the strategic goals for video to over the top distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. I guess I don't know exactly what over the top distribution means but I certainly know a lot about what's going on from a monetization perspective on YoutTube. So let me try to focus on that.</p>
          <p>I think we've said before we're monetizing more than one billion video views every week, and that the monetizable views have increased more than three times in the last year. So the model there is making partners money and the success of content idea I think over the course of the last several months has been a big part of that.</p>
          <p>Usage and traffic continues to be very, very strong, and we're now doing a good job of monetizing across the four activities that Chad tends to refer to on the site. The homepage as are going great. We've sold out the U.S. YouTube. A homepage over a significant period of time.</p>
          <p>We're making great progress on the search videos. If you look at the promoted videos on the right hand side, if you put in a query for something like soccer, the watch videos with the in-stream ads are going well. And we're getting some interesting videos uploaded and better engagement with the user community, if you take a look at the Quaker Oats contest that's running now on awakening your senses challenge; we're seeing a lot of interest there.</p>
          <p>So I think across the board things are going very, very well from a monetization perspective with YouTube.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the strong gains you're seeing in the display ad business, can you discuss whether these gains are a function of share gains and online display ads or do these dollars represent new dollars being allocated to the internet from offline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan again. And we certainly talked about how happy we are with the growth of the display business. We don't typically comment on our market share. I do think display has huge potential. I think we're &#x2013; our goal is to obviously help the overall pie grow, and I think we've succeeded because we're offering great performance to advertisers, and we're going to continue to grow revenue for our publishers. I think significant portions of dollars are coming offline to online.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thanks, Jonathan. The next question is from Jeff Lindsay. [Sanford Bernstein]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is search on mobile devices cannibalistic to PC search or is it additive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jonathan, you'll jump in on this as well. I think that the most exciting thing about mobile is that even though there maybe, the margin some stuff that's kind of overlap. It's essentially a new space. And because it's a new space, and there's been a lot of research done on this. And there was one for example, there was one we search today, I read not long ago whereby the end of 2011 or at the end of 2012 the research talks about smartphones surpassing the global PC in sales.</p>
          <p>So you end up in a world where, I guess, it's an and world rather than an or world, where you live very differently with your mobile device and the PC, but I mean, Jonathan maybe you'd like to add comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, that the intuitive way to think about it is really that it's not &#x2013; that it's largely non-cannibalistic, because think about it, having search with you at all times, basically opens up new opportunities no mater where you are at the time of day. So certainly a search that somebody was able to do, because they had their mobile phone with them when they are away from their desktop is unlikely to be cannibalistic.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we can actually see in the data is the complimentary aspect of the usage patterns across time of day and day of week. You see multiple usage increase in the middle of the day at lunch. You see it increase after work, you see it increase over the weekend, so I think some of those dynamics suggest that it's largely not cannibalistic but we need to continue to gather data there to better understand it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will we see more video ads within the Google search pages? And how will the YouTube sales force work with the existing bidding system for Google.com?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're definitely going to &#x2013; we're going to show more videos on google.com like we have that plus box now and you can see it on some queries, typically the queries that you see it on today are limited to entertainment and movies. I think there's some good product demonstration. I think type in Astro Boy I think that's an example that would generate one of the plus boxes. So I think we're pretty encouraged by the user and the advertiser responses there and we're going to keep investing in expanding that some more. I think that we want those formats ultimately to merge with the YouTube efforts from a sales and product perspective, which we're working to do.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the top three hurdles Google needs to cast to be significant player in display advertising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we sort of covered some of those already. I think that we talked on the first call &#x2013; you got to make it easier for the advertisers to run their campaign. We've got to get the demand for the publisher ad inventory. I think publishers are interested in forecasting, they want to extract the maximum value from the inventory that they have. They want to be able to use product like network builder much more easily to manage their inventory, across all of their sites. On the other side the advertisers basically want to use productrs like the ad planner product that we have so they can get much better at targeting relative to specific audiences. We launched demographic data in ad planner for I think nine or ten markets this last year, or this last quarter adding the U.K., France, Japan, Brazil, Australia and others. So I think it's just basically an effort around fixing what historically has been a very fractured and encomplass ad eco system and making it easier for the advertisers and the publishers to engage and thereby grow the pie for everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would &#x2013; just the way the question is written. I think that it is important to understand that in many ways Google is a very significant player in this play today. The question is, it is a model that's very fragmented at the model that's really has a kind of inefficiencies and many people would like to participate in the model where they &#x2013; if there was an exchange, if there was a place for publisher you could actually &#x2013; on an efficient basis. So from that perspective I think it really a story, it's really a story about fixing an industry that is really cumbersome and a lot of upside rather than a story of, are we catching up in some way, shape, or form.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the Display side we hear from marketers and agencies that they are interested in products that are not IET <mark type="ph" /> standard &#x2013; screen takeovers. How important is this business for you and how does it complement what you are doing on the exchange?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're trying to build display products for all advertisers out there both on the branded side and on the performance display side. So obviously, we want to support creativity as part of our strategy and everything that we do. We've been working on a bunch of tools focused on this within DoubleClick as well as within AdWords.</p>
          <p>The DoubleClick rich media studio basically being the main focus, so we're going to keep building and differentiating the products and trying to find ways to bring more accountability, showcase the ROI, and let the advertisers and publishers benefit from our innovations there. Exactly, how that will manifest itself in terms of what made today be non-IAB <mark type="ph" /> standard formats I can't say.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Okay. Next question is from Jim Friedland. Again a follow-up to Jonathan's <mark type="ph" /> comment that displays compelling in the mobile environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does mobile displays the material opportunity where the Company consider monetizing Google products, such as Gmail on mobile with display ads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would we consider something? Sure, we'd consider something. I think that mail on mobile maybe a little bit more difficult to aggressively monetize. Again, because you're dealing with the small screen size there, and it's a little bit more difficult to find adjacent room that doesn't get in the way of a mail message.</p>
          <p>Certainly, we're open to better ways of doing display on the mobile devices. It's not immediately obvious to me intuitively that Gmail would be a more monetizeable opportunity on mobile devices than it is on desktop devices. But we're certainly going to watch and see how mobile plays out.</p>
          <p>We're certainly -- there's some good examples there with popular apps, Urbanspoon, Shazam and others where I think we can get a sense at how some ad formats work and see whether or not there are opportunities there. I would be hesitant to really launch functionality that significantly adverse these peoples ability to read the mail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Other cost of revenue excluding depreciation was just 5 30 of gross revenues, which is quite a bit lower from a year ago. Can you provide an explanation if you do more efficient, are you <mark type="ph" /> cost lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes. So we are more efficient. And even depreciation, if you look at depreciation quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, I mean essentially, you know, when Eric talked a bit earlier about the fight that we really over the last year for an architectural point of view really and did a number of changes to be much more efficient. We got the benefits of that and we get the benefit from the machine utilization but we also get it on the network side, so overall you see it both in the OpEx side as well as the depreciation side, so it is &#x2013; and its part of the puzzle for that category. So I'm really happy that we're continuing to push harder in that area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>How do you &#x2013; maybe it's easier. They're still my boss. I guess really the only &#x2013; the most significant change probably for you all is that they're not on the earnings call which they were in the past. But generally, I think they're just as engaged and involved in the state of the business as they always have been. I think as a management team we're trying to do a better job of dividing and conquering across different products and different applications. So I think many of the folks on Eric's management team are more specifically focused on particular areas. Sergey for examples is diving deep on the social side. Larry is very involved in Chrome OS and Androids. So I think they continue to be very, very much engaged. I think that all of us on the management team are trying to get focused on specific efforts within the business, because the businesses now are so large that we can't all focus on everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is &#x2013; I think it's fair to say, Jonathan, that there are incredibly involved. I mean, in my mind, these two founders &#x2013; we see them daily, we see them through the week. We have on the are areas where they're focused, they're incredibly focused, they're very present. I guess Larry to this day, right, continues to review very hire very week, right. There is a presence and an active presence from both of them that continues to be incredibly energizing because it's so great to work day-to-day with these people.</p>
          <p>So it's not a question of don't assume that because they're not on the earnings call that they're somewhere else and they're kind of half checked out. They're here. They're here -</p>

          <p>Thanks. Mark, thanks for that question, because I think it is really &#x2013; people kind of always question that. But I think it's really at the heart of why Google is so special.</p>

          <p>This is Jonathan. We can probably take another question, because I'm not going to comment on future directions there. It's not something we're currently working on.</p>

          <p>Can you please give us color on what kind of trend you're seeing in the U.K., help with us pay click and EPC trends in the U.K.?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can talk geographically about the U.K. So let me just go back to my notes here. So we saw a decline year-over-year, but you saw increase also quarter-over-quarter for the U.K., primarily due to FX, because of the big changes decline since last year, and then the same thing for quarter-over-quarter. I think that in general, the U.K. continues to perform pretty well. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, given the tough economic environment that they have seen in the last little while, you know, you would have thought that they would have been a major pull-back. But the search continues to be there, and the key &#x2013; the key verticals that are driving U.K. continue to be doing kind of relatively well.</p>
          <p>So I think that there are signs of increasing consumer confidence, and if you think of Q3 for the travel vertical or the retail vertical, I mean, they did kind of okay, right. So it's not like U.K. is in the &#x2013; owes that, U.K. is holding its own I guess is the best way to portray it.</p>
