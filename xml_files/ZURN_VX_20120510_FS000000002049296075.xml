          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to results reporting for the three months to March 31, 2012 conference call. I'm Goran, the Chorus call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only-mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mrs. Debra Broek. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone on the line. Welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's Q1 Telephone Conference. I hope you all had the opportunity to watch the video and also with the first time you were able to probably download it onto your iPad or your iPhone. So hopefully you found that convenient.</p>
          <p>And I would like to pass it over now to Pierre Wauthier our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debra, and good afternoon or morning or evening, everyone. So just perhaps to put in context a couple of minutes, we had an excellent start in 2012 ,and we are very pleased with the results for the first three months with strong business operating profit as well as a strong NIAT. Strong ROE as well of 14.4% and this reflects the strong underlying performance across our operations, particularly in GI with the improved underlying loss ratio but as well in seeing growth across all other lines of business.</p>
          <p>In GI, we had 5% growth on the premium side in local currencies, in Life with 11% or at Farmers with 4% growth. We're also quite pleased with the fact that we've been able to maintain a strong balance sheet. We're within, as indicated in February, within our target range of AA at 100% to 120% ending the year at 103%. And I think these are all proved points that we remain focused and disciplined about executing our strategy and that we're making progress along these lines.</p>
          <p>The other point, I think, is that we're starting also to see our growth in emerging markets showing through with in particular the results from MAA and Santander now embedded in the numbers, albeit with one quarter lag still in the Santander results. And we will do a catch up later in the year. So overall very pleased with that and happy now to take questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had two questions. First of all, Pierre, can I just understand a bit more about the run rates of Life profitability? I know there was some impact from lower spreads and also some impact from the change of policy on DAC. I just want to understand if there's any other special impacts, negative impacts in the quarter or is the run rate we're seeing kind of to be expected based on current levels of investment return and the current business mix, which I think in particular is affecting DAC impact on the UK? So just a bit more color on the Life run rate would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Second question, could you remind us, I think you told us in the past, what would be the economic solvency coverage if you were to include liquidity premia that you've included in your Life EV in the economic capital coverage? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Andrew, with regards to the run rate Life profitability, the last year first quarter was impacted positively by special operating items which did not repeat this year so that had favorable impact on this year. With regards to our profitability this quarter I think what has been essentially affecting is the low interest rate environment, particularly in Germany as well as in Switzerland, which has indeed reduced the investment margin. We're seeing growth on the risk margin and on the expense margin in both areas, which as you know are our two key areas. And then the other point is that we have Santander coming in and which is not a full quarter impact and therefore all of these would indicate that they would be the growth areas.</p>
          <p>I think with regards to the low interest rate environment, which has been as a key driver. It really depends on where interest rates evolve in order to improve that. But at the same time, what you can expect is that the stronger growth that we're seeing in emerging markets should help the business operating profit going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the UK, this wasn't really affected by investment margin. It's more a change of policy on the deferred acquisition cost. Is there any lumpiness in that or I mean essentially the breakdown of profit shows that there's no net impact of deferral going forward and that you must be deferring a lot less in terms of costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is really mostly due to a change in the business mix in the UK and the fact that as a result of this business mix change, the impact on the acquisition of deferrals is not the same and has therefore caused, if you want, the lesser positive impact in 2012 versus 2011. So that can evolve again as the business mix changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the second question was on the economic solvency. So you're absolutely right. Our economic solvency ratio is with no liquidity premium, no matching premium or matching adjustments. I'm not sure that we have &#x2013; actually we have, yeah. So I guess in essence, this would be around five points on the economic ratio of uplift if we applied just that. The other thing perhaps, since you are on the Solvency II topic is that we also look to the actual loss liquid point on the yield curve will reduce swaps, so it goes very long and this would also make a significant difference if we took the much shorter yield curve that is currently being discussed on the Solvency II perspective, probably same order of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of uplift, it's five points of uplift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of uplift, yes, because the ultimate forward point 4.3% or 4.2%, I think it is quite high and it grows quiet quickly there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Just two things, please. Returning firstly to the Life business operating profit number and you've clearly flagged the reduction in the investment margin is a big driver. We can see that on slide 14. I am just kind of wondering prospectively is there any scope to mitigate that by lowering the amount you're crediting to policyholders, I guess particularly in Germany but also elsewhere?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was I guess you've now obviously resolved this issue with FINMA in terms of the of the calculation of the Swiss Solvency Test and the adjustment to the model that's been required there, but I'm wondering now you have resolved it, could you be a bit able to clearer as to exactly what it related to? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start with the SST question. So the Life adjustments, sorry, the adjustments to the SST model, don't want to go too much into the details, but it was essentially about putting additional buffer at the request of FINMA on the way we look at ALM risk and there was also an adjustment as to how we look at the volatility or the margin on some of our equities. There was also an adjustment moving from post-tax to pre-tax that we incorporated into the model. And then the question on Life that was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was basically asking a question obviously we can see the impact of the investment income decline on the investment margin and I guess I was just asking prospectively is there any potential to mitigate that effect through lower crediting rates to policyholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is something that we always look at carefully. As you know, there's a portion of the book in Germany where we give a crediting rate for the year, so this one is locked in. And then next year we'll have the opportunity to review that rate. And we always review it relative to the market and where the market is and where we are relative to that. What we're clearly seeing in trends is that the portion of that product reduces a lot, so just a reminder, the new business that we've been selling over 80% is on the expense and risk margin only. So we're over time reducing the exposure to the net investment margin and then to the extent we can, then the crediting rate in the investment margin would be our other lever. But as I indicated in some products in Germany for example, this would be something in 2013 rather than 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from the Mr. Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two simple quick questions. I think, one, on the other operating business units that seemed a little higher than I had been anticipating, I just wondered whether you like to just give me quick a better feel for what that run rate should be if possible and just talk through that. The other thing just on the reserve releases, I know they were down a little on the run rate and so there's nothing in this might be normal fluctuations, but adding back the prior premium claims associated with the prior premium adjustment, it looks a little low versus history. I just wanted to check basically there's nothing in addition there that we should be thinking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So I'll answer the first question and then I'll come back to the reserve releases. So OOB indeed it is higher. There has been perhaps some slight negative impact, but essentially the quarter last year benefited from the favorable FX impact, which did not repeat this year. And the other is that we have slightly increased our amount of debt, partly to finance the acquisition of Santander. If you remember, there was a &#x2013; the vast majority which was announced in cash, but there is also a small portion which was financed by debt. So these are the two key impacts that has affected the other operating business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So those should be sustained. In fact, the way we should think about those as being more normal this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Directionally, yes. We are always working on improving it. The other thing, however, is that we also have debt maturing and as the interest rate environment is lower than it was in the past there is some potential to recoup some of that as time goes by.</p>
          <p>Reserve releases, I would not necessarily look at one particular quarter to try to guess what the trend would be with prior releases. You're right, however, that even after adjusting for the prior premium impact on the PYD, the PYD is lower than last year. I think the way they can develop really depends a lot on what claims inflation trends we see. We have certain assumptions about claims inflation. If the trends remain very subdued as they have been and could continue, then you would expect further reserve releases. As you start to have some claims inflation, then of course you will have a reduction in these reserve releases. But that really is speculating about the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no change, nothing to report effectively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea from Bank of American Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'm afraid I have to come back to the investment margin in Life Insurance and maybe I could just try to come at this two ways. First of all, just conceptually, given how long duration your Life balance sheet and particularly the German spread balance sheet, I would have thought that the investment margin would respond only very slowly to interest rates. And so a bit surprising that it's coming down so quickly because of, as you said, at low interest rates. And that's the first way of getting it.</p>
          <p>And the other way of getting at it is if you look at the gross investment income and a gross investment yield that you're booking in the Life segment, that's held up very stably and I would have thought that the margin for shareholders would be connected and have the same trend as that gross investment income. So really two ways of getting at the same question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there's a few things perhaps to mention. One is specifically with regards to Germany, one of the impact has been some upward trend in lapses. The other point to make is that you're looking I believe at the overall Global Life Investment income. That doesn't necessary apply to Germany. I do not have the numbers in front of me, but if you want, you have lower yields right in the basically mature markets particularly actually in Germany because it has been lower where as in emerging markets where we got more of the growth and remember also that their assets under management did also grow, you had higher yields.</p>
          <p>So, while your net investment income in total dollars may be constant, what you would typically expect that actually is the yield in Germany would be lower and the yield overall would be lower since your assets, they grow. So in summary, the yield impact as well as then the lapses which have had an impact on Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To make sure I understand the lapse point, I guess that just means that just your in-force book is just accelerating more quickly than one would normally expect towards low interest rates. Is that the point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions only. So one question on the internal solvency model, my understanding more of that, once the FINRA that famous 1.89 ratio would change because a more of going to make it more conservative. It looks like it hasn't clearly changed so if you just talk a bit about the 103% and in relation to SST. And second question is the underlying in slide nine, the very nice 3.2% we see, you did mention that Santander has 0.5% of that improvement and there's also some good luck factor from low attrition, if you like, in |NAC. So just surprising is that still causing around 2% or what is the sort of underlying combined ratio improvement on slide nine please, the 3.2%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I gathered &#x2013; I'm sorry, the quality of the line was not very good. So repeat the questions and then if I didn't answer your questions, you can go back. On the conversion ratio of 80%, we actually debated internally whether we should adjust it. Look, at the end the day, it should be really seen as a rough estimate. The reason is that the SST ratio has different risk dynamics than those at ECM. This is summarized in the pack on slide 30.</p>
          <p>So on top of the calibration of being the same reduced swap rate versus government rate, the operational risk is included in one, it's not included in the other. The treatment of senior debt is also different, so we've got a lot of factors which actually will have different dynamics on that conversion ratio, so that will really move around the band. We felt that it hasn't changed that much that we should change that conversion ratio which we're always speaking remains reliable. If anything you could say that indeed it should be perhaps a little bit lower than the 180, but not materially different. You also saw anyway that the adjustment that we made to the SST model per FINMA's request was not that significant.</p>
          <p>Now, second question I understood was about the Santander and what was the underlying loss ratio. What you're referring to I believe is the fact that in the 62.3% underlying loss ratio, there is a benefit from the lower loss ratio provided by the Santander business. And that is absolutely true, but this is sustainable because predictability of the Santander book is pretty good and there is low volatility with regards to the loss ratio such that it should be sustainable. Equally, the impact on the commission ratio is also going to be sustainable, i.e. the commission ratio on the Santander businesses is also higher than our average book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I was basically trying to understand on the underlying 3.2%, how much of that is coming from just pricing or other than good luck factors like attritional loss ratios coming low for NAC? Is there anything more there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, further two comments then. On NAC, there has been indeed a favorable impact from low property losses. So if you take on outside of large plains that the property losses in NAC has been low. So they have indeed in the property line from the risk ratio. But really a lot of it is due to the rate increases and the continuation of the re-underwriting of the book. So what Mario explained back in December of last year about the re-underwriting is continuing and we're seeing a lot this improvement in the underlying loss ratio being a result of this more targeted actions and the re-underwriting of the portfolio together with targeted rate increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So summary, the vast majority is through underlying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Klien from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I had two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that in the economic activity, the assets helped drive growth by 1 percentage point in GI. Now my understanding is that there is a time lag between changes in economic activity and when this impact premiums so looking specifically at NAC, should we expect further positive impact in the coming quarters from the positive development in economic activity that we have seen so far?</p>
          <p>And my second question is also on NAC. Now you have been pushing for rate increases for some time and NAC made efforts from pre-profitability. As you've mentioned, you have been re-underwriting selective pooling, then obviously also the focus on efficiency improvements that you have had for the last couple of years. Also if I look at NAC, the last quarters have seen a positive impact on the top line. However, if I look at the expense ratio in NAC, I'm not seeing much of an improvement. It was 30.2% in Q1 of last year. It's 29.9% this quarter. So my question is should we expect this ratio to improve as premiums are increasing because of the mention in efficiency improvements that are biting or are there some other factors that we should consider, for example, change business mix or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I may not be able to answer all of your questions. The change in the economic activity &#x2013; but I hope that I can give you at least some indications and then you can refer to IR for further details. The change in the economic activity, what really happened last year, in particular in the workers comp book is that there was more activity, more people employed. There were some retroactive premiums paid and received this year. So this is a pretty usual, if you want, phenomenon. The fact that the economy picked up in 2011 has benefited and increased the premium and added 3 percentage points to NAC's premium growth.</p>
          <p>To the extent that the economy continues to grow, then it is not unreasonable to expect that we will see this phenomenon continuing as the people renew and they do the audit premiums for that line of business. Also there has been some benefits from the increased property activity and there, I guess, it's a bit less clear as to what happens. It definitely has helped farmers, by the way, who also has reported some increase in their premiums in the home owner's book.</p>
          <p>On the expense ratio, well, as per your own numbers, there is still a slight improvement in the expense ratio. What I do not know is whether there is this mixed change perhaps between the commissions and the other underwriting expenses. What I can tell you, however, is that the drive to continue on the efficiency program continues across all mature markets and that continues to be true with NAC where we've seen a continued reduction in the direct expenses and <mark type="ph" /> FTDs.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, am I right in assumption then if you were to see further economic activity impacting premiums positively that we should expect an improvement in the expenses ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the extent that we strive to continue to be more efficient and this would not necessarily require us to change our operations I guess, yes, marginally speaking, we should. But I think the key item though is that continuation of our efficiency program is really what's going to drive that. I mean, we are half way through. We have targets for 2013 and there is still some benefit that we expect to come through both this year and next year. These are more important drivers than the ratio and the slight increase in premiums and how this could benefit the expense ratio. So it's really the drive to control our expenses. And it relates well to the strategy which is in the reduction over the combined ratio that we expect to gain on the expense ratio by a point and that continues to be our target.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions on General Insurance, please. First of all, regarding the global corporate segment in your prepared remarks on the video, Pierre, you alluded to solid exposure growth in North America, but unfortunately it was offset by the weakness in Europe. As you look out to 2012, how do you see those dynamics playing out? Can you remind us the premium make up first of all? Do you think we're going to see further benefit from the pickup in the U.S. economy? But then what industry is the premium volume in Europe sensitive to? Do you think that again will be offset further in Europe by the weakness that we're seeing here?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is regarding the claims environment. So clearly it seems that the claims environment remains favorable. Now when we look at the situation in Europe with the economy further slowing down, at what stage do you think there is a risk that the slowing economy could result in an uptick in claims?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with regard to global corporate, yes, we're seeing a growth in North America and that is, of course, linked to the economy. With regards to global corporate in Europe, we have a broad portfolio of activity. We saw some decline, but we're essentially flat for global corporate in Europe. These are dependent on the economic activities. I think, Europe, we would expect eventually the growth to be a little more challenged than the U.S., where they seem to have stronger growth prospect, but not a huge upsurge.</p>
          <p>Global corporate tends to be less affected than activity in local counties. So for example, we did see our premiums in Spain drop. That is clearly linked to the economy. Global corporations across Europe are doing fairly well and therefore the dynamics there may be different and not necessarily affecting it the same way as it affects the local economies.</p>
          <p>With regards to the claims environment, we're still seeing some good results across Europe. Yes, we've had a small pickup in the combined ratio, but I think as you saw on slide 11 of our presentation, we're still at 94.9%, which is still a very solid ratio. We are seeing the right &#x2013; the claims environment continues to be relatively subdued.</p>
          <p>You have two impacts when you have counties which are in recession or challenged in the economic environment. One is that, yes, in certain lines of business, you may see enough uptick in claims, but there is also reduced activity which can also have a favorable impact on the frequency. So you really need to go into the dynamics of each country, where you have some trend increases in some, but where they remain subdued in others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions from my side. The first on the Banco Seguros, regarding the agreement with HSBC, what are your expectations from the HSBC agreement in terms of premium volume impact on profits and as of when to kick in? And the second one is on the investment portfolio, because I noticed that the percentage of BBB rated government bonds increased from 1% at the end of 2011 to 12% at the end of the first quarter 2012. Was this caused by negative rating migration or due to modestly re-risking of the investment portfolio? And maybe you would also be able to mention whether there is a noticeable impact here from the required capital on the Zurich ECM ratio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on HSBC Middle East, we do not give prospective indications of what the premium expectations are and frankly it's too early. But there's a sign that this will be starting this year and we'll be starting writing business in these countries this year. With regards to our investment strategy, we haven't fundamentally changed our strategy, therefore, the migration on government bonds is essentially due to migration of the credit ratings themselves. So, there's no proactive part. We're continuing to strive to keep a balanced risk profile across risk types and if anything, then our strategy on the Ireland side has been to actively manage the portfolio in order to maintain a strong credit quality and high quality of the portfolio itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any adverse impact on the required capital due to the lower credit rating of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look simply at the government bond, the impact is minimal because it is overall a very high quality and the migration is marginal. Overall, did the credit risk increase in the portfolio as part of the market ALM, yes, it did slightly, but the biggest driver has really been the interest rate risk.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Please go head sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there and thanks for taking my questions. First question is just to go back on the investment margin in the Life business. Can you give us a sense of how much had Life declined further and the kind of rate of decline that we might see if you can take mitigating action? Second question is I didn't manage to see the whole presentation that you recorded online, but just what action have you taken to mitigate against lower yield year-to-date on your economic solvency and SST in terms of hedging program? So could you price an inflation on that?</p>
          <p>And I guess as last question is just going back to slide 15 on the Santander reconciliation, I realized it's a partial reporting but it seems to me that the uplift that you might have and the full reporting might not be that big given that you already have three months of Brazil and Argentina. Could you give us some sort of guidance on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on the investment margin and the Life business, what actions we're taking, you have to keep in mind that this is on the in-force book, so the in-force book is already written. It's got the guarantees. The way we can manage it is to take potential actions in terms of reducing that risk. The thing perhaps to keep in mind, we indicated earlier that we had taken some interest rate options and swaptions in particular to protect this book against the downside risk. These have essentially remained in place, in order to continue to protect it, but there is still some downward sensitivity as results have fallen even further.</p>
          <p>We're looking overall at what actions we might take with regard to the investment portfolio, really on the dynamic basis. So we constantly look at whether we have the right risk profile and for example within the ALM risk, how that relates to the overall risk and within the ALM risk, what is the split between credit, equity, interest rate and yield curve shape? The general direction is not to increase it. I think this is probably as far as I can go. And looking at given the current environment how we can further improve the rates returned by shifting between asset categories.</p>
          <p>If I move then to your question on Santander on slide 15 where we indicate, I think this is what you're referring to that $24 million BOP over the last three months, there's two things that I think you should keep in mind. One, it's not a full quarter, so you have Brazil, Chile &#x2013; Brazil and Argentina are full month whereas Chile, Mexico and Uruguay are only two months. The other thing is when you look at the amortization of intangibles, this is a fixed number that is actually going down. And in particular the present value of future profits is very front loaded especially in the first couple of years. So as overtime, what you will see is a declining impact of these intangibles and also as the profit grows, you will have, if you want, a double effect that will accelerate the growth in the profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I might come back on the Santander with IR just to understand that. But just going back on the investment margin, I guess asking a different way, in the actual profit by growth, could we expect further declines? Are there significant rates in the next few quarters given where yield curve is going or do you think actually it's kind of more of a one-time effect because of one-off things that happened in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the current profit reflects essentially the current market conditions.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I would say, which is I really like the presentation. I know it's probably not a good time but I do like the level of disclosure. So thank you for that. Couple of questions, one is going back to the Santander, it really feels low to me and I look back very briefly on the slide you showed <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:53) which showed $328 million net profit in 2010. All-time growth since then I know you report not it's not all the quarter itself or not all the last quarter countries. $But 100 million on a statuary basis where a pre-tax where in 2010 the full year pre-tax was for $40 million seems low and I'm just wondering whether you can give some color maybe growth is less strong or claims are higher. I don't know, there's something &#x2013; I don't know I may be wrong.</p>
          <p>And then the second is on the combined ratio in Europe, the two things, one, Germany, it seems odd that the jump in the combined ratio to 99% in Q1. I'm not aware of anything in Germany, but maybe there is something large there which we obviously, I'm an analyst. And then the second is also I would have expected a bigger improvement in Italy. I thought there was a form of something about whiplash claims, which meant that whiplash claims could potentially halt and there is an improvement, very mild to the 98%. They are small things, but I would much appreciate any insight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Santander, look I think there's two things that you need to take into account. One, it's only one quarter and not necessary a full year. And then second, the $100 million is not a full quarter. So you would need to adjust that quarter to a full quarter for all the businesses, and I think if you do that then you would find that the profits annualized would be more or less in line than with the annual profit of last year. I think the indication we also gave is that on the statutory basis, the premiums grew by 10% in the first quarter and the statutory net income by 5%. So there is a growth and that we expect will obviously evolve depending on the quarters and that this one should not necessary be seen as an indication of accelerating or slowing growth in either direction.</p>
          <p>With regards to Germany, you're right, the combined ratio is 99%. It is not entirely where we want it to be. But I'd like to remind you that if you look at the Q3 or Q4 results, the combined ratio here is actually significantly better. So we're actually on track in fixing the issues that we've had. You may recall in the architects and the medical liability line and that 99% reflects both the recognition of the issues that we had as well as the re-underwriting action starting to take to show through in a ratio that is at least below 100%. But we recognize we have no work to do and we're working actively on that.</p>
          <p>With regards to Italy, we're continuing to here re-underwrite and improve the portfolio and actually the combined ratio has improved to 98.6%. Now to what extent do you take whiplash benefits, I don't know specifically with regards to Italy. What I can tell you, however, is that we did recognize whiplash benefit on our Swiss portfolio where we recorded a combined ratio not loss ratio, but combined ratio of 79% and that is indeed due to the fact the whiplash claims have been significantly reduced. And it took us some time before we recognized it because we wanted to make sure that there were no other developments or other trends in the courts emerging before we recognize these reserves releases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have two questions. The first one quite a short one on the non-core unit, I'm not quite sure anymore, on the details of the one-offs you showed in that. I think there was dynamic catch and could you give us a figure on that and other run-off units? And the second one on Swiss positives coming back to that, when I compare sensitivities here you gave us at full year now, it appears that your sensitivities to interest rate are higher. And I mean that wouldn't basically back your &#x2013; you're saying that you added additional buffers on the LMS risk side. Could you just maybe explain a bit more what really happened here in the model refinement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, two things, one is just on the non-core units, just a reminder and give you some color about the result. So the first is center, the results have been relatively stable, can be volatile at times. This is essentially the biggest part is disability book. There, the results have been slightly positive at $12 million. All other things being equal we'd expect it to be slightly positive.</p>
          <p>Banking activities is minus $22 million. This is essentially driven by the loan provisions that we took and recognized as a result of the deteriorating environment in Ireland. Other centrally managed business is around zero, so we'll skip it. And the other line run-off is really the Life part of the run-off and what this recognizes is the reassessment of certain liabilities and also some contracts, which were expiring, which allowed us to release some reserves in that section. And they are related to the ZALICO part of the business, our U.S. life subsidiary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Atanasio Pantarrotas from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have just one question left, and it regards to the solvency capital about the near term, modern Swiss Solvency Test. If I look at the slide number 28, I saw the degree of credit spread which points that the 100 basis point increase in credit spreads has an impact of 17 points on your internal economic solvency ratio. Two questions, first of all, you mentioned that this also increased credit spread of the government bonds and I wonder if you mean all the government bonds, so including for example German, U.S., or only peripheral government bonds.</p>
          <p>And second question more general one, if I look at your internal model, you don't use any liquidity premium. This could penalize your solvency capital and your shareholders at last because I mean, all is equal, if your peers use liquidity premium and in 2011 the usual liquidity premium having a big impact or larger impact on some solvency margin, international solvency margin of your peers which even was around 40%, 50%, if you don't use these, this could penalize your calculation and your shareholders. So I wonder, if this could change in the future not only for you but also for the Swiss Solvency Test, because if the Solvency II model will go in the direction to introduce the counter cyclical premium, this could create a big difference between the European Union solvency model and the Swiss Solvency Test. So I wonder if you can give some more color on this topic. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think it's really important to distinguish between the internal model and the SST model. That's really important. As far as the internal model is concerned, we do as we feel best. We calibrated to a AA level. If our ratio falls below 100%, nothing happens. It's only an indication as to where we are with regards to our target and what actions we would like to take and this is something that we can decide in the context of what the environment will be at the time.</p>
          <p>The only real binding one is the SST ratio. The SST ratio, there is not that much we can do about it. It will be whatever FINMA decides. So from that perspective our ratio is at the 185%. We need to be at 100%. So we've got 85 points to go or we need to worry about anything. And I'm sure indeed that between the SST and the Solvency II, there will be ongoing dialog and that FINMA will have a look at what is happening on Solvency II and may or may not consider what kind of adjustments that we'll make. And this is actually is one of the driving forces as to why we say do we need to look at and manage our capital based on our internal model, because if we try to manage it through the SST, the ratio to the SST taking into account what might or might not happen to Solvency II and how these two models might align or never align further diverge, it really becomes a complex story.</p>
          <p>So look, we try to be market consistent so that we have, I think on our mind, a fair understanding of what's going on and therefore the liquidity comes when a judgment issue is what you think it may or may not be or the matching adjustments, that really gives us a very strong and objective basis to make our decisions. But if we are at 100%, we're outside of our target range, again there's no action needed. But I think it gives us really a sound foundation to look at our capital as opposed to the regulatory capital which are influenced by many elements such as political, the economic environment and the time et cetera, et cetera. Hope I have answered your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just two things, one is relating to solvency ratios. I mean, I may just have missed it in the presentation but would you able to give us some induction of where these are now at the current date, preferably your internal solvency ratio, Solvency I and I am not going to ask about SST because you won't have it?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates I am afraid again to the investment margin, but here just to pick you up on one dynamic which you identified which is the surrender trend in Germany. Would be able to give us a little bit more background on that what surrenders have done over let say the last four quarters or so? And precisely also what you think is driving the surenders in Germany and commensurately where these surrender trends might be going, let say in the near term over the next year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Well, I do not have the detail on the surrender trends in Germany. So on this one I have to refer you to IR to provide you some further details. Still a nice opportunity to just highlight one of the things that we've been doing in Spain, so if you look at our <mark type="ph" /> APT (52:08) and new business value in the Spain you will have not noticed a drop in the APE. However, we maintain our new business value. I just want to highlight it because we had to face very challenging constitutions in Spain. I think this is a great example of how we really adjusted significantly the product mix in order to maintain the new business value and this is generally the way we approach these markets and how we can response to it in creative ways.</p>
          <p>With regard to that ECM ratio now we did indicate that we will provide this ratio every half year, i.e. at Q1 and Q3 and that is as long as it is in the target range, we will not provide some interim ratios. We do not do a full run between quarters. These are only estimates and, as with all estimates, is subject to uncertainty which is why as long as we are in the target range then you can feel comfortable and so are we. And you don't miss we have tremendous further insight if we give you a further estimate.</p>
