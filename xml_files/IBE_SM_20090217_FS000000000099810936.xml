          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. We're going to begin the presentation of results for 2008, and the presentation is quite long, so we're going to begin immediately. Ignacio, you have the floor, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks very much for coming today. Those of you who don't have a seat, those of you who are from Iberdrola please let the others, our guests have a seat, we're a little bit crowded here in the room. No, not everyone needs to get up, please, please, just, we just want our guests to be seated please. I think that everyone is more or less comfortable, so again, thanks very much. Those of you who are listening to us through the web page, also, good morning. With me today we have the Financial Director and the Operational Director, Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro.</p>
          <p>Today, as is normal we are structuring the presentation, first of all I'm going to talk about the main aspects of 2008, then we'll hear from Mr. S&#xE1;inz Armada, the Financial Director, and he will talk about the financial position of the Group and to finish up, I'll give some thoughts about the perspectives of the company in 2009, finishing up with some conclusions and then we'll go into the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>In 2008, thanks to the good performance of our traditional business and especially by the growth of the new business, Iberdrola one more year has increased its bottom line. Net profit has increased by 21.5% to 2.86 billion. Also the profit per share by 21.3% to &#x20AC;0.57. And this is a very complex situation given the deterioration of the global financial system. Now from an operational point of view, production of the Group grew by 14%, and distributed energy grew by 13%.</p>
          <p>Now diversification and the internationalization of the Group in 2008 has received quite an impetus and this, the renewables for example, and international expansion accounted for 57% of our total EBITDA and are only around 40% depends on the Spanish market today. I'd also like to point out that the growth of RENOVABLES, we grew by 2,204 megawatts reaching 9,302 megawatt hours, which is well above the initial estimates and once again reaffirming us as the leader in wind energy.</p>
          <p>Now throughout 2008, the Group also put together quite a bit of investment with improvement of its financial structure and optimization of liquidity which is over &#x20AC;8 billion right now. Now the positive development of the Group during this period has allowed us to propose to the General Assembly of a total remuneration of 20% increase vis-&#xE0;-vis 2007, and we're talking about &#x20AC;0.332 per share.</p>
          <p>Now going into operational data, the installed capacity has grown, and now it's over 43,300 megawatt hours. I would also like to point out the quality of our portfolio, which is characterized by the low emissions and small variable cost. The sum of the emission free is -- accounts for now 52% of the total capacity. This is an increase of wind energy, which is now 20 &#x2013; accounts for 21% and is the second technology after hydropower. Now these generation assets in 2008 have produced more than 141,000 gigawatts hour, and that's an increase of 14% vis-&#xE0;-vis last year.</p>
          <p>Now the distributed energy of the Group has supplied 28 million customers and that's over 182,000 gigawatts, and that's a growth of 13%. This growth of gas in the Group was more than 2 million customers in the U.S., UK and Spain now. Now the increase in the main operational numbers is also showing good numbers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew by 15.8% up to 6.4 billion, reflecting the growth and diversification undertaken by the Group over the last two years. Now in this sense EBITDA in 2008 is 65% higher than just two years ago and the breakdown by business is well balanced right now.</p>
          <p>In -- International RENOVABLES now accounts for 57% of EBITDA, while the traditional Spanish business only accounts for 37% compared to more than 57% two years ago. Now this internationalization and diversification process will be completed in 2009 where Energy East will contribute to the results this year.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight that the Group EBITDA was above &#x20AC;7 billion that we estimated at the beginning of last year. If we hadn't had certain negative factors such as the exchange rate, for example basically the sterling pound, the delays in the acquisition of Energy East and the international financial and commission regulations of the United States. Now as the Financial Director will explain, the negative impact of these impacts is over &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of RENOVABLES the results were just presented on Friday, and 2008 showed once again the power of this company. From an operational point of view, RENOVABLES has passed the objectives, surpassed the objectives, increased the installed capacity by 31% up to 9,302 megawatts, and also from a financial point of view, it increased financial profit by 3.3 times, reaching &#x20AC;390 million, and cash flow increased by 2.5 times up to &#x20AC;873 million.</p>
          <p>Now the development of ScottishPower in 2008, the first full year with us shows that the solidity of its portfolio and also its efficiency measures which were implemented ever since their integration. EBITDA reached &#x20AC;1.5 billion, 23% of the total Group EBITDA, and this is due to the greater production, better prices and also savings, close to 100 million sterling pounds over the last two years. Now these results have been achieved despite the negative foreign exchange of the pound and the accounting effect of the raw materials of the company. If we exclude these two impacts, EBITDA of ScottishPower would increase, would have increased by 18% compared to the previous 12 months.</p>
          <p>Now during 2008 we also had the acquisition of Energy East and its integration in the Group. So now the growth, the non-organic growth has been completed in the company. The operation was closed at the end of the third quarter under very satisfactory conditions and in the fastest way possible despite those three-month delays vis-&#xE0;-vis what we had planned. So the consolidation of the company in the fourth quarter was completed.</p>
          <p>I now wanted to highlight that the financing of the operation of the acquisition of Energy East was done one year prior to the close of the deal, and thus we avoided the problems having to do with the markets in the second half of 2008. Now this operation allowed the Group to increase its position in regulated business increasing also the presence of Iberdrola in countries with a AAA credit rating.</p>
          <p>Now throughout 2008 and especially in the last quarter of 2008 Iberdrola implemented several actions that prepared the Group for sustainable growth over the long-term based on reduced variable cost operations and low emissions. Hydropower, we have been building and operating now 1,135 megawatts. This was in the Rio T&#xE2;mega in Portugal for 60 -- 65 year contract. This project in addition to others in Spain and Brazil, so we have more than 2,000 megawatts and will operational over the next 10 years. In terms of nuclear generation, Iberdrola has recently signed an agreement with Gaz de France-Suez for new nuclear plants. Their first milestone of this will be the joint work in the construction of new plants in the UK and part of the consortium where Iberdrola, Gaz de France-Suez together with Scottish and Southern will make a bid on the next site.</p>
          <p>Now hydro and nuclear is part of our growth in RENOVABLES thus throwing out our strategy and our generation portfolio based on sustained and a sustainable energy. In terms of the finance of the Group, over the last several months as you all know, Iberdrola completed a series of financial operations allowing the Group to deal with 2009 in a very strong position. We have 2.6 billion in stocks, treasury stocks and we reconfigured our credit and in -- of ScottishPower for a total of 5.2 billion. Now both of these operations were in advantageous conditions, gives us a liquidity of &#x20AC;8 billion and would cover all financial needs for a period of close to two years.</p>
          <p>And finally, as I said at the beginning, the profit per share in 2008 increased by 21.3% reaching &#x20AC;0.57 per share and this is going to allow us to propose at the general shareholders' meeting an increase of 20% in the total remuneration of foreign shareholders reaching &#x20AC;0.332 per share.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to give the floor to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada to &#x2013; who will talk a little bit more in detail about the financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mr. Chairman. Good morning. Now we're going to take a look at some of the most important aspects of the P&amp;L of 2008 and then we'll analyze in detail the most important details of our business and I'll finish up with an analysis of the financing of the Group.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by saying that the results we're presenting have already been audited. The auditors have checked the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. They hold that our assets are correctly valued. I mentioned this to stem any rumors that may be out there. This has been duly audited. Here's another thing, the results show growth of 15.8% in our EBITDA and this means that our international and renewable sectors account for 99% of the 874 million of the EBITDA, which means that our recent investments in international investments are what is driving the Group's growth.</p>
          <p>We should add to this the profitable exit from disinvestment in non-strategic sectors in line with the commitments of the strategic plan 2010. If we look at the profit and loss account in a like-for-like basis, the basic margin is growing by 9.5% and EBITDA by almost 7%. And if we exclude the exchange rate in fact you will find that EBITDA would be going up by 11%, which shows that the operational performance of the Group has been very positive in 2008. This would have led us to have more than &#x20AC;7 billion EBITDA if it had not been for a number of factors beyond our control, which add up as the Chairman has said to &#x20AC;609 million, so that the EBITDA is in fact 6.412 billion.</p>
          <p>There are two effects here totaling 267 million. Firstly, the adaptation from U.S. GAAP and then the change in the dating of FX due and FX payable, just an accountancy correction. There's been another adjustment of &#x20AC;180 million and the market there is another correction and currency effects particularly sterling, 319 million, MTM impact was in fact minus 23 million. Now most of this rose in the third quarter. As you can see in the slide, our reported EBITDA went down by 13.7% in the third quarter. If it hadn't been for the factors I'd referred to, it would impact upon up or rather down by 2.4% Energy East, 47 million, mark-to-market exchange rate have accounted for this downturn in EBITDA in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Group sales are up by 44%, this right across the board. The energy market in Spain has gone up, demand up by 0.9%. ScottishPower provides for almost &#x20AC;8 billion of the total. The RENOVABLES business continues to develop and its income has doubled. Latin American business has been significantly affected by the Tamazunchale power plant, which came online in June 2007, growth of 8%. Non-Energy up 7.8% due to energy corrections. Energy East 952 million in a single quarter was its contribution.</p>
          <p>You have to have regard for the cost of fuel, the change in the thermal mix contribution to ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>Tamazunchale plant and Energy East were particularly significant in the fourth quarter. Energy East and RENOVABLES account for 52% of the margin. ScottishPower, you can see the figures on the slide and RENOVABLES 16%, 1.6 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;1.6 billion, sorry. Traditional liberalized business in Spain 25% and regulated 16%. So that the energy market in Spain only accounts for 41% of our gross margin. The basic margin is up by 24%, which is almost four percentage points more than the Group gross margin because the only negative impact here is emission rights consumed, 600 million for Spain, 356 million for ScottishPower. There is the positive impact of 430 million as a result of the CO2 allowances allocated, broken down between Spain and ScottishPower. Those are included under other income. So the net operating &#x2013; or rather these emission rights have accounted for 170 million in savings.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses without having regard for the emissions are up by 34%. There are number of atypical impacts here. Now what we call Iberdrola Spain and Latin America is up by 15% to &#x20AC;1.87 billion. You have to bear in mind that in 2007, there was a one-off effect of 45 million due to the restructuring plan.</p>
          <p>So if you exclude non-recurrent effects, the growth here would be around 8%. ScottishPower accounts for 31% of the net operating expenses, &#x20AC;747 million, that's grown by 31% because it's been consolidated throughout the year 2007. But if we compare recurrent year-on-year periods, its expenses will be down by 31%, which shows great increases in efficiency.</p>
          <p>RENOVABLES 414 million, up by 67%, that shows how its activities have expanded and also how it's been consolidated with PPM and the United Kingdom. Energy East &#x20AC;236 million in one quarter, that includes &#x20AC;47 million, which was expenditure recognized by the regulators for storms and other extreme weather effects.</p>
          <p>Levies, taxations gone up because we have made provisions for emissions rights from 115 million to &#x20AC;368 million 2007, 2008 respectively. The difference is &#x20AC;243 million. This is provision not just for trading rights that have been assigned, but that have not been assigned and this is pursuant to Royal Decree 11 of 2007.</p>
          <p>For Iberdrola, most of this CO2 allowances clawback was for non-assigned plant. Now the order that develops the Royal Decree 11 of 2007 has been appealed against in the court in Spain and has been appealed against by Unesa. We believe that the CO2 allowances clawback is a further levy. ScottishPower provides another 19 million in 2007 under the heading of levies. There are other effects &#x20AC;26 million arising from increased levies associated with increased IBI.</p>
          <p>Energy East one quarter &#x20AC;49 million. So the Group EBITDA is up 15%. And this should be pointed out, the 61% comes from regulated or quasi-regulated sectors of business, which means that our profit and loss account is less vulnerable. This means that there's predictable, reliable cash flow. This percentage will go up in 2009, but this will have another six months with Energy East. 43% of EBITDA comes from regulated businesses and 18% from renewables. If you break down EBITDA, you'll find that ScottishPower and renewables are accounting for most of the growth.</p>
          <p>The increased internationalization of the company is strengthened with Energy East and its contribution in the last quarter. Traditional activities in Spain up by 15%, renewables EBITDA more than doubled, ScottishPower over &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the first year of 12 months, positive operational impact, Latin America slightly up 0.3% at a time when there have been tariff corrections in distributors in Brazil, and given the weakness of the dollar and the real and the effect of that we saw on our business. Non-energy down by 25%. I will stress that this 15.8% increase in our EBITDA achieved as I said before, despite the negative effects of over 600 million when it comes to mark-to-market, Energy East, etcetera.</p>
          <p>The figure of 6.4 billion in EBITDA is an increase of 15.8%. The Group continues to have very conservative provisions on D&amp;A, amortizations, total figures you can see on the slide. Amortizations from ScottishPower, D&amp;A and provisions are up 16.9%, I would point you to the figure of 225 million purchase price allocation. The net finance costs are up 125 million to 1.026 billion. This is a result very largely of the fact that the overall debt has tended to go up. The debts associated with the purchase of Energy East, which is more than 6 billion, and this increased financial expenditure has partially been compensated for by the income from currency coverage despite the downturn in dividends from Galp and Red El&#xE9;ctrica. Spreads have gone up, interest rates down, profit before tax is up 24.7% to &#x20AC;3.8 billion. That's not just EBITDA and the financial result that I've referred to already, but you have to also bear in mind the non-recurrent assets up to &#x20AC;555 million. This is largely a result of disinvestment I would refer to 380 something million euros achieved from selling 4% of our holding in Galp, and also the equity method is up by 33 million.</p>
          <p>Sale of Gamesa Solar Division. Net Group profit up 21% to &#x20AC;2.86 billion and you have to bear in mind the 23% effective tax rate in comparison with the figure for the previous year, slightly higher effective tax rates in 2008 in comparison with 2007. The corporate tax rate is around 28%, but that has decreased through certain effects.</p>
          <p>I would point to the increased profit per action, per share, sorry, results by business starting with the liberalized business in Spain. The average pool price in the Spanish System is up 265.4.</p>
          <p>The Ordinary Regime Output is down by 1.5%. There's an increase of 30% in the special regime. The mix is very different in 2008 vis-&#xE0;-vis 2007. As you can see in the slide, the changes in, for example, thermal and combined cycle, the average conventional thermal fuel cost was &#x20AC;55.2 per megawatt hour. This is 16% higher than in 2007. CO2 costs are up as well, up by 15.8. So we have suffered from increased fuel cost and CO2 costs.</p>
          <p>Net operational cost is up by 21.5%. Now given the efficiency of the Group, we have growth below the gross margin. The net operational cost is the &#x2013; not only due to the greater commercial retail activity, but also due to regulation, the layoffs and the Endesa payout. The liberalized grew by &#x2013; EBITDA grew by 21.5% to reach &#x20AC;2.5 billion and affected by the impact of those &#x20AC;368 million due to the CO2 clawbacks, which were accounted for into the levies section.</p>
          <p>EBITDA of the distribution business in Spain saw an increase of 1.3% and this was an improvement over the gross margin due to the improvement in the development of the net value, which grew by &#x2013; which fell by 5.9%. So the margin grew by 1.4% to &#x20AC;1.66 billion, because there was a positive liquidation of &#x20AC;119 billion that were in 2007 and reduced growth. The growth in the regulated business according to the Royal Decree 2008 would have been above &#x20AC;60 million. So thanks to the improvements in efficiency, the development of EBITDA in the Group has been above the gross margin.</p>
          <p>In RENOVABLES, the growth of 97% of gross margin is due to an increase of 31% of installed capacity to 9,302 megawatts with a &#x2013; that's a large growth. The increase in production is 71% to 17,000 gigawatts per hour. We have an increase in average power of 6.7%. An increase in the load factor goes from 23 to 26.4%. In terms of the variation of the consolidation perimeter we need to consider that in October 2007, we included in this perimeter the assets from the reorganization of ScottishPower, so that in 2008 these assets contributed throughout the entire year. The net operational cost increased by 66%, 30 points less than the gross margin due to the international expansion cost of the company. And this change of perimeter due to consolidation, EBITDA grew by 109% to 1.185 billion due to international business and this was 41% of the total EBITDA, and the U.S. business had the greatest growth. If we analyze the results by ScottishPower in local currency, excluding the mark-to-market, we find a positive development in operations with a growth of 10% in terms of basic margin. In terms of EBITDA, there's a growth by 18% to &#xA3;2.2 billion due to the result of greater efficiency and the &#x2013; and we've grown by four points the operational expense ratio over the period.</p>
          <p>If we look at the results in euros, recurring EBITDA is the figure that you see there, and that would be &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Now the impact of the exchange rate took away &#x20AC;2.03 billion and the mark-to-market also took away &#x20AC;23 million until reaching that &#x20AC;1.5 billion figure. Now look at the results of ScottishPower. Due to the two main units of business, the wholesale and retail contributed &#x20AC;73 million, where there was a growth in the production of 7%, and network growth had 748 million in EBITDA and distributed energy fell by 2%.</p>
          <p>Energy East contributed for the first time too in the fourth quarter with a contribution of &#x20AC;92.5 million to the Group's EBITDA. In the quarter this was satisfactory even just above what we had estimated. But as I said we should point out that accounting adjustments were done due to the GAAP and this accounted for the figure that you see there $112 million. This was a result of the extraordinary cost in the quarter due to the consideration of regulated assets that are recognized in the fee and the U.S. GAAPs allow these to be accounted for and do not allow these until they are actually paid. So we would have reached 117 billion in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Latin America had a growth of 0.3% to &#x20AC;892 million. Now in local currency this growth would have been 3.6%. Now, the good performance of the business in Mexico in local currency in Tamazunchale had a negative effect of the exchange rate coming from the fall of the dollar, while the business in Brazil which had been performing well at operational level has also been negatively affected by the tariff regulation in Cholua and Cosan and also the interannual Brazilian real which fell.</p>
          <p>Now going into detail by regions, EBITDA in South America reached &#x20AC;507 million, registering a fall of 4.1% giving the less contribution from the distributors in 2008 and also considering the favorable performance of demand in the region, which grew by 5.2%. Now, the effect of the exchange rate is also negative by 1.2%. In terms of Mexico, EBITDA reached &#x20AC;384 million growing by 6.9%. The positive effect of the greater production and the Tamazunchale also compensated for the negative impact by the exchange rate at 7.3% and also the negative effect from the fewer recuperation of the tariff.</p>
          <p>Now the non-energy fell by 25.2%, the lower activity of the real estate business where EBITDA fell by 59.8% to reach &#x20AC;76 million is the first main reason why the EBITDA in the area has fallen. In engineering, with the lower international business and other business partially compensated for this fall reducing it to 25%, which means a contribution of &#x20AC;364 million as I mentioned. Now in terms of the financing of the company, looking at the analysis with the situation of the tariff deficit, this reaches at the end of the year &#x20AC;2.3 billion. In December of 2007, the tariff insufficiency was around 1 billion. Now this insufficiency had accounted for 118 million. In 2008, we had the funds from the deficit, which were 455 million, and we had a tariff insufficiency which was &#x2013; now the tariff insufficiency now reaches &#x20AC;2.3 billion. We expect that this will be solvent bonds, and this will be as confirmed by the Supreme Court in its decision of January 2009. Now the balance of the company is still very strong. The equity funds in 2008 are &#x20AC;25 billion. This figure is in line with a net debt without considering the tariff deficit. The leverage is around 50.3%, therefore if we include the tariff deficit that is &#x20AC;28.3 million and the leverage would be up to 52.5%. Now despite the negative development of the exchange rate, the policy of coverage carried out by the company has neutralized the effect of the exchange rate on leverage and has maintained this as stable in terms of equity and the adjusted net debt.</p>
          <p>This brings us to a situation where the rest of the solvency ratios are above the criteria required for the credit agencies if we &#x2013; this is in consideration of the tariff insufficiency or not if we included the ratio of funds over net debt, reached 18.5%. Now the coverage ratio of interest is 4.7 times and the cash flow ratio is around 13.9%. Excluding these, the tariff insufficiency, these figures would be above 20% coverage of interest almost five times and cash flow retained over net debt would be over 5%.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the breakdown of financing, we have diversification in different markets and this also allows us to balance risk. And we're finishing up the documentation for the American market. In terms of the debt per currency, Energy East shows that the policy of coverage of the interest rates will allow us to cover the percentage of the debt due to this interest rate, while at the same time it reduces the risk of exchange rate in the P&amp;L through the financing of business with using local funds. Now in terms of the structure of the debt by interest rates throughout 2008 we increased by 34 to 41% the percentage of variable debt to take advantage of the fall in the interest rates and compensate for the growth of spreads.</p>
          <p>Now Iberdrola has &#x2013; is one of the few companies that has access to markets throughout this crisis. Over the last three months we obtained more than &#x20AC;3.2 billion in the capital markets in euros and pounds. Now we've closed an agreement for to finance and to increase the &#x2013; with the debt that we had for to the purchase of ScottishPower and this loan was constituted for &#x20AC;11 billion. At the end of 2008, we had 5.2 billion left and on that amount we will extend 3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>So the Group has absorbed over these last two or three years all of the financing, short-term financing for the ScottishPower alone. Now in these operations, the Group now is in a very good position of liquidity and will maintain this over the year refinancing at least 12 months ahead of time the accrual of these &#x2013; of the loans to increase liquidity. This allows us now to have more than &#x20AC;8 billion of liquidity available at the end of 2009 according to our estimates and these will be 6 billion at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at the financial analysis of the company, looking at the due dates first of all, we should point out that the due date is around six years. Also we should point out that we have a high concentration of due dates over the next several years. We have a balanced structure and with low-risk for re-financing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Pep&#xE9;. As always things I think are very clear, and I think it's very easy to understand and follow, so we -- results for 2008, just wanted to analyze the main perspectives of the Group for this year. In 2009, we're seeing in a macroeconomic level, we have a complex economic and financial situation in Iberdrola. Within this environment we will continue to apply its model of growth based on solidity and minimizing risk. And this will allow us to maintain our strengths throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We've been very careful as always. We're going to be more careful this year. So this model is a comprehensive one that includes all of the different lines of the P&amp;L sheet. Now part of that P&amp;L in the Group we have now a pipeline which is very diversified with our presence in countries Spain, the United States, the UK and the main Latin American countries as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of operational costs, we're going to continue as we have been improving efficiency in our different businesses. Now the trajectory that we have will allow us to deal with the situation not as an exceptional measure as some other companies are doing, but rather just as a continuation and then delving deeper into what we have been doing over the last eight years.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial costs, the positive that we've had of staying ahead of the game and going long-term will allow us to deal with this year with a great deal of liquidity. In terms of regulatory issues, we expect improvements in our regulatory business in the UK and the United States where right now we're reviewing the different regulatory issues. And in Spain this will end the uncertainties very shortly as some members of the government have pointed out. Iberdrola has a growth model based on diversification of business in geographical areas. Approximately 65% of the result come from assets characterized by stability and cash flow. Specifically 45% of the operational results have to do with regulated business and another 20% from renewables, which we could call almost regulated due to the institutional support that these technologies receive. The other 35% come from surely liberalized business contracts by the competitiveness of the pipeline and the relationship between market and production.</p>
          <p>Now this model is a unique one in the electricity sector. We have a much less wait on regulated business compared to the liberalized ones and almost &#x2013; and other companies almost have nothing in renewables. Now the concentration of the Group over the past, next several years will come, the growth will come from the United Sates and Europe because governments that are giving incentives to renewable energy resources. The economic situation like now is, it means greater emphasis &#x2013; now where we see the importance of the contribution of companies like ours in creating employment and providing tax income. Therefore the different regulatory regimes in different countries are promoting activities of renewable energy companies to increase investment in this area. So along these lines, there are two recent regulations in the United States by the Obama Administration, the Energy Bill and the Stimulus Bill. Now these two bills introduced incentives to network investment and renewable energy with a view to doubling the installed capacity of renewables over the next three years and in 2012 to reach 10% and 12% and 25% renewables for the year 2025.</p>
          <p>In terms of the EU, we've also reaffirmed the objective of the directives to reach 20% of energy consumption by 2020. In the case of Spain, this objective will mean going from 9% to 20% and in the UK 1.5% to 15%. And finally, the different countries of the EU are establishing ambitious objectives in terms of investment and infrastructure in energy. In this connection it's important to look at the case in the UK that will have investments of almost &#x20AC;100 billion up until 2020.</p>
          <p>In terms of the perspectives of the different businesses and Iberdrola RENOVABLES will once again be the main growth area of the company. RENOVABLES will earmark investment on the Europe and the United States, markets which provide more than 30% of the total capacity and where we have the greatest amount of the pipeline of projects, of new projects. The company also foresees an investment of at least &#x20AC;2 billion, a figure which could grow up to 20% as we see the development of the different regulatory measures in these different geographies. Also Iberdrola RENOVABLES has guaranteed production because in systems like in Spain or thanks to contracts of long-term sales contracts like the United States, we have guaranteed growth.</p>
          <p>Now, the Network business has also contributed greater to the results, just the consolidation throughout the year of Energy East and the perspectives of improvement in the markets where Iberdrola is operating. In Spain the access tariffs have increased by 23%. In the UK, the United States and Brazil the remuneration for distribution is being reviewed with positive expectations.</p>
          <p>In terms of liberalized business, the production in Spain in the first weeks of the year, just to give a vision of how the year is going, have grown by 14% due to greater production of hydro that grew by more than 80% and wind energy by 43% in the first weeks of the year. Also the hydroelectric reserves in Spain have increased by 40% vis-&#xE0;-vis last year we have more than 600 megawatts saved.</p>
          <p>In terms of the acquisition of gas for 2009, we have a destination and we have the generation plants or through the sell to our customers both within and outside of Spain. We also have sold in this year about 50% of our production basically to small industries and high consumption residential areas. In the UK, the Longannet coal plant is available over the next few weeks once we finish the installation of the diesel frame plants and we hope with that to increase production vis-&#xE0;-vis 2008. Now, you know Longannet is the biggest plant, the carbon plant or coal plant in the UK. And this will have a large effect on the final result, so we're hoping that this goes forward well. And we've also increased the number of customers by 200,000 in the UK, 5.2 million now. And right now we're analyzing the situation of the market to also advance our price policy to changes that are taking place. In 2009, we're going to continue concentrating on improving efficiency, continuing the path of the last eight years. As I already mentioned in the traditional activities and extending this to all of our new businesses both within and outside of our borders. Iberdrola RENOVABLES and the growth will be accompanied by a better use of resources and with that an improvement of efficiency as is already happening. In ScottishPower, we're going to continue making an effort in terms of efficiency, which has already allowed us to make savings of almost &#xA3;100 million which is over and above the best expectations that we had.</p>
          <p>In terms of finance, the different operations closed over the last several months as the Financial Director spoke of have increased liquidity to &#x20AC;8 billion. In 2009, we're envisaging an investment of 4.2 billion, just below the investment made in 2008. And finally as I said at the beginning, we'll continue to maintain our dividend policy over the last few years which will be about in lines with past years.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, 2008 and the perspectives for 2009 show once again the strength of the Iberdrola business model. In 2008, EBITDA grew by 15.8%, thanks to the positive performance of all the businesses and despite the impact of non-recurring element that took away almost &#x20AC;600 million from that area. The profit per share was by &#x20AC;0.27 with a growth of 21.3%. Now based on that, in 2009, Iberdrola will continue to manage all of the different P&amp;L lines.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, we have a diversified pipeline with two-thirds of the results coming from regulated or nearly regulated businesses. In terms of operational costs, we will delve deeper into efficiency measures applying those to all of the company's new investments and the structure of the date and the great liquidity will allow us to deal with this year with all of our financing covered in very attractive terms.</p>
          <p>So with this we hope that the results for 2009 will show growth in terms of EBITDA and also in this scenario the net profit will be around or just above that of 2008 with a growth also similar to the dividend. This is again in the scenario that we expect. Iberdrola then is a very sustainable business in its bottom line, thanks to its diversification in businesses and geographies and growth in comparison to our competitors.</p>
          <p>And at a time of financial crisis and uncertainty from many economic sectors, Iberdrola is reaffirming its commitment as a business that creates hundreds and thousands of jobs and being the driving force behind the economy. All of this is the result of a strategic vision that we've had since 2001. And between 2001 and 2006, Iberdrola focused on growth, basically organic growth multiplying by two its installed capacity through growth in combined cycles and wind energy, which doubled its results vis-&#xE0;-vis 2001. In 2007, we started, we had international expansion and the main highlights was the integration of ScottishPower and Energy East and international growth of RENOVABLES.</p>
          <p>And we expect in this sense to finish up in 2010 with more than 47,000 megawatts and 27 million customers, and double our results from 2006. But in Iberdrola we're already working on the next stage, which will be characterized by the construction of new hydroelectric plants, growth of wind energy, the development of new nuclear plants and taking advantage of networks and infrastructures in different countries.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much and now we will be very happy to field your questions.</p>

          <p>Sorry, that comes later. From Credit Suisse, two questions one for the Chairman and one for the CFO. The first one is on the perspectives for the year 2010. I think a little has been said on this already. Now although the last year and half or so the panorama has been a bit more complicated, do you really think it's feasible to reach the 3.5 &#x2013; the 3,500 or will that be more complicated? Now the CFO, you said that the figures have been audited. We haven't seen any adjustments to the accountancy cost of certain acquisitions, but that must have been done over recent weeks, so maybe you could tell us about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you recall, Amit presented the strategic plan to you. We spoke of the situation on the energy markets and energy production. And given the increasing costs of CO2 and oil and so on, we made some highly conservative premises. I think some of you said that you're going to have to mediate between Pep&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, and it was hard to tell who was being more conservative.</p>
          <p>Our premise was that the oil price would be $60. Back then it was around 90 something if I recall, coal $70, was our baseline. It was over 100 at that time. Right now oil is at around 45, so it's not that far off the 60 we took, and coal is at similar levels. It is true that CO2 costs have changed somewhat vis-&#xE0;-vis our forecast, and we expected to have a debt level of around 32 billion in 2010. We're now looking at figures quite a lot lower around 25 billion, and that's a figure we expect to achieve in 2010.</p>
          <p>The interest rates we took at that stage were 200 basis points higher than current interest rates. Just giving you an overview really, so you can understand the conclusions. Now you know us. As I've said before, the environment has changed. Environment continues to change. Our forecasts were conservative, and in some instances they were excessively conservative, whereas in others we weren't that far off, but it's hard for us to forecast future changes in commodity prices, in exchange rates and so on.</p>
          <p>But I can tell you that the scenario we forecast isn't that different from what the current situation is. If you look at current data, we're not that far off track, and if you know us at all you will know that we're going to go on fighting hard to achieve the goal. I repeat, the scenario has changed, but not that much vis-&#xE0;-vis our forecasts, but we can't extrapolate from now to two years hence. What I can assure you is that it's our intention to go on struggling towards the goal you referred to, and we have reason to believe that we won't be that far off.</p>
          <p>As I expect you know, with regards to all of our acquisitions, we have to have a impairment test every year with certain criteria and hypotheses and that are consistent with previous years. Now this specific year, the figures have to be tallied with expected growth for forthcoming years. Despite that, practically no asset generating facility has required any correction. There was the odd correction, not even &#x20AC;100 million. Practically all of our generating assets have a major margin between fair value and the current accountancy value.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name Fernando Garc&#xED;a from Espirito Santo. My question is, if EBITDA, the distribution comes down by 1% and then demand comes down, what would you think would happened then? And on the subject of gas, what do you think about your competitors? Do you think that there may be a plethora, an over-supply of gas in Spain? In 2009, do you think there may be negative surprises in your real estate business? And lastly, you said that your marketing contracts with your customers are fairly secure. Have you found any increase in bad debt levels and non-payment levels in recent months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the distribution retribution model were to be continued, then a downturn in demand and a downturn especially in inflation would have a slight impact on the profitability of distribution. It depends upon a 30% increase in demand, and it depends upon inflation minus 1%. If the demand were to dip by 2%, then there would be a downturn in retribution of distribution of 0.6%. However, when you look at the tariffs for 2009, you can see that the distribution, remuneration levels have been put in such a way that we're thinking of a different model so that regulatory assets in operation will be affected by inflation, and elsewhere it will be more a question of increased investment in such a way that the total remuneration will obviously depend upon the investment we can carry out.</p>
          <p>Would you like to ask &#x2013; answer the questions about an oversupply of gas and commercial contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the commercial question. You said, has there been an increase in bad debt in non-payment levels, the answer is no. We're selling around or billing around &#x20AC;2 billion per annum. The bad debt level is stable under 1.5% and over 120 days less than 0.7%. So on the contrary actually we've found that the figures, we have succeeded improving them somewhat. The other question was, yes, over-supply, a possible over-supply of gas and our competitors in Spain. Well anything one ever knows about one's competitors is in the domain of speculation. It's true that our competitors have less flexibility in their contracts, but it's also true that some of them have gas right next door to their production plants, and some of them are able to buy their gas very easily. So it is possible that if there is a decrease in demand and an increase in the ordinary regime, that will mean that there will be an upstream effect. I don't think that there is going to be an over-supply. This gas is not going to be here until the end of this year or the beginning of next year, and probably the people who would otherwise have sold that gas to our electricity generating competitors will sell it to other people. Pep&#xE9; on real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I said in my presentation, you will recall that last year we had quite an amount of provisions which we held to be non-recurrent and we've done practically the same this year, around &#x20AC;250 million in provisions, part of which corresponds to real estate. So we are provisioning that in advance. We are ahead of the game. We're fairly conservative about that business in the future. And as to non-payment by customers, I believe what the Commercial Director said, in Spain this is quite well under control, in the UK non-payments still going up a bit, accounts still going up a bit. But we are ready for this. We've got provisions of 250% for possible non-payment. So you needn't worry, we have made all preparation for that.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Pablo Pena-Rich from BPI. I have three questions. Firstly, what's your investment plan for 2009/2010, and will 2009 be down vis-&#xE0;-vis &#x2013; well 2009 is down vis-&#xE0;-vis 2008, will that downturn continue for 2010? Secondly what about pool prices for the current year. What are your expectations because there's been quite a downturn in recent weeks and months? Do you think that that decrease will continue, do you think that the prices will continue around 35 to 45 or will go up? And thirdly on mark-to-market, particularly regarding ScottishPower and the downturn in coal prices, this has changed vis-&#xE0;-vis 3T '08. Do you anticipate any change in your hedging policy to prevent &#x2013; there's volatility because you've gone from about plus 180 million to around minus 25 million? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investment plan, the CFO has said, and I'll say our plan for this year is around &#x20AC;4.2 billion. RENOVABLES can be tailored, and depending upon the regulatory trends in the U.S. it could be up to 20% more. So it's going to be somewhere between 4.2 and 4.6 billion for the year. And for 2010, unless environmental conditions change substantially, our policy is to invest our cash flow to keep our debt levels and retain a similar sort of investment level. So there again it would be around somewhere between four and 5 billion. So for 2009/2010 in total we're talking about a total of between 8.5 and 10 billion. Whereas on pool prices, perhaps Jos&#xE9; Luis will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pool prices, futures on the market, in Europe, the prices are all now somewhere between 50 and 65 except in Spain where they're 44, and the future prices for the second quarter of 2009 in Europe are around 40, and in Spain they are not very deep, but they're around 37. And for 2010, all the signs are that they will be around 48 or 50. So in Spain, we spend a great deal really on our wind and hydro production. It depends a lot on that. Any major change will bring the prices down, but I think that the price is coming &#x2013; signals coming from Europe are far more significant, as I say around 40 for the second half of this year and 50 for next year. Pablo?</p>
          <p>Well yes, I'd like to give you a straight answer to the question. Our expectations for complete pool price for the year is around 45 or 50, but you do have to bear in mind that right now, and the same goes for many other products, market prices are what they are. Their importance is what it is because we have so many different markets -- bilateral, forward, spot, European, many different kinds of markets. And at the end of the day each agent has their own strategy, which you want to keep under your hat so as not to give an advantage to the competition, but that can have a major impact of 10 to 20%. I'm not talking about increased income vis-&#xE0;-vis the competition. Pool, as I said, 45 to 50. Now Iberdrola is consistently getting 60 from the pool because we provide our energy to the pool at the best times of day due to our generation mix. And we provide to other customers, other clients, and we get better than average pool prices. So it's a bit like airlines, no two passengers are paying the same fare. Similarly there are, every different kilowatt-hour has a different price depending on its quality.</p>
          <p>On MTMs &#x2013; well on to MTMs, our policy has been that all purchase operations, be they for fuel or for energy so as to meet our expected demand from customers, shall not be subject to IAS rule 39. Those operations that are aimed at bringing in the final production in line with final demand, we think that those are similar operations -- on just &#x2013; the only one, operations that we feel are excluded have to do with coal price coverage, particularly in ScottishPower because the coal prices are two years ahead, and coverage is only for one year, so those coverages are subject to market valuation in line with IAS 39. And the decreased coal prices in recent months have led to this decrease in MTMs in September of 100 million and now around naught or negative, but this really only has to do with hedging for medium term coal purchases.</p>
          <p>Next question, please. Virginia?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Virginia Sanz from Deusche Bank. I have a number of questions. Firstly, estimated debt service cost for 2009, do you think you'll be going out onto the market again to generate more debt or have you met all of your needs? You also said you expected that the deficits will be securitized in the medium term. When do you think that will be, and do you think that all of the deficit will be securitized? Also, could you tell us about the state of play of discussions with the Ministry on the tariff deficit because there's not been lot about it in the press in recent months? Also on Gas Natural and Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa assets that are going to be up for sale, will you be interested in any of those? And finally, once ACS sells Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa and is not held to be a dominant operator, do you think there'll be any reason why ACS should not have a Board member within Iberdrola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Debt service costs, well right now we're pending. We're trying to bring down the overall debt service cost. We've become quite aggressive when it comes to variable costs. We're getting good results. And right now, we hope to bring down the overall cost vis-&#xE0;-vis what we published as forecasts, and this goes for increased spreads as well. Will we be going to the market again? The answer is yes. As I've said for some time now, we've always arranged our finance and covered it at least 12 months in advance, and our current policy perhaps will be less towards optimization and more to securitization. And times are very uncertain, the financial markets are very turbulent, and we will tap available opportunities to issue debt on the market, particularly long-term debt. Utilities and companies such as ours have to change their finance source mix. It used to be predominantly from the banks, and now it's tending to be more from the capital markets.</p>
          <p>On securitization of the tariff deficit, of course we're working on the basis of the scenario that the entire total of the existing tariff deficits including those that may be arising in the current year will be securitized, and we are looking at this happening before the summer holidays this year. If you look at the figures that have been published by the Ministry, it's clear that the government wants the deficit to be mopped up as soon as possible and to be mopped up before the end of the current term of government. We think that around March, maybe when the relevant decrees are published so as to tidy up all of the ongoing operations on this front.</p>
          <p>You spoke of finance, Gas Natural and Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa's assets, have to wait and see, wait and see what they sell, what they want to sell. When on the face of it, I would say the combined cycle, well obviously we have no interest. Not least because well, I'm afraid the regulator wouldn't &#x2013; let us buy them, you never know, anything is possible on that front. But on the face of it we would not have an interest in that kind of asset. Your other question, please allow me not to give you a specific answer until such time as there is a specific situation. When there is a specific situation, I may have an answer.</p>
          <p>Any more questions from the room?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have four questions quickly. The first one is a detailed one. On page 43 of the brochure, I see almost 45 billion for derivative products, could you explain that? Secondly, strategy, do you think your leverage level is appropriate, if not which of your assets do you think are non-core or peripheral? Third question, I've heard a lot about electricity generation costs in Spain, I think this depends a lot on commodities. Could you give us your view of spreads, spreads in Spain because I think that with this major downturn in demand, it's quite likely that spreads will remain very tight? And my last question, could you give us your understanding of the IPC, that is to say the official inflation rate impact on renewables in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the derivative, that's just what it is. In part, we have many of the derivative covered different interest rate. But basically the sterling pound we hedged during the year with derivative not necessarily taking the risk but through derivatives. So this has to do with the hedge positions. And now we'll go back and take the pound, because it's cheaper than the euro. So we've been working on that. Now in terms of leverage, we maintain what we always have that a year or two ago, we said that we weren't very much leveraged and now we're going as therefore too leveraged. We're managing the company based on a series of criteria that we believe are reasonable and sustainable over time. We've defined the rating 'A' three where we think that we should be. So we believe in accordance with the rating agencies that we're constantly in contact with that we have ratios that we saw on the slide, which are reasonable and compliant with the objectives, with the levels that we're talking about, with the rating agencies. Therefore I think that we're comfortable where we're now and as the Chairman said in a high risk environment, where we should be more conservative, the logical thing is to keep our leverage open in the next months or years to stable or lower. And that's been our policy, a policy which I think is consistent, has been consistent in terms of the financial management of the company and which we've been defending for some time now to maintain our financial solidity and not &#x2013; and to be working with very casual fluctuations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also Pep&#xE9;, I would like to add. I remember when I came to this sector it was in vogue to be very leveraged, and we were criticized because we weren't as leveraged as others. And we held &#x2013; when we held this criteria of 50% leverage from the base where we began because we thought that was reasonable. Now we've done many things over the years. We doubled our installed capacity through organic growth with big investments. And a second stage of international growth were to continue maintaining those ratios, we have had capital increases by always maintaining our financial solid. And so we're still in the same figures. As our Financial Director has said, this is a consistency that over the last eight years and different environments of organic growth and corporative growth. Right now we said we stopped expansion, non-organic expansion and only organic expansion. I said different environments and that's why we're adjusting our levels of leverage, and we're moderating our levels of investment. We could do many more things, but we think that we need to be careful right now in this situation. That's in terms of investment. Now the divestment of our assets, we are envisaging divestment of some assets. We have done some, and we're going to be doing others over the next couple of years, which what we will see, what will be the most attractive at the time, and will depend that &#x2013; at the time of last year we did a few, and this year maybe we will do some others and maybe next some others of those things that we believe are not part of our core business. Now, in terms of generation cost in Spain?</p>
          <p>I suppose that your opinion about the, your prices that you're comparing, the average spot market with the fuel cost, but the reality as the &#x2013; as the liberalized Business Director said, is that we're comparing &#x2013; we need to look at the areas where we have the highest prices. The average reality is that that the spreads that we're achieving in cycles &#x2013; combined cycles with the guarantee of the potential is around about 10 years per megawatt-hour and the spread is in coal, they don't have this fixed price, but also are adapting to a lesser degree. But they are adapting to times when the prices are higher. The spreads for coal around five or &#x20AC;6 per megawatt-hour which are similar to those of last year. So the lowering in demand is not a reason to believe that the thermal spreads would be lower. The thermal spreads will depend on the supply and demand. If we have an excess of supply they'll drop and if not no. In terms of the ITC, this to-date the foreigners investing in the United States we had a disadvantage because the tax breaks for renewables were better taken advantage by nationals than for foreigners. They didn't have the same advantage with the ITCs. We could have a tax break. I think it's up to 30% of the investment and we have the guarantee of taking these in cash. So we don't have to make use of our financial partner to take advantage of these ITCs. Also we have the subject of accelerated amortization as we can't take full advantage of this, but we can take advantage of this to a certain degree. And as we have greater ITCs and we generate more cash than we're going to get advantage of this tax break. Now the initial numbers that we have with the knowledge that we have of the new American legislation is that with the ITCs, we could finance and generate a net value which is quite a bit greater than what we up until now. So it's a real incentive for us to invest in renewables in the United States. We have about seven minutes before 11, so we're going to go on to the next question.</p>
          <p>So we're going to go on to the next question.</p>

          <p>Next question is by Mr. Jose Ruiz [Exane BNP Parib&#xE1;s]. Sir you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Very quickly, I wanted to confirm what you said about the net profit for 2009 will be similar to 2008. Are you talking about recurring or reported? The second question, I wanted to assure your assessment of several companies in the UK that have talked about lowering gas and electricity prices for 31 March, and what is your position on that? And finally, with regard to your retail policy for domestic customers, I understand that 50% of forward prices depends on that. And considering that, 1 July will have the liberalization of the entire market. I wanted to know if you're already anticipating a policy on &#x2013; and because the prices keep falling and maybe by 1 July, we'll have low prices that we'll have to deal with at that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding 2009, I spoke, I said that in this situation we're going to have an important growth of EBITDA and that the net profit, total net profit of all the different concepts taking account of everything and the payment of the dividend, we talked about maintaining in line or just slightly above and so the dividend will be maintained in line, or just a little bit higher than that of this year. In other words taking into consideration all concepts in the UK it is true that there have been, a number of people that are talking about lower prices. But no prices have fallen, so we do have time. We're studying the situation. Over the next few days we're going to have a Board meeting in ScottishPower and I'm sure that we'll hit some proposals from our Board members about the scenario that we'll need to take a look at it. It's not urgent, because no one has lowered prices yet. Everyone is talking about it, that it will be, this will happen in March. So we'll study the situation and we'll make our announcements and we'll take the proper decisions at that time. Paco, could you talk a little bit about the retail policy in Spain please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the question on the retail policy in Spain, we have to &#x2013; should say that we're looking at the disappearance of the fixed price for 1 July. We are looking at the segments, the customers of the high tension, low tension. And we're looking at their quality of service, meeting their needs and the different products. And if there is one million contracts that we have right now and of the 20,000 contracts per week that our commercial people are recruiting now, of that one million contracts about 20% of products that are not electricity I'm talking about gas maintenance, electricity maintenance and so forth are green electricity and this allows us together with that segment of customers that we can select. Unfortunately we don't have the volumes of production that we would like to have. Maybe we're being a little bit too modest here, but we do have the possibility of selling this production pretty well with these customers, and this segment allows us to obtain prices, which I think, and there has been some confusion considering that those that they reflect the base of the daily pool and that has nothing to do with those prices. We're talking about much higher prices in the above 60, quite a bit above 60. So that's our strategy and I can't say a whole lot more that would, I can't say too much more without helping our competition. Let's go on to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two quick questions, but first in the UK business, can you give us a breakdown of EBITDA in terms of generation, supply and networks on EBITDA? The second question has to do with the one-off of 80 some million euros in the fourth quarter regarding where it comes from? My question is this completely non-recurrent, but when do you expect to recover that amount? Are you going to recover that in 2009, or whether you have to wait until the regulator includes this and wait for longer? And is there a bigger flaw in Energy East for this year, is that a very &#x2013; is that very important &#x2013; a very safe business regulated business, if you can talk a little bit about Energy East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you answer the first two questions further please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes EBITDA divided by the different divisions in ScottishPower, the wholesale retail that would be &#x20AC;785 million and network 748 million and then we have a negative impact of Canada in corporate, which would be negative 29 and the sum is 1.504 billion of reported EBITDA. The one-off of those 80 million &#x2013; yeah that one-off of the 80 million, that should be recovered relatively soon. Part of that one-off comes from greater, a greater cost of transport of the purchase of gas, and once this is justified that will be paced. And the other part is related to the extraordinary expense, that comes from the upstream and other greater expenses comes from the expenses for storms, extraordinary cost. So when that is registered and paid, since now that that has been approved by the authorities, then it will be recovered. Therefore, I would say that there is an important part of those 87 million that will be recovered quite quickly. I can't tell you exactly when, but an important part will probably be recovered this upcoming year. Pedro, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about that subject, can you, you have something more to say on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just to confirm what Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz just said, of those 80 million, two thirds will be in the review of the purchase of existing gas in October, they would be recovered there. So the next 12 months after October and in terms of the storms, there is the rate cases, they will be approved when there is rate cases and in terms is historically are recognized and recovered. So this is something that is quick to get to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of the expected results of energy is within the Group. First of all, as Pedro said right now we're reviewing the tariffs in several different states and we hope that these go well and the expectations that we have for the budget is in terms of contribution &#x2013; will contribute around 88 or 9% of the total EBITDA of the Group. Those are the figures we're looking at now and if there is some improvement in the chart then there could be improvements in their contribution of EBITDA. Next question please.</p>
          <p>There are no more questions in Spanish now we're going to go to the questions in English.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question comes to Tom Gapni from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, just in regards to the Energy East debt that you've got, the holding company you said in previous calls that you were looking to move that to the Iberdrola level, could you perhaps give us an update on your sort of your thoughts around that transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pedro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically this debt is one of the analysis that is done with the rating agency related to subordination and so forth, that was done with ScottishPower and what we analyze, this is something that we're kind of doing in the year. Right now, we are in the middle of the rate cases and this is that rate cases are based on a snapshot of the different balance sheets and the P&amp;L and cash flow of the companies. So right now we think it's better to finish the rate cases and then we'll take a look at some of the other optimizations that we could carry out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if there are no more questions we'll go back to questions here in the room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The first is from Arnaud Joan from Kepler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Explain the evolution of the structure of the corporation for 2008, that's 135 million negative compared to 2007 of 16 million positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as in accounting, internal accounting issue of the Group were given the accounting used in the Group, we are allocating cost that used to be assigned to the units within the structure. This is just a re-classification of the analysis of expenses and where they are, where they are produced within the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is if we expect new adjustments for an in-energy is due to the FRS and U.S. GAAP in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While we're hoping that we don't have more storms of that size. I think right now in terms of distribution, the main difference between the IFRS and the U.S. GAAP is the U.S. GAAP, the regulatory; the regulator accounts it as revenues when it is received and in IFRS we have to wait to receive the remuneration of that asset whenever that is. That's the main difference between the two, and this is something that is not clearly stipulated in the regulation in the U.S. GAAP or the IFRS. But it is a rule that the auditors have adopted in Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Matthias Heck from Oppenheim and asks, if we expect a significant increase in EBITDA without a full year of contribution from Energy East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Energy East is part of the Iberdrola Group, so that scenario is unimaginable. We have no intention of selling Energy East and we have consolidated group-wide results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Another question from Alejandra Khil from the Designoz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we think that Iberdrola's long-term goals may be modified in the near future?</p>

          <p>Another couple of questions from Alejandro Vigil and Victor Peiro from Caja Madrid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the corporate governance report table that's CNMV, the Spanish stock exchange regulator yesterday had it's impact on SES with reference to American regulators and how to exit more than 10% in Iberdrola.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Reply. I think we have our lawyers here, our lawyer, legal experts, Julio and perhaps you could reply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been no change vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous situation. There's been no change in the limitations nor in the corporate governance provisions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly a question from Chris Moore [Royal Bank of Scotland].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What percentage of production in Spain was sold forward in 2009 and 2010 and at what price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other questions I'm sorry, to those who tabled, and I think they've all been answered already. As to Chris Moore's question well, I think we've answered it already. We said that around half of the energy for 2009, yes, half of 2009's production has been sold and half of the electricity means around 80% of the objective margin, 80% of the objective margin is already placed. As I said the prices are substantially over 60. That's 2009, and it's only February. So are you asking about 2010, well that's like asking a post graduate question out of an 'O' Level student, GCSE student. I think around a third, around a third. That's your answer and the prices are also 60 and over 60. So it's been done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>If there are no more questions I'd like to thank you all very much. I trust that this has helped you do your job. We certainly learned a great deal from your questions. Thank you very much.</p>
