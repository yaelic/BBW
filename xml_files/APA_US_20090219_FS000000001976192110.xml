          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings 2008 Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dye, please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for joining us today for Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2008 Earnings Conference Call. This morning we reported net income of $706 million or $2.09 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2008. We also reported a net loss of 2.9 billion or a negative $8.8 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008. And the fourth quarter loss was a result of a severe drop in oil and gas commodity prices since the middle of 2008 that caused us to record a 3.65-billion non-cash after-tax reduction in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as required by the full cost methodology of accounting. We indicated in a release earlier this year, that an impairment was likely given year-end prices.</p>
          <p>For those of you not familiar with full cost accounting rules, we must calculate the 10% discounted after-tax value of our proved reserves by country using flat year-end prices and costs for the entire life of the reserve base. If the calculated discounted value is less than our net carrying value, the excess must be a written off. This is generally called a ceiling test write-off or impairment.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize that the reported impairment is a non-cash charge and in no way impacts our ongoing financial flexibility. Roger Plank will provide more details in his comments in a moment.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or costs incurred, will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. And I'll also mention we routinely put up important information on our website.</p>
          <p>On today's call, Steve Farris, our Chairman and CEO, and Roger Plank, our President, will make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our 2008 year-end conference call. Apache accomplished a great deal during the past year, and I'd like to share with you some of those highlights. On the exploration side, we had a steady stream of major discoveries across our regions, which resulted in a 118% reserve replacement from the drill bit alone. We delivered progress on our major development project scheduled to come online in the first half of 2009, and we took important steps in advancing Apache's next generation of projects. And going in, in 2009 importantly we managed our cash flow wisely. So we entered 2009 with $4 billion of readily available firepower.</p>
          <p>Three major one-off uncontrollable events occurred during 2008, which really distort our reported results for the year. Production was affected by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and an explosion on a pipeline which transports all of our gas production in Australia. As a result, our production declined 5% during the year. And if you exclude these two events, production would have grown 2% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Approximately 25% of both our gross operated oil and gas remain offline in the Gulf region. We're waiting on pipeline repairs to restore those volumes. We're hopeful of having all those volumes restored by the second quarter of 2009, but the timing in nearly every instance is out of our control.</p>
          <p>And the third major one off event which is reflected in our earnings is the collapse in oil and gas prices and that resulting write-down, which Bob just outlined for you briefly. I do want to emphasize that this is a non-cash item.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn reserves for 2008. And before price change, we grew our proved reserve for the 23rd consecutive year. In particular as I said, we've replaced 118% of our production through the drill bit alone. And this is significant when you consider we did not book any substantial reserves from our resource place such as Ootla. So we're talking about 232 million barrels of oil equivalent of discoveries and extensions in the year, and we're proud of our team for it.</p>
          <p>Our year-end reserve calculations included a negative reserve revision of 64 million barrels associated with year-end commodity prices, which means we closed the year with 2.4 billion barrels oil equivalent of proved reserves. Nearly all of the reserves affected were located in North America, and primarily represented long-life oil properties in the U.S. and royalty changes and high-cost shallow gas in Canada.</p>
          <p>The negative revisions in North America were partially offset by positive reservations in Egypt, and that's due to the cost recovery component of our production-sharing arrangement that requires more reserves to recover prior spending when commodity prices are lower.</p>
          <p>For those of you that focus on finding and development cost, I'd like to note that our 2008 results point to a finding and development cost for BOE up over $20 a barrel. We calculate it to be $23.43 from additions only. In relation to this, I need to point out three major issues.</p>
          <p>First, our E&amp;D capital spending in 2008 on infrastructure was uniquely high. We spent over $700 million on facilities and platforms associated with construction and upgrades. And a good portion of this is associated with progress &#x2013; I mean, projects in Australia and Egypt that will begin production first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Second, we spent almost $950 million on developing proved undeveloped locations in 2008. And again about a third of this is on Van Gogh, which is our Australian oil development, and it will move into the proved developed category in 2009. We really focused on delivering projects over booking new proved undeveloped locations, and as a result you might notice that our proved undeveloped as a percentage of our total declined from 31% to 28%.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I might point out that finding and development cost is only one side of the coin. Our resource and project profile is very different from most North America large cap independents. The other side of the coin is that our cash flow per barrel is consistently in the upper end of the peer group, which means that barrels are worth paying for.</p>
          <p>And finally in 2008, we didn't outspend our cash flow, we didn't chase costly deals, nor did we enter into expensive leases for large blocks of acreage with short-term expirations. As a result, we enter 2009 with nearly $4 billion and a readily available firepower, which consists of over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term securities and $2.3 billion line of credit. We end the year with a 23% debt-to-cap after the write-down and if we exclude the cash we have in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to discuss some of our operational highlights in 2008 and really focus on the fourth quarter developments. For the year, we drilled 1,057 net wells with a 92% success rate. During the fourth quarter, we drilled 380 wells with a 93% success rate.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front, we had a number of Apache landmark discoveries during the year, and some of those highlights include the following. In Egypt we had a steady stream of significant discoveries during the year across basins and plays and most notably the following two. Hydra, which is in the Matruh concession in the northern part of the Khalda concession, we found an accumulation of 200 Bcf of gas, which will end up going through Train 3 and 4 that I'll talk about here in a minute. And on the southwestern end of the concession, we discovered West Kalabsha C-1X, which is in the Faghur Basin during the fourth quarter, and it tested nearly 5000 barrels of oil a day and has confirmed a new deep light oil play.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the Halyard discovery found a 150 Bcf of gas near Varanus Island. We're currently in the design phase of its development. In the fourth quarter, we had a successful discovery in the Bambra-9 near the Varanus Island, and we're studying ways to bring that back through the island.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, the Geauxpher discovery identified a large accumulation of gas on Garden Bank 462. Our Geauxpher project is expected to commence production in May at a net rate of about 50 million a day. And during the fourth quarter, we stepped out with a successful well in Garden Bank 463, which was an appraisal well shallow. And we took it deeper, and we found 150 feet of gas in deeper sand.</p>
          <p>In terms of our development projects, we delivered progress on the major development projects, which are going to underpin Apache's visible production growth in 2009 and beyond. In Egypt two additional gas processing trains are expected to reach full production of 100 million a day and 5,000 barrels of oil a day in May of 2009. Also in Egypt, we drilled 203 waterflood wells and ended the year with about 76,000 barrels of oil per day of gross production from waterflood field, which is a 12,000-barrel-a-day increase from 2007. I might point out that waterflood production now underpins 50% of our crude oil production in Egypt and continues to grow.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter, we completed a very successful drilling and recompletion program at Ewing Bank 826. We've increased production from about September of '07 from 700 barrels a day to 6,300 barrels a day by the end of the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In Canada we drilled 96 coal bed methane wells during the fourth quarter, leading to a North Grant Land's production record for the region earlier this year.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, we completed 11 new development wells in the giant Forties field, including four wells during the fourth quarter. These 11 wells flowed at a combined rate of 18,900 barrels a day of light sweet oil.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the Van Gogh development remains on schedule with first production of 20,000 barrels of oil a day net and is expected to come online in May of 2009. Our Pyrenees development, which is operated by BHP, also remains on track. It should be on in first quarter of 2010 with an additional 20,000 barrels a day net to Apache.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we took important steps in shaping our next generation of projects. In Egypt, we made four discoveries in a new area called Hava Ridge, which is adjacent to the Asala Ridge waterflood area in East Bahariya concession. These discoveries have the potential to recover 20 to 30 million barrels of oil through waterflooding.</p>
          <p>In January of 2009, we secured a 154 Bcf seven-year gas sales contract, which underpins our Reindeer development in Australia. Our Reindeer development will start up in mid-2011, and the contract will net back prices at Apache three to four times the $2 price we've received on average over the past decade.</p>
          <p>In Canada we completed seven successful horizontal wells in the Ootla play during 2008, with an additional five wells waiting on completion. And nine wells were surface casing preset. And we're now moving toward a full-scale development plan.</p>
          <p>I'm going to talk a little bit about our 2009 outlook. And as a result of the accomplishments that we just talked about, we project production growth in 2009 from 6 to 14% for the year. I need to make it clear that we're driving to stay within our cash flow in 2009. If commodity prices continue to fall, we'll likely land in the bottom half of that range.</p>
          <p>Currently our 2009 capital spending levels are based on cash flow estimates using $4.50 for natural gas and $40 for oil, which translates in a budget of 3.5 to $4 billion. We will scale back spending further if commodity price stays at current levels. We're reviewing our capital monthly if not weekly. We are a flexible and entrepreneurial organization, which enables us to make the best value decisions as market circumstances continue to evolve.</p>
          <p>I might point out that presently service costs don't make any sense. Oil is below $40 a barrel, but most costs still remain at levels reached when oil was above $100. And I know service costs historically lag commodity prices three to six months, but frankly we expect significant external cost deflation through 2009 and potentially beyond. Given that backdrop and following our directional plans for 2009, all regions have significantly reduced capital budgets to balance the forecasted operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. Central region, we remain extremely cautious drilling gas wells until net back prices improve in Western Oklahoma and also plan limited activity in the Permian Basin. Fortunately these areas have pretty low decline rates and we do not have large acreage positions which are facing near-term lease expirations.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, our Hurricane Ike production recoveries and Geauxpher discovery are both expected online during the second quarter of 2009, which should offset the decline in activity.</p>
          <p>In Canada, our major focus is to drill 25 wells at Ootla, as well as fund a 30% interest in a 24-inch pipeline that will give Apache 120 million a day of additional takeaway capacity.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, we finished most of the facilities upgrade in 2008, which accounts for nearly all of the budget decrease relative to 2009. And our drilling activity in the Forties will be flat in 2008 &#x2013; I mean, flat with 2008 level.</p>
          <p>In Egypt we intend to complete funding of our gas plants and conduct a more moderate drilling program. We should show record volume growth in 2009 with the Salam gas plants ramping up. Gross operated production has steadily ramped up. And over the last week, we averaged 630 million cubic feet of gas and a 148,000 barrels of oil per day of gross operated production.</p>
          <p>In Australia we will complete funding of Van Gogh and continue funding our Pyrenees and Reindeer projects. The Van Gogh development will not require funding until we determine which market is best suited for the asset. Our Julimar discovery is more likely to participate in an LNG development rather than supplying the domestic Western Australian market. Australia will obviously have record strong volume growth with our Van Gogh development coming online during the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close with a couple of comments. First is Apache's a 54-year old company, and we've been through many down cycles. And truthfully we've never been in better shape to take advantage of opportunities that we think will invariably present themselves. We have a portfolio, diversity, and balance that is a unique strength. We don't depend exclusively on North American high volatile gas markets for our existence. And our pipeline of visible major projects is spread across our international regions.</p>
          <p>We entered 2009 with projected production growth, ample liquidity to pursue acquisitions. And historically Apache has been very successful during these periods. And I'm extremely confident that we'll emerge even stronger company as the cycle ultimately turns.</p>
          <p>My final comment is I hope the gentlemen of listening in. It's Raymond Plank, who is synonymous with Apache. As many of you might know, Raymond retired on January 15 after being the only chairman and founder that we've had. For those of you who don't know him, I think you would agree he's one of a kind. He started Apache in 1954 with $250,000 from family and friends. And depending on the stock price today, we've gone to a $25-billion organization. And when you consider the adjusted price of those shares in 1954 were $0.04, it's been a hell of a ride.</p>
          <p>So, Raymond, on behalf of our employees certainly &#x2013; and I think all of them I know in this room feel that way and all of them around the globe, and our shareholders &#x2013; we're very indebted to you. And thank you for your wisdom, your warmth, your friendship, and support over many, many years and we wish you all the best. Roger?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. From a financial standpoint, Apache finished 2008 with a very tough quarter. The write-down nearly eliminated what otherwise would have been outstanding earnings in a year that would have been our best ever. It's little consolation that even with the write-down, Apache's $706 million of income still stacked up as the sixth highest in our 54 years. Clearly 2008 will go down as the year of extremes. From an earnings perspective, we had our best quarter ever and our worst quarter ever, all in the same year.</p>
          <p>Bob commented on the magnitude of the write-down and how it's calculated, and I just wanted to touch on a couple of things before moving on. You may be aware that in December the SEC issued new rules on how to calculate the ceiling test. The older rule requires that in comparing the discounted present worth of properties against their historical cost, we must use prices as of a single day and time, and then hold that price flat forever. The new rule updates that approach, allowing companies to use the prior 12-month average price, the theory being that this is a better price indicator than a single day's price.</p>
          <p>Three points, under the new rule, we'd have avoided a write-down altogether at least for now because the previous month's highs in terms of prices would have muted the impact of recently lower prices in determining an average. However, the revised rule does not take effect until the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are required to use cost levels &#x2013; and Bob went into this or mentioned this, touched on this &#x2013; cost levels as of year-end for the entire life of the properties. And clearly this doesn't make any sense in estimating economic value of reserves at lower commodity prices &#x2013; as lower commodity prices historically result in lower service costs. It's just that there's a lag. And so the calculation misses this. You just can't assume that $40-per-barrel oil revenue against cost levels generated in the $100-plus-per-barrel price environment and expect to have a fully valid answer from an economic perspective.</p>
          <p>And then the third thing and more importantly, this is a 30-year-old rule that's clearly outmoded or it wouldn't be being updated today. Obviously a 12-month historic average price is a better answer, but it too has its limitations and should not be confused as a statement about market value.</p>
          <p>The point is the methodology for calculating the ceiling has little to do with how properties are valued in the real world. It also has nothing to do with the underlying earnings and cash flow comparability of a company, and capability of a company. That being said, it's a calculation. It should be ignored, but it's probably best set aside in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison of results, which is what I now intend to do in comparing the fourth quarter to the third.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Prices cratered from the third quarter to the fourth, dropping our oil and gas realizations 50% and 36% respectively. This caused revenues to decline over 40% sequentially to just under $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the write-down, fourth quarter earnings totaled $701 million or $2.08 a share. This includes a $272 million or $0.81-a-share foreign exchange benefit in deferred taxes, following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and a $152 million or $0.45-per-share benefit, largely from a favorable resolution of tax audits.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations decreased 49% to $1.1 billion compared to the third quarter. That's a substantial decline, but it's not unexpected given that the world economy is currently in shambles. While a lot of products have no market at all today, we are very fortunate to be in the oil and gas business where all our product sells every day. As Steve likes to say, we don't sell widgets.</p>
          <p>Costs remain an issue for both Apache and the industry as a whole, as they have not come down nearly as quickly as prices. Lifting costs per BOE rose to $10.91 from $10.39 last quarter, a vestige of yesterday's rising commodity price environment. The quarter also included several items outside of our base running rate, most significantly hurricane repair costs related to Ike. Our 2009 goal is to reduce lifting costs per unit by 10%, as our volumes rise and lagging cost declines catch up to the reality of lower prices.</p>
          <p>Recurring full cost DD&amp;A &#x2013; and this is pre-write-down &#x2013; increased 10% sequentially to $13.09 per BOE. Parenthetically I'd note that each dollar of write-down is a dollar we don't have to amortize in the future. So between that and drilling costs, which are starting to moderate, our full cost DD&amp;A rate should drop below $12 a barrel equivalent.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A costs increased to $1.47 per BOE from $1.23. However we should be between those rates as we go forward. Severance and other taxes of $2.92 per BOE fell in the half, or fell in half on lower oil and gas prices. This could fall in half again depending on whether today's lower prices hold.</p>
          <p>Finance expense increased $0.32 to $1.03 per BOE with the additional $800 million of 6.5% notes issued in the fourth quarter as credit markets tightened. We also completed a project financing for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects on which we drew $100 million in December. This increased our cash on hand, enabling us to end the year with just under $2 billion of cash and treasuries. I would caution, however, that the first quarter is expected to see a draw-down in that amount for costs that carried over year-end, including $125 million in Egyptian cash calls, an estimated $135 million to the UK for PRT tax, and we also plan to retire $100 million of Australian notes that mature this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to income taxes, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 40%. But if you remove the noise associated with adjusted earnings, our effective tax rate would have been 36%.</p>
          <p>Steve earlier underscored many of the highlights achieved during 2008. I would add that we have a saying at Apache that what we won't do is as important as what we will do. For the longest time I didn't fully appreciate what that meant, but can size it up like this. During the frothy upswing, Apache did not outspend cash flow. Choosing instead to reduce our debt-to-cap and to build a significant cash hoard, we did not submit to the strategy du jour of buying in shares at new highs or jacking up dividends to unsustainable levels. And we did not blow our financial flexibility on deals at the peak of the cycle. We've been on the acquisition sidelines for two years. We looked, but didn't buy. And as a result we have significant firepower intact when it really counts.</p>
          <p>Would we have done some things differently had we known how rapidly prices would fall? Absolutely. But by taking a long-term approach and staying our own course, we find ourselves in a very competitive position with production on the rise, access to credit at favorable rates, and a meaningful amount of opportunity money with which to address today's not insignificant challenges and opportunities.</p>
          <p>With that, we'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just had a quick question thinking about your Gulf of Mexico volumes and the recovery and then the additional volumes coming in from Geauxpher. What are the major systems that we should watch, or is there some way we can get an idea of ratios as that comes back this year?</p>

          <p>I know from a 2009 plan standpoint, if we get the recovery that we're projecting &#x2013; and we lost a little bit obviously. We wrote off a few reserves just because of the hurricane at the end of the year. But with the 50 million a day coming in from Geauxpher, we should be slightly ahead to flat in the Gulf of Mexico this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in Egypt, as commodity prices &#x2013; as oil prices have come down, you get the split between your cost barrels and your profit barrels that impact your overall volumes. How do we think about the variability of production that's tied to the change in commodity price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, frankly, I go by our gross operated production. And if you looked at our gross operated production, we have been steadily increasing throughout the year. And when we get these two plants on, we should be at &#x2013; started out about 520 million a day at the beginning of 2007. By the first, end of May of second quarter, we'll be at about 850 million a day of gas and about 165,000 barrels of liquids because you really have a hard time looking at net-net numbers in terms of how you book the cost recovery component. It's just &#x2013; know this, when prices go down, we're going to book more production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yes, you get more production as these prices have come down. And they steadily have down, so you'll have some boost to '09 that hopefully reverses itself as oil prices come back. But I was trying to think through that logic. I understand the gross is growing, but you also will get a net growth as well in addition to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no simple formula. We've tried to simplify it, and you really just got to run it through the model and based on whatever the price is. But you've got the direction right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, you also have about 12 different concessions that all have their own particular cost tool. So it's very difficult, as we've spoken before, to model that because you'd have to have a model on every one, and you'd have to know how much spending we had made in every one, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I won't be able to get there. I was trying to get an order of magnitude, and I think we've talked about it before. But it's net positive versus just the overall projects that you have coming in as oil price is at. I think that'll do it. Thanks, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are actually, and I think I said this on the last call &#x2013; we're actually drilling wells at EFO, which is one of those projects. And we are actually restricting capital in Argentina right now, but the one area that we're not restricting is our EFO development because we're hopeful to be able to put that gas into the market. I really can't comment on the Oil Plus because we have one project that we're doing. It's a horizontal project down there that &#x2013; we just started drilling our first well, made over 500 barrels a day. But that's early in the cycle.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; and this is my Steve Farris hat on &#x2013; but I think you're going to, everybody is going to be very discouraged when they look at first quarter pricing. What we have for the fourth quarter, even though we took a ceiling test hit, our average price was much higher than the average price that's going to be in the fourth quarter. And that's not just for us; that's going to be from the Exxons to the little guys. And I think when we get first quarter realizations of what our cash flow, all of our cash flows are going to be, there's going to be a real convergence of the selling price and the buying price of assets. And so truthfully we're just kind of pedaling our feet right now until after the first quarter.</p>

          <p>And I really mean this, we do look at our business long term. So in terms, is it going to be six months or &#x2013; we've got an awful lot of pain in the economy, and I think you could linger it where we are for some time. Having said that, if you also think that we're still producing, or consuming as a world 83 million barrels of oil a day and you think of how much capital is going to come out of this business, I don't know if it's two years from now or three years from now, but regrettably I think we're going to see the same thing that we saw at the $140 oil. I mean, I really do. I don't think you can &#x2013; I don't think you can stop that 83 million barrels a day on a dime.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions on &#x2013; first question on Julimar. You mentioned you continue to expect that it will be associated more with an LNG project. Can you provide any of the latest color in terms of how you're thinking about timing and cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's two &#x2013; as you know, Brian, I mean, there are two competing LNG projects that are very near to us over there. One is a major oil company, and the other one is a major LNG player but it's smaller. And frankly we are discussing those options with both of them. I would expect sometime, and actually I'm going to give myself -because Reindeer I said we were going to have that done for months, so I'm going to be careful. I would expect something to happen on that during 2009 in terms of some kind of commitments of where we would go with that gas.</p>
          <p>There are some differences, which I'd just as soon not go into because it's &#x2013; There are some differences in the structure of those two opportunities and also of the timing as which they are going to be built or were built, which has an impact on cost. You understand what I'm saying? Because costs are going to come -</p>
          <p>The major supplier that built our plants in the Egypt, we have talked to them about building our third train now &#x2013; third new train, our fifth train. And they have one project around the world that they've got in front of them now versus where they were six, eight months ago. So all of those costs, steel costs, et cetera, are going to be significantly lower than they were during the boom. And I think that's going to have some impact on the way we look at Julimar and where we go with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And secondly, in Egypt and Argentina what are you seeing in terms of gas demand trends given the economic climate, and maybe some comment on gas prices on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's interesting because I &#x2013; if you probably are going to look at the first quarter of 2009, with either a gas price in Egypt that is equal to or close to what we're getting in the United States. And regrettably that's not because one of them has grown up and the other one is staying there; it's because one of them is coming down. I don't recall what our average price was in the fourth quarter in Egypt on gas. How much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>4.13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$4.13. Now when we get new volumes on, that's going to start drifting down just because it's a lower price. But we should net back to us probably in the $3.50 range to Apache. And given gas today is little over $4.00 in the United States &#x2013; that's at NYMEX &#x2013; I would suspect that our gas price in Egypt in the first quarter with an additional 100 million a day coming on is going to be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you might have gathered from Steve's' comment about the fifth train that there's still very strong demand for additional...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so. And the reason is regardless of the price of crude oil in Egypt, they just don't have enough of it. And so what they're trying to do is whatever dollars that they can get &#x2013; because basically they have import products. So whatever price they can get for their crude oil is hard dollars and our gas is used internally. And it's still a very strong market for gas.</p>
          <p>In Argentina &#x2013; and again this is bittersweet, but regrettably our Argentine price doesn't look so bad anymore. We're still selling our Dow contract. Actually starting in first of 2009, that Dow contract will be $3.50. Now that's not much gas. But in the fourth quarter of '08, we averaged $1.85. And I would suspect probably Argentine gas prices are going to continue to go up on an average. Certainly we're not going to threaten the $9.00 we've seen in the United States, but I don't think United States is going to threaten $9.00.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Could you comment on your outlook for production growth out of the Ootla shale? So what's production now? What are you thinking about year-end '09, a year later, just give us a sense of the growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on how we develop that right now. Right now we're drilling wells and presetting casing, and we're going to go back in the fall and complete those wells. We're doing about 20 million a day right now of gas out of the wells that we've got on. Interestingly the last well actually EnCana drilled, but we have 50% in also. Four months later, still making 5 million a day. So it's holding up very well. That's the only well that we've actually got 10 fracs on. So from a reservoir standpoint we're very encouraged about what we see.</p>
          <p>In terms of the timing, we probably start ramping up production not until about the end of 2009. So where you're really going to start seeing some &#x2013; depending on what happens to prices, you're probably going to see the first meaningful gas coming out of Egypt &#x2013; I mean, out of Ootla area in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. And then in terms of acquisition, you suggested that you're in the market for making acquisition. What are you looking for in particular? And, I mean, don't you have enough to keep yourself busy now and to invest all the capital that you got available to you at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly we have, and truthfully we have more opportunities than we have cash right now. And we're being been very selective about how we spend those dollars. In terms of &#x2013; we are a growth company. Apache is &#x2013; at 54 years has been very acquisitive. And they have not &#x2013; we do not look for acquisitions that just add production. We look for acquisitions that add acreage and have upside and that can be a long-term part of our portfolio, &#xE0; la Egypt. Now we bought Repsol out of Egypt in 2001, and that was the other half of the greater Khalda area. And we drilled &#x2013; we got 42 rigs still running in Egypt. That's going to go down, but that was a huge, huge win for us.</p>
          <p>You would hardly ever see us make an acquisition just for the production. So what we'd liked to be able to do is put ourselves in a position to add some growth potential for the next several years out of an acquisition we could make when prices are relatively low, rather than buy at the high end of the market. Same reason you buy a stock when it's down &#x2013; is you expect it to go up. We'd much rather invest dollars in a much saner environment than we would at higher prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somebody earlier asked about the right time for acquisitions and when do things pick up. And the real answer to that is that timing's coming our way. But the real answer is in Steve's last answer to this question. And that is when we see something to which we can add value that brings us a lot of opportunities that's in a market where you aren't stretching every assumption in order to get a deal done, then that's when you act, rather than try to pick the exact right time with respect to pricing because that's pretty difficult to do, as we all know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I suppose you weigh that against things like buying back stock or paying down debt and other opportunities as well. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly do against paying down the debt. Occasionally we'll weigh that against buying back stock. But I can tell you, along the lines of Steve's comments about we are a growth company for 54 years, this kind of environment is the kind of environment where we vastly prefer to look for opportunities that build a better business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then, Steve, you made a comment about how the costs were &#x2013; you suggested that finding costs were higher because of the facilities and construction and other costs that you incurred in 2008. Are there others? Are there costs like that in 2009 that might make '09 finding costs higher than they otherwise would be?</p>

          <p>The only place that we have significant infrastructure left frankly, because most of our &#x2013; we probably see a little of it in the first quarter out of the gas plants in Egypt and a little first quarter Van Gogh. But past that, we ought to &#x2013; certainly Reindeer won't start up until later in 2009, first part of 2000 &#x2013; the actual construction and spending because we don't come on until 2011. So we're pretty well funded with what we see right now. Now if &#x2013; and again most things, there's always two sides &#x2013; we'd love to have something that we could start spending money on. So &#x2013; but right now we're pretty well funded, those projects that will come online in 2009.</p>

          <p>Hi, going back Ootla for a second, could you &#x2013; now that you're in full development mode, does that mean that you're pretty comfortable with what the wells are doing in terms of what your program is in terms of fracs, completions? And can you outline what you think the IPs and the URs are going to be at that stabilized level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we project that the latest well that we drilled is probably going to 7.5 B, and that is with 10 fracs. We think we can &#x2013; and this is &#x2013; I will tell you we've got five wells that we've actually had some production on, so a little of this is &#x2013; but we're fairly confident. At least our engineers and our specs is pretty confident that with larger number of fracs we could recover 10 Bcf per well.</p>
          <p>In terms of our &#x2013; from a reservoir standpoint, now we've only been in two areas and we've got 400,000 acres. So we're extrapolating a long &#x2013; it's more than a Oklahoma step-out. But certainly all of the wells that have been drilled so far have been very similar. This program that we're doing this winter and throughout the year will be very important to us in terms of drainage, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But at some level, this project is going to go forward. And the question is how big is big. Certainly we're confident enough to join and putting a 24-inch pipeline that's going to take 700 million a day out of there, of which we'll have 30% of. So we're going to increase our available capacity significantly over the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is the cost? What do you think the cost is going to level out at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Level out, I don't know yet honestly. You're looking at &#x2013; every service that we talk to comes down daily, frankly. And it will continue to come down until it reaches a point at which it's commensurate with the return on the prices that you're getting for the commodity. It never fails.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, maybe I used the wrong term. But in terms of your technological improvements, what do you think the wells are going to cost at today's cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At today's cost, about $7 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>7 million. And you cited &#x2013; I think to Joe's question about Ootla, you said that it was one well that was still producing 5 million a day. What was its IP and how long has this been? And is it surface infrastructure-constrained at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not constrained. It came on actually &#x2013; instantaneous rate or the life &#x2013; the 12-hour rate, it came on about 12 million a day originally and declined obviously significantly early. But it's relatively flat for a shale well, and at 5 million day after four months is a very good rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is your view that the Ootla at today's prices would be economic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a well-by-well basis, it would be economic; on an infrastructure basis, probably not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're going to have to spend some of that money in order to get there, if you understand what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Absolutely. Okay. And then just a question about &#x2013; you mentioned in the royalty &#x2013; in the revisions downward, the royalties played a role in that. Could you &#x2013; I know the royalty regime sort of kicked into place at the end of 2007. So wouldn't that have affected 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this was the first year that they &#x2013; and it was the Alberta government royalties that had the impact, and was significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it didn't affect your reserves in '07, only the reserves in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it might have been that it was announced, and it didn't take effect until 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But, yes, okay, so you didn't have to write your &#x2013; or you didn't have to calculate your '07 reserves based on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Question on CapEx for 2009, you guys talked about 3.5 to 4 billion. I know that's a moving target. Could you guys put any numbers around kind of where that money may get spent if it's possible to say 20% in Australia, 10% in North Sea or any sort of vague guidelines like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have it in front of me. Let me tell you where I &#x2013; we probably spent $800 million in the Central region, and we're probably going to spend $400 million in the Central region. And these are just directionally, if you understand what I'm saying. We spent probably 1.5 billion in the Gulf coast, and we'll probably spend something like 1 billion. In Canada, most of which is our Ootla, we're probably down 350 million there. I think we're going to spend about $500 million. In Egypt, we're trying to be &#x2013; now we had the gas plants in '08. So you're not looking at &#x2013; it's not having as much effect on our drilling. But Egypt, we're going to be about $800 million. And then North Sea, about $300 million. And the rest of it is change, if you understand what I'm saying.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. You guys talked about your Gulf of Mexico shut-ins being roughly 25% of your volume. Could you kind of quantify what that number's going to be?</p>

I just need to &#x2013; you just need to get that number offline. I mean, we've got it; I just can't remember exactly the number. And I don't want to give you a ballpark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. I think you guys were drilling some wells in the Gippsland base in Australia kind of late last year. I want to see if you had any results in that part. I think there was a couple of big prospects you guys were looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a very good program that turned up with some uneconomic discoveries frankly. We drilled &#x2013; the Dore well had a nice sand with hydrocarbons in it. It turned into being gas rather than oil, which it &#x2013; where it was in the world is not going to be economic. And the other two turned out to be &#x2013; had sand in them, but were &#x2013; actually didn't have a charge. So we drilled three dry holes there. And that doesn't condemn the Gippsland frankly. I just &#x2013; the ship's gone, and we're going to study it and probably go back to drill in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Anything else on the drawing board in the exploration side for Australia for '09, or you guys kind of taking a break over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got a well up in the Browse that we're getting ready to drill. We get our ship back; we're getting ready to drill an oil prospect up in the Browse. We've got a project that's offsetting our Van Gogh Pyrenees development that's a smaller oil play, but it could be a very good add-on. We've got a couple of gas wells that we're going to drill in the Carnarvon basin down toward Varanus Island. We'll probably drill &#x2013; because of our discussions on where to go with gas, we'll probably drill a couple of appraisal wells at our 356, or Julimar block, that are going to be important wells to established proved reserves, if you understand what I'm saying. So we've got a program. It's more modest than it was in 2008 for sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Most of the questions have been answered, just one follow up. And you briefly mentioned &#x2013; I was looking at the regional F&amp;Ds in the Gulf Coast. Can you talk &#x2013; ex revisions, can you talk about &#x2013; I think you mentioned there's some deep water wells included in that number. Can you talk about what exactly went into that CapEx number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there was a significant amount of infrastructure, not all associated with the hurricane. The other thing I would say is that we have timing difference in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is the difference between when you book the reserves and when you drill the well. We drilled a very expensive well out, South 10308 that was an exploration well to the deeper target that turned out to a dry hole. The biggest is timing differences, and that's just year-over-year, if you understand what I'm saying. And the Gulf of Mexico is a high cost area. I mean, and we saw historic high cost in the Gulf. That's not indicative of the way that programs should go, but it certainly was that way in 2008 for all kinds of reasons, one of which is the hurricanes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and when I look at grouping of your U.S. production, how much of that &#x2013; what's Central versus what's Gulf Coast? How much onshore is included in that Gulf Coast number?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just had two questions &#x2013; is there a price that you kind of cutback drilling in Ootla in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess there is a price. Right now we are for a lot of reasons &#x2013; one is we really want to do in a pad drilling and experiment with fracs, et cetera, in a orderly fashion. So we are going to drill those wells in 2009. That is going to be part of our program. And we're going to complete them and we're going to put them on. And if oil &#x2013; I mean, gas prices continue to decline, certainly we're spending money for the future. We're not spending money for now when we do that. And we fully recognize it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. The second question &#x2013; can you give me a feel what demand's like in Argentina as far as gas, I mean are they still importing a large amount? Has some of that demand kind of fallen off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll see as we go into their winter. But in terms of the actual need for natural gas in Argentina, that hasn't let up at all. They are behind the eight-ball with respect to gas demand versus supply.</p>
