        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Woolworths' First Half Profit Announcement. Welcome to those who have made the journey to the Norwest and welcome also to those that are online and listening in. Overall, the result has been a pleasing one for the first half and characterized by I think sustainable and profitable growth.</p>
          <p>I just want to take a moment at the beginning of the presentation to look back to November 2011 and the sort of things that we said out there, our four strategic priorities, our four strategic goals. And their merit I think in today's result, so we said back then that we would extend our leadership in food and liquor and I think both the sales and the profit number in this business show that we're delivering in that area.</p>
          <p>We said we had maximized the value of our portfolio and in the SCA float, and the exit from consumer electronics, I think we're making significant ground along that path. We said we would found new growth and that's happening through innovation, through our multi-option strategy and also through our category expansion like home improvement. And we said we had put in place the enablers for the new area of growth and we've certainly been putting some hard yards in in relation to that particularly around <mark type="indiscernible" /> insights, particularly around recruiting and training the best teams and particularly around our supply chain. Also the pieces in our D&amp;A and it's our cost control.</p>
          <p>So what the strategy has unlocked in terms of outcomes, I just want to take a moment to go through now. So from a sale perspective for the half, we reported sales of $30 billion, which is 4.8% up on the previous year. EBIT for our continuing operations and before significant items was $1.934 billion, up 6.1%. In <mark type="ph" /> Perth, again for continuing operations before significant items, it was A$1.247 billion, up 5.5%.</p>
          <p>For the total group that NPAT rises to an increase of 19.4%. Our earnings per share 101.1 cents, an increase of 4.2 on the previous year and pleasingly we can announce an interim dividend of A$0.62. I think the good news is also that over the course of the half, we've returned, or we will return in the order of A$2 billion to shareholders by dividends and in-specie distribution that was attached to the SCI transaction. So I think very pleasing for the shareholders, good news. I just want to touch a little deeper on each of our strategic priorities and give you the opportunity to sharing some of the progress we've made and you get a little more detail on this again, when each of the heads of business make their presentation shortly.</p>
          <p>Extending leadership in food and liquor has been our biggest focus. Number one priority, the number one strategic priority, and it's been across five areas, fresh programs, where we've enhanced the supply chain, but more to do and we've introduced new categories that we're rolling out around the group and Tjeerd will touch more on those shortly.</p>
          <p>Value improvement programs, which was necessary work that we needed to undertake. You're starting to see the beginnings of those with promotions like Extra Specials, with tailored campaigns like Cash for Christmas, which was a tremendous success for us in the Christmas trading period. Also looking at and seeing more merchandizing innovations out there on our new store formats Wolli Creek is one that we've spoken a bit about, but importantly the initiatives and innovations in Wolli Creek are now rolling out of <mark type="indiscernible" /> network of stores. We are on track from a supermarket perspective to open 34 new stores in this financial year.</p>
          <p>We're proud of progressing liquor, Brad and the team there are producing strong sales and strong share growth underpinned by Dan Murphy's and the expanding BWS offer that we have in our bricks and mortar portfolio. But also increasingly online. I'm pleased to see in the New Zealand market, that's a little tough at the moment, but we're still gaining share. And that's a good measure of the success that Dave and his team are having there and we'll hear an update from Dave shortly.</p>
          <p>Next part as I alluded before we made good progress on these effecting on our portfolio to maximize shareholder value, the most obvious of those, I think, has been the creating of the new REIT, which is the SCA, Shopping Centres Australia or Australasia Proprietary Limited, where we release $1.4 billion worth of property.</p>
          <p>And that capital that's been returned enables us to have greater focus on the growth avenues in our business. Similarly with the consumer electronics business we've completed the divestment of that business in this half and that ensures the attention of the not only the executive group, but our resources again are on the growth avenues for our business into the future.</p>
          <p>We've talked about having our portfolio of hotels that bears the title of the most responsible operators and we've done and are doing a work in that area to ensure that comes off at the started the process of implementing voluntary pre-commitment and many other measures that part and pass of that and the big W business that Julie will talk about is making good progress but with more to come. Maintaining our track record of growth there're two areas that I wanted to particularly point to this morning first is a multi-options and there are three areas of I think focus there, ones is the online growth itself and a 40% increase in airline launch sales shows that we are getting some momentum in that area of business. The connection with customers is something we've spoken about over the course of the last year, not only we got mobile platforms in all of our businesses we also brought apps that are proving to be very popular with customers in changing the way that they shop. I think we're up to about 2.8 million downloads now of the app and it remains in the top 10 apps of in the food and grocery category in the Apple's iTune store.</p>
          <p>Click and collect is something that there's been a big increase on all of the Dan Murphy stores were made to be click and collect stores and Brad will talk about that, we've got selection of supermarkets that way and all of our home improvement stores clearly can collect. Customers are voting with their feet in relation of that one, that's more convenient to many of our customers to not have a delivery to home, but delivered to the store, and we're seeing a fairly significant increase in that. Providing Australia's best home improvement offer is our focus with the category expansion into home improvement. We've now got 25 Master stores on the ground. So, that growth is right on target.</p>
          <p>And the things that enabled us to do all of what we desire is really in the enablers part of our strategy and there's been a lot of work in supply chain in Tasmania or in New Zealand here in New South Wales, we're the BIG W warehouse at Hoxton Park. We continue to invest and we're getting towards the end of the implementation of our next generation replenishment systems. So, still work being done there, still work to do to make sure we stay at the sharp edge of supply chain.</p>
          <p>Customer data is &#x2013; and the use of our Category Lab is enabling us to be more targeted to our customers smarter in the use of that data and then have that represent itself in our stores. And cost leadership I alluded to before is part of the Woolworths' DNA, and I think there's some outstanding cost results in the divisions that I'll let Tim talk about, but a continuation of what's an important part of the Woollies DNA and we've looked, if you look around what was there you'll see many new faces over the course of the last year, you'll see a number of them talked this morning in fact, and we've introduced some more resources both from internally and also externally to make sure that we've got the world's best world class retail team. So, the four strategic imparities of what I'll get out of the bed to drive everyday and as I said I think you can see that woven through the business result but for some more detail on each of those areas I'm going to call on Tjeerd to join me to talk about the supermarket business. Tjeerd?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Grant. And good morning. My name is Tjeerd Jegen and I'm the Managing Director of Australian Supermarkets and Petrol. And today I'd like to give you an update on our financial results for the half, but much more importantly on the progress we're making with implementing our supermarket strategy which we presented to you in November 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's first go to the numbers. And before I go into detail, I would like to summarize the half. And on the top of the chart behind me you can see this summary is that our sales are improving, our profits are improving, but there is much more to do and there is much more to come. And I'll touch upon the numbers now, and I'll start with the top line. Sales up for the half 3.8%, but if you strip out petrol it's actually up 4.7%. And there is a very healthy shape in the P&amp;L because our EBIT growth is faster than our sales growth, so EBIT growth was 6%. If you go in detail into the sales number, you look at the comp number, for the half we were up 2.4% which is more or less the same Q1, Q2 and the comparable number for the half in last year was 1.5. So an acceleration of our comp sales development.</p>
          <p>So a healthy shape of our P&amp;L with a pleasing result. But also very pleasing is giving value back to customers and our average prices went down with 2.8% in the half. So 2.8% less cost for a growing number of customers, who came into our stores in the half. Our gross margin increased and of course if you look at the chart behind me, a significant increase 31 basis points, but it's also due to a mix impact that high margin business units, higher margin business units like liquor and foods <mark type="indiscernible" /> a greater share in the overall mix due to the sales decline in petrol. So the actual net gross margin increase in food and liquor as large as 31 basis point, but still good gross margin increase and the gross margin increase had several components. It's of course by focusing on a better mix. It's being helped by more global buying. It's also a growth of our own brands and an ongoing focus on shrink. And, shrink I think we still have opportunities to reduce shrink much more than we've done in the past.</p>
          <p>Another important driver of our profit growth was the fact that we were able to professionalize our CODB, and our CODB rate was flat if you strip out petrol for the half, and that's not been the case for quite a while. And our mission is to make sure with our focus on cost reduction, our focus on simplification, our store processes to remain the cost increase below our sales increase, that's our ongoing commitment, ongoing focus and this half reflects that intention <mark type="indiscernible" /> in actual numbers.</p>
          <p>We've opened 17 new stores, 17 new communities in Australia, enjoyed the benefit of Woolies across the corner and also we have plans to open 17 more stores in the remainder of this financial year. So a good set of numbers, but again more important is to talk about the strategy behind these numbers. And, I'll start with talking about Fresh Foods. We are Australia's fresh food people and it's very, very important for us to retain leadership in fresh foods. And we listen to our customers how they perceive, how we're going, we're delivering on the fresh food promise. And both important freshness as we measured the customer's perception, customer evaluation we've continued to make good progress in the half. We're helped by the fact that we've launched a new campaign Australia's Fresh Food People at the back end of the last financial year. And it wasn't just a TV commercial, it was also actual change in our stores. We had celebrated a fantastic fresh food fairs in June, July, but also great fresh fair leading up to Christmas which are testament to the passion of our people for fresh foods.</p>
          <p>But it's not just fresh fairs and marketing. It's actual change in our stores. In our Wolli Creek store, we've opened on 10th of October last year, very close to Sydney Airport, showcases the change we're undergoing in our supermarket. There is not a one off flagship exploration of stores and the elements in that store are visible in all the new stores we're opening and retrofitting in existing store base.</p>
          <p>But just to give you a flavor of what we're doing, we're introducing a much more inspiring and a much more covenant purchase offer with great cut fresh fruits. We're having trained sushi chefs on site which prepare great tasting sushi in that store and many stores across the country.</p>
          <p>We've got beautiful fresh pizza as you can pickup, produced already, but you can also again ask for on topping, freshly made in the store and has a butcher giving you advise how to your meat can give you a thicker or thinner cuts and as Greg alluded products to inspire our customers.</p>
          <p>And it is just, not just a one off, this is part of a new generation stores and we keep on innovating fresh food experience for our customers in all the stores we open now and in the future. Our trading result meets that really well help by great value investments, I'll come back to that later but also an ongoing focus on the MSA beef and the MSA lamb, which is juicy and tender all the time. We've also opened more bakeries. Our ambition is to have a warm bread offer, hot bread offer in every single store, which is <mark type="indiscernible" /> on a shelf front. And we're able to add 42 new stores to that bakery ambition in the half and our plan is to have in all of our stores longer term a fresh bread offer, which is key to be able to be Australia's fresh food people. As important as fresh foods, is providing unbeatable value. And I think it's highlighted we've been able to give back to our customers lower prices to the tune of 2.8% on average. But I'd like to call out a couple of big initiatives in the half, which helped us providing more value for our customers. And the first one was in a sort of <mark type="indiscernible" /> year in August reducing the price of quite a few <mark type="indiscernible" /> cuts. 20% to 30% price reduction making Australians. And really result in strong volume growth and we took the margin hit. So our <mark type="indiscernible" /> farmers benefited from strong and much better earnings for them in the half in terms of land sales.</p>
          <p>We continued in October with the focus on reducing prices for Christmas, and we've called this for less for families. We started out with Huggies nappies, Quilton toilet tissue, Fab washing powder and we rolled on and rolled on significant amount of big promotional products and bit staple items all the way until Christmas eve and we've reduced our prices to the tune about $35 million in this campaign. Well, we didn't do just a broad-based approach of providing value. We actually started leveraging our everyday awards significantly more than we've ever done before.</p>
          <p>And we've introduced, mainly in December, three initiatives where we started the customers and given back to them based on their shopping experience and based on their spend with us. We've introduced a new concept which is Cash For, so we are rewarding our customers with a gift cards and with Christmas if you would have shopped three weeks in a row and you would have spent in one week $100, you would get a $20 gift card just before Christmas. And we had massive signups and many, many customers made it all the way to the end spending three weeks in a row $100.</p>
          <p>The people who didn't make it, we gave them more alternatives and they also got a loyalty incentive and they could choose between a petrol offer and gift card offer and also that was very successful. And the last one was to all of our core loyals, the people who visit our stores most frequently, the people who spend most money of their disposable income on food with us we send them a thank you card. A Christmas card from our store manager thank them for the business and that wasn't just a Christmas card. They actually got four weeks in a row great offers to thank them, a box of free chocolates, great discount on hand for Christmas and a very strong discount on the spend in Christmas week. And redemption rates of that cart were significantly both redemption rates we experienced before with a more broad-based approach. So, we're exploring opportunities to connect more closely, to target more precise and we see benefits and we will focus on this and accelerate this significantly more in the future. I said before the focus on shrinkage has helped us to give back 2.8% lower prices to our customers and home brand as an example is the ultimate entry price point in our range and this is an example of the great Aussie made sugar for $1.50 in our stores great value all across categories with Homebrand.</p>
          <p>Continuing on customers, Grant touched it before in his introduction our Category Lab is really important and we have now covered three quarters of all of the ranges with the Category Lab and it really helps us understanding better how our customer shop. We use the information to improve our ranges, improve our programs, improve promotional mix and also in the half we've extended it to Big W and the liquor division with a very successful beer deep dive and we got insights into the beer category we've not seen before with normal point of sale data. And, we'll continue to drive customer insights with our buying teams with using the power of our customer loyalty data. We've used it to targeting campaigns, but we have also done something else. It could sound a bit trivial to give your store manager an iPad, but it was a big change for our store managers, because they were actually spending quite a lot of their in their office behind the desktop and we put most of the applications on that, on their iPads, and they now spend about eight hours a week more on a shop floor versus the previous system. And, we will simplify that more even. We will put more apps on their iPads. We'll change the way we communicate with them through app technology and we'll make sure they spend most of their time &#x2013; the bulk of their time looking after the most important stakeholders in their business, which is our customers and our staff.</p>
          <p>Customer insight is a very big importance for us and there is a lot of insights we use in those decision making processes and you can see behind me what really using, but I can tell you probably the most important one is our score card where the customer segment is of equal importance as a financial <mark type="indiscernible" />. I think that's testament <mark type="indiscernible" /> customer in our company. [Audio inaudible] a beautiful New Gold Easter Egg and I'll talk about it in a second.</p>
          <p>Let's just touch upon smaller products, sushi 18 kiosks at GRN, 21 were now &#x2013; at this stage, we opened three more kiosks, two of which in Victoria. So we've got <mark type="indiscernible" /> in Victoria covered with sushi and the plan is to have close to 50 sushi kiosks all around the country serving great daily meat sushi for our customers. We've added some new ranges to it value element, more hand rolls, more children focused sushi and we've seen great uptake of those new lines in the half. As spoken before pizza bars, five stores now 17 bars planned for the rest of the year. We've got 150 stores with my kitchen. We've got more than 400 stores with new Health &amp; Beauty range. And I would say the great success of our trading has been our own brands. Macro has been an ongoing success, 40% more growth. And we've also introduced something new. We always had a good and better tier in our range of home brands. We had good home brand, better select. And we finally completed the range with our best tier, which is Gold, was launched in Christmas, we had a Christmas pudding, shortbread, fruit mince pie, panattoni and beautiful dim sums in the freezer. And we've now for Easter again launch great lunch of very high quality chocolate Easter Eggs produced by an Australian owned family owned company from Melbourne <mark type="indiscernible" />. And there is a beautiful Easter Egg and hope you enjoy them with your family when you take them home later today.</p>
          <p>We started to launch gold in a seasonal environment, Christmas and Easter. But the plan is to add gold ranges in all of our categories throughout the year and this actually compliments and completes a good best offer and actually tailors offers much better than we've ever done before for our customer. And I think I spoken about an Australian family-owned company producing our Easter Eggs for gold, 92% of all of macro products are produced in Australia, which I think is a good example of how we support this production in this country with focusing on great products for our customers. And again macro is all about choice it's about choice. It's about an organic option, a free range option, natural option or a free from option if you're allergic to Glutton or lactose and it's choice, the famous well known brands don't offer to date and that's visible on the results of the strong growth of macro.</p>
          <p>We continue to tailor our stores, we continue to tailor our options. We focus very much on mobile solutions to do purchases with us. We focus on app development mobile sites, online delivery and a growth of 50% of online sales. It's still a very small share of our overall sales, but a great opportunity to much more in the future and we're focusing very much on fixing the basics and making it easier to shop with us. Our app is really important for us, more than 2 million downloads in supermarkets in Australia and it's a great platform to connect with our customers in a much better way. You can now see your local fuel price. You can now see your fuel voucher and how much you're paying if you would have redeemed your fuel voucher.</p>
          <p>There were Christmas recipes, and in this financial year we will innovate quite a bit more with our apps. I'm also pleased to say we've got 119 locations with Click and Collect all across the country and with the strong ambition to do much more in the future with that. That's all about progress in the strategy.</p>
          <p>A couple of words on petrol to finalize the update on supermarkets and petrol. We've made a very liberate decision as we announced in our sales update to not replicate a broad based offer discount in petrol, in the half we only have 35 days of petrol discounts and other retailers have 90 days petrol discounts. We've really targeted our investment that led to lower fuel volumes, but we also use that opportunity to invest in more target offers with our customers. So, as a consequence our fuel volumes were down, our sales were down, but if you look at the health of that business, with lower fuel volumes actually we're able to make significantly more business, more sales with the stuff you make money on the high margin stuff, which is unknown fuel merchandise sales, which is a very, very healthy sales drop of 5.4% and a comp growth of 0.9, which I think is great result of the commercial team in petrol, but also from a P&amp;L shape very healthy EBIT growth 5.3% up of course helped by targeted investment in fuel discounts, but also benefits from the buying alliance with Caltex more merchandized sales and also a very good strong cost focus.</p>
          <p>That's yielded for the half. We've opened eight more petrol sites in the half, so eight more sites vacant, within your shopper dockets, and there will be eight more sites again opened in the second half this <mark type="indiscernible" /> year.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, that's my update. I would like to give the floor to Mr. Brad Banducci, Director of Liquor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tjeerd, and welcome everyone. As Tjeerd mentioned, I'll look after the Liquor group. And we had a very good half. Before I go into that, actually what you see appear behind you or behind me is a photo of a store reopened on the 19th of December. It was our last store opening for the half. It was store 170 for Dan Murphy's, that's Gladesville store. I don't know if any of you have shopped it yet, but if you haven't, I'd encourage you to go and giving it a go.</p>
          <p>In terms of our sales, this just shows you what the sales were for the half and I think it evidences that we continue to have very strong momentum across liquor. As you look at these numbers, I should call out to you that they include the bar sales in our ALH business, so it includes on-premise liquor sales as well as off-premise. In some ways, these numbers underestimate our performance in that for us in our financial half, new year fell into quarter three. So you don't have new year in this half, but you did have new year in the previous period. It's worth somewhere in the order of about 1% of sales, the impact of having that moves from Q2 to Q3. Quite a pleasing set of sales numbers and what is most pleasing to me quite honestly is that all of our brands delivered strong growth, not only Dan's but our convenience business, BWS and <mark type="indiscernible" />, and direct businesses Cellarmasters, Langton's and winemarket.</p>
          <p>In terms of our progress against objectives, let me quickly go through those. As mentioned, we continue to be very focused on growing and we should actually have the word improving our network. We opened 11 <mark type="indiscernible" /> in the first half. The last one of which was Gladesville and in fact we have opened three in Q3 already. We opened still 173 today in Orange. So we're at 173. We will get to 176 by the end of the year. So 15 net store openings. We closed one and moved in Castle Hill, one Castle Town for those of you who know it. So good strong continued growth in Dan Murphy's.</p>
          <p>In BWS, in the first half we opened 30 stores, but it's very &#x2013; also very important to call out that we closed 15. Our focus in BWS is still to continue to grow our convenience business, but it's essential that we're very disciplined in rationalizing our tail and we did that. So 15 net growth, 30 total stores opened. You see the number of stores, we've got 1,346 as of the end of the half and obviously our growth did benefit from the laundry and related part of transaction that took place with 10 liquor outlets added by the transaction, including one for Dan Murphy, which is our carrying Dan Murphy's for those who you have been down to <mark type="indiscernible" />. So good growth, pleasing momentum in growing and improving our network. We've also been working very hard on improving our store formats and a topic we've alluded to but probably not spoken explicitly about in the past is the initiative we have underway to rebrand our Woolworths Leica stores as BWS stores. We're in the process of moving from having two convenience banners to one. This will significantly streamline the whole way regarding market in terms of promotional calendars, how we manage our teams and importantly give us a platform, the biggest convenience platform by some stretch in Australia that we can then start being a lot more fruitful and deliberate about how we segment as a convenience occasion, which is the key to compete in convenience Leica.</p>
          <p>We started rebranding more with Leica stores as BWS stores in the first week of July. At the end of December, we had done a 176 Woolworths Leica stores. We have about 476 in total that we need to rebrand. Next week we will brand &#x2013; rebrand number 300. So we are moving at an incredible pace and what is possibly certainly my corporate memory, the biggest rebranding exercise, I think undertaken in Australia if you look at breadth of what's going on. So number 300 is next week in Eastgarden <mark type="indiscernible" /> Tjeerd has talked a lot about in town. And we hope to at the end you have done 90% of the rebranding exercise. So, essentially we complete. We still need to take a little territory. So very big exercise that has been going on. And it really is &#x2013; I wouldn't like to overplay what we have done. It's just a very pragmatic exercise. It's about signage. It's about just basic improvements to the Laden store. It's about investing in sales and service in the team that's sort of one of the great streams of BWS and a line in the promotional programs. So, good progress, early days customer acceptance though it seems very positive. So very exciting initially for us. As I say, it is all the most physical effort required in what we're trying to do in convenience, it's arguably the least interesting portion of what we're trying to do, having one vendor is essential for us to start actively segmenting and so that is the key in convenience. As any of you would know, if you shopped at our convenience stores, what you get on a <mark type="indiscernible" /> Street, Mosman Store, is going to be very different to what you are going to get if you've got a convenience liquor store located next to a supermarket, or if you're going to go through one of our country drive through his is a very different propositions and we need quite different strategies ranging and ranging strategies attached to them.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, while the major risks listed on segmentation will come post the rebranding of BWS, we had started at least on the premium stores and we rebranded what we laid out 28 BWSs that we felt had in a more premium demographic and that was achieved by the end of year, and we'll have about 50 of those by the end of the financial year. So at least we're underway on segmentation, but it's a very long way to go.</p>
          <p>Grant referenced multi-option retailers being an essential growth initiative for the group and that's equally important inside liquor and we've been working very hard on our multi-option offers. Both Dan Murphy's which as mentioned is &#x2013; as far as we understand the only fully <mark type="indiscernible" /> enabled retailer in Australia, I think our friends at Masters would suggest that they are the second one, but we got their first, so I'm going to claim it. But we were fully click-click enabled for December. We have got lots of things to learn from click-click I should add, but it &#x2013; it &#x2013; it was a clear statement to our customers that we were innovative and progressive and sales were good out of it, and I say there is a lot of learning, the world of digital is all about learning and reacting quickly, it's all about speed and we've learnt a lot and our click and collect offer will be even better going forward. So Dan Murphy's online, a multi option, we have incredibly strong growth for us in the half, both through our online shop and home delivery but also through click and collect.</p>
          <p>I should also mention <mark type="indiscernible" /> now that in a number of dialogs that you hear about online or multi-option it's very focused on what you're sale is on the store or on the website, there equally important is the fact that increasingly the journey for our liquor customer starts by looking at our website. They look there even if they come to our stores, so people look and make their decisions before they come into the store, so it's essential for us as we're trying to activate our customers that we have a very strong website and at the moment more than 50% of online liquor traffic in Australia either starts or finishes at the Dan Murphy's website. So, that really is the reference website for people shopping for liquor in Australia.</p>
          <p>So I'm very pleased with where we are with Dan Murphy's, we will have also continue to make progress with Cellarmasters and there was really the focus for Cellarmasters was realizing the synergies with the board of Woolworths' group in terms of being involved in everyday rewards as well as Woolworths' shareholders program and that's gone very well. The other brand I should highlight which has had a very strong half for us, but it's a still small part of our business is Langton, we've merged a series of businesses under the Langton's brand which is an incredibly strong brand and is growing very, very quickly, which does indicate the opportunity that exists in the fun-one market in Australia. Again I think sort of few hopeful customers, potential customers in the room for Langton's either the auction or the brokerage business. So, multi-option has grown strongly, we are very focused and need to be focused on sustaining that growth, I mean has I think changed so quickly in that space as you would all know. The last key initiative I wanted to call out on liquor was owning exclusive brand portfolio. Right now, in an exclusive brand portfolio, it's clearly been an initiative that we've had underway for a longtime, but it's changed shape quite dramatically in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>In august of this year, we put together the manufacturing assets we had acquired from Cellarmasters, for those of you remember that acquisition, we acquired a winery business and bottling business and some packaging assets. We had put that together with what was historical private brand business called Woolworths liquor brands, and we have merged them, and a unified management team and rebranded the business as the Pinnacle Liquor Group.</p>
          <p>And, we think that was essential because in order to grow on our exclusive brands, you do need to be a very disciplined brand build. We're about building brands. We're not about building private label. There is a massive difference between those two things, and having them under one structure, we can have the necessary brand discipline that we would like to have on that business.</p>
          <p>So quite a big move for us, a very positive, but obviously very early days again, but very positive in what we seem to be getting out of it. Two of the brands that we launched that is worth calling out, just recently. One was our Sail &amp; Anchor Craft Beer range. Our Craft Beer is a very important growth category for us. It's a much higher category than more commercial beer categories.</p>
          <p>And, we continue to drive that and we have our own brand participation in that Sail &amp; Anchor. So that's great and is produced by Gage Roads, which is a brewery that clearly have large investments, and that I'm sure many of you know.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> was an absolutely terrific wine range we launched. If you haven't <mark type="indiscernible" />, I encourage you to give it a go. It's the Chris Ringland CR and reserve ranges. Chris started at Rockwood and was rated &#x2013; has got more 100 point ratings from Robert Parker than any other Australian wine maker for his own 3 Reverse range of wine, so its an exclusive range with him that has produced at the <mark type="indiscernible" /> of states in partnership with him and bottle <mark type="indiscernible" /> is a great achievement and again just bit <mark type="indiscernible" /> the synergies we can get in five <mark type="ph" /> pinnacle if we work in a team environment.</p>
          <p>So pleasing progress on liquor, but always plenty more to do. I'm just going to briefly touch on hotels, before I pass to Dave Chambers, given that Bruce Mathieson Jr is not with us today. As you can see from the numbers, it was very strong growth in hotels. Hotels by the way had the same issue as off-premise in the same <mark type="indiscernible" /> New Year fell in Q3. As again you would know, is driven principally by two factors. The first is the acquisition of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> last year in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I'll pass over to Dave Chambers to talk about New Zealand Supermarkets.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brad. Good morning or good afternoon, everybody. My privilege to talk about the New Zealand business today. And I just want to make some initial comments about our trading results and then I'll give a bit of an update on our progress against our strategic imperatives. Fifth place of status obviously with sales, and some people might be thinking with only 2.3% sales growth and flat comp, we will not be disappointed far from that. We're really encouraged by sales drive because we grew our customers that we served, we grew the items that we sold, we grew our average basket size in an environment of really low inflation at any point. In fact we strip out cigarette inflation to be quite some deflation in key categories within New Zealand, primarily around milk and milk related products. The result of all that is that we grew that market share quite well against our competitors for both dollars and crucially units sold. That was really important for us.</p>
          <p>GP margin was sustainable and very pleasing. A lot of the things we can foresee the shift from DSD to DC has been a structural shift within our New Zealand business. We've invested in the supply chain that, Grant, already called out. And, we're realizing that investment through GP improvement.</p>
          <p>Shrinkage was down, promotional effectiveness was up, and all-in-all, GP sustainable strong 26 basis points up on last year was very pleasing. Also, extremely pleased with our CODB was down and tough sales growth in a challenging retail environment. We are able to reduce CODB percentage, which was terrific controls right across the business, and really gave us that outcome over an extremely strong EBIT with trading EBIT result plus 8.4% on the prior year.</p>
          <p>Strategic objectives, Countdown continues to grow on an appeal to New Zealand and that's evidenced by brand metrics that we track very closely of net promoter score and brand equity, which leads all of the retail brands in New Zealand. So countdown is on number one for brand equity and number one for any promoter school within New Zealand. In the first half, we also launched countdown for a stories. This was an integrated campaign it involved traditional media or as well as digital media, and really focuses on in season and local projects.</p>
          <p>We have some really great encouraging results particularly for our purchase department, which we say is some &#x2013; some really strong, a true growth over the prior year, since we've launched the countdown fresh stores. This was an integrated campaign. It involved traditional media as we all as digital media and really focuses on in-season and local purchase doing some really great encouraging results particularly for our purchase department which is showing some really strong true growth over the prior year since we've launched the Countdown fresh stores and we expected through the second half and into the financial year, that will build more momentum and really help us to cement the Countdown brand store and the countdown brand strongly in the minds of New Zealanders.</p>
          <p>Our store network has continued to grow. At the end of the half, we had 165 stores. <mark type="indiscernible" /> four stores in the half, and four were under construction, two of those we've already reopened since this &#x2013; this half started, the other two that at under construction will open, that will be offset somewhat by a store that we have closed for redevelopment in Wellington and one of our stores will close when one of the further two stores will open on the half, and we have one underperforming store that will close in this half as well to the extent that it will finish the year with 166 stores. And we're continuing to redevelop the network, where our stores are located, the size of our store, and giving us a much better reach across New Zealand, and going into areas that <mark type="indiscernible" /> have been before.</p>
          <p>Our online business continues to grow extremely well plus 36%. It's being growing at plus 30%, compounding for many years now. A couple of key things I point out from the half. Our team some time ago and what we actually did was to get our online business having exactly the same price as bricks and motor that is really resonating with our customers. So that the way they use the apps, they can do a really quick price check that they knows it online, and pay exactly the same process that would any item on that day in their stores. 200,000 downloads of the app. Compared to how many smartphones exist in the New Zealand's market, that's quite a good uptick. And critically though, it's actually tuning into sales. It's not downloads that we're interested in, but how that actually resonates with customers and actually turns into sales. And, we now have a quarter of stores have online fulfillment <mark type="indiscernible" /> operating in the store as part of their business, all of them with click and collect.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to grow our franchise network. We now have 57 franchise stores and in the half, we open two new format First Choice stores and new format SuperValue store that have been extremely well received by customers, but also really importantly to us by our franchisees. To the point now after many years, there is some underinvestment by our franchisees in the business, we now have a fewer franchisees wanting to redevelop these stores into the new format and <mark type="indiscernible" /> to the business that would bring in terms of growing the sales and profitability, and continue the market share <mark type="audio gap" /> that I think once we get to the full year profit announcement, we'll be able to make some more comment on. The key thing that the whole New Zealand team is focused on is really enhancing our value perception with the New Zealand public to drive our Countdown business further. Now, it's passed over to Julie Coates, from Big W.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I am really pleased to take you through the first half results for BIG W. For the first half of the financial year 2013, the team at BIG W delivered profitable sales growth. Our sales were up 3.6%, 0.7% comp, but our EBIT was up 8.3% in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin increased by 110 basis points due to savings in our freight and outside storage costs from the operation of our new Hoxton Park DC. And also from the increased direct global sourcing volumes that we talked to you about in November 2011. We also made strategic decisions about the use of our promotional activity which we talked to you about at the sales result. These sales and EBIT result was delivered against the deflation of 4.9% in our business. Of course in categories like home entertainment, the deflation was much more than that. Our costs were well controlled. If you take out the impact of the new DC and new stores that we didn't have last year, in fact our CODB dollars were flat on the previous year.</p>
          <p>Our online sales were up 17% for the half, but in fact for the December in the all important Christmas period, our online sales were up 76%.</p>
          <p>In relation to our progress against our strategic objectives, BIG W continues to win on value every day. A high volume key item program across apparel doubled its units in the first half of this year. Our Smart Value brand which you see pictured in front of you continues to resonate strongly with our customers, with units up 225% in the first half. Now remember that this product was largely already in our business. We branded it, packaged it differently and put it in front of the customers. And has assisted us in driving positive customer and unit transactions in the first half. Our new brand campaign which we launched in the middle of the last year, 'Everyone's a Winner with Australia's Lowest Prices &#x2013; Cha-Ching!' continues to go in traction with our customers and the next size of this will be launched later this half.</p>
          <p>Our vision is to be Australasia's leading multi-option discretionary retailer and we're focused on integrating our digital channels with our store network and the best example of this for us in the half was our toy sale, where we launched our transactional app in time for the toy sale. So you could transact on your mobile, but in fact you could do that by scanning a QR code in the catalogue or in fact in a popup store. You could lie by that product online in July and have it delivered in time for Christmas and the process is in the capability that we developed for the toy sale was starting to using other promotions in our business. We remain committed to growing our store network. We opened four stores in the first half and we'll open two in the second and we have plans to open between four and seven stores every year for the next five years.</p>
          <p>So, whilst we're focused on our vision in multi-option, we are also evolving our customer offer through merchandising and range innovation. In our business, innovation and newness in merchandise is a key focus. The Emerson brand in women's apparel was the number two brand in our business at the end of the financial year. You will remember we launched this brand a short 18 months ago. As of last week, it was the number one brand in Big W. And for those of you on the line, on the screen I have a photo of our season launch catalog with all the latest seasons colors and for those of you that are wanting to know, that's maybe white and <mark type="indiscernible" /> pink. And hopefully, you'll notice that I'm dressed in that, which is Emerson today as well. We talked to you at the end of the last full year about launching this half Michelle Bridges and Guy Leech and we've don't that and I'm pleased to report it has exceeded all our expectation. We're really positive about how active business in BIG W as we move forward.</p>
          <p>And while customers rate BIG W have &#x2013; having the best range and in-store shopping experience, we continue to evolve our offer. We have seven stores in our latest format where we've made changes to Womenswear, Menswear and Footwear, in short, we've given them more space.</p>
          <p>We've developed flexible fixturing, we've improved the directional signage and, importantly, we've reduced the cost to build and the cost to operate. And for those that you've are interested, the closest one to here to go and have a look at is Maryland. So whilst we're evolving our customer offer, we're also focused on delivering the full potential of our existing business, we're aligning our offer with our core customer needs whilst delivering improved financial outcome driving more profitable sales.</p>
          <p>We're continuing our focus on gross margin improvement and we're looking to expand our direct sourcing capability and we're making further investments in our merchandise back office and allocation systems that will come to fruition in the second half and in financial year 2014.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're really pleased with the positive first half results and the benefits we're getting from the investments we've made and we'll continue to make in this business.</p>
          <p>I will now hand to Grant who is going to talk about home improvements</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Julie. Just want to make couple of comments about our newest business, our home improvement business before get into the financials, and the overwriting comment in relation to a home improvement business is we &#x2013; we're very pleased with how Masters is tracking. We got seven stores now that have been opened for 12 months, and in every one of those cases they are hitting their numbers, they're hitting their business case, so we are very pleased with that and patents emerging in that were now able to look at with more surety which stores have been open for a little while. We continue to load &#x2013; we continued to roll at our new stores and at the right of that, one every 2.5 weeks, we opened our newest one in Dandenong last week, and we're on track to deliver the 30 stores this year that we said we deliver and we've got 100 stores. So we're still on target to have 100 sites within the <mark type="indiscernible" /> period that the business is up and operating.</p>
          <p>Interestingly for us with the stores we have opened in this half, we've now got a store &#x2013; Masters Stores trading in every state, mainland state that is of Australia and in the ACT. So pleasingly more and more customers around the country are getting access to the master's offer. We also got the only fully transactional online site store that the customers can access and it's enabling us to give even a wider access to the Masters brand for customers. We got a great joint venture with the Lowes group, which is an important part of the home improvement business that we're building. They are very supportive and they are adding tremendous value, have up until this point in time and continued to moving forward.</p>
          <p>Danks business has experienced a challenging half from a sales perspective, and that's consistent with the impact of the dampened demand for building and construction products, and they are trade oriented business. So they have &#x2013; they have been affected by that. We got to update you on our financial performance for the Home Improvement business at the end of the year, but we remain on target for the Home Improvement business to be profitable in 2016. So, without further due, we'll get into the financials of the financial highlights for the first half and ask Tom Pockett to take through those. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Grant. And good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of point in relation to some of the significant items that occurred during the year. Firstly, we are really pleased to create SCA Property Group towards the end of last year. It's $1.4 billion listed trust, which is performing very well for those people &#x2013; for shareholders that participated. The transaction involves 69 properties that transfer to SCA, 65 were sold in this non development properties and they support New Zealand properties to be transferred in. So a very good transaction. It really follows our strategic statements that we're not hold our long-term holder property. Mostly we have been building property assets on our balance sheet. This was a very good transaction to move off $1.4 billion. The other two components that impacted out our balance sheet for the period was the divestment of consumer electronics and for both Australia and India. One is completed 26th November and the other was completed on the 15th October.</p>
          <p>In terms of the balance sheet, just a couple of key points. First the inventory, was up primarily through our investments in Masters inventory, as we build that business. And also our investment in Pinnacle Group as we increase our exposure to private label or develop our private label business in liquor as we have Longbow bread. The other key component is timing issue in relation to creditors. We can cut off our year end just before the actual end of the year, just before the last check run, so both <mark type="ph" /> cash and card <mark type="indiscernible" /> have that component in them. The other key movement in our balance sheet was the fixed assets component, which reflected really the sale of the SEA assets that have been completed to date. And, our net repayable debt was down $1.2 billion, which reflected the cash received from SCA and the creditors <mark type="indiscernible" />. So a pretty good result from the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventory, just a couple of points. We continue to manage our inventory pretty well. We've had new DC, new infrastructure in that business, and we've had record number of new stores. So it's a pretty good result overall. Our closing inventory in days was actually up two days and when you adjust for the home improvement in inventory in the incremental indent as we expand our &#x2013; expand in a more global sourcing are actually down 0.8 days from the prime retail business. So that's pretty good outcome overall.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow, we generated $1.4 billion in cash after dividends that reflected the timing difference on creditors but it also reflected $764 million received from the proceeds of equity rise in SCA, and slightly lower CapEx, however, the CapEx benefit here will be primarily as we forecast for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of shareholder payout, shareholders have really had a good reward in this period. We returned $2 billion, the final dividend last year, the interim we're about to pay, half a billion from the correction of SEI and for those shareholders who said have participated the SEI share process has done extremely well. So very good year of our shareholders. Our return-on-equity as our return on funds employed is 15.5%. If you adjust for the Home Improvement investment, it's 18.2, so that's tracking along pretty well for the half year.</p>
          <p>So on that note, I'll hand it back to Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. Just the outlook and the focus strategy that I outlined at the beginning of the presentation is building momentum in this business and the benefits arising from also the continued investment that's underpinning our profit growth. We remain well-positioned in all of our market segments and we've got a strong and sustainable business model. At the end of financial year 2012, we've provided profit guidance to the market and that guidance was that we would grow in the range of 3% to 6% at a net impact level for a normalized 52-week year, given that this year is a 53-week year for our financial records. And whilst the Australian and New Zealand retail sectors continue to experience some challenging trading conditions, we're seeing good progress against those strategic priorities. And given this growth, we've decided to revise our previous guidance and now expect net profit after tax from continuing operations to grow in the range of 4% to 6% on a normalized 52-week basis, when you exclude the one-off impacts associated with both the CI and the consumer <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>So pleasing progress, keeping step with our strategic priorities and getting the benefit of that we've steady and strategic growth. So we will now take questions. I think, we'll do them firstly from the floor and Shaun's got his hands. We'll do it from the floor and then we'll go to the questions online.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Shaun Cousins with JPMorgan. Just a question possibly for Tjeerd. Can you maybe talk a bit about the gross margin movement in Australian &#x2013; in food and liquor. If we think about your GM were up in 31 basis &#x2013; sorry, your gross margins were up 31 basis points across broader supermarkets, but part of that is because petrol volumes were down, your convenience in the petrol station was up and you also had &#x2013; still a first time contribution of part of Cellarmasters. So can you maybe talk about what happened to gross margins in food and liquor please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Shaun, first of all Tjeerd is getting to his feet, keep getting to your seat. You've nailed the first thing which is the reduced contribution of petrol and the positive effect of that's had on margin, but Tjeerd, do you want to touch on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's basically the answer. The bulk of the gross margin improvement for the total division is because of the impact of the mix. And the minor part of the GP improvement actual is the GP improvement of food and liquor so that the bulk of it's the mix impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, effectively so food and liquor ex-petrol didn't go up &#x2013; sorry -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It went up, but not to the same extent of 30 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe another one. Just in terms of &#x2013; I think at this time six months ago you made the point of that batteries, is it the region maybe you called out correct in terms of I guess your idea of going down to one brand there. What impact did that happen &#x2013; did that have on sales and GP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We didn't actually go back to one brand. So the energized division for the Eveready brand, which is Enterprise and they got the Energizer brand, so effectively still have two brands in category and because the shelf room brand which we share with <mark type="indiscernible" />, actually we got three very strong brands in the category and there was the insight coming out of the lab, where customer struggles with the proliferation of brands and technology, and size of batteries. So we've made <mark type="indiscernible" /> if you go to our stores, it's really easy to buy batteries. And as a consequent of the change, there was no sales impact negative or positive. We saw good customer feedback and we have now implemented that trade in all of our stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So nice sales impact, but positive dollar GP impact, is that fair say that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good mix impact, but the most important region we've done is to simplify the range of customers because they struggled buying &#x2013; with us &#x2013; too many brands, too many technologies, too many sizes, and it's much simpler now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And, just finally, just in terms of Big W, can you talk a bit about the drivers at the gross margin upside there in terms of more direct sourcing and sort of a bit of changes in mix as well to apparel, but also what contribution you got out of effectively taking some freight costs out of COGS into CIDV, because that's somewhat of an artificial changes trying to just used putting a different buckets there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>It's one of the objectives of changes we made in the or adding DC was to reduce freight, and that turns up into GP line. The mix in Big W certainly as soft food areas and apparel being the major part of the soft goods areas is seeing strong growth, and Julie alluded to, particularly the unit growth has been very strong and I think or about of 8% in that business shows that customers are plenty full and they're buying and buying in a value end to meet the MSN brand Julie talked about before being one of the reasons where our units have gone up to the extent that they had. So it's mix, it's also some of the changes associated with the supply chain changes.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of the impact on SCI on that line, it's very small because it only happened towards the end of the year, in fact it's immaterial. That unallocated or corporate line includes the corporate costs and as you know the Home Improvement business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been much change in the corporate cost kind of year-over-year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We manage them pretty tightly. We don't call them out separately, but that's an area where we allow ourselves to spend on looking at future investments and looking at our strategy. So, it does move around a little bit, that's been pretty well controlled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="indiscernible" /> this depreciation in the food and liquor business has reduced, which is a bit surprising given sales have moved up and you obviously rolled out lot of stores. Can you walk us through why that's happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, deprecation in the food and liquor business is a product of reduced refurbishment expenditure post the 2010 investment that we made or the 2010 format investment that we made. We made a significant investment in refurbishments number of years ago and that since then our spend on refurbishments has declined and the depreciation has kept track with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct and there has been a few assets both in food, liquor, petrol and some in New Zealand have come to the end of the useful lives and it's like a point of sale system, and some of the liberty petrol assets that have now fully depreciated et cetera. So it's a combination of the reduced refurbishment spend, and those assets &#x2013; it's actually know that the normal ongoing CapEx when you look back over the last few years to 2008 has actually reduced ran about 9% compound so that's really what's causing that flat depreciation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys. Just &#x2013; first question just in the cause of great result, another great result in terms of cost control, just basically on the food and liquor side of things it looks like space was up, sort of average around 4.8, and you say that there was only <mark type="indiscernible" /> amount. Just wondering if you could give us a feel for what the underlying cost inflation is in that business and effective what I'm trying to understand is how much cost you're actually taking out of this business, and how much more you got to get?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what change <mark type="indiscernible" /> he said is that our cost performance was effectively flat and in this environment I think that's a terrific result because we don't have high levels of inflation that are helping us to fractionalize our costs and we've also had fairly significant increases in some of the utility costs over the course of the year. So that flat result is being achieved even with some of those upside costs effecting not only the supermarket business, but the other business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we be thinking that say, the fixed cost outside the underlying inflation is a safety odd type number, sort of 2.5%, 3%, and that's the sort of level of cost out that you're doing in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our objective is again as we stated earlier is our cost to increase at a lower rate than our sales, and that's our primary objective as part of this strategy in supermarkets that Tjeerd is driving. He's got now a team in, his sole task is cost of doing business and looking for productivity improvements within the business. And lot of the cost results we've got in this half are the early results of that team.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Grant. Just wanted to explore Masters, it looks like the home improvement segment had a loss of somewhere between $60 million and $70 million for that first half. It appears just stepping away from the $80 million loss guidance for the home improvement segment for fiscal 2013. Can you just explain what's change in that home improvement segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So couple of things I called out, one of which was the trade element of the home improvement business which is the banks business, we call that out at sales, sales for the second quarter, bit of a challenging half was experienced by the Danks business, but overall we remain very pleased with the Masters business. We've got seven that are open now, have been open for 12 months and we've got a pretty good read on how they are performing. And I shared this morning that they're hitting their business case which we are really pleased about. And we're still growing and opening stores at quite a right. We haven't pulled out the home improvement numbers, the guidance target that we gave at the beginning of the year, we'll update it at the end of the year. There is a fairly lumpy roll out of stores in the calendar for Masters and it's not helpful to look at that at this point in time. So we will give you an update at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but is there, I mean do you have that view about at a store level win, these stores will get to breakeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah consistent, Craig, with what we have given and the model that was drawn up on the basis of how we experienced start up or maturity curve in the certain markets. I wanted to use for profitability and in the group we set three years to four years and the first group of stores have done nothing to move us from that assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had a question about the food and liquor segment and with petrol discounts. As Tjeerd rightly called it out, there was a much higher level of discounting activity on petrol by competitor, but I think this half, the second half, the extend of petrol discounts offered by Woolworths seems to be matching calls, you got to the discount on up until April. So what's the change in the thinking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the beginning of the year we would on that exchange <mark type="inaudible" /> and we gained on back to school just before the parents and families went back to school and back to work. And we called it out for exactly what it was and that was looking at the cost of living for people and giving them an extra bonus just like we might do in a promotion for plastic wear or something else that's going to help them at that time of the year. So it was done from a customer's perspective, we've decided to take it through until the end of this year and we will be making a decision at that time. But Craig we really looking at that as we looked at it for the second quarter and the beginning of this quarter. We're looking at it and we're looking at the roles it plays. But were also very prepared as we did during December to provide customers without the benefits for shopping with us.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning, guys. Just a question on the hotels business if I can. I think that the guidance that was provided earlier in terms of the uplift from the licensing changes was about $100 million pre-tax, the increase first half from first half looks to be much smaller than what I would have expected there. Can you just explain whether you still think that $100 million is the right number and what to expect in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Mike. The short answer is we expect to deliver on the guidance that we provided, so in short the $100 million that we talked about before is what we expect to bank in this financial year. The changes as you know, didn't occur until the 16 August will commence and what's also been working in the Victorian market at least has been the removal of the ATMs. So we're rebalancing the business from a performance point of view to take into account the effect of the ATMs have had and also with the changeover to the new gaming infrastructure, we are now free to improve the productivity of our gaming assets, so that's what gives us the confidence about being able to hit the $100 million for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's also $30 million of one-off costs associated with The Linde Group in there <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. All right, can I just ask a question more broadly about the group guidance, I mean if I look at the first half performance, there's greater than 6% operating earnings growth, so <mark type="indiscernible" /> impact growth from the sales release, it seems like momentum is improving relative to what it was in the first part of the year. We're also likely to have more benefit from hotels and potentially less Masters office in the second half. Doesn't the guidance look fairly conservative in that context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance we set for the year of 3 to 6 was to take into account the market that we're operating in and it's not the most stable of markets and our guidance reflected that and we wanted to send a message with our adjustment to the guidance of raising the 3 to 4, but not to get carried away and it remains a fairly subdued market. It remains that we have to work really hard to get the benefits and gains that we're getting in this business and it remains that we will take a measured and sensible approach to the guidance that we're giving. So, Michael, it's very much in the same vein as the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Grant and Thomas, sorry couldn't believe that <mark type="indiscernible" /> today. Grant a very broad question involving the productivity or the efficiency across most of your businesses, I certainly understand deflation impacting on fractionalization et cetera but you also had some benefits because you became more efficient in your promotions et cetera which hopefully improved your cost of doing business line.</p>
          <p>My question is with significant CapEx on renovations of stores and world class DCs, I'm just a bit disappointed that your cost of doing business still hasn't got opportunities to come off, I think, Tjeerd said cost of doing business was flat and again I understand all the challenges that you've got. But I would still like to see efficiencies, productivity improvements coming through from the investments that you've been making in the last two to three years. Can you give a bit of an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, fair question. And I head into that with the answer that I gave earlier around some of the cost inputs this year being substantially higher than cost inputs that we've experienced before and the one I called in particular is utilities. That's a pretty big cost in supermarket business as you will know and this is the first trading period where we felt the full effects of that. Despite that cost <mark type="indiscernible" />, we've been able to <mark type="indiscernible" /> costs. So in any other half, any other quarter, any other trading period that would have been a reasonable reduction in cost. Our focus is absolutely where you were describing, and my assessment of both the food and Australia or in the result in New Zealand <mark type="indiscernible" /> result I am pleased with, but it's part of our DNA, we need to stop, and the change that we have got aimed that this will continue to remove the cost and deal point take benefit from the investments form [Technical Difficult] refurbishment and a store point of view. Background, I'm actually quite happy with the cost line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're still getting you know that 20 basis point improvement through efficient teams of it, so you got a &#x2013; fair, you got a fair that the electricity cost probably elective at 20 basis points, would that be a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I like this absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Grant, with liquor, this is probably liquor. At the end of the year or last year, calls really backed off having discounting is particularly be a &#x2013; and that's a support of their earnings, and I surprise that's posted with the old group, with a vastly superior liquor group, you let them off the hook. I mean, in the old days, the &#x2013; was with a certainly I think this phrases when you get your throat on the competitor or when you got your foot on the throat of the competitor you don't let them up. But it seems like that both you and &#x2013; enjoyed significant profit improvement buy reduced discounting. But I just I suppose strategic question, why did you let that happen, why didn't you just drive home your advantage in liquor and really hurt you're your competitor when you had the chance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have. And if you look at the shares, I don't think anyone would describe the share results over the half as letting anyone up on for &#x2013; so from our point of view we have continued to push very hard in both our BWS and Dan Murphy's business. And the proof for me of where I'm going to look for how we're travelling is of course the sales line &#x2013; in the comp line and they've been strong. And, more particularly looking at the share gains that we have seen and how we measuring the market. So there has been no let up. They've changed their strategy and that's their business. It hasn't changed how we run our business.</p>

          <p>Hi, Grant and team. Two questions from me if I may. Grant, I'm interested in your thoughts on the group ACCC investigation that's underway where it seems to have been in the press and <mark type="indiscernible" /> estimates committee about having <mark type="indiscernible" /> confidential, in talking about potential misuse of <mark type="indiscernible" /> and unconscionable conduct by ADS also of course, have you conducted your investigation internally to ensure that you're <mark type="indiscernible" /> clean and what you're your views as to the potential impact on the business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, you have been carrying all this business for a while and I think you not to be business that has fairly all high standards and systems and process that support those standards. We don't have to do anything in reaction because anyone who takes up a position of responsibility, and always was given the right training, given the right tools to do that job and that goes <mark type="ph" /> for by, that goes for operational managers and the like so. So, we have got confidence in the compliance and the levels all the expectations we have with people operating now in our business. And our focus therefore can be on doing the business and serving customers. And so, if you're confident to doing the right thing, you can get on and concentrate on delivering for customers and that's what we do. <mark type="ph" /> Our guys get out a bit everyday in order to following ways to improve the lot of the customer and that's what they're able to do and that's what they're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I understand what you're saying though primarily on a company wide basis, but every supermarket has that instances where buyer specifically have gone off to reservation. So I'm wondering whether you've &#x2013; are extending your terms or you're extending to comfortable, but that's not going to be the case here, which is good. On BIG W, Julie, can you give us a feel as to where you're seeing your consumer at the moment? Are you seeing them being willing to spend more and high price ticket items, and how you're planning to benefit from a improvement and consumer confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main number I looked at and called out in the BIG W result and Julie can add to this was the 8% lift in unit sales and the strong customer lift in the BIG W business. That says the customers are out there and they are spending and they continue to be careful <mark type="indiscernible" /> for value. And I think that's what Julie is saying. Is there anything that you are interested at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what we're saying is they're absolutely looking for value and you can see that in our smart value brand and in our key item program.</p>

          <p>Hi guys. Just a question around CapEx, I know you've given some guidance there <mark type="indiscernible" /> but maybe if we look at it we'd pass that, property developments seems 600 to 900. At what point, should we expect do they come off?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, as <mark type="indiscernible" /> we mentioned this previously Phil. We're going through a <mark type="indiscernible" /> approvals that we received about a year ago. So we had a pretty good new store roll out last year and we'll have another really good new store roll out this year particularly in supermarkets, and then it should return to more normal levels of store roll out and hence development going forward after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that &#x2013; I mean, like adding $11 &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> which were more like 600 rather than a 900 odd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look it's forecasting that number is difficult because you can never know the mix between development and development led sites. So I wouldn't want to predict that but we should see it reduce over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you seen any change in the developer market that gives them a sort that it may &#x2013; they may also &#x2013; be ability that they will come back and step in. So you don't have to do as much on your book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at the moment, but I don't think there has been too much change in the economic conditions to want that it's really a banking issue and I would say it would be another year or so before we see developers come back in. When we see the big property trust here in Australia starting to redevelop these tenders I think that will be a pretty good sign.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Julie, answered my question &#x2013; so I have a question with CapEx, but just in terms of the potential divestments obviously SEI went very well in terms of your ability to offload a lot of property. Is there any expectation on behind improvement side making a similar move in the near future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, we don't have any short-term plans to do that out. In fact what we communicated at the time that the SEI was created was that once Masters was a fully functioning and larger portfolio, in other words when it was &#x2013; it's 100 stores or maturity then that something that we would certainly look at that stage, but not beforehand.</p>

          <p>And just on a another topic just in relation to Dan Murphy's online, it appears to be doing tremendously well. We've heard from a number of people in the industry just saying the sales have been explicit, I'm just wondering have you been able to tap into a new market, are you being able to sell far more successfully to for instance trade through the Dan Murphy's online offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask that &#x2013; I will answer that generally then to &#x2013; Brad's got anything that he wants to add to that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been really pleased with the uptake of Dan Murphy's online, and totally in the lead up to Christmas. The online business, both the search and the transactions have been above expectations, but &#x2013; and as a result of being really pleasing, I don't think there's been a huge uptick in orders that would be described as trade from what we can tell with the data. But Brad, do you want to just add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure going to add. The trade, trade is not big for us online, but what has really helped us, what really helped us in the run up to Christmas was gifting. And so that's really important category for us and that category moderated quite effectively online and there would have been clearly some corporate gifting in those numbers. So that was part of the real rent and the benefit we got going into Christmas.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And at this time we have no further questions over the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'll just ask if there are any further questions in the room. Can't see it. So all its left is to thank all of you that joined us online and also particularly thank those that have joined us in the room for the half year profit announcement and look forward to having a chat with you afterwards. Thank you.</p>
