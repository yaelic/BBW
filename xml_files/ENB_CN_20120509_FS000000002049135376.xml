          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Enbridge, Inc., First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Jody Balko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pam. Good morning and welcome to Enbridge, Inc.'s first quarter of 2012 earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, Chief Executive Officer; Al Monaco, President; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; and John Whelen, Senior Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>This call is webcast, and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides which are available on our website. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p>The Q&amp;A format will be the same as always. The initial Q&amp;A session is restricted to the analyst community, and once completed, we will invite questions from the media. I would also remind you that Jonathan Gould and I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions that you may have.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we may refer to forward-looking information during the call. By its nature, this information applies certain assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, so we remind you it is subject to the risks and uncertainties affecting every business, including ours.</p>
          <p>This slide includes a summary of the more significant factors and risks that might affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings available on both SEDAR and EDGAR systems.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat Daniel.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, thank you, Jody, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for a review of our first quarter results. Earlier today, as you are probably aware, we were pleased to announce that our adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $376 million or $0.50 a share. This represents an increase of 14% relative to quarter one, 2011, and it reflects strength right across our businesses.</p>
          <p>I'm going to let, Richard, provide a more detailed reconciliation of each segment in his comments in just a moment. The results of this quarter put us firmly on track to achieve adjusted earnings within our guidance range of $1.58 to $1.74 per share for the year. Reaching the midpoint of that range would represent a 12% earnings per share increase over our actual results in 2011.</p>
          <p>2011 was also a stellar year for us in terms of business development success. We added over $8 billion of growth projects across the full enterprise. And with the upsizing of our Gulf Coast access initiative earlier this quarter, we're now well on our way to having another very successful year in new business development. In fact, it started out very well. Our success has come at a faster pace than we forecast in the long range planning process that we went through last year.</p>
          <p>Although our overall universe of prospects over the next 10 years hasn't changed, we have one more business and increased probability of winning even more from when we put that forward. So, we've now increased the total of our commercially secured and risk projects from $20 billion to $26 billion. Of course, this increase in our business development outlook means even more shareholder value to be added going forward and as well, Richard, will update the related funding requirements associated with that increase by in a minute.</p>
          <p>Lastly, what I wanted to do is just to briefly provide an update for everyone on the status of the leadership transition from myself to Al. And as you may have read a couple of months ago, I will retire on or before the end of the year this year and I'm pleased to say that the hand-off is going very well. I've started to step back from day-to-day operations of the company, focusing more on transitioning over the relationships that I've developed throughout the years.</p>
          <p>And I've said this many times before but I believe that we have the best and the deepest management group in the business and I'm extremely confident that this will be continued to be a seamless transition. We also currently have in place the strongest long range plan in the history of the company and we've got the team to execute on that and also to lead the company into the next stage of its development.</p>
          <p>So with that very brief introduction, let me hand it over to Al now to provide some more detail around recent initiatives that we have underway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the activities, let me first outline the priorities that I and the rest of our senior management team will be focused on, given the transition that Pat referred to.</p>
          <p>First and foremost is to ensure the safe and reliable operations of our system. Now, that's sounds a little bit everyday, but we need to keep doing that right as it's critical to our customers, the public, our staff and ultimately it drives shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Given the massive capital program in front of us that's already been secured, our priority is execution that goes from design to construction to funding it to the resources that make it happen. We have a lot of people to hire and we've made some good progress on that already in the first quarter. If we do that well and we are confident we will, then we're very confident that we can generate 10-plus percent earnings per share growth over the planned horizon, I'll come back to that point in a minute.</p>
          <p>With that and with the strong cash flow generation over the next five years, dividend growth will follow. At the same time, we'll continue to develop new sources of earnings that will extend growth beyond the next five years in other areas of our business, aside from liquids pipeline. We'll maintain our disciplined approach to capital investment. That's been a hallmark of our company for quite a while. And finally, we'll have a strong financial position and what I mean by that is well-capitalized, ample liquidity, and strong credit ratings.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the next slide, let me outline the progress on three fronts, two which relate to the Liquids Pipelines business that will be the main growth driver for us in the next few years. Even though the rest of the business is growing, it's certainly being overwhelmed by the growth in the liquid side of our business.</p>
          <p>In the last six months, we made excellent progress on one of the most strategic initiatives our company has ever undertaken and that is establishing a new and much needed corridor to the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market. Gulf Access relieves bottlenecks arising from an unprecedented growth outlook for North American oil production, including the oil sands and new shale oil plays. This, I think, is the new game changer in North American energy. Gulf Access also reduces U.S. dependence on overseas imports. Now, after the initial Seaway in Flanagan South announcement in Q4, we were able to garner even more commitments to a point where upsizing both of those segments made sense.</p>
          <p>All in all, by mid 2014, we'll have established a path from Chicago to the Gulf for some 800,000 barrels per day to 900,000 barrels per day of capacity with low cost expandability beyond that. In fact, the first 150,000 barrels per day of Seaway capacity comes on stream next week, May 17, to be precise at this point, ramping up to 400,000 barrels per day by year-end.</p>
          <p>There are a few keys to this initiative coming together successfully, certainly having a good partner like Enterprise for the Seaway portion was important, as well as our ability to move quickly to address the Cushing glut and the resulting impact on producer prices. There is of course a double discount to market prices today at Canadian versus WTI and then of course WTI to Brent.</p>
          <p>It also illustrates the power of our large scale system and our CTS toll structure, which allowed us to offer competitive fixed tolls for customers. Importantly, we've utilized existing right-of-way and infrastructure to minimize the impacts.</p>
          <p>Just finally on this point, our Gulf Coast Access initiative is impactful at $5 billion plus of capital invested and linking that back to my initial comment around investment discipline, Gulf Access fully meets our investment criteria with low-double digit full life return on equity. And it comes down to long-term take-or-pay commitments as well supporting the project.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, another important initiative that we are pursuing is eastern access, which is also driven by evolving supply and demand fundamentals. The biggest factor on that front is the significant increase in light oil both from the Bakken and Western Canada. At the same time, we've seen refinery capacity conversions to heavy and that's in the PADD II area, which means the light barrel needs to find a home to retain its value and a good spot for that is certainly Michigan, Ohio, and then of course the Ontario refineries. And lastly, refineries are clamoring for alternative feedstock to Brent-based crudes.</p>
          <p>We've commercially secured the first step of our strategy by expanding Line 5 and a reversal of Line 9 from starting it to Westover, which should be in service next spring.</p>
          <p>Now, no new pipe is required for this expansion. And once again we capitalized on the CTS toll structure. There are several other initiatives under development to fill out the strategy, namely increasing capacity on Line 6B, expanding Line 17, and accessing the Quebec market.</p>
          <p>The total investment by Enbridge and Enbridge Energy Partners here could total some $2 billion plus. So this would also result in a meaningful impact to our company. We're making very good progress on commercial discussions, so please stay tuned on that front.</p>
          <p>Also this quarter, we announced $200 million investment in the 50-megawatt Silver State North Solar facility in Nevada we just opened up. This marks our first entry into solar in the U.S. and the project aligns very well with our renewable business model. That facility was essentially operations ready, so there was no construction or permitting risk. The solar resource in this part of the U.S. is very strong and we have a 25-year PPA that underlies the investment, pretty much then dead center of the Enbridge investment triangle that you are all familiar with. Along with our Cedar Point Wind investment in Colorado and our recently announced Lac Alfred project, we'll have successfully diversified our renewable portfolio and opportunity set. We've now reached about 1000 megawatts of capacity in operation or construction.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I mentioned earlier that a key priority of the management team was the top-notch execution of the capital program and that's simply because when you're putting this kind of capital into the ground with the magnitude that we have, it's critical that we get that part of the equation right. Our major project's execution function has resulted in success so far, and has been important factor in helping us win new business.</p>
          <p>We currently have shovels in the ground for about $14 billion worth of projects and inventory, and the slide that you see here is just outlining some of our liquids projects under construction within service dates before the end of next year. And as you can see here, we are very much on time and on budget with the program, in fact below budget in most cases.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond, there are projects within service dates two years out to 2014. We have a Walker Ridge and Big Foot on the offshore Gulf. Procurement continues on that and planning is on track to put the pipe into service near the end of next year.</p>
          <p>We're also underway with Flanagan South, where land auctioning is proceeding well, and engineering is underway, and Enterprise is beginning work on the Seaway Twin. Further out, we filed our regulatory application this March and execution planning is underway now with the $1.2 billion Athabasca Twinning project secured for 2015. We will continue to keep you up-to-date on the progress of the program, given as I said, the size and importance of the capital we have in front of us.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my section by illustrating the earnings impact of the capital project inventory that Pat mentioned on our five-year plan horizon and beyond that, at least at a high level here, it's pretty much the same as you've seen before except with &#x2013; I'd say, a positive bias now on our longer term outlook. To reiterate, because of the additional secured investments we have, which now total $14 billion, we're very confident in achieving a long-term EPS growth rate of 10% plus through 2015.</p>
          <p>One of the things that gives us confidence is the structure of our CTS agreement which is bearing fruit as you've seeing on the mainline and liquids throughput borne out over the last three quarters. And the advantage it provides in extending our system, as you've seen with both the Gulf Coast Access and Eastern Access. These projects contribute nicely to mid decade EPS growth, but their contribution builds as additional volumes come and revenues continue to grow. So, I would say, a relatively stronger EPS pickup in the second half of the decade.</p>
          <p>So with that Richard is going to take you through the financial results and the funding position in a little bit more detail around the EPS profile longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, good morning. I'll start on slide 14 with a review of the segmented earnings. Liquids Pipelines had a strong quarter, both relative to prior year and even a little stronger than we were expecting. That strength is primarily from the mainline under CTS and the reason is higher volumes.</p>
          <p>In terms of full year implications, we don't see mainline volumes remaining as strong as Q1, but stronger than expected at guidance time. So, for liquids pipelines as a whole, the very strong year-over-year uplift anticipated at the time of our guidance call is on track and trending even a little stronger.</p>
          <p>Next, we come to Gas Distribution our guidance for the full year was flat for this segment. EGD's first quarter was consistent with this picture with a small increase from prior year, which is largely timing effects that will likely reverse in subsequent quarters. The unusual result is the big increase in Gas New Brunswick.</p>
          <p>On a full-year basis, we expect earnings will decline to about 40% of the $20 million we earned last year at Gas New Brunswick and that's due to the rate reductions imposed on us by the provincial government. We anticipated part of this in our guidance, but not all of it. However, one of the consequences of the government's action is that, we no longer account for this business under rate regulated accounting and as a result of the quarterly profile of rate revenue, we actually earn more in the first quarter than we will in the full year and in fact $6 million more than in the first quarter of last year, so this first quarter effect will more than reverse out in the remaining three quarters.</p>
          <p>Gas Pipelines, Processing and Energy Services is tracking consistent with our expectation that it will be slightly down from 2011 on a full year basis, largely because we don't see a repeat of the exceptional energy services location arbitrage opportunities that characterized the early part of last year. The new renewable assets in this segment are making up for those transferred to the income fund as expected.</p>
          <p>Sponsored Investments are showing a good year-over-year growth as expected with the income fund contribution up strongly due to the drop down of the renewable assets last year and Enbridge Energy Partners contribution benefiting from increased earnings both, from both its liquids pipelines and gathering and processing business.</p>
          <p>The Corporate segment started off the year consistent with expectation, so altogether as Pat indicated, we are firmly on track with our full-year guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, as I indicated on our last call, we have continued to be active with both equity bolstering actions and other liquidity building actions in support of our large suite of attractive investment opportunities. On the equity side, we placed over a $1 billion of preferred shares in the first quarter, though the US$200 million issue hadn't actually settled by March 31st. And we're also expecting a little over $300 million from our share of the proceeds from the sale by Noverco of $22.5 million Enbridge shares.</p>
          <p>We issued $500 million of medium term notes out of the Enbridge Income Fund, which was used to repay the temporary loan from Enbridge related to the 2011 renewables drop down and we closed $1.25 billion expansion of our bank credit facilities and expect to close a further $1 billion in the next few weeks, which will bring our total general purpose corporate lines to $11 billion with corresponding available liquidity of approximately $8.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The next slide is an update to our Enbridge, Inc. funding requirements picture to reflect the very successful business development quarter, which Pat and Al have already discussed. And as I discussed on our last call, although at that time we were still working from $17.7 billion five-year capital plan, it was beginning to appear increasingly conservative and we had already begun building flexibility to accommodate a significant upsizing of the plan and we have continued to build additional flexibility since. The tipping point was the successful Gulf Coast open seasons driving the upsizing of Flanagan South, the twinning of the Seaway system together with further progress on a number of other projects as well.</p>
          <p>In the normal course, our five-year capital plan is good for about a year, and it's updated in conjunction with our strategic plan in our annual Enbridge Day's Review. This year because we have been so successful with business development, we've done a mid-cycle revision to the plans and that's what's depicted on the slide.</p>
          <p>We've increased the total secured growth capital at Enbridge Inc. to $11.8 billion as a result of the most recent project announcements. However, based on what is in the wings, we have also revised the risked growth capital we now expect to invest over this timeframe to $8.5 billion, up from $3.7 billion on our last call. So the total expected funding required is growing from the $17.7 billion figure at Enbridge Days to a current estimate of $23.5 billion. And just to be clear these number are for Enbridge Inc. alone that's a subset &#x2013; it's most of, but it's a subset of the enterprise-wide capital figures that Pat showed earlier that included the portion of the investment within our sponsored vehicles.</p>
          <p>This translates at the equity level to a gross equity requirement over the five years of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Most of this is already taken care off. But, we have moved back into a small net equity requirement position compared to the surplus we had previously built up. The equity requirement is quite small and well within the capability of the supplementary equity sources available to us. So even though, we substantially upsized our expected capital program, we are very comfortable, we can fund it given the balance sheet capacity and bank liquidity we've already put in place.</p>
          <p>I'll finish up on this next slide with some information on the economics of our $5.2 billion Gulf Coast Access initiative and how it factors into the long-term EPS growth outlook, which Al has already touched on.</p>
          <p>The starting point is to clarify that the base contribution from the CTS excludes any barrels which could be pulled through by market access initiatives. As we indicated when we first discussed the CTS, the agreement reinforced our confidence in achieving a 10% average EPS growth rate through mid-decade, but the real gravy for the CTS will be in the second half of the decade as base volumes grow.</p>
          <p>With regard to the $5 billion Gulf Coast Access initiative, when we provide guidance on the return on this capital, it includes the mainline CTS pull through volumes. In particular it includes the benefit both of the increased mainline throughput above our base CTS assumptions and it also includes the international joint toll discount we provide on the full trip.</p>
          <p>It is the incremental mainline revenue which makes the Gulf Coast initiative financially attractive, which is why we have been saying that the CTS facilitates new market access projects. The all-in return we expect including the mainline benefit is our typical low double-digit full life DCF return, though recognizing that this is not a cost of service model, so the return profile has an upward tilt, from high single-digits in 2014, ramping up to the full life return by 2020.</p>
          <p>The key point here is not to double account the project benefits, by including incremental CTS benefits in addition to the return on the capital. With the 2014 in service date and an upward tilted return profile, the investment will be modestly accretive by mid decade, hence we are now indicating 10% plus in terms of growth. But like the base CTS, the real juice from the Gulf Coast Access initiative will come in the latter half of the decade.</p>
          <p>And that's it from me. Back over to Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. So maybe I can just very quickly summarize. First thing, we are very pleased with the start of 2012, well on our way to achieving our earnings guidance target for the year. Secondly, we've continued to have exceptional business development success and we're also increasing our overall expectations for future success and going forward. And, very importantly we are positioning our funding capabilities accordingly. Lastly, we remain very confident that we can achieve an annual growth rate in EPS averaging 10 plus percent through 2015, and we are increasingly confident and being able to continue that growth trajectory into the latter half of the decade.</p>
          <p>So, that's concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'd now ask the operator to open up the phone lines to take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Linda Ezergailis with TD Securities. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations on a strong quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Linda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have some questions with respect to &#x2013; follow-up questions with respect to your slide 16 funding requirements. When I look at the $4.8 billion growth in risked capital since your Enbridge Day and your latest Q4 guidance on that, where might we expect or where do you think most likely we will see any announcements over the next 12 to 24 months with respect to geography whether it's Canada, U.S., the international or business segment whether it would be power, liquids or maybe gas midstream? And then, how might we think of your views on the attractiveness of building assets, buying assets or potentially doing a corporate transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. That's a &#x2013; it's a very broad question Linda, let me take a quick run at it, and Al feel free to step in and supplement it. And I am going to be cautious because I don't want to preannounce, because you're asking us to kind of look forward and say where the growth will be coming. As we indicated in the script, we are working right now on eastern access and improving access to both existing Montreal refineries and possibly to the East Coast at some point for Canadian crude oil.</p>
          <p>So I think you can expect that to continue to be a strong area of development and growth for us. We are very active in the corridor from Fort McMurray down to Edmonton, both in terms of crude movements out and diluent supply in. So I think you could expect some new business development through there. At this point based on what we see, we have announced everything in the foreseeable future for Gulf Access, so that kind of covers of the liquid side of the business. There will be some ancillary possibly storage and other initiatives associated with that.</p>
          <p>When we turn to the gas side of the business, we continue to be very aggressively pursuing other midstream opportunities in Canada as a result of the successful win on the Cabin project, so you could potentially see something there. Our Anadarko area continues to grow very significantly in the U.S., so gathering and processing associated with those liquids rich streams. And the renewable side, I think it's fair to say that our focus is primarily in the U.S. right now, but I think it's quite possibly you're going to see something coming along there. And Al what if I missed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that pretty much covers it Pat. I think maybe just to emphasize what you said about Eastern Access as I said in my remarks that the first couple steps in our strategy there have already been announced and there's a few more shoes to drop, so probably emphasize that. We've got good focus on the oil sands corridor which Pat mentioned, maybe just to add on a couple of things on the gas distribution front as well, I think that's probably the only one that you missed there Pat. We've got some good opportunities there in terms of enhancements to the system, so that continues to be favorable.</p>
          <p>I might just make a comment, I think one of your questions when there was around any potential for corporate transactions, I think pretty clear that we look at absolutely every opportunity out there. We've got everything modeled up and we're very focused on keeping track of what's out there. I will say though that every time we look at opportunities in that area, we're looking at a corporate deal, it becomes very difficult for us simply because the base plan that we have is so robust in terms of our growth rate that most things that we look at would end up diluting that growth rate. So, we're very cautious on that, not to say that we're not always on the lookout for good opportunities that might come up, but very hard to make some of those larger deals work without diluting our growth rate. So, I think that addresses what you're getting at in the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Also -- so does that mean that the probability of a mainline expansion would be lower for the liquids business over the next 24 months and I guess maybe you can also comment on international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, first of all with regard to mainline expansions those will be kind of in proportion to the extensions that we do. As you we extend to the Gulf, we have to expand the mainline to accommodate the volumes similarly Eastern Access so. And then, sorry what was the second part of that question Linda?</p>

          <p>International, the only reason why I didn't mention international is that we wouldn't see anything imminent, your question implied something a little more short-term, but we are very pleased with the way things are going on this project we're evaluating in Colombia that we've mentioned before looking at moving production from the Llanos area out to the Pacific Coast via pipeline. We're working with a consortium down there sharing the development cost, but there is nothing eminent there is a fair bit of work yet to be done in that project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks very much. Richard, you talked about having bolstered the flexibility on the debt and equity sides of the balance sheet. And you have a small equity requirement over the next couple of years, is it safe to say that you'd be looking still to strengthen the balance sheet or the equity side of the balance in the near-term or have the actions you've taken so far this year been sufficient to make you comfortable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that you will see additional equity bolstering actions and additional other liquidity bolstering actions as we move ahead. We do need a little more equity as the chart indicates. We've got lots of alternatives to source that, but you can expect to see us move ahead on that and we won't wait a long time for that. We'll continue to try and move ahead with that on a measured piece.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I believe in the opening comments, it was mentioned that the mainline volumes through the balance of the year might be down slightly from Q1. Can you give us some thoughts about what the drivers of the volumes are for the balance of the year? Well, that's the first question, I'll come back a follow-up on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, are you sure you like to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think in the beginning -- in the first quarter we had a bit of a perfect storm in terms of refineries pulling strongly in PADD II, because of differentials in much more crude being sucked down in our system. And also some refinery turndowns in Western Canada that meant they weren't processing crude, so they were sending it along. So we expect to see some of that actually reverse and go in the other direction with those refinery turndowns coming later in the year -- sorry coming back up and therefore chewing up that crude in Western Canada. So it's just -- it's just really a number of anomalies in the first quarter, that will reverse in subsequent quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's fair to say that overall volumes on the year are up, it's just that we wouldn't want you using the first quarter as the run rate for the full year Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you, thanks. And longer term, can you talk about the potential impacts of increasing U.S. crude production, how that might impact, do you have any concerns that that might impact the ability to grow the volumes coming out of Western Canada, going into the U.S. Gulf Coast, is that a concern of yours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say it's a concern Paul, as a matter of fact, it's probably an opportunity as much as anything, growing U.S. production in the various sources of that growing production require infrastructure in order to direct it to existing refining markets. And we don't want to expect the rate of growth of U.S. production whether it's from the Bakken, Eagle</p>
          <p>Ford, Niobrara, even the Permian in West Texas now would in any way push out Canadian crude. The U.S. requirement for crude is still strong, although not growing as rapidly as it once was that we don't expect any push back with regard to Canadian crude. So, I think it's probably more opportunity in terms of infrastructure development for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to tag onto that, I think Paul, certainly with the size of the Gulf Coast refining market at 8 million barrels a day, that certainly bodes well for Canadian volumes, and particularly when about half of that is related to heavy oil refining capability, which as I said earlier, the U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are scrambling for so that as Pat said, bodes wells for Western Canadian crude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the last question on this line. There's been some commentary in the industry about the potential for reversing the cap line to access the Eastern Gulf Coast, is that an area of interest, is that a project of interest for you, if you were to buy it, or if you want to acquire it and reverse it, could you benefit from such a reversal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are watching that very closely Paul, and yes, we definitely could benefit from it, because we think we are -- our Southern access project -- our Southern access extension project from years ago would be a logical feed to a reverse cap line. So there are issues to be resolved around existing refineries along cap line, and where they get their crude from, but we're watching and monitoring that one very closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would that be a potential project of interest for you to acquire?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To participate in, yes, it definitely could be that allowing access of Canadian crude to the Eastern Gulf is something that we have looked at on a number of occasions. And so, yes it would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm trying to understand a little bit more sort of this <mark type="ph" /> 5.17 (38:51) and how to model the Gulf Coast access, should we think about this as a slower ramp in volumes based on the commitments that you've actually received and therefore a financial ramp or you said that the pipeline capacity is fully contracted out. I'm just trying to understand financially if you're also going to be receiving the full tariffs and the full volumes immediately or if there is a ramp because of as oil sands production comes online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, you want <mark type="ph" /> to answer (39:20)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There is a ramp in both volumes and in toll. So in some cases those commitments are for the full amount, day one of the commitment, in other cases the commitments do ramp up over time, and the combination of those and of just normal project economics for an unregulated project is what produces that ramp up in the annual returns. It doesn't really look much different than &#x2013; the steepness of the ramp doesn't really look much different than it would in many of our Alberta oil sands regional projects, so sort of from the high single digits to the low double digits over a course of 4 or 5 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, that's on the returns itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on the volumes, I guess every 60% fall to start going to 90% or kind of ballpark, what kind of volumes are you seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that detail at my fingertips, but I think as granular as we get with the disclosure on a commercial project like that is, returns in the high single digits to start with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think if I got your question right, Ted, you may be referring to the Seaway segment which we do see pretty much running full. 60%, you may be referring to is what's initially committed in the first year, but of course the commitments ramp up significantly after that. I'm not sure if that was what you were getting at, but <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:02) part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. No, we can just do it off the returns, I was just more curious about the volume size, that's fine. And then, how do you think about &#x2013; because there is this ramp in the sort of earnings, how do you think about that in terms of the balance sheet and credit metrics, I mean, do you feel like the agencies will give you some credit towards a bunch of upfront capital for call it a ramp in earnings and EBITDA over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think just to answer very generally, Ted in the past there has been certain amount of forbearance from the rating agencies, but remember, we now have significant cash flow from the big waves of invested capital from the past, such that their FFO-to-debt metric is much more favorable than it was back at the time that we went through that first round of reinvestment, but Richard could maybe comment more specifically on rating agency discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So we go through the numbers with the rating agencies on a pretty regular basis, Ted, not necessarily project-by-project, but in terms of the aggregate picture and even at low, high single-digit, returns when those projects come into service. They are accretive to the credit metrics right out of the box. So there is no relation from a credit metric perspective with that return profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then, my other question was on just some of the changes on the &#x2013; some of the pipeline permitting processes, this Responsible Resource Development Act, I'm wondering any impact do you see from that in terms of the process with Gateway or maybe comment on that and then would there be any increased maintenance capital we should be thinking about in terms of more inspections and whatnot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know whether, Richard or Al, whether you are able to comment on the Responsible Development Act and impact. At this point, I don't think we see there being a significant impact as a result of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's right, Pat generally. And then to get to your point around Gateway, I think the process there has been pretty much defined, which we're &#x2013; as you know right in the middle of. So, I think we are very transparent of what we need to do there. We don't see any impact on that particular project. As far as the maintenance side of the equation I think we've taken everything into account that we see from regulatory point of view, more importantly, though our own initiatives to put the required capital into maintenance for the system wide is being done. So, I don't think we'd see anything that's material to affect the profile that we had already in our plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning everybody, nice quarter. Hey, couple of questions if I could on the Gulf Access, Flanagan South. And the first is, is it possible &#x2013; are you able to split out on the initial 590,000, 600,000 barrels a day of capacity, how much of that is actually being taken up by Bakken volumes versus Canadian crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've got the data to do that, Carl. As you know, we work from shipper commitments and they don't tell us necessarily what they are going to be shipping, so I don't think we've got a good breakout on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate that. And the second question on that. Nice to see sort of the mid-2014 timeline reaffirmed, but if there is any one critical factor we should be looking at as potential friction point, I mean, I know there is a host of approvals that the standard course need to be done, but I didn't know if there was any one thing that stuck out more than anything else, as potentially something to watch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take a shot at that one. As you mentioned, there's nothing really from a regulatory point of view that is unusual along that route. It's Corps of Engineers that's required for permitting as well as state approvals and we'll obviously be focused on getting those, nothing unusual on either of those fronts. So I think we're proceeding along. The other part of it, of course is most of the routes for Flanagan South is in existing rights-of-way. There is a couple of areas where we're diverting from that which we're optioning up. But on the whole, I think we're pretty comfortable.</p>

There was a number thrown out, potentially $2 billion of capital, and what I didn't know if there was any way to sort of parse that between Enbridge and EEP at this point? And then ultimately what the final capacity or targeted capacity is to get to Montreal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I'll take the first shot at it. No, I think that the $2 billion plus number that I referred to was for the combined projects. So there really isn't a split at this point that we are going to talk about. As far as the capacity, I guess maybe the best way to think of it is ultimately into the Ontario market, Line 9 initially would have commercial volumes on to Westover in that 100,000 barrels per day range, but ultimately Line 9's capability is in the range of 250,000 barrels per day of capacity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then last question, if I could. And this speaks partly I think to Linda's question earlier on just overall M&amp;A and appreciate that you guys are looking at everything. And, specifically I was wondering, did you guys take a hard look at the Cayman project in the Marcellus? And I only ask, because I am trying to get a sense of, as we look at midstream as one of the potential growth levers going forward are projects of that magnitude very much in play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I'll take a first attempt at that one. We did have a look at that opportunity. As you know, it was very large, and it was located in obviously the Marcellus, which is very attractive generally. So, the answer is we'd certainly like to build out the NGL footprint. That opportunity really didn't fit that well given its profile for our partnership in the U.S.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kuske with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I guess this question is for Al. And, in part because, Al, a few years ago you held the title of being the head of major projects, and obviously the skew of projects has changed over the last few years. You still have some multi-billion dollar projects, but in general projects are a lot smaller from a dollar value standpoint, and obviously a lot more numerous. So how do you manage that process, should you have someone responsible for really the multitude of more minor projects as opposed to the major project role you had a few years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a very good question, Andrew. I think most people would sort of think about major projects execution in these multi-billion dollar project categories. But, you're right, the projects are a little bit smaller. But, on the other hand, we still run those through the major projects group in most cases, except maybe for the smallest ones and those smaller ones add up. So, I would say that we're very focused as we always have been on execution even on the smaller projects. And when we say small, these days, I guess for us that's sort of in the $500 million to $750 million to $1 billion range, but it's very important to get those right. As you know, the execution really drives ultimately the return on these projects. So, we more or less have treated them the same way as in the past from a focus point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to make sure, Andrew, I'm &#x2013; I just want to make sure that I understood your questions well. Andrew, we do still manage all of those projects through our major project management group, even though you might categorize them as not as major. I think our threshold now is around $50 million, anything over $50 million is handled through that group. So these obviously all clear that hurdle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Thank you. And then more specifically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, maybe just to add a little more to that, we follow exactly the same process with respect to executive oversight. So, once a month Pat and Al, and really all of our ELT sit down with the head of our major projects group, and we go through project-by-project status issues. It's continued full meal deal for every project the same as it was with the last wave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And then I guess on something that could be an area for major amount of capital to be allocated, just pushing crude volumes to the East and what would the ultimate end game be? Could you foreseeably see crude volumes winding up on the &#x2013; not just Montreal, but really beyond Montreal and targeting say something like Irving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's fair to say that we could foresee that. That is probably a little bit further out. But the attractiveness of both Western Canadian crude and Bakken crude is such that I think it's fair to say that Eastern refineries, not just Montreal, possibly Quebec City, possibly New Brunswick, possibly around in to Philadelphia, would see some significant advantage of being able to access those crude. So, we certainly will be looking to see where there is sufficient support to extend the project even further east.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up on that, if you were to target say something like Irving, would that be the old Trailbreaker project, I think that was called a number of years ago? Or would you look to lay actually new pipe through Canada and thus avoiding issues of crossing into the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is, I guess, probably in the category yet to be determined. If you go back to Trailbreaker, I think we were actually at that point planning on putting crudes on in Portland and possibly moving all the way around into the Gulf as a short-term solution to the Gulf Access issue and that's not as likely in this scenario now with our Seaway project starting up shortly. But still access to the other East Coast refineries could make sense in the longer term.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Just coming back to funding, the capital program seems to be much heavier in, say the front end of the four-year period. Just wondering the $400 million to $600 million, is it fair to say that that's maybe a little bit more of an immediate need versus something that's more evenly spread out over the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think it's fair to say, Robert that I liked the picture that we had before where we didn't have an equity requirement in front of us. So it's something that we would expect to try and address soon rather than waiting till the end of the five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of addressing that, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on the asset monetization side, and whether that's something where you followed maybe following on the transaction with ENF or maybe an increased dropdown activity in EEP or do you envision just flat-out asset sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't envision material flat-out asset sales, we're always looking to trim non-strategic and/or underperforming assets, but that's not what we mean by asset monetizations in any case. And really we have the three, what I would call, three existing funding vehicles, EEP in the U.S., the Income Fund in Canada, and Noverco was really in that category as well, although we don't report it as a sponsored investments. So, any or all of those three with the caveat that EEP has its plate full at the moment with funding its organic opportunities and so it's not really a candidate in the near-term. And there are possibilities and we have had discussions with interested partners with respect to separate funding vehicle outside any of those three, which is something that we are examining as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just the last question I had is on acquisition growth. And Al, you had mentioned earlier that you obviously look at everything, but you at times had trouble making the numbers work, because it dilutes your pretty strong kind of core oil pipeline growth profile. I am just wondering as well, how much do you think about the impact in acquisition or even just a new business development might have on your premium multiple and specifically if you're venturing into whether that's lower growth or even just lower multiple businesses than in the core oil systems, such as building out just pure natural gas infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I will give that first go. Certainly what you refer to there is the impact on PE. I think that's another way of looking at the dilution of growth that we often see with bigger transactions in that ramp down and the growth rate from a large combination could have an effect on our PE and frankly that's one of the concerns we have. Now, that's for larger sized acquisitions certainly for more bite-sized acquisitions where we can identify good synergies both on the cost and revenue side, then it could very well be that that would be neutral or accretive to the PE as well. And when I say bite-sized, I'm thinking more somewhere in the range of the $1 billion, slightly more type of magnitude.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not going to really comment too much on that. I think, first of all, we don't have a position in that project. I think the question before referred to the general strategy around accessing the Eastern Gulf and I think it would make sense, as Pat mentioned earlier. But at this point, as you pointed out, there are challenges. At this point, I don't think we want to comment too much on how we could solve those given we're not involved in the project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Yeah, my question was again along the lines of the access to the Gulf Coast and all the proposals that are going on right now, especially with the latest cap line, financial projects, lot of barrels will move down the Coast. And I was kind of wondering over the longer-term, I know that in your Seaway, you have commitments for 5 years, you have 10 years, you have 15 years. But when you think about the 5 to 10 to 15 years longer-term and the spot volume that you have on this line, what portion of your target return could be at risk over a certain period of time, especially as the Eastern options and also the Western options develop eventually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll maybe try to answer that generally and then Al, you may or Rich might want to be a little more specific. But Pierre, I think it's fair to say that the &#x2013; we have been able to take advantage of the strong growth in production in the Bakken and Western Canada and the uncertainty around the Gulf Coast access to get in place long-term shipping commitments that give us obviously the comfort that we needed to proceed with the developments that we have. And hence are comfortable with the length and the term on those agreements and earning our return and recovery of our capital over that period of time. So, we don't see any major exposure there. It's not that these are short-term that as other infrastructure projects come on, they're going to in any way endanger our investment. Al, Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's right. I mean we are pretty bullish on the outlook for two things. Obviously, oil sands production and as well more recently the uptick that we've seen in the U.S. shale side, not just in the Bakken, but obviously the Permian, the Niobrara, some &#x2013; well, a big chunk of these barrels are going to be pointed to Cushing. So that'll help for the longer-term. So we're pretty excited about the future in terms of just the overall oil outlook for North America. So that bodes well for our projects, so I think both for the Gulf and Eastern access.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I'd just add that the volumes flowing on the Gulf Coast access project those originating at Flanagan are 10 to 20 year commitments. The five-year commitments are only a part of those that are originating at Cushing. So, even some of those originating at Cushing are for longer terms, 10-year terms. There are some for five years that are originating at Cushing. That's a relatively small part of the overall project economics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just had a question regarding East Coast Access or Eastern Access, I should say, I think there is a $2 billion figure or more than $2 billion figure that was quoted earlier in the call, and I was just hoping that someone could elaborate on the cost that you foresee to get to Montreal and beyond potentially to the Coast for that kind of a project?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think jut to clarify then, what the $2 billion plus figure covers would be enhancement of our Line 6B, that's the U.S. portion of the project. It would include expansion of Line 17, which runs into Toledo and it would include access to the Quebec market. So that would be the second part of the reversal of Line 9 that would go into Montreal, but there is nothing beyond that as far as further expansion of Eastern Access projects beyond Montreal figure.</p>
