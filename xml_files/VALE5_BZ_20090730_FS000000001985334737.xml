      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. Let me start off our comments today by saying that &#x2013; by the same token that we commented that in the fourth quarter during the announcement of the third quarter results that the third quarter was part of a world but didn't exist anymore as the world has changed dramatically.</p>
          <p>I would say that we could say about the same regarding the development in the first half of 2009. Of course, the adjustments have continued during this first half in the world economy and, of course, company's results reflected this reality of adjustments and as I will comment with you later in this presentation, we have several reasons to believe that the watch is over and we are in a new stage of development of the world economy and our industry in particular. So the second quarter results do reflect a transition from this old world that we are commenting to a new world of recovery. Our operating revenues were limited to $5.1 billion, adjusted EBIT of 976 million, EBIT margin limited to 19.7% and our EBITDA reached $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are not quite waiting for the improvements of the environment. We are working very hard to implement several initiatives to push further down our cost structure. And if you took a look at our release, you'll notice that we had results across the board in our cost structure. Of course, we were affected by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, that's another indication of the relative strength of the market &#x2013; the appreciation of the real, sorry, that's another indication of the relative strength of the commodity market.</p>
          <p>But it's clear in the figures if you're looking more detailed that in every single item, we have a meaningful effort in terms of cost reduction. We have some highlights in this presentation and I'd like to invite my colleague Tito Martins to comment what is going on in the nickel business and what is going to improve remarkably the development of this business. Tito, you could comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody. We've been trying hard along the last six months to &#x2013; strategically in terms of the nickel business to set some restructuring program. What we are trying to do is to set up a new way to work from a geographical approach in our operations in Canada and in other operations, nickel business around the world to a more functional approach.</p>
          <p>What I mean by that is, we decided to put the operating team together and run business from one operating center in Sudbury. The idea is to combine &#x2013; because before that until the beginning of the year, most of the Vale Inc. operations, they were run independently. So the idea is to combine and generate some synergies among all the operations through services contracts and maintenance systems and IT systems, everything that's related to the operation.</p>
          <p>So we're expecting to see along the 2009, results coming from this combination of &#x2013; based on the new structure. We have already managed to achieve some reductions in managerial positions around 20%. With this new structure, we're expecting to have some gains in synergies and we would be able to have technical people work in different sites and providing services for two different sites throughout the world.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are also working and renegotiating some service contracts and at the same time, we're expecting to achieve some cost reductions through renegotiations with suppliers and maintenance contracts. Fabio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And the global sourcing as well is applying to you, right in the operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, applies to everybody, a few reductions in other contracts that are being put in place right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very important item of our cost structure and we managed to diversify our sources of supply. So this should mean a very important cost saving of the plan. And there is also &#x2013; we believe they are impressive as you can observe in chart number seven. We managed to present further cost savings of $186 million. Of course, we increased the volumes and the appreciation of the real exchange rate, in particular, we more than offset this effort, but it's clear that we are again working very hard to get the results on the ground.</p>
          <p>And this is clearly shown by the unit costs that we observe in chart number eight. And we see that for the second quarter in a row we have meaningful results to be presented both in nickel and iron ore, iron ore more intensely in the first quarter. So this is another very important result. $1.3 billion in cost savings, it's nearly the &#x2013; it's close to 80% of our EBITDA in the second quarter, to give you dimension of the effort that has been put in place.</p>
          <p>Of course, the EBITDA reflected the market conditions and it was primarily determined &#x2013; its reduction was primarily determined by the price decreases, despite &#x2013; very important contribution is by sales volumes and cost savings and also dividends, but unfortunately, we had this market circumstances and the numbers are reflecting that. More specifically, the driver there of the drop was, of course, due to this importance and the very fact that it was the most relevant item in cash generation in the first half was the iron ore price reduction.</p>
          <p>We applied it retroactively to the first quarter to part of our sales and an important message here, all sales from now on independently of the &#x2013; achieving agreement on prices, they should &#x2013; the prices that we are accounting for in the second quarter consider that all adjustments have been already made. It means that there should be no more retroactive adjustment relative to the benchmark pricing that we applied independently of the negotiations that, of course, may continue for some clients, as Martins will explain. It means that this unpredictable effect is no longer expected considering market circumstances doing what we just did in terms of adjustment.</p>
          <p>So in the case of iron ore, we have this effect, this important effect in the price changes. In the non-ferrous business, we have a sharp recovery of average prices and this is indicated by the contribution to EBITDA of $269 million. And at this point, it's very important to mention that Vale cut production in the fourth quarter of '08 and they cut production well below its <mark type="inaudible" /> first half, because it believed that was very important to contribute for a rebalancing of the market and we believe that we have been successful in this regard.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we intensified our sales effort in the nickel business, so we sold much less &#x2013; much more nickel in the second quarter of '09, 70% more than we sold in the first quarter of '09. This is, of course, a result of the market developments but also our own marketing strategy as we can see in chart number 11, the prices &#x2013; the LME for our commodities, including nickel, recovered. The numbers indicate a very, very, very sharp recovery of prices and in this regard our sales efforts were very timely. And the non-ferrous minerals as a whole, EBIT margin that was negative, it was sharply recovered to reach a positive figure, very modest yes, but a positive figure of 0.2% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The major challenge that we have today is to reconcile our quest for growth as we do believe that long term it's very promising and we believe that investing and creating more capacities for the future demand, it creates value for our shareholders. And in this regard, we invested $5.2 billion in the first half of 2009. And I would like to call your attention that, we have almost $10 billion invested in projects on the ground that are not generating any cash at this stage that certainly will contribute when the operations start to enhance further capacity to generate cash in the long term.</p>
          <p>We have, of course, a very strong sound financial position with large liquid assets, low-risk debt portfolio, and long-term credit lines, as you all know. And considering the position that we are in this cycle &#x2013; the down cycle, we are in a very comfortable position in terms of leverage, with our total debt/EBITDA limited to 1.5 times.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the future &#x2013; this new world that we are already starting to see with several signs of strength of the world economy and particularly in our industry. Global industrial production started to recover, it's clear, and more than that there is indication new orders inventory ratio is clearly showing that there is more expansion to come. And our business is deeply connected with the industrial production figures, so this is good news and we see in chart number 14 a clear improvement of the situation. And if you are able to see color, see the red line, the PMI new orders/inventories indicating further strength of industrial production still to come compared to the actual figures observed in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And this recovery is being led by emerging market economies; Vale is still small compared to developed economies to produce a faster recovery of the world economy, but they are very intensive in consumption of minerals and metals and they are driving back our market to a better position. Of course, the developed economies are also improving compared to the situation they faced &#x2013; the critical situation they faced in the fourth quarter of '08 and the first half of '09 but there is a clear path of recovery considering the several stimulus packages that were delivered in the most important economies of the world and also in emerging economies.</p>
          <p>So this has had an effect on the industrial production of the developed economies, as you can see in chart 16, and there is a clear convergence towards a better performance in the second half of 2009 compared to what we observed in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>As for China, China's GDP is rebounding after two quarters. According to the numbers that we collect, the GDP growth &#x2013; the marginal GDP growth in the second quarter of '09 was almost 15%. Of course, we don't believe that the GDP growth in China will remain as such for the year at 15%, but it's a clear indication that the stimulus package in China and the recovery of the economy &#x2013; the economy is presenting a very strong performance this year.</p>
          <p>And in chart 18, we have another indication, which is the Chinese real estate sector. We have floor space sold increasing by 51% in the second quarter &#x2013; at the end of the second quarter and the floor space started 12% growth. So very solid numbers that are behind in a way given the importance of the Chinese real estate to the demand for steel, they are behind a major part of the recovery of the global carbon steel output.</p>
          <p>At this stage, I would like to invite Martins to comment on this sector and the perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning, everybody. Let's start with the chart number 10, where we can see that steel production start recovering in this year &#x2013; late this year &#x2013; sorry, it's chart 19. So we can see that steel production has started recovering worldwide, not only in China and also mainly in Europe.</p>
          <p>It is very important to see in the chart 20 the recovery in Europe. For Vale, Europe is very important as our sales in Europe used to be higher than our sales in China in a regular year. And during this crisis, our sales in China and Europe dropped almost 80%. Although steel production in Europe went down 50%, European market decreased a lot in terms of iron ore because of de-stocking, heavy de-stocking, some usage of their own mines for some customers and also in some markets a increase in scrap usage. All of these three points that happened during the first half of this year is now changing, coming back to the older pattern. So the recovery in the European steel industry and markets will be very important for the recovery of our sales of iron ore.</p>
          <p>Prices for steel also going up as we can see for billets and hot rolled coils in every market. Price of steel is a product of demand and also steel production. So the steel production moves after the price increases, this phenomenon is already happening with many steel makers. They're starting their blast furnace operations in Europe, not only in Europe but also in the States and even in Brazil, we can see a lot of announcements of blast furnaces restarting production. So all of this is bringing a good impact in our prospects for sales.</p>
          <p>As you'll probably know, our sales are mainly based on FOB basis. And now we see a lot of customers nominating vessels for the next quarter. This is a very good prospect for shipments from now on.</p>
          <p>Another interesting chart to show you is the chart number 22, which is the iron ore price in the spot. As we can see moving up, yesterday China's spot price reached $93.50. So it seems that the market is very tight and demand for iron ore very strong in China. And one of the reason is that as other markets are recovering like Europe, Japan, Korea, other markets outside China is recovering, some shipments that are used to go to China are now moving to other places. So this is bringing some kind of a feeling of shortness in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>What we can see in the chart 23 is our efforts to increase our sales, because considering our high dependence on European markets and also in Brazilian markets, the drop in those markets left us with any other choice than trying to sell more in China. And we make a lot of efforts to increase our sales in China and besides there's a lot of efforts in shipping area because we have to hire a lot of ships. 70% of our sales to China were made on a C&amp;F basis. So we have a high level of load ships.</p>
          <p>Being a company that are used to sell 100% of its sales in FOB basis; to move into a C&amp;F basis  involves tremendous efforts in our company in our structure. And we needed to understand that we are 45 days from China. So we have to hire the ships, to send the ore and sell later. And as the market in China is very dynamic in this spot area, you can imagine all the pressure we've had to send this ore 45 days ahead without knowing what would be the price and what would be the customer.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but we did it and we are very proud now to say that even in this very difficult moment, we are able to increase our sales to China, almost 40% more our traditional level. I think if I may say one of the best point of our performance in this quarter was what we reached in China by changing the way we sell, by changing the way we ship, changing our portfolio of customers, so it was a big transformation and I think Vale made a very stronger demonstration of our capacity to change when we face a different market and circumstances.</p>
          <p>The implementation of our C&amp;F sales has been very instrumental in enhancing our competitiveness in China. And we build a low cost portfolio of maritime freight. We are less, less dependent on spot freight. We are hiring long-term freight contracts &#x2013; long-term ships to work for us. We also are building our fleet of more than 20 vessels now being built in China and that will be starting delivery in 2011.</p>
          <p>So we're going to be in a very much &#x2013; in a very stronger position from our own, because we started this game without having a ship, without having a contract and having to sell bigger parts of our sales C&amp;F basis. But in six months, we built a very strong portfolio of ship contracts and we bought many ships also to work for us. So we are minimizing our exposure to spot freight prices and we are increasing reliance in our own fleet based on long-term contracts and on ships.</p>
          <p>And these are very important points we reached during this half and we are now much better positioned going forward. We see the recovery in global demand for iron ore increasing. The de-stocking process is finished. And none of our customers have iron ore in their stockyard so they needed to buy in order to produce what they are producing. In the first half, they were using the stock to produce, now they have to buy to produce. If they don't increase their production, they will have to buy much more than they did in the first half.</p>
          <p>And Vale is in a situation, it's the only big player that has capacity available. So all the increase in iron ore market will be captured by Vale, because we have &#x2013; we kept our capacity intact. As we can see by our cost efforts that we did a lot in the first half, but we kept our structure to produce up to 300 million tons of iron ore if it was needed. So now we have this capacity available and as we increase the sales, our unit costs will be much lower, because we are going to dilute fixed cost and reminding, industry fixed costs is a big part of the total cost.</p>
          <p>As we see, in the first half we've sold 212 million tons of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Annualized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Annualized to &#x2013; in the region of 212 million tons of iron ore and our capacity is 300. So we have nearly 80 million tons capacity available to fill the market if it was needed.</p>
          <p>For sure, our dependence on Chinese market increase while I don't think is a bad news, I think it's a good news, because to depend on a market that is buying is a good news. To depend on a market that's not buying is a bad news, like it's happened in Europe in the first half. We have a huge market share in Europe and the market was very, very weak. So then we faced a lot of troubles because of that. So I think that the dependence in the Chinese market for iron ore is a very good point.</p>
          <p>As far as pellet is concerned, pellet is mainly used when you need the high productivity. Considering the low capacity utilization in steel industry, pellet was one of the most affected product in our portfolio. All the steel makers decided to use more <mark type="inaudible" />, and so they stopped buying pellets. I think in this point of the crisis, I should consider that we have 13 pellet plants, considering the three pellet plants that we have with Samarco.</p>
          <p>Only three of them were operating and then since this point and since we made this adjustment in price to reflect a better economic balance with the other forms of iron ore, sales of pellets started increasing and now we will have only three pellets plants idle. All the others are in operation or starting to resume operations. So we think that for pellet second half will be a much better performance. So the next point I think is to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tito, could you comment on the two or three slides and then we will open for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Of course. As you can see from slide 27, we are seeing a recovery in the stainless steel production and mainly that was driven by the Chinese market. When you see the numbers from the first half of '09 and we compared down with the first half of '08, we had a very steep increase in demand in China, 70% growth compared with the first half of '08. And when you compare the second quarter of '09 over the second quarter of '08, we're talking about 139% increase in demand.</p>
          <p>We should mention Chinese stainless production set a new quarterly record on Q2 '09 and we're talking about a market of around 2.1 million tons of stainless steel. So what is happening outside China? China is the main driver, but we are also seeing some signs from different geographies. Europe and U.S., Japan, Korea, Brazil, some countries in Asia, they are showing some recovery already and we have to bear in mind that 70% of the total consumption of nickel in the world is outside China. So when we see those signs, we become more optimistic about a more stable market in the second half.</p>
          <p>Some &#x2013; three important comments, as we are seeing the stainless steel growing &#x2013; demand is growing, but we are also seeing some good signs from the other nickel markets like plating and boulders. Some recovery has been observed in the batteries and electronic markets and also in the automotives.</p>
          <p>Because of all of that and as we can see in the slide 28, nickel prices went up maybe in the last eight weeks. And looking at the scrap market, the tightness of the scrap market and consumption of the level of output in the 300 series in nickel, we can see that market is consuming more and more nickel. So we tend to believe that forecast for the second half for sure should be better than the first half. <mark type="inaudible" />, Fabio</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai with Bank of America.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Fabio, one thing that you didn't comment was the interest that you are having on the fertilizer business. Could you comment a little bit on the strategic value of this business and how would you think that you could actually grow in this area and if you could eventually consider any big acquisition in this sector? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. We have been saying for some time now and I believe that several quarters that we believe that fertilizers are a very important and interesting line of business for Vale. It's mining, Brazil in particular is a natural consumer of fertilizers, but not only that, the Americas as a whole, they are very important in terms of deposits and resources. And it's part of the mining business, and we have operation in <mark type="inaudible" /> and we have several projects in our pipeline. And in the last year, we concluded the negotiations and in the first quarter of this year, we acquired very interesting assets from Rio Tinto, that Rio Colorado deposit in Argentina and, as you know, deposits in Canada.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is to develop all the products that we have in our pipeline and to become a major player in this sector. And we can become a major player in this sector without any further acquisition. And as we commented, by that time that was some rumors in the press, we said that we are always looking for opportunities in all lines of business that have to do with Vale, but our focus is organic growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning everyone. One comment was to explore a little bit the Chinese iron ore market. First question is, you sold 36 million tons, a record volume to China and 25 million tons out of these were on a C&amp;F basis. So I just would like to confirm that the remainder 11 million tons sold in China were done probably on a benchmark basis. And also if you expect any changes regarding this mix, which was almost 70% of your volumes on a C&amp;F basis and 30% on the potentially close to benchmark prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it, 70% of our sales in China were based on C&amp;F basis. And the remaining FOB was based on benchmark, meaning <mark type="inaudible" /> prices are fully benchmark prices. From now on, you'll have to consider that the Chinese are looking at the trend in this spot market. And the spot market now is going up and over the benchmark level. So we immediately saw a trend to nominate vessels and to try to buy more based on the contract, based on the benchmark prices.</p>
          <p>So this assumption that we are managing for the best of interest of our company and our shareholders, but clearly the Chinese is now moving faster to the benchmark level, to the contractor level. And this trend is not only with Vale, but it's happening with the other producers and probably that is one of the reasons that last shipments are standing to export and so this creates some kind of sharpness in the spot, because all the suppliers are now selling more FOB contractual basis. So I think that will be a trend as far as the spot continues to increase as we see now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then just to complement, if I may, Martins, these are very few indication of a certain imbalance of the market out there, because the implied FOB price is more attractive than the C&amp;F spot price. I'm not forecasting anything. I'm just concluding by the numbers that we are observing currently in the Chinese market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also a point to be considered at is clearly, I don't know the latter, but there will be a cap in the spot price in China, which will be the level because you'll have more local production. As the price goes up, more local production will be brought to the market. So I think the market is now testing what will be the best balance between imports and local production and in what price level that will happen.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My question is regarding freight in this strategy now that you are seeing a lot in the C&amp;F basis here. Could you please comment a little bit more on how much in terms of volumes you have already the freight contracted or it's just a range of the costs that you're seeing there. In terms of your own fleet, do you have any idea that you could give us in terms of how much of capacity that you have in place right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very sensitive question, because as everything we say in this respect could have impact on the level of freight price. So what I can tell you is we are prepared to ship every ton we produce, if you have a market, if you have a customers and freight will not be a problem for us. Like we have beginning of this year, we let a lot of iron ore behind because we didn't have the competitive freight for it.</p>
          <p>So we are preparing ourselves now to deliver every ton we have in spite of what is going on with the spot markets for freight. And you may consider that to reach a position like that we have to have a bigger portion of our sales based on C&amp;F basis, and we'll have a bigger portion of our sales with our own fleet. So we are managing this issue according to market conditions and according with the situation. This will be from now on a very sensitive issue for Vale. So I cannot, unfortunately I cannot disclose to you how much we already have. But I can tell you we are now in a very comfortable position based on that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Ivan Fadel with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. The question is regarding a recent CISA statement to try to limit iron ore import license in China for the spot market, and if implemented what could be the impact for Vale in your views. I see that in one hand it can create lower supply that could increase spot prices further. But as Fabio and Martins were saying, it could also start to create more markets for domestic production there that could supply the market at higher prices and maybe reduce a little bit volumes from exporters to that region. So how can this issue impact Vale in your views, if implemented? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is a $1 billion question. But I think we needed to wait and see what they will decide, okay. I think China is becoming more and more important in the iron ore business, more and more important to the whole economy. So I think not only iron ore, but other commodities, other nations.</p>
          <p>So economically speaking, China is becoming more and more important. And the question if we're going to have a more market-oriented decision or not is not up to us to conclude. But we really believe that as time goes by more and more decisions will be done based on market situation, okay. So that's what we can expect based on that, but we have no idea what could be the outcome of this present situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And here's a follow-up on since you touched the point of the markets decision, we're seeing as you said many blast furnaces now re-igniting in Japan, Europe and Brazil, as you mentioned in the presentation, and also we've seen some signals from BioSteel in recent newswires, news that they were seeing demand in China leveling out a little bit. So it's clearly good for iron ore that blast furnaces are re-igniting, for the short-term it means very likely more demand. So my question is, from your side there if you're still seeing final demand for steels or where will that steel &#x2013; all of that steel go to and if you're seeing that already in recent numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at it you'll have a worldwide better signals in the economy side, okay. As during this period from September on, we've had a, I would say, a kind of a overshooting in the iron ore market and in all of the markets because of the de-stocking process, we never saw in the old economy a de-stocking like that. It's not only in iron ore, but steel, cars, appliances. So a lot of construction is being sold and not new ones being started. So de-stocking were everywhere, because there was a credit crunch and people had to free money from their inventories.</p>
          <p>So what we are seeing now in my view in the western world is coming back to the level, to the underlying demand. So there is an additional demand for commodities because production was always there, but now we are replenishing inventories. And this will bring additional demand also. So we think that we have I would say a kind of big growth in these two or three months and then probably we're going to level off afterwards and &#x2013; but we will be in a much higher point than we were in the first half.</p>
          <p>And as China is concerned, their investment package is fully working. You have a lot of investments going on in the country and they are buying more steel. But also we can see some is more I would say overflow in this growth. I think after this period that we are going to be stable in a higher level of demand, not only for iron ore but for steel and everything and also prices, a little bit higher than what used to be. So I think we are moving to our new level, and I would say in a better level for producers.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Owen Flanigan with Ocum Asset Management .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My question relates to what guidance you can give us on iron ore sales volumes and prices for the rest of this year. I mean, you said how you think second half of the year could potentially be a very different environment from the first half. I mean can you share with us some numbers of the kind of sales volumes you think are achievable? I mean, if we look at the first and second quarter, you sold pretty much 50 million tons of iron ore in both quarters. And in the second quarter, obviously, your production is higher than 58 million tons. Is it possible in the third and fourth quarters that sales volumes equals that level of production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Mr. Flanigan all the indication that we provided in our presentation is that there is a recovery process on the ground. And we believe that the second half of 2009 could yield better results from the standpoint of market strength, of market performance, industry performance, the world economy should perform much better. And that's the scenario that we're working with. But unfortunately, we do not provide any specific guidance about sales volumes or prices that we expect. We'll provide this information after the end of the quarter and disseminate the information for everybody interested in the numbers of our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just ask one other question about prices in the second quarter? Your realized price in the second quarter was $47, which is below even the levels of spot prices that you have on slide 22. Can you tell us why this differential between spot prices and your realized prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this price that you have there it's a index that &#x2013; it's a price index that involves several materials that are not necessarily the same that we sell. Martins, could you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you'll have to consider that the spot price is delivered in China. So our price realization is less freight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's FOB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So FOB basis, so then the difference is basically because our price is FOB, the price we deliver in our results is FOB and the spot is delivered price in China. So there is a difference of this freight and also quality and you have &#x2013; some contracts were based on benchmark, some contracts are based on spot. So it's a lot of different reasons for this difference, but the main one is spot &#x2013; is C&amp;F price and our price is FOB.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tito. Hi, Fabio I only got one question so I've got to make it count. I just wanted to understand what in Vale's mind does the rising C&amp;F price mean in China. In other words, if you are currently selling at rough numbers $50 FOB Brazil, but now the advantage is clearly with spot at 90 and say freight out to China 30, you could be realizing $60 at your port for C&amp;F sales. So I just wanted to understand would you be in a position in the second half to capture that differential and actually generate more EBITDA per ton, if you continue to sell primarily on a C&amp;F basis into China, or the contract set up in a way that the client would capture that benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be possible. We have two differences to capture. One is the difference between the spot and benchmark and that will depend on if the spot market will be open for foreigners, foreign companies to participate on it. And another difference is if you can get lower freight than the spot, we can capture this difference also. So I think it's a possibility that we can capture a better price, but I cannot elaborate how much.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and thank you for the call. I would like to explore the cost side a little further. We've seen that although overall costs were negatively impacted by currency movements and the cost of idle capacity, we noted that your cash cost specifically in the iron ore business decreased. So just to get your sense of how you see the evolution of cash costs in the iron ore business going forward, I mean, given that FX appreciation might continue, which will weigh negatively on your results. But on the other hand, you have the positive impact of ramping up capacity. So just to get a sense of how you see the evolution of cash cost in the iron ore business specifically please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we cut a lot of cost from the system and this cost that we cut were mainly fixed cost. But as you said, we produced much less than our capacity. In second half, as we are ramping up production and we are selling probably much more than we thought, this fixed cost will be dilutive. I cannot make any kind of statement how much but it's clear that our cost will be down in the second half on a unit basis.</p>

          <p>Well the pelletizing plants if I understood correctly, our plan is to &#x2013; we have about five plants in operation right now. We are stocking up the Vargem Grande plant, it will probably hit this project. And we believe that depending on market circumstances two more could be brought on line, this is our idea. As far the Goro project, we are expecting to start the ramp-up in this quarter and it's progressing according to plan, and I believe that Tito could have additional comments on that.</p>

We haven't got back to the discussions yet. I cannot elaborate much about what's going to happen and we don't know how long it's going to last, this strike.</p>
          <p>We have kept our original <mark type="inaudible" />, which is everything that was proposed was based on the profitability of our business locally.

          <p>In terms of inventories, we're fine with that, I cannot mention any number but &#x2013; and if you look back what was our production along the first semester despite the drop in the market, you would try to keep a certain level of production in order to couple with the market conditions in the second half.
