          <p>Thank you and welcome to Merck's third quarter 2012 earnings presentation and conference call. My name is Joshua Young, Head of Investor Relations for Merck. And joining me on today's call are Karl Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board; and Matthias Zachert, Chief Financial Officer at Merck.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to begin my presentation on slide number four, solid underlying performance. We'll start with summarizing the key messages for Q3. First, we show a strong financial performance, and, second, the transformation of the company continues at full speed.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with the financial performance. In Q3 sales grew 11.8% to &#x20AC;2.7 billion. And this performance reflected the continuation of the solid business trends that we have seen throughout 2012. Primary growth drivers were Merck Serono and Performance Materials, boosting our organic sales growth to 5.9%. This is actually the highest level of organic growth we have posted this year. Reported sales include 5.7% benefit from foreign exchanges. Another highlight of the quarter is the fact that the emerging markets have surpassed Europe as our largest region.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are making good progress with our efficiency initiatives. We have completed negotiations in over 50% of our targeted countries. In many of those countries, we have already started implementation of the plans, which is reflected in both lower costs and lower head count in Q3.</p>
          <p>From a profitability perspective, EBITDA pre one-time items grew 15.6% to &#x20AC;754 million with a margin of 27.7%, considerably ahead of last year. Our profitability improved constantly over the last few quarters. This is a reflection of the good top line performance, savings from the efficiency program and better resource allocation. Combined with actions to improve the efficiency of working capital, we could also show a strong cash flow and let us reduce our net debt to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, which is more than &#x20AC;800 million lower compared to the end of June this year.</p>
          <p>Please pass up to page number five now. From a geographical perspective, our top line performance in Q3 was quite similar to the trends that we have seen earlier in the year. Organic sales growth was the highest in North America &#x2013; is 13%, driven by both volume and price, totaling &#x20AC;562 million. Emerging markets followed with 12%, generating &#x20AC;964 million. Rest of the world was flat. Europe continued to decline; we stand now at &#x20AC;956 million.</p>
          <p>Let me underline that one of the strengths of our company is the strong presence in emerging markets, which has consistently generated robust growth, and has now surpassed Europe in terms of absolute sales for the first time.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets are being driven almost exclusively by volume growth with the greatest contribution coming from Merck Serono. Expect emerging markets to represent a higher percentage of our sales going forward, which should help to offset some of the weaknesses we have seen in Europe.</p>
          <p>Please move on to number six, where I turn to our divisional performance. Sales of Merck Serono grew 10% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, representing 5.3% organic growth consisting of both volume and pricing effects.</p>
          <p>Rebif reported organic sales growth of 10% in Q3; U.S. sales of Rebif growing 20% organically to &#x20AC;267 million. As a result, organic growth of global Rebif was 8% in the first nine months of 2012. This is quite solid, and it reflects the fact that we are up to now successfully defending and optimizing our Rebif franchise.</p>
          <p>Our Fertility &amp; Endocrinology products continue to perform strongly, with GONAL-f posting nearly 11% organic sales growth in the quarter. As a result of operating leverage and structural savings from the cost efficiency program, Merck Serono's EBITDA pre-margin expanded nicely and crossed the 30% threshold for the first time in the past two years.</p>
          <p>We reported a weak performance for Consumer Health, but some of this weakness results from the decline related to softening of European consumer demand, effects of the restructuring activities and exits of unattractive markets effect on our performance. Sales declined by 10% to &#x20AC;122 million. The division continues to optimize its resource allocation process and to manage its cost base. As a result, EBITDA pre increased to 15% of sales.</p>
          <p>We've shared with you the details of the Consumer Health restructuring plans last quarter, and as you can see, many of our cost saving initiatives are well underway.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide number seven. One of these initiatives is the proposed closure of our production plant in Hull, U.K., which is summarized on slide seven. In Europe, we are currently operating with four production sites for our Consumer Health, which besides the Hull plant are based in Austria, Germany and Spain.</p>
          <p>Compared to these three sites, the Hull site, which primarily manufactures and packages products of our Seven Seas portfolio, would need considerable investment for upgrading. In addition, we've experienced under-utilization at this site for several years. Given the structural limitations of the facilities and scenarios of future capacity utilization rates, we don't believe that we can be competitive there.</p>
          <p>We have therefore proposed to relocate and outsource our manufacturing, packaging activities from Hull. Commercial operations are proposed to be shifted to the Merck Serono in London.</p>
          <p>We are also proposing to reduce the number of products that we are currently selling, manufacturing at the plant; each of these actions designed around improving the setup and profitability of the division. In Hull, we are now in the midst of formal 90-day consultation period with employees.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Performance Materials on slide eight, we reported sales increase of 31% in the third quarter to a record level of &#x20AC;446 million. The underlying demand for Liquid Crystals has remained strong. PS-VA products recorded strong volumes and benefited from high growth in China as a result of an expanding domestic LCD market that creates higher demand for our products. In addition, demand for IPS products used in touchscreen displays continued its strong momentum.</p>
          <p>Driven by strong operating leverage, the division's EBITDA pre-margin improved by more than 200 basis points despite pricing pressure and weakness in the pigment materials. In summary, it was an exceptional quarter of operational performance for Performance Materials.</p>
          <p>Finally, Merck Millipore reported sales growth of 10% to &#x20AC;643 million. This performance reflected organic sales growth of 3% driven primarily by the division's Process Solutions and Lab Solutions businesses. While parts of the Life Science Tools market remain challenging, the division's benefiting from the fact that much of the sales are outside of the academic market. Sales to drug production customers and analytical laboratories remain strong.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we continue to invest for future organic growth through R&amp;D investments. In addition to internal R&amp;D, we continue to augment our investments by completing bolt-on acquisitions. We announced the acquisition of Biochrom, which strengthened our cell culture and buffer solution offering. Despite these investments, the EBITDA pre-margin improved by 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to slide number nine to a short update on the transformation process. As illustrated on this slide, it follow with the <mark type="ph" /> Q4 2018 (12:08) program a very consistent and sustainable process.</p>
          <p>In 2011 we came together in a new management team. We then built a new organizational structure that is better suited to tackle the challenges in the business. The beginning of this year, we announced our formal plans for cost efficiencies, starting then negotiations and reaching agreements up to now with many of our stakeholders over the past several months.</p>
          <p>Of course, we still have ongoing negotiations in several countries, but we have begun executing cost efficiency plans already, particularly in major countries like Germany and Switzerland. And as a result, we are beginning to see that our profitability is improving. Moving ahead, we would like to more and more embark on a continuous improvement process and then to focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Having said this, I hand over to Matthias, who will walk you through third quarter financials. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>A warm welcome from my side as well. I will start on page number 11 and will briefly touch on the key financial indicators that we report at group level. Sales, Karl has already made the statement that we are well on track with our overall performance and have delivered strong sales growth, predominantly in the Performance Materials and Merck Serono segments. As far as EBITDA is concerned, I would like to allude to the strong increase of around about &#x20AC;100 million here, which is also reflected in the structural upgrades that we had in the margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Especially noteworthy is the operating cash flow, which was highly increased driven by the increase in profitability and another quarter of working capital improvement. So this has led us to reducing net debt to levels around &#x20AC;2.1 billion, which, in light of the fact that just in 2010 we did the Millipore acquisition and had net debts of around about &#x20AC;5 billion, shows the cash flow generation capabilities of this company.</p>
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity also to state to you that the net debt number that I have seen in your models is most likely on the high side and should be revisited.</p>
          <p>With this, I move on to page number 12, and I would focus in my comments on the very strong performance that is shown by Performance Materials and Merck Serono. The details of this will be explained in a moment.</p>
          <p>As far as currency is concerned, please allow me to raise the point that 2012 is a year where in each quarter we have <mark type="ph" /> next to (15:24) organic performance, had a nice contribution from currencies as well, and this becomes especially visible in the Performance Materials segments.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to page number 13. Top line, I've already made my points. The strong increase here is driven by our franchises &#x2013; strong leadership position that we have with Rebif, with Glucophage, with GONAL-f, but of course also stemming from the strong stands that we have in the emerging markets. What is not visible in the mere numbers is, however, the strength of the team. When I rewind around about one year and three-quarters, before Stefan and his team arrived, I guess that all of you will confirm that the organic momentum of this business was not as pronounced and forecasted to be not as pronounced as visible right now.</p>
          <p>The team is in place and you can judge their performance on the organic contribution to top line. This very comment, I will also like to stress, if you look into marketing and selling costs, I think here Bel&#xE9;n Garijo walks the talk on what she has presented to the financial community, fifteenth of May this year.</p>
          <p>As far as royalty and commission expenses is concerned, you see the increase basically stemming from the good performance that we posted in the U.S. on Rebif, which of course draws further commission expenses.</p>
          <p>Other expenses have increased, driven by the restructuring costs that have also hampered third quarter 2012, and of course, this is also something that you will see in fourth quarter and in the first half of 2013. But of course the envelops become smaller in this regards.</p>
          <p>As far as R&amp;D is concerned, also here for the very first time, you see an improvement. And again this is a reflection and the commitment of Annalisa Jenkins that has clearly shown to you on the fifteenth of May what direction we are going to take here. So, like in marketing and selling, we walk the talk, which, bottom line, leads to a strong increase in absolute terms but also structurally in terms of EBITDA performance.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Consumer Health. Karl has already alluded to the decisions that have been made on the business model, i.e., exiting certain countries where we have not achieved the targeted profitability and also slashing products that have not contributed to bottom line performance. We expect improvement in resource allocation you see in the marketing and selling costs, where we mitigated this drop in sales and have therefore maintained our bottom line profitability.</p>
          <p>Like in Q2, I would like to reemphasize that in Consumer Health we've started the transformation process latest. For that very reason, the next quarters will remain fragile whilst the business moves in the right direction. From the decision being taken in Hull &#x2013; not the decision &#x2013; the initiative that has been taken in Hull, should we come to the conclusion that eventually this production site will not be maintained, of course it automatically will lead to sales reduction in the forthcoming year, because around about two-thirds of the products will not be maintained.</p>
          <p>Let's go to page number 15. The headline already stresses the nature of the quarter &#x2013; exceptional. For that very reason, please don't carry on or don't get carried away with this exceptional performance and assume that this can be taken for granted for the next few quarters. For that very reason, we've chosen the term exceptional. The business is rock solid because of our substantial technology leadership, our good positioning in all the respective markets very close to the customers, and for that very reason we posted good organic growth.</p>
          <p>We made further improvements in all of our technologies, and for that very reason, we kept our leadership position, which is reflected in our market share. This is especially noteworthy for our premium technology PS-VA, but also in our IPS technology that most likely you see in all the tablets that you are carrying with you.</p>
          <p>The point I would, however, like to make is that 30% growth or 20% organic growth is, in the chemical industry, exceptional, extraordinary. For that very reason, please do assume that the forthcoming quarters will not be at the same magnitude. For the fourth quarter, we convey that the profitability will be at the level of fourth quarter last year. And beginning of the year 2013, we assume that de-stocking takes place, because currently inventories are being built up, especially in China.</p>
          <p>Having said this, I would nevertheless like to shed light on the profitability, which is even slightly higher than previous quarter, which already with &#x20AC;190 million was outstanding. Final points on Performance Materials, please blend in and consider that in 2012 all currencies, i.e., U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Thai dollar, went in our direction favorably.</p>
          <p>With this I move on to page number 16, Merck Millipore. Strong sales performance, whilst we of course deliver profitable growth, which posted &#x20AC;148 million with a slight uptick in margin as well. Here you see the continuous investments into the future. We strengthened further our sales forces in the U.S., but also in the emerging markets. That is behind the around about 11% increase in selling costs and the substantial investments in R&amp;D with around about 30%. That is a clear sign that we believe in the future, and the rationale behind that, we would like to explain in depth on the fifth of December in Molsheim, where we will give you an update on the products and the business segments of Merck Millipore.</p>
          <p>On page number 17, you see the key cornerstones of the balance sheet. Noteworthy here is the gross debt deleveraging, which will continue end of this year. There's another bond that matures in course of Q4 2012, which will be redeemed. And another bond will fall due in 2013, which fortunately then can be eliminated because of its high coupon it currently carries. So here the gross debt reduction will continue, and at the same point in time, of course, net financial debt is going to go down further nicely. And my point here, again, please revisit your models. In most of them I have seen net debt positions which are around about &#x20AC;5 billion to &#x20AC;1 billion too high.</p>
          <p>On page number 18, you see where cash is coming from, from a underlying strong profitability uptick, but also from improvements in working capital. Third quarter is especially noteworthy, because different to the second quarter, we've only done very, very limited amount of factoring in the South European countries, as a matter of fact, around about &#x20AC;60 million. So this is clearly stemming from an organic, strong operational improvement on the inventories and receivables sides.</p>
          <p>On page number 19, you see where this is now leading to. We started in December 2011, with working capital of around about &#x20AC;2.93 billion, which is 30% to sales. So within just nine months, we have knocked down working capital quite substantially to now around about 24% to sales. It's a reflection of the new management incentive schemes, it's a reflection on better focus, and therefore also in this regards we execute according to international standards.</p>
          <p>The point I would like to stress on whether here, with 24%, we are around about a little better than what I would consider as normal operational percentage and ratio for the company. I think 25% for a healthcare company with also big exposure on the emerging markets is decent. This would be the level that will be somewhat maintained in Merck, and it of course will drift depending on product launches that can go up. And if we are not in such a situation, it should be somewhere around this 25%.</p>
          <p>With this, ladies and gentlemen, let me move to page number 21, where we explain the guidance. As said  in last quarter, key focus of the guidance is the group. We give you indication at the divisional level as well, which should be an orientation. So here we have adjusted Consumer Health to the lower ends of the previous guidance, i.e., &#x20AC;60 million. Before it was &#x20AC;60 million to &#x20AC;65 million, and the &#x20AC;60 million, therefore, is the direction we take. If it's &#x20AC;2 million above or below &#x2013; is rounding.</p>
          <p>Performance Materials, on the back of the strong third quarter, we have upgraded our guidance here to &#x20AC;700 million, and the same we have done for Merck Millipore. At group level, please understand that revenues have been adjusted to &#x20AC;10.9 million, &#x20AC;11 million, (sic) [&#x20AC;10.9 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion] (26:36) and as far as EBITDA is concerned, I think we have been pretty much on the spot already in the previous guidance. However, on the back of the good third quarter results, we are now capable of moving to the upper ends of the corridor, even though we had to adjust our U.S. dollar currency from $1.25 to $1.29.</p>
          <p>So six weeks down the road, I think this is the numbers that are pretty hard, and with everything we know, we conclude and consider that we will land year-end in this corridor. Of course, we are not excluded from external events that always might happen, but from what we see right now, this is pretty much what we consider for full-year.</p>
          <p>And with this, we open the call to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is with regards to the Liquid Crystals division. We clearly understand that the very nice performance in Q3 is not sustainable for next quarter and after. But can you give us more color regarding the profitability of the business in China versus the U.S. and Europe, and what could be the implication mid-term, long-term?</p>
          <p>Also, I have a question on Merck Serono and sustainability of the pricing for Rebif in the U.S. Because we understand that the volume growth is low to mid-single-digit there and the rest of the 20% organic growth then is pricing, is it possible to continue to benefit from material price hike there?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on your debt reduction. What are the implications for the financial cost? And also is there any impact for the dividend and the other, let's say, topics regarding the flexibility of the financing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. As far as it comes to Liquid Crystals, I kindly ask for your understanding that we don't provide country numbers in terms of profitability. As you know, our business in Liquid Crystals is Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China, and these four countries make up for the numbers. What we see at the moment is the long expected and foreshadowed buildup of capacities in China, and therefore the Chinese part of the franchise is growing while we see corresponding changes in the other markets.</p>
          <p>And as far as the margin is concerned, as already was mentioned, there is certainly some amount of pre-ordering, pre-stocking in the process not only for the seasonal business at the end of the year, but also when you start productions, as it's happening in China you need a certain amount of pre-stocking, and that's the reason why we said &#x2013; Matthias has said clearly, 31% is not a sustainable margin going forward, 31% gross.</p>
          <p>If it comes to the pricing of Rebif in the United States, we have a very clear way forward. The price, the strategy, reflecting number one, the dynamics of the competitive environment; second, the value the product brings to the patients. And that is exactly the way we will do our pricing policy also going forward, and we ask for your understanding that it will be not more specific now on that one.</p>
          <p>A tough one to Matthias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the only thing I would like to say on Rebif is other competitors have posted price increases, as well, like Avonex <mark type="ph" /> and a few (31:43). It's basically also in the second quarter, and therefore in the third quarter just benefited from the price increase we had posted in the second quarter at the end. And this is something that still rolls through in third quarter and, of course, fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But please take also note of the fact that in the U.S. we had some good volume momentum also due to wholesalers stocking up. So that is something that you should not fast-forward for the fourth quarter. And everything else on the pricing, I think Karl made the clear statements. We have to look into the markets. As you know, a lot is moving there, and that is something that we simply have to take into consideration as we go ahead.</p>
          <p>On net debt, you see in the fourth quarter a moderate coupon of &#x20AC;500 million that is exiting the balance sheet, and here we have given precise coupon indications in the capital markets presentation that I gave in May. The high coupon, however, will be due next year in the fourth quarter of &#x20AC;750 million. Again the plan is to repay that completely. And here we have a coupon in the high 4 percentage points, I think 4.875%, something around that, and for that very reason, our financial expenses on the bond side will of course reduce.</p>
          <p>As far as divi is concerned, we clearly made the statement that this is a year where the likelihood that we'd do something like the previous year is not very high in a year where we have focused on restructuring. We stated, don't expect too much on the dividends. That's point number one. And point number two, the dividend decision in German corporates normally is taken in the first quarter of the year when the annual financial statements will be decided upon, and therefore comments on the divi will only be made once this meeting has been completed.</p>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Sachin Jain from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Bank of America. Three quick questions, please. First on Liquid Crystals, I wonder if you're able to quantify at all for us the extent of inventory moves and how should we think about the de-stock that you're referencing in the first quarter of next year?</p>
          <p>Second question, on R&amp;D, if Annalisa is on the line, on Stimuvax. As we get closer to the year, final data, I wonder if you could remind us of what statistical plan has been agreed with the FDA given the three cohorts of patients around the clinical hold?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is actually on the 2014 guidance you issued earlier in this year. Given the strength in Rebif in emerging markets here today, it looks like Merck Serono for this year will be running in and around the 5.9% range. Clearly your guidance for Merck Serono in 2014 earlier in the year was 5.7% to 5.9%. I understand that we've had some FX benefit this year, but outside of that, how do I think about that 2014 Merck Serono sales target now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>So, hello, Sachin. So let me take first of all the Liquid Crystals question and the 2014 question on the growth rates. As far as LC is concerned, it's pretty difficult to discuss with your customer how much does he stock up and how much is for organic sales. They don't give you this kind of indication. But, of course, especially for China, we see that here a lot of capacity, production lines came on stream. By the way, in the last 12 months, I've always taken note that people are announcing the &#x2013; all that little production lines. As a matter of fact, substantial capacities went on stream on Liquid Crystals, which were not reported and not communicated because they were not as much highlighted.</p>
          <p>So now these Liquid Crystals production lines come on stream. The display production lines, which use Liquid Crystals come on stream, and we see that they are ramping up already with 100% utilization rate, which is normally not reflection of the customer uptick. And for that very reason, we are happy that Liquid Crystals volumes are significantly ramping up, but we see simply that not everything is entering into the market. So for that very reason, we give the cautiousness on Q1, because in Q1, beginning of the year, you always have the festivities in China, Chinese New Year, And then our view is that here the sales momentum will go down, and therefore you will see softness in Q1 with Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>But unfortunately, our customer when ordering doesn't tick the box. This is for the client, this is for our stocks, and this is for over-safety stocks. Unfortunately we don't have this level of granularity. Then on 2014, my clear point is, when we communicated our 2014 target, we did that with currencies of &#x20AC;1.35 to the $1.00. We did that with the fact that royalties are going to come down and that will start already in 2013 onwards. And of course we communicated this knowing that competitors will enter into the market like Aubagio like potentially BG-12, and all of that is something we have to take into consideration.</p>
          <p>So we have not gone out with new high targets. We have not gone out with ultraconservative targets. We've gone out with how we see the business in 2014. We rejoiced about current momentum, but of course it's far too early because to make any changes to what we've said in 2014, the only confirmation I can give to you is we are absolutely on track on what we want to achieve in 2014.</p>
          <p>And with this, I handover to Annalisa Jenkins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. And hello, Sachin. Well, let me make a couple of comments on Stimuvax. So I'll start with the question you asked about the statistical analysis plan. So as you're all aware, we experienced a clinical hold on the program and that led us back to the FDA. And then late 2010, we did agree with the FDA the statistical analysis plan under the FDA, and that led us to increase the patient recruitment in order to be able to restore the power of the study. As you'll recall, we've previously disclosed that this study is powered at 90%. We're looking for a very robust p-value, as you might expect, given the single study. We also discussed with them consistency across the primary endpoint, which of course is overall survival, and some key secondary endpoints. So I think we're satisfied that we know what we're heading for, and, as I say, that was agreed in late 2010 with the FDA.</p>
          <p>It's probably opportune to give you a little bit of an update on where we stand with the study. So we have reached the pre-specified number of events in the statistical analysis plan. We are in the process of cleaning the data. And I'd like to remind everyone that this study did start a number of years ago as a purely paper-based study. And so therefore you can imagine the magnitude of the effort to clean the data until I'm satisfied that we have sufficient quality to lock the database and then to look at the data. And we'd like to update our guidance and ensure that you understand that there will be data available and released early in 2013, That's our current best assessment of where we are to date with the START trial.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Just going back to Liquid Crystals, if I could. I appreciate your view going into 2013 on a volume side. Would you be able to comment on how foreign exchange moves may have impacted the rebates and discounts you were willing to give this year? And how that may help you or not in 2013, if relevant at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so on Liquid Crystals, my feedback would be please look into the overview that we do on currencies and organic growth rates, and you will basically see that we benefited from currencies the most in Liquid Crystals, around about 11%. And here we will not disclose the sensitivity by division, but pretty much the sensitivity of Liquid Crystals is like the group, a little bit more pronounced perhaps.</p>
          <p>And my feedback on the sensitivity analysis, which we issued first in Q2 2011, was that $0.01 of the US$1.00 moves the EBITDA by around about &#x20AC;6 million to &#x20AC;7 million up and down. Of course, this is on an unhedged basis, and so please take note of the fact that our hedging costs we are no longer booking to the segments, but we keep it in corporate. And this is something that you see visible in the corporate segments correspondingly. So that's the point on Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>Your point on the discounting Rebif, I have not fully captured. Can you please reiterate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sorry. I meant, given that your competitors in Liquid Crystals do potentially bill in other currencies, how that may have impacted your willingness to discount this year and how you might be able to reclaim that next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for repeating. This is something that predominantly is helping us in one particular market, in Japan, where we were in the past, especially in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, were badly impacted by the Japanese yen being at  &#xA5;170, &#xA5;175. Now the Japanese yen is around &#xA5;100s. We invoice in Japanese yen, and for that very reason, we don't complain. What we also, however, do is, we protect ourselves in hedging or through financial derivatives. As exporting country &#x2013; exporting company, we protect ourselves already today for the next three years to come.</p>
          <p>And Japanese yen, that is one area that drives hedging losses. We, of course, have contracted forwards in Japanese yen already at &#xA5;120, &#xA5;115, one, two years ago, because that is something that we always want to lock in. So the profitable implications we absolutely have in the course of 2012; this is what I highlighted before. But the specific situation on Japan is not that fundamental to the group because Japan is the smallest market of the key markets on Liquid Crystals.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three quick questions, please. I wonder if you could help us a little bit on the drag of the pigments business, so that we can just understand what is happening to the business excluding Liquid Crystals? Secondly, a small technical one, I wonder if you could give us your best guess for the tax rate we should be looking for for 2013, 2014. Is 25.5% a reasonable rate to be going forwards?</p>
          <p>And looking at your cash flow, I wonder if I can push you here. You say that we're perhaps &#x20AC;500 million to a &#x20AC;1 billion light or too heavy in our expectation of net debt. I'm assuming that's for the end of 2012. If you look out at analysts' expectations for 2013, do you see the same sort of thing? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether this is a timing issue, because in 2013 you'll be paying out more of the restructuring charges that perhaps you're accumulating this year, but they actually get paid out in 2013. Or whether we've just completely misunderstood your level of working capital requirements going forwards?</p>
          <p>And I wonder if you could tell us what your priorities are for using this cash flow, whether, for example, you'll be looking to take more of your pension reserves off balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jo, thank you very much for your questions. Let's come to your drag question first. The pigments industry is basically going down everywhere. So it's not only a drag for us, it's also a drag for the entire industry. And this pretty much has to do with the coatings, pigments that we sell to the automotive industry, which is a big share of the pigment business.</p>
          <p>And here, by and large, the pigment industry, at least in Continental Europe, has gone down by roughly in volume terms between 10% and 20%. And for that very reason, industrial-wise, pigment has not had the best quarter. And that is very likely to continue in the next two quarters, because here the indications from the automotive industry is pretty negative.</p>
          <p>As far as the second piece of pigments is concern, the cosmetics business, which we also have, business relatively stable, and for that very reason, we're not suffering as much as other pigment producers are. But of course here in this industry-wise, our end industry does drag the pigments business down. This has been fortunately completely wiped away by the giant other business unit in Performance Materials, which is Liquid Crystals. So for that very reason, the drag here did not became obvious.</p>
          <p>Now, let's come to the tax rate. This year, as I indicated in Q2 already, we have a clear distortion of the tax rates due to the one-timers. And for that very reason, the reported tax rate to you might be on the higher side, but I think there is something that you understand also from other companies, when they go through significant turnarounds and have one-timers, that they are not always working out in the reported tax rate of the group. This is something that is more, however, changing and to some extent even reversing in course of 2013 and 2014, so there, even though we will still have one-time costs, you should see that the tax rate more comes to the underlying tax rate that you've mentioned, i.e., in the corridor of 25% to 26%.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the very details with follow-up questions on cash flow. My point here on the cash flow is indeed the working capital. We have not announced any working capital targets in May. As you recall, the question was raised in the Capital Markets Day event. At that point in time, we, however, focused very much on the cost initiatives, and said we will address that. But as a matter of fact, we did not put too much priority on it.</p>
          <p>So here I clearly have to say we advanced far better than anticipated, and from the change in percentage I gave to you, i.e., moving from 30% to sales to 25% of sales &#x2013; and this is something that somewhat should be maintained, give and take 1 percentage point. You will automatically see that net debt should be changed not only for 2012 but also ongoing. So of course I don't make the statement because I assume that next year will not be impacted by cash outflow restructuring. This is a statement embedded in my feedback.</p>
          <p>So the reduction in net debt because of working capital is something that I clearly would like to allude to. It has not been taken up after the Q2 call, when we already reduced indebtedness. And now after the second time of delivery on working capital, my feedback is please blend in this improvement on working capital, but don't blend in more than I've guided with the 25%.</p>
          <p>Now on the priorities. On cash, I think the generation here &#x2013; the cash generation will be clearly used for focusing on the paying all the restructuring projects, and we are clearly stating to the organization that cash is not hampering restructuring initiatives. We focus on further deleveraging and cleaning up the balance sheets. We are a dividend paying company, and of course in second quarter next year, we will pay again our dividends.</p>
          <p>And of course what I would also like to stress, we might look at pensions as well. This is something that we did last year. Last year was something which was truly exceptional, but this is something in light of interest rates, which are going down, and therefore a nominal-wise increase, the pension accruals, this is something we might also on an ordinary basis look into when we close our books in the fourth quarter this year. So this, therefore, doesn't change the way we allocate our cash, too, right now.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, just one going back to Liquid Crystals. Just wondering if you could update us on any new technologies that might impact on 2013 that you may launch in the LCD space? And then following on from that, just looking at the Epson deal that you announced earlier in October. Just wondering if you could give us an idea what that brings to your competitive position in OLEDs and how that's shaping up for the future?</p>
          <p>And then a couple of pipeline questions. Just I noticed you've got the Atacicept data in-house, but seem to be looking for a straight presentation at a medical conference. I wondered if you could update us on what you've seen there and how the data looks on that product? And then on TH-302, just to get your perspectives on the pancreatic Phase III trial that you're going to commence in the light of the Abraxane data that's just been announced with a positive overall survival benefit for that product. How does that affect your plans for TH-302? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. So I will take the part on Liquid Crystals and OLED, and then pass on to Annalisa. We are constantly working on new technologies. But new technologies in Liquid Crystals is not something you introduce and then it's on the market. It needs approval by the customer, testing by the customer, so it's a long-term process. The technologies we are working on currently will not materialize into business in 2013. Still, of course with the existing technology such as PS-VA and IPS, it will add a lot of improvement, different mixing technologies we are working on, which are business as usual in Liquid Crystals. And they will, of course, help with the business in 2013.</p>
          <p>The Epson deal, from my perspective, is an important deal. Up to now, the production processes in OLED technologies are based on vaporization. And vaporization, if it comes to bigger displays, the masks have to be bigger, so a lot of material's lost during the process. So going forward, we strongly believe that the printing technology will be the technology for the future, in particular if it comes to bigger sizes of displays.</p>
          <p>For printing technology, you need ink. What we have been doing up to now, we have been supplying the materials to printing companies, but what the customers want is the materials placed into ink. The deal with Epson now provides that we learn from Epson how to transform our materials in printable ink, and then can supply the ink to the printing companies going forward. So this places us really on the forefront of material suppliers into the future OLED industry.</p>
          <p>With this, I pass on to Annalisa.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So good afternoon, Richard, and thanks for your questions. I'll take the Atacicept question first, and then move on to Threshold. So, yeah, Atacicept, if you recall, the program originally set out with the study that was designed as an adaptive Phase II/III pivotal study in a broad lupus population. If you remember, this is a prevention of flare design, typical prevention of flare design. You'll also recall that due to a couple of safety events, the high-dose arm was prematurely discontinued, although there were a number of patients who had proceeded through that arm prior to the discontinuation of the arm.</p>
          <p>So at the moment, what I would say is that we are in the middle, actually, of analyzing the broad data set. So obviously, we have a combination of the primary endpoint, which, as I say, is the prevention of flare. But there were a number of very significant biomarker data sets. So we are currently taking a look at that, and we will be able to, as you noted, actually, be able to share those publicly in the early part of next year at one of the key scientific congresses. And we're currently taking a look at the go/no-go criteria for moving forward on this program.</p>
          <p>So let me just move on to the Threshold question, and obviously the question around the recent data that was released by Celgene. So an initial observation is that, of course, there was a press release on this study, which has been going on for quite some time as Celgene acquired this asset from Abraxis. And as you know, a very large population, sample size was increased to about 900 patients, if I recall. So it's extremely difficult for us to really predict the magnitude of the benefit that they've proportionately seen. And I think what I would say is that we're all going to have to sit and wait until the ASCO-GI conference in San Francisco at the end of January to see exactly what the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint of the study looks like.</p>
          <p>But as such, we believe that currently as designed our Phase III study that we have described is against the current standard of care. Of course it also reflects what we tested in Phase II. We are under SPA, and therefore at this point we continue to pursue that as our primary pivotal study. I think our partners, Threshold, just recently commented that of course in our plan we had our eye on the Abraxane data. And we do have in our plans for 2013 an exploratory Phase I study, where we will be asking the initial question about the combination of TH-302 with Abraxane, potentially plus or minus gemcitabine. So that is in our plans for next year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just two small questions left. On Consumer Health Care, you mentioned regulated sales reductions. Could you maybe give us a rough number, as a percentage, how much is paid out of pocket and how much is reimbursed for that division by the government? And the second question, on emerging markets. Maybe you could talk a bit on the slight &#x2013; slower growth there for Merck Serono in the quarter, and whether that might be picking up next quarter or needs to annualize? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much, Mr. Blum. So I think generally you should assume that this is out of pocket products. So of course we have some &#x2013; that products which are not qualifying for the statement, but by and large, it's simplified as consumer costs. The point that I would like to make on emerging markets is of course we had very, very good momentum in the last several quarters, and therefore I think compared to emerging markets industry, we performed even better. While in the European competitive players, we had softness in the emerging markets momentum.</p>
          <p>Therefore the 4.4% that we have posted in the third quarter is, I think, a decent one, but it doesn't change the underlying growth rate that we had on average in course of 2012, which was in the high single-digit. So we are basically remaining in this ballpark for the emerging markets. Please understand that sometimes you have good tender business, sometimes small, mediocre tender business, and it sometimes leads to certain bigger volatility in this particular region compared to other regions around the globe.</p>

I would highly appreciate if all of you could make your way to Molsheim on the fourth and fifth of December where we will host a very down to earth information day on Merck Millipore. It's not big about financials, anything. It will only focus on the industry and where we stand in Merck Millipore, because we understand out of the last one and a half years that there's a clear desire to upgrade the information on the Merck Millipore, and we would like to give you transparency so that you understand how beautiful this business is. And therefore, if you make your way to Molsheim, we would be extremely happy, and therefore please register with IR to participate.</p>
          <p>On behalf of the entire company and the management board, we thank you for your interest in Merck, and hopefully we will see you on the road. Thank you, very much. Bye-bye.</p>
