          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bab, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Kelcey Hoyt, Director-Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bab. Good morning and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the third quarter including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes $0.04 of net earnings per share related to an income tax benefit partially offset by a pension settlement charge and cost reduction charges primarily related to severance and business restructurings in Europe within both the industrial gas and surface technologies businesses. The tax benefit and charges are detailed and reconciled to the GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Jim and I will now review Praxair's third quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kelcey and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide three for our consolidated third quarter results. Praxair delivered strong results in the third quarter despite significant currency headwinds and moderating economic conditions. While year-over-year reported sales declined by about 4%, we were able to maintain relatively even operating profit and earnings per share. The impact of currency on sales was 7% plus another 1% from lower cost pass-through of natural gas to the selling price of hydrogen.</p>
          <p>Excluding foreign currency and costs pass-through, sales would have been up 4% and operating profit and EPS up 7%. This demonstrates that we're still able to get leverage down the income statement from improving productivity and strong cash flow and return on capital.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow was a record $746 million, representing about 27% of sales and capital spending against our project backlog totaled $547 million. Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 51.6% and debt to EBITDA was 1.9 times. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $164 million and repurchased stock of $106 million net of issuances.</p>
          <p>$1.2 billion still remains available under the share repurchase program authorized in January of this year. After-tax return on capital is 14.2% and reflects the large amount of projects under construction and therefore a significant amount of project capital on our balance sheet that is not yet completed. Return on equity was 29.2%.</p>
          <p>And now I'll let Kelcey explain in more detail our third quarter results by segment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Please turn to page four for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% below the prior year quarter. The effects of cost pass-through, primarily lower cost natural gas which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers reduced sales by 4%.</p>
          <p>Negative currency translation driven by the devaluation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar reduced sales by 2%. Sales grew 4% from higher pricing and acquisitions of packaged gas distributors. Underlying energy market sales in North America grew 6% year-over-year. This was driven by our on-site supply assistance to refineries, the majority of which are in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.</p>
          <p>In addition, our oil well service business in Mexico continues to run at very high levels and delivered solid volume growth in Mexico providing liquid nitrogen and pressure pumping services to the oil and gas sector. Sequential energy market sales grew 4% with the typical third quarter seasonal pickup in our supply of liquid nitrogen for fracking for natural gas liquids and oil in the Alberta region of Canada due to improved weather and road conditions.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth to metals customers was solid at 5% year-over-year. This was due to continued steady liquid argon sales for stainless steel and metal fabrication as well as oxygen sales on our pipelines in the northern United States to steel mills. Regarding chemicals, the fundamentals for North American production remain advantaged with plentiful low cost natural gas as a feedstock.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we did experienced some lower volumes due to scheduled customer maintenance and the environment remains cautious in light of the slowing global economic growth. Underlying manufacturing sales grew 7% year-over-year with growth in all three countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico. Packaged gas sales remained healthy in line with manufacturing strengths.</p>
          <p>In Praxair Distribution, our Canadian and U.S. packaged gas business, same-store sales which excludes currency and acquisitions were 5% above the last year. Gases were up 5% and hard goods were up 6%. Packaged gas primarily serves the manufacturing market, but sales were also strong year-over-year to metal fabrication, automotive and energy in support of customer activity in the Bakken and Eagle Ford regions. Sequentially, sales modestly declined as growth began to moderate to metal fabrication and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>The pipeline of activity for potential further packaged gas acquisitions remains strong. Year-to-date we've closed four acquisitions in Texas, California and New York, as well as formed a joint venture with one of our long-term distributors nexAir in the Southeast United States.</p>
          <p>North American operating profit was $374 million, 10% above the prior year quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, operating profit would have grown 12% from the prior year quarter. The operating margin was 26.9% reflecting higher pricing and productivity, which more than offset cost increases. In addition, lower cost pass-through which reduced sales with minimal impact on operating profit contributed about 1% to the operating margin percentage for the quarter versus prior year.</p>
          <p>44% of our large project backlog with long-term contracts is in North America. We are constructing 12 projects with customers across the United States, Canada and Mexico for energy, chemicals, metals and manufacturing industries. In 2013, we are on track to start the two large hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur and the hydrogen expansion to serve Motiva in Louisiana.</p>
          <p>In addition, 2013 customer plant startups will include oxygen supply in the Southeast United States, as well as two plants in Canada. 2014 includes a plant startup for Deacero in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America is increasing and we are seeing activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals markets.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page five for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe decreased 2% for the third quarter versus 2011. The weaker euro reduced sales by 13%. The sales increase from acquisition is due to an increased ownership interest in Yara Praxair located in Scandinavia, which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2011. Underlying sales were down 1% versus the prior year as 2% lower volumes offset the higher pricing attained across all of our operating countries.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Spain and Italy were below the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to merchant and packaged gases. Germany experienced modestly decreased volumes as customer demand has weakened due to lower industrial economic activity. Sequentially, volumes declined 4% versus the second quarter with the typical summer holiday seasonality extending into continued lower levels of demand.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of $60 million was 12% below the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and currency, underlying operating profit decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower sales volumes partially offset by improved pricing.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we took further action to right-size the cost structure of our European business to reflect expected longer term slower growth in the region, especially Southern Europe, $36 million of our $56 million cost reduction charge related to the Europe segment, for employee severance costs and business restructuring actions, including consolidation of packaged gas filling stations. We are expecting about a two-and-a-half to three-year payback.</p>
          <p>Page six shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $516 million, down 15% from the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 1% for the quarter, primarily due to higher pricing partially offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 17% in the quarter. Higher volumes from new onsite production facilities were more than offset by lower volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers largely attributable to the weaker industrial production in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year sales increased to metals and healthcare customers and were lower to manufacturing and chemicals customers. Sequentially, underlying sales were up 2% for the quarter, driven by higher pricing with steady volumes. Negative currency impact reduced sales by 3% in the third quarter versus the second. About 20% of Praxair sales in South America come from countries outside of Brazil, including Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. Underlying sales in these countries grew 11% versus the prior year quarter and 6% sequentially, with growth in chemicals, food and beverage, healthcare and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in South America was $112 million, 20% below the prior year quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation impact of 18%. Ex-currency, operating profit was down 2% compared to the prior year as higher pricing was more than offset by the impact of a lower mix of higher margin packaged gas and merchant liquid volumes.</p>
          <p>The third quarter of this year was Brazil's fourth consecutive quarter of negative industrial production year-over-year, although the sequential industrial production numbers are beginning to show some slight improvement. Current Brazil Central Bank consensus industrial production for the full year 2012 remains negative; 2013 consensus industrial production is currently about 4%. The government continues to exercise stimulus levers to increase demand including decreasing the interest rate again in October to a record low of 7.25%, which now results in a record low real interest rate as well of about 2%.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Brazilian government recently announced a reduction in taxes on power to benefit both consumers and businesses that will go into affect beginning in 2013. We continue to remain very positive on Brazil in the medium to long-term, given the strong growth fundamentals in place as it continues to transition from an export-driven economy to a more local consumption-driven market with a growing middle class.</p>
          <p>In addition, there should be quite a bit of pent-up demand for infrastructure build out in front of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. We continue to see strong new project proposal activity. This demonstrates the confidence of local businesses in the longer-term growth. Proposal activity is broad-based across South America and Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, primarily in energy, manufacturing and metals.</p>
          <p>South America currently has seven projects in the backlog across four countries, which include Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay, in diverse industries such metals, chemicals and manufacturing. These projects are scheduled to start up during 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $358 million grew 3% versus the prior-year quarter. Volume growth of 5% came primarily from higher on-site sales in China and Korea including new plant startups from metals and chemicals customers in China. Overall growth was mitigated by lower demand from the electronics end market including semiconductor, flat panel displays and solar customers.</p>
          <p>Lower merchant and packaged gas pricing primarily due to the electronics end market reduced sales by 1% from the prior-year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue in the near term.</p>
          <p>Electronics demand remains weaker than expected. Approximately 75% of our electronics market sales are to the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor sales continued to experience negative year-over-year growth during the third quarter and were flat sequentially due to the sluggish PC market. The solar industry continues to struggle with overcapacity and China has about 50% of the global manufacturing capacity. Polysilicon and wafer prices continue to decline.</p>
          <p>Negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar reduced sales by 4% in the quarter. Cost pass-through increased sales by 3% during the quarter, primarily driven by higher India power pass-through in on-site sales.</p>
          <p>Asia's operating profit of $52 million declined 6% from the prior-year quarter excluding the impact of negative currency translations. Lower price decreased operating profit by about 3% primarily for argon and silane pricing.</p>
          <p>In addition, we experienced seasonally higher power cost in Korea. The rates reset at an increase each year in the third quarter and cost recovery is typically delayed. And in Thailand, our food freezing business margin was impacted by low shrimp yields due to a shrimp disease causing a decline in higher margin merchant CO2 volumes that are used for freezing.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we signed a long-term contract with Oxiranchem to construct and operate an air separation plant with a capacity of 500 tons per day of oxygen to supply their chemical facility located just north of Shanghai. The plant is scheduled to start up in 2014 and will also supply oxygen and nitrogen to the Yangzhou Chemical Industry Park.</p>
          <p>Our backlog of projects in Asia is continuing to grow with 17 projects in China, India, Korea and the Middle East that will start up between the fourth quarter this year and into 2015.</p>
          <p>New project activity for the region remains strong. We have not seen any weakening in the negotiation and bidding process for new project activity. The growth continues to be driven by longer-term secular growth needs. This includes China's policy for more energy independence and the utilization of abundant coal supplies for gasification as a feedstock for the chemical industry. We build, own, and operate world-scale oxygen plants for use in the gasification process.</p>
          <p>Also, China's focused on spreading the wealth to the central and western part of China, not just on the east coast, and we have a large project under construction in Chongqing in the center of China which is going to be strong growth for us when it starts up in 2014. And with emerging economies in general, the per capita consumption of industrial gases is only a small percent of what it is in the United States and Europe which as they develop over time will utilize more and more industrial gases.</p>
          <p>Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page 8. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $157 million, up 2% compared to the prior year excluding currency. The underlying sales growth came from increased aerospace coatings and increased coatings for energy markets particularly coatings for parts used in the oil and gas market.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $25 million for the quarter. Higher volumes and leverage from improved pricing increased operating profit. These benefits were more than offset in the quarter by negative currency translation impacts of 8%. During the quarter we took action to consolidate and rationalize certain operations and product lines primarily in Germany and Italy in the weak industrial coatings sector. $16 million of our $56 million cost reduction charge related to the Surface Technologies segment.</p>
          <p>We are expecting about a two-year payback.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn the call back to Jim who will discuss our outlook and updated earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to slide nine for our updated outlook. North America again led the way with operating profit of 10% in spite of a 2% currency headwind from Canada and Mexico. Year-to-date business conditions have been much stronger than the rest of the world, although we have seen the strong ramp up in 2011 and the first half of 2012 moderate during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we've seen no improvement in Europe or South America. The slowdown in China is not only hurting our results in Asia, but also South America as exports of raw materials to Asia has slowed. In the near term, producers and consumers along supply chains are becoming more cautious and reducing inventories. We expect there will be more inventory correction in the fourth quarter and are anticipating extended holiday shutdowns. Hence, we decided to reduce our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter to $1.35 to $1.40 of fully diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>In order to continue to right-size our organization, we undertook modest restructuring in Brazil in the first and second quarters and further restructuring actions in our European industrial gases and Surface Technology businesses during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our long-term outlook remains positive. We estimate our capital spending forecast for 2012 to be about $2.2 billion against a current backlog of $2.6 billion of projects under construction with committed customer contracts. As these projects start up over the next two to three years, they'll contribute to sales and earnings growth. Over the long term, we expect to earn around 4% to 6% top line sales growth from the contribution of new projects.</p>
          <p>In addition, we add new merchant and packaged gas business with organic growth driven by a strong pipeline of new application technologies as well as the migration of existing application technologies globally. We do expect that future global economic growth will be slower but that our secular growth drivers in energy, environment, and emerging markets still have long legs.</p>
          <p>We believe our strategy of focusing on our core business and execution capabilities will continue to drive strong margins, cash flow and return on capital. And as you can see from our history of annual dividend increases and share repurchases, we're focused on delivering those results to our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn to this call over to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Please try to limit yourself to one question and if needed a quick follow up for clarification. That way, more people can get a chance to ask questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please, proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, your North American volume growth this year in the first three quarters sort of declined or decelerated from 7% growth to 4% to 0%. And last time that happened was in 2008. So what are you seeing? Are you seeing that other regions are dragging down U.S. growth? And was this &#x2013; your on-site seemed okay. So was it mostly from merchant that dragged down the growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think that in 2011, really end of 2010, 2011 and the first half of 2012, North America really climbed out of the recession and we finally got our base business, same-store sales in packaged gases back to pre-2008 levels.</p>
          <p>As we moved into the third quarter, the sequential growth was limited. We had some turnarounds and so forth, so our minus 1% Q3 versus Q2 really is not meaningful of anything. But we're definitely seeing the ramp up that we saw over the last year-and-a-half slowing down and I think that's tied to consumers. If you look at Caterpillar's results, they mentioned that dealers of farm equipment are reducing inventories. I think that's the kind of thing that you're seeing across the board.</p>
          <p>Now I don't think it's at all like 2008. I think it's just probably a six-month period of caution in the third and fourth quarters as we wait to see who gets elected and what happens to the fiscal cliff. But there's been some deferral in people making decisions to build things and that's kind of flattened out the growth in the packaged and merchant business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just secondly, have you seen any project delays or slowdown like what some of your competitors are seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I guess I would say this, the projects that we have in our backlog and under construction, there is no change in the status of those projects. They've got contractual commitments. The customers are going ahead and completing the facilities that we're going to be supplying and we have language in those contracts where within a certain period of time, we startup the plant and they start paying us. So the stuff in the backlog is unchanged aside from a few that we started up in the quarter and a few that we added to the backlog.</p>
          <p>Now in the category that I'd call, projects under proposal or negotiation, that continues to be very strong. We have not seen customers who had been talking about projects and looking for proposals, We have not seen them defer the projects that they're on. Sometimes it takes a long time for people to make decisions. We may yet see some deferral, but we haven't yet, and I think that's largely because most of the projects that we're negotiating and building right now are really projects that are required by the customer for more secular reasons rather than economic reasons.</p>
          <p>So, for example, we started up our last steel project in China in July and there's really virtually no steel in the backlog. So if there's a slowdown in steel consumption, it's really not going to affect the backlog all that much or the active projects either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. You talked about the bidding for the projects under proposal still being strong. Are you still seeing the same kind of discipline in the pricing that competitors would be giving for those projects or have you seen some of the slowness in the economy start to affect maybe the returns that some competitors might take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By and large, I think that what happens in the on-site business is that you make a contract with a customer and you live with that return for 15 years or 20 years and &#x2013; so there's no reason to go in and try to take a loss leader and think you'll make it back later on.</p>
          <p>So, I think that's the way we look at the projects. We haven't seen any real change in the marketplace in terms of competitive dynamics. It's a very competitive industry, but we really haven't seen it change. And the returns on capital of the projects that we're signing are basically as good or as high as the ones that we've signed in the past. Having said that, I'll say that the smaller projects tend to &#x2013; where we're in a very niche position, tend to have the highest returns and the larger standalone projects tend to have returns in the mid &#x2013;  the low to mid-teens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then again, given kind of the projects under proposal, $2.6 billion in backlog, is it fair to assume that it's still a decent bet that CapEx is up next year versus this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't given guidance for CapEx next year. We'll be spending close to $2.2 billion this year and the quarter just ended was the highest CapEx we've had. I don't expect it to go up next year. I expect it to probably go down a little bit. But we're in heavy spending right now on three steam methane reformers. We're in the heavy spending part of the cycle and they're going to start up in the first half of 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the FX side, are you doing any currency hedging at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Any currency hedging?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, currency hedging, not much of anything right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on packaged gases, did you provide a breakdown between price versus volume or rent versus hard goods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think both the gas volumes and hard goods were up roughly 5% or 6%. And so that what you've seen there is that as we came out of the recession, the hard goods growth was much faster than the gas growth and that was &#x2013; when you go back into a recession, hard goods goes lower because people stop buying welding equipment.</p>
          <p>So now, we're in kind of an equilibrium with both growing the same amount, within that 5%, roughly half price and half volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in Europe, Europe is down to about 13% of revenues and it's only about 10% of your operating profit at this point. Given that you might be thinking that this might be a long slog there, are you seeing additional opportunities for more substantial restructuring there, other than the right-sizing actions that you've taken, such as asset swaps or divestitures, selective actions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not planning on any divestitures or swaps or any type of transactions like that in Europe. It's certainly something that could come down the road, but we're not planning anything like that. And basically, in the 2008 recession, we did a fair amount of cost cutting. But one of the rules that we had was that we weren't going to take out any capacity so that we would still have that capacity when the volumes came back.</p>
          <p>We've now come to the conclusion in Europe that some of the demand is never going to come back and that is specifically in Spain and Italy in the packaged gas business, where I think construction in Spain was driven very rapidly by the lower interest rates when they got into the Eurozone, subsidies from the European Union and a number of other things that basically drove construction which aren't there anymore.</p>
          <p>So we concluded that we have too much capacity in packaged gases and we're rationalizing these infill stations. And so that's all we can do right now without cutting into volume and so forth.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In regards to your long-term growth targets, can you just tell us how you feel about those targets now that maybe the macro environment might be a bit more sluggish than expected when you last laid those out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that parts of our growth that we have control over, which is basically applications technology and the projects. I think they're pretty well still intact. Now, we've always said that some of the growth will come from just general increases in industrial production globally. I agree with what you're saying: I think that for the next 10 years, industrial production will be slower than it was for the last 10: who knows? But, so that will probably temper some of the growth there. But we're not going to wait for a rising tide to hit our earnings goals, so we'll continue to focus on productivity and pricing and restructure bit by bit as we have to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then one follow up on the PDI business. Can you give us some color on the recent trends as far as maybe how those progressed throughout the quarter and your expectations here, given the more uncertain macro environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm guessing that in &#x2013; we'll have relatively flattish volumes sequentially going from &#x2013; well, going the second to the third quarter, also from the third to the fourth quarter. And that's just kind of an over-the-top guess, because I do think that as we get into the holiday season, it is always difficult to predict, but in times when there's a little bit of excess capacity and not enough demand, people tend to take longer shutdowns at year end. In times when it's the reverse, then they work right through the holiday season. But I'm just expecting this quarter that we're going to have more people rationalizing.</p>

          <p>Hey Jim, just trying to think of what kind of earnings tailwind you get next year from all these new projects. Even with sluggish IP, these new projects contribute a lot. I know you used to be more precise in terms of EPS contribution. Can you give us some help on that front?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't really come out with any guidance there. In fact, next week we've got our folks in from around the world to put together our overall plan for next year.</p>
          <p>So, we don't have any kind of bottoms up look at that, but I would say that we're going to expect North America to continue to lead the way. We're going to continue to get pretty significant growth from projects startups in North America. And then we really need to get &#x2013; we really need to get Europe and South America out of the tank, but some of that is going to depend on what happens with the current slowdowns there. But generally speaking, I think I'll go out and give you some guidance that we'll have sales growth in the 5% to 10% range without acquisitions, maybe more with some acquisitions and we'll get earnings growth in the double digit area again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know in the past you've talked maybe about five percentage points of growth just from the new projects alone. Is that still a relevant number or there a pick up next year with some of these new SMRs in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We typically get about 4% to 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we typically get 4% to 6%. We'll get probably more than that next year, but because we have got a lot of projects starting up. Because it's usually about a three-year gestation period on these projects and the projects that would have been signed in 2009 would be starting up in 2012. But because of the recession, there was a big lull in project signings and now we're experiencing the lull in startups, but we've got a lot more starting up next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one follow-up. Some of your competitors have talked about a heightened level of competitive activity in the U.S. liquid market, are you seeing any evidence of that and just as, did you mention what your LIN/LOX operating rate was in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the merchant market's fine. We, we're doing very well in the merchant market. You got liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and you've also got argon and helium and liquid hydrogen in there. And to some extent you also have the gases used for fracing, liquid nitrogen and liquid CO2. And so sometimes depending on the fracing and the weather you'll see it kind of spikes up that come in the merchant side.</p>
          <p>I think we've all seen a decline in liquid hydrogen partially attributable to the end of the space shuttle, okay? So there are things like that are going on and, but I think that overall we'll continue to see merchant demand grow faster than industrial production.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of questions on Brazil, you referenced sort of a 4% consensus industrial production number for 2013. Is that consistent with when you talk to your customers? Are they sort of expecting something along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I think that it's been negative this year. I think that when it turns around, you usually see a fair amount of volatility in Brazil. When things slow down, they speed up quickly and there is a big growth. So I could see a number bigger than that if the economy starts to turn around. So I think that we're in pretty good shape there.</p>
          <p>The one thing that I think is on my mind is, to what extent a slowdown in Chinese demand impacts the rest of the world. And China is Brazil's largest trading partner. So I do think we're experiencing a situation where turnaround would have already started to begin, but it's being delayed by decreasing demand from China. And so that's all got to be part of the equation of what happens next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up to that, if we work backwards from the Olympics and the World Cup and the idea that that will stimulate some infrastructure demand, what is sort of the deadline where that needs to start showing up in order for it to be there for those events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they should be working on that stuff and building things now. And Petrobras is also a big driver of construction. They've got so much spending going on. But what slowed down is manufacturing and what slowed down is some of the export business. So it's hard to say but I think you'll see some pickup from those things, but you're also going to see hopefully some pickup in consumer spending and auto and truck production and so forth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. First off with your comments, Jim, about the growth potentially being slower going forward, you mentioned a few of the things you would focus on, but how confident are you longer term or medium term that you'll be able to get operating leverage at those lower levels of growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what &#x2013; you just have to look at our segment results coming out of the recession to see that when we were in the recession, our North America margins were around 20% maybe 18%, 19% and that's because particularly in the merchant and packaged business you didn't have a lot of customers go away but you had a lot of customers taking less demand which means that you had less revenue per delivery of product, if you will.</p>
          <p>As that demand came back, we got a lot of operating leverage in North America. Now what we're seeing in South America and Europe is exactly where we were in North America in 2008 where volume is off and we've got &#x2013; we've been going through negative operating leverage as volume has declined.</p>
          <p>So, if the volume keeps declining more, we'll have to take some more cost out, but I do think that in both Europe and South America that construction and metal fab and machinery and repair activity is probably below equilibrium and will come back to some extent. So, what we want to see is our margins go up there and I think we'll get some operating leverage out of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So relative to your longer term organic growth targets through 2015 of 8% to 12% if that comes in, you still feel confident that the 10% to 15% operating profit and the 12% to 18% EPS is doable between now and then, assuming we're in a normal kind of a slow growth economy, not recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's <mark type="ph" /> July (41:20). I do think that we're going to be in a lower range rather than a higher range as long as you don't get much help from the economy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's certainly possible because, as I said before, we've got a lot of projects starting up in the next 12 months and as they start up, they come out of the backlog. So it will be going down unless we sign a lot of new contracts. But I'm pretty confident that the ones that we're negotiating right now we will win most of, and that over the long run, we'll be able to keep the backlog in the area of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which is what we need to support 4% to 6% sales growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not on allocation. We had a couple of temporary allocations because of the facilities being down, but we've still got a strong supply from the BLM and from the other sources that we supply from. And I think we're the only producer of helium that's not going to keep on allocation right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you mentioned earlier, maybe the next decade looks a little bit different from capital investment in some of the end markets where your customers operate. How would you expect that to manifest through your strategy that just you will spend a few more CapEx dollars and maybe a little more of return of capital to shareholders? Do you change the country focus? Have you sort of come to grips with any big picture issues, or is this just a standard issue macroeconomic cyclical speed bump here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know me, Bob, I'm always down on the pessimistic side, but I just think that we got budget balances and so forth to deal with. I do think that North America economy in the industrial side will be strong. We're seeing an uptick in projects right now, primarily related to the chemical industry. There are about 15 proposed chemical facilities which either need oxygen or nitrogen or CO2, so we're looking at a lot of proposal activity going on in North America.</p>
          <p>So I think that that will be the main driver. I think that we've got a lot of projects going on in South America, both inside of Brazil and outside of Brazil, a lot of projects in Colombia, in Peru and Argentina and so forth and I think that will be strong. Russia, we've probably got more projects than we can manage right now, so we're quickly addressing that. But I think that project outlook will continue to be strong and I don't think that we'll need to reduce our expectations for our capital spending.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You often talk about new projects adding something like 4% to 6% to revenue growth, but if I look at your first three quarters, I think your volumes are up about 2%. So is it the case that really fewer projects came on to affect revenues this year or is it that they came on, but that the underlying industrial gas business across the globe is down a couple of percent? That is, why isn't the underlying volume growth stronger for the amount of new projects that you have coming on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess the first reason is that, while we did startup a few projects this year, we haven't started up that many as I mentioned earlier. 2012 is a lull year for startups, because 2009 was a lull year for signings. Now, we have started the projects up and we're getting the volume and the revenue from them, but our base business volumes in packaged and merchant in Europe are significantly down year-over-year and the same thing in South America. And pricing's down in China, so that's really kind of offset the contribution from the new projects.</p>

          <p>Merchant gas volumes were up some in the third quarter year-over-year. But there were some put and takes inside of that. There was less gas used in fracing than the year before. And that's a big volume swinger. So, we still have strong argon and helium and CO2 volumes.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes. Good morning. Hi, Jim. I just wanted to follow up on merchant gases. If you look back over the past couple of quarters, do you believe that you've picked up any market share in North American merchant gases? If I look at your volumes they seem to be running a bit higher than your principle competitors. Wondering if there are any share shifts or if it might be attributable to mix or other issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess mathematically if our volume is growing faster than theirs, you might come to the conclusion that we must be picking up share, but I certainly don't think we picked up any share that would have been their existing customers. It may be that we've signed new business at a faster rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or I can even put another spin on that which is that it all depends on the customers who you get married to. If you get married to customers who don't grow then you live with that. You get married to customers who grow faster then that's a good place to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it makes sense. I just have a related follow up, your same-store sales and packaged gases look to have run about 200 basis points or so higher than your main competitor there. Is it a similar dynamic that you're enjoying in packaged gases? Jim, maybe you can elaborate on what's going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't speak for what's going on with competitors, but I think our growth rate has been in line with demand growth. And these quarters, they bounce up and down for everybody. You get one new customer or one new project or something like that and it changes the quarter especially when you're looking at 2 percentage points over the whole volume area.</p>
          <p>So I think everybody's doing fine and I think demand is still strong. I don't think it is just growing as fast as it was a year ago, but I think it's still strong and you're going to start to see &#x2013; I think once we get into January and February, more people start buying equipment and building things again.</p>

          <p>Hi. This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on Europe, assuming a more moderate macro environment there in the foreseeable future, I guess what sort of margin target can you reasonably achieve over the next couple of years? Is it closer to 20% or do you think you can get into kind of the mid-20s again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll be disappointed if we don't get it back to at least 20%. I think if we got some help from the economy in Europe then we would see strong operating leverage because we've taken a lot of costs out of our operations, just like we did in the U.S. and I talked about the U.S. before. We took a lot of cost out in 2008 and we didn't add those people back and that's why we're getting so much operating leverage. And I think we're going to see the same thing in both Europe and South America when volumes come back.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just a quick follow up on the aerospace aviation market. That's been a pretty bright spot for you in the recent past. I guess what's your outlook for this area as it pertains to your surface coatings business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Surface coatings has got basically three end markets, one of which is aerospace, that's about 35% of the sales. I think I'm very optimistic and very positive about that. We have contracts with the main jet-makers so that when the aircraft get delivered and they actually put the engines on them we're going to see more demand growth in the aerospace.</p>
          <p>Now, unfortunately offsetting that especially in Europe has been our industrial consumers who are in the printing, in textile, in transmission parts and stuff like that has really been slow in Europe. And that's why we're closing down a couple more plants in Europe this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at the South America business, it's understandable given the weakness that you're seeing in Brazil that you would be highlighting the growth outside Brazil but can you talk about whether there has been a concerted effort to diversify your South American business out of Brazil? And can you just remind us what are your strongest market positions outside Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't say that there has been a concerted effort to kind of change our portfolio. We're kind of agnostic as to what end market we're in and what country we're in as long as we get the right kind of risk-return that we're looking for.</p>
          <p>But as Brazil has gone into a recession; Chile, Peru, Colombia are doing just fine, okay? And Argentina and Venezuela are probably another story, but there is a lot of demand from new projects in many of those countries and for example, there are several projects that refiners are looking at where they don't refine enough low sulfur &#x2013; they don't refine enough diesel to fill all the cars up. And so the countries import diesel and gasoline. So, there are some refinery projects for hydrogen, for low sulfur diesel. There are other metals projects and general manufacturing projects in glass and some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:04) and stuff like that.</p>
          <p>And so those economies are growing and I think we're very well situated in them. We have strong market share, we have excellent talent and &#x2013; they're not that big, but they are a good contributor to growth and high returns for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then looking at the electronics market down 3% year-on-year, but up 1% sequentially. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing right now in that market? How's the visibility on growth as we head into kind of a period where we would normally expect a seasonal build? Any indications on where customer inventories are? Things of that nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not really sure. It's not one of our bigger end markets and I'm hardly the expert in it. But there's clearly been a big, big problem in China and in the polysilicon market and that's just because people expected that thin film panels would be the way of the future and they didn't turn out to be that way and so pricing has fallen and volumes have fallen there and we're all getting hurt by that.</p>
          <p>The reason we had a sequential gain was really our business in Korea. We're a primary supplier to Samsung there and what they tend to do when demand goes down is that they've got some fabs that are wholly-owned fabs and they've got some fabs that are outsourced and they tend to bring the work back home when they need you to keep the home fabs operating.</p>
