          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to our conference call for Q2 2009 results. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our presentation slides are available on our website. As always, I must advise you that our presentation today contains forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results to be materially different. These factors are detailed in our Form 20-F and also in the document of de r&#xE9;f&#xE9;rence.</p>
          <p>With us today in Paris are Chris Viehbacher, our CEO; Hanspeter Spek, the Executive VP of Pharmaceutical Operations and J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our Executive VP, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today will focus on our Q2 results and then on an update of our transforming program.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call over to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien. Good afternoon, good morning, everybody. As S&#xE9;bastien said, I think we'll &#x2013; we've got a lot to cover today. We're going to cover results first, and then come back and as promised earlier in the year, try to give you some of the financial impacts of our transforming program. Probably say right up front that the numbers you're going to see are not necessarily forecasts or guidance for those years, but are really trying to give you some quantitative measures around what comes out of those transformation measures, as clearly other things on the go in the company.</p>
          <p>So if I turn to Q2, it was an extremely strong quarter, very happy with this, very good sales performance at 6.5% at constant exchange rates. I personally like to look at constant exchange rates because it tends to reflect more of the underlying performance of the business. Clearly, we had a stronger dollar in the first half of this year, although it seems to weaken with every month, but that certainly generated a beneficial effect in the first half, such that we report sales growth of 11.2%. Clearly very tight control over costs with obviously the traditional discipline around SG&amp;A. As you know, we've got pretty much the best SG&amp;A ratio to sales in the industry.</p>
          <p>The fact that we have been pruning our R&amp;D portfolio means that we've been able to reduce our R&amp;D costs. That's probably not completely reflected in the numbers given that we acquired Acambis and that added some numbers, but if you actually look at the pharma piece, those costs were down about 9% in the quarter, which is an indication that we're actually also starting to lower R&amp;D expenses in the absence of new projects. That one is going to be pretty much dependant however on whatever projects that we have and obviously if new projects come along, we won't hesitate to invest.</p>
          <p>Because we had very strong discipline over costs, goods sales that of course meant leverage on the bottom line and you can see that even at constant exchange rates, that led to an extremely robust and probably industry-leading and certainly consensus-beating number of 17.2% at constant exchange rate, or almost a 30% increase on a reported basis. So if we then look at where is the rest of the year going to go, obviously with around 13% profit growth in the first half, it won't be much of a surprise that we believe that we can do around 10% for the full year.</p>
          <p>The growth rate looks a little softer in the second half, only because obviously we're not still quite sure what's going to happen with Eloxatin and although that actually has worked out well having lost the summary judgment, we have been able to get an injunction. How long that takes and whether or not the FDA continues to respect that injunction in preventing generics from coming off the market, we can't say. And obviously there may be an effect of Plavix in Europe, although I think with everyday, we get a little bit more confident even around that.</p>
          <p>So we've got around 10%, we haven't really taken into account H1N1 flu sales, largely because you don't book sales until you really delivered the vaccine and in the case of the United States government, you had it accepted by the U.S. government, a process that can at times take two to three weeks. So given that we're talking about the year-end, we're not sure about yields yet and everything else. We haven't really taken that into an account. So &#x2013; and then maybe then obviously some upside depending on what delivery timeframes are.</p>
          <p>So, if I then move to major events for us this quarter, was obviously the launch of Multaq, approval received on July 1 and we've been able to get this into the market within a few weeks time. And you saw the press release yesterday where that is now available in pharmacy. So we've done the pipeline sales, the reps have all been trained, Hanspeter, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me and I were all at the launch meeting in United States last week, I think we can attest to the enthusiasm of our teams. Hanspeter will talk a little bit more obviously about the potential of this. What I think is particularly noteworthy is obviously that we got the ATHENA mortality data in the PI and that cardiovascular hospitalization benefit is not only good for patients, but also for payers. And I think you've seen the ability to price this product accordingly in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Another major event obviously, well, not a second quarter event, is something that we've been very much occupied with in the last few weeks, were the studies that were published in Diabetologia on one Friday evening. Obviously, this was a major event in financial markets, if not exactly in the medical community.</p>
          <p>Obviously, once rumors circulated in the financial community, we immediately contacted regulatory authorities who were not aware of any studies, nobody really was, and when we saw these studies, and I think clearly when we saw them, we wondered what the fuss was about. But to make sure, we actually had convened a group of 13, 14 of the world's top experts; we scoured the planet to get the best people in diabetes, in cancer and in epidemiology. And these folks came from all over, we &#x2013; I spent personally five hours with them on the following Monday and they clearly all agreed that these studies were of poor quality. In fact I remember asking the epidemiology folks in the room, if you had to score these studies on a scale of one to 10 in terms of their quality and impact, most gave it a two out of five. I think the best score was a five out of five, with one expert saying, these are the type of studies that give epidemiology studies a bad name.</p>
          <p>And the real issue here is, is that if you're going to talk about cancer, you have to understand that cancer is multifactorial and that if you want to identify an aspect in isolation, you have to design a study that keeps all of these other factors constant. We had one expert in the room saying, you just needed one group to drink one glass of wine more per day than the other group and you already had the same difference in cancer as some of these studies were claiming. And I think what was interesting was that in my point of view, I have not quite seen this, most of the medical community really had a sense of outrage, there have been significant questions for many, many years about possible links between diabetes and cancer, possibly between insulin and diabetes.</p>
          <p>But given the complexity of the subject, it's been hard to study. And for someone to have taken such shortcut studies and drawn conclusions out of that was seen to actually be not paying the proper respect for the importance of the questions being raised. And as a result, they suggested in that meeting that I had with them that they were going to issue a declaration to be signed by all 13 of them, outlining the weaknesses of those studies and the fact that the conclusions that had been drawn in some quarters were inappropriate. And obviously, I think you saw then very swiftly and that was the result of our work right from the beginning over the weekend &#x2013; we had support from the European agency, the FDA, the American Diabetes Association, one of the top epidemiologists in the world, Stuart Pocock submitted independently of us an editorial in the Lancet noting that the available data did not provide a cause for concern. And this was obviously then followed up as recently as last week by the CHMP in Europe who said that also that changes to the prescribing advice for LANTUS are therefore not necessary.</p>
          <p>So that all suggests that our own view, which is that we stand firmly behind the safety of LANTUS has been validated by the medical community and regulatory agencies. That having been said, clearly, our primary interest is in patient safety. And we want to make sure that there are no lingering questions. I want to take the scientific highroad here. So we actually have engaged the medical community outside the company both in Europe and in the United States and we may work in &#x2013; on both continents and in consultation with regulatory authorities, to try to find what types of studies could perhaps shed more light on that. And we've had plenty of ideas and we are likely to begin some of these studies in the fourth quarter. It is highly unlikely that any of these will be actually clinical studies, largely because of the time necessary to get any answers out of them. You'd be talking about five-plus-year-type studies. So we're probably looking at much more sophisticated and larger databases of electronic medical records and under the supervision of some of the world's best experts in this area.</p>
          <p>If you ask what's the bottom line of all of this, certainly, where we stand today, I personally see nothing here today that causes us to change our outlook in the long-term for LANTUS. It is and continues to be a major source of growth for the company. When you look at prescription data, and Hanspeter will show you some data in just a minute, I think you can see that there has been no real significant impact of these studies.</p>
          <p>So I'll just finish on that and come back and talk to &#x2013; talk about transforming a little later on, but I think before we do that, let's continue on with the quarter. Hanspeter and his team I think have done an excellent job of delivering sales and profits for this quarter. So Hanspeter, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning and good afternoon. Yes, it's a pleasure to speak about this quarter. If you turn to page 12 of our presentation, you see that pharma sales totaled 6.7 billion, growing 7.3%, slightly or one or two points above the worldwide market growth. Those sales have evidently to some extent been boosted by the recent acquisitions of Zentiva, Medley, Kendrick. But they are mainly driven by a very strong performance of our key prescription brands and you see them, Plavix with nearly 10% growth, 1.8 billion sales; LANTUS plus 26%; Lovenox, back to a two-digit growth, is more than 13%. You remember that the first quarter was for technical reasons a little bit weaker and also tax was there, this a nice two-digit growth sector.</p>
          <p>As a sideline results I think are being worth mentioning, despite the fact that an absolute figure is still small, but nevertheless, you see that our OTC sales are growing by 23% totaling more than 300 million, and also classic pure generics is close to 300 million. This is a very strong growth rate evidently driven by the recent acquisitions in this field.</p>
          <p>On the next page then, you see that yes, we have as we believe a very good, perhaps an even ideal distribution of our geographical presence. Approximately one-third of our sales is in Western Europe, one-third in the United States and one-third outside.</p>
          <p>All those fields have nicely contributed to the first quarter in the United States, it rose by 5.4% or if we exclude the H5N1 effect, even 11% evidently above the U.S. market growth. Europe, which became without any doubt the most difficult tier for our performing pharmaceutical grows nowadays &#x2013; it's growing by 4.6% and outside the Southern Hemisphere, or the other countries growing by 11.2%. So we have a good continued distribution of our sales growth and our geographical presence.</p>
          <p>On the following page 14, this is once again underlined as we focus now on the emerging markets you see that the growth is 20%, the absolute sales figure is getting close to 1.9 billion and evidently in those countries, it is strongly supported by the recent acquisitions and you see them on the page once again, Zentiva, Medley and Kendrick and most recently Shantha Biotechnics in the field of vaccines. And Chris will get back to Shantha during the later part of our today's presentation. Our growth in BRIC plus M countries is equally strong, plus 15.8%.</p>
          <p>Now on the following page, I believe the most important figure or the most important line evidently is the top line you see on the right side of the chart. This signals the daily prescriptions &#x2013; new prescriptions and shows us the most current figures from the 24th of July. You see that evidently after the event there was a certain slow down, a slight down, nothing really dramatic. But we have all reason to be confident from the last three or four data points, where the least to say is that the contribution from new prescription is growing back at least to the previous level, perhaps even if we remain to be optimistic, even a little bit better than before, those publications Chris just was commenting about.</p>
          <p>Of course, we follow the performance very closely. If I go outside the U.S., I see literally no effect expect Germany, which is not really a surprise because I believe it's fair to say that the origin of the whole campaign comes out of Germany and consequently if you see any disorientation of our prescribers it is in Germany. This is certain, evidently we are working on it. But from an economic point of view, we have to say that our presence in Germany is relatively low, we have sales in the magnitude of approximately 100 million, but we also have sales of approximately 100 million. This NPH in Germany through a product with the trade name Insuman. So there is no direct impact, but of course we take care of it.</p>
          <p>The following page shows you the performance of Plavix and Lovenox. As mentioned before, Plavix a growth of nearly 10% after more than 10 years of marketing 1.8 billion. We do very well with the product also in the United States but we continue to see from the new generics in Germany is nothing really in terms of change. We have a share of generics in value of approximately 24% and in terms of volume of approximately 33% over the last week or even month. So sales remain more or less stable largely due to the fact that there is a very strong debate in Germany if those generics are really substitutes due to the fact that they have a limited scope of indication and we believe that this is a very serious discussion and of course, we are of the point of view that drug safety has to go first. And it presents a potential risk if products are being substituted with a different scope of indication.</p>
          <p>We have a number of important publications in front of us in the remaining lifecycle of the product. Perhaps the next is the most important is the publication of the study of CURRENT. You will remember that the large study with nearly 20,000 patients which may present arguments in front of prasugrel. Prasugrel has been meanwhile launched as you surely know. Naturally we see very, very little impact so far from prasugrel, which is partly effect of time but especially the Europeans see it also as effect of very limited indication and the very large majority of Plavix.</p>
          <p>Plavix's success story continues, you see that we have an excellent performance in Japan. That's the performance is meanwhile absolutely in line with the performance we had with Plavix at the same point of time and yes, I think it is predictable that at least in a couple of years, Plavix will become a Japanese blockbuster because we are trending exactly like that.</p>
          <p>Lovenox, also very good results, 13% growth, we can state that during the year 2009, we have succeeded to get up with product supply in line with demand and consequently I'm absolutely confident that Lovenox will continue to grow at two digits. Also in the context of Lovenox, we have new competitors and also with Lovenox, we can say and of course we are content to say so that those new competitors they all show very, very little impact so far in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now on Multaq, I believe the most important has been mentioned by Chris, yes, we have an excellent labeling. The labeling is perhaps even a little bit better than we had expected in our optimism. It is an excellent labeling because we can translate it directly into drug benefit and from this, we took a relatively bold move in terms of pricing. We have a price which is I believe it's fair to say above the expectations of the financial market. But we have decided to do so because we can bolster this price, this clear benefit coming out of the labeling because hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons is a very important financial factor for the payers in the United States and later on also in Europe.</p>
          <p>We have announced a product with the field force last week. We have deployed about 400 sales representatives for the product. They work exclusively for Multaq which is at least for the U.S. market and for us a rather new approach which means we have really established a team of Multaq specialists. They manage everything in their territories. Their territories are small, they are therefore very familiar with those territories. They work on the hospital sector and they work on the office sector. So we found a very, very well motivated field force to promote this product on the basis of what I said just before. We consider as an excellent labeling. You see that the market is very well prepared. 87% of the U.S. cardiologists are in detail there of the upcoming launch of Multaq and its database which is largely of course driven by ATHENA.</p>
          <p>Last word on vaccines. We have this open question how much we will achieve with H5N1 sales. Chris has alluded to it. Beside of this which we consider as a potential upside for the remainder of the year, we can say that we have very good performance of vaccines this month, an 18% growth. And as you see them on page 19, this is more or less true for all segments of our existing vaccine business which continues to build a very important growth driver for the overall company.</p>
          <p>On the following page, you will learn then that we are very nicely on track for the production of TAMIFLU. We tried to make a kind of Stargardt here which means we'll try to fulfill of course our obligations in terms of what we have committed to in terms of seasonal flu production. We have a very well advanced this issue. Remember that this is quite a good tradition of Sanofi Pasteur. We always historically have been the first to the market and as of now, we will now more and more focus on the production of H1N1 influenza product and we will recover outstanding sales in the remaining six or five months of the year.</p>
          <p>So if I may sum up this second quarter, which showed a very solid, very good performance, this is true for our flagship products which are all in two digit growth. We have continued to further expand our position in emerging markets which in our country which 70% of our sales growth. We have launched under excellent circumstances Multaq in the United States. We have been extremely reassured by the strong support we have achieved from opinion leaders during this year's LANTUS event during the last month. And yes, we continue to be extremely well supported also by the performance of our vaccine business. All of this makes us very optimistic for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So far from operations and I pass now on to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine who will give you more insight into our financial performance. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. So good morning, good afternoon, everybody. So a few more words about the quarterly results, even if you've gone through it already widely. First we'll pause a while on sales just to give the details. So the contribution of acquisitions is 6.5%, 178 million. This includes mainly Zentiva for 172 consolidated of the old quarter. Medley contributed for just two months, it was consolidated as of the 1 of May. When it comes to the organic sales, the 3.7%, which is already strong includes the fact that in vaccine we are flat beside H5N1. So clearly outside this element we were much above 4% close to five. And you can see on this page 23 as well the impact of the currency situations which has been mainly the U.S. dollar as you can see for 358. They are stunning. Have gone up during the second quarter. So in the first quarter, it was somewhat depressing our sales trend and second quarter, it's minimal.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;L, the operating income, I think what is most striking here is that we have integrated Zentiva, we have integrated Medley, which has a structure of costs which is somewhat different because it is generics, more of a ratio of cost of sales to sales, lower ratio of R&amp;D to sales and at the end of the day, slightly lower ratio of operating income to sales. In spite of that, we have been able clearly to increase significantly our operating income margin as well as the gross profit margin, which has increased again during the second quarter, which shows that the rest has performed very well, both in terms of cost-of-goods, as well as R&amp;D, as well as SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Just a word on R&amp;D, as Chris has mentioned already, we now start to see the benefits of the policy we've implemented in terms of selection of projects, from focusing on the main project, also starting to bring down our fixed cost base. So the minus 2.5% which you'll see here includes a minus 9% on the former R&amp;D, while we have somewhat increased the R&amp;D for vaccines, particularly with the acquisition of Acambis and some developments to the preparation of the H1N1.</p>
          <p>Also the SG&amp;A as well, we have the integration of the extra costs coming from the new acquisitions, which is normal and despite of that the increase is very small, 1.5% when sales have increased by 6.5, which clearly shows the efforts which have been made by the rest of the organization including clearly on the sales and marketing spending as well as G&amp;A.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the next page, then we have the financial expense, which is kept stable, which is normal because we have a low debt level. As you know the effective tax rate has been kept at 29% along with the guidance we have given for 2009. The old 208 was 29% as well. The share of profit from associates is mainly on the increase. It's coming from two main elements. The first one is the higher contribution of the BMS, our share in the BMS venture in the U.S. but it is basically normal in line with the increase of Plavix sales but also the stronger U.S. dollar. When it comes to Marion, we have posted higher contribution of Marion as compared to last year. Even as you saw the shares have been flat, the profitability has increased, somewhat driven by higher exchange rate of the dollar against the euro, but also for good deferments and good cost control. So all in all, once again, we have posted this very strong EPS increase which has been already commented.</p>
          <p>So again, we have reaching &#x2013; I mean high &#x2013; very high performance in terms of cost ratios. Cost of sales to sales has decreased slightly as compared to Q1 is significantly lower than Q2, 2008. So we are in line with our projections and once again this includes the acquisition of Zentiva, which is somewhat dilutive. The &#x2013; SG&amp;A to sales ratio is slightly above the previous quarter, it was planned, it's as normal. We tend to have a higher sales spending &#x2013; marketing spending during the second quarter as last year. We can confirm that we will aim to be at around 25%, Sales and G&amp;A, sorry, sale and G&amp;A., the sales ratio for the full-year. Operating margin is reaching record high at 41% on the net income to sales ratio, I think also is somewhat a record, or close to the previous record while &#x2013; about 30% which I think is among the best in the industry.</p>
          <p>A last word on cash flow. We are positive of the first half. I think it makes more sense to look at cash flow on the half-year because I mean fluctuation in the quarter can be more significant. So for the half-year we have posted a strong cash flow, the net cash flow from operating activity, net of the  variation of working capital is 4.4, close to 4.4, it's a small increase as compared to last year. On the constant exchange rate basis it's more than 10%.</p>
          <p>The CapEx includes the investment on new vaccine facility as well as the startup of the new facilities of biological projects in Vitry in France, and acquisitions includes, as we know of course, Zentiva, Medley, BiPar and Kendrick. All in all we have the finance through the cash flow. All CapEx acquisitions are generative of free cash flow. We pay yearly dividends as we know we are paying dividends once a year. So of course, the dividend impacts the net debt for the second quarter. But we can say that if we were not to do any new acquisition by year-end, which as a matter of fact is not true because we have started with Shantha, we'd bring down the debt down to around 1 billion or even slightly below. So it shows our how strong the cash flow generation of the company is and what is the margin of maneuver we have to invest into new projects.</p>
          <p>To summarize, very solid Q2 sales performance, continued cost management, very strong EPS growth above sales growth, that's obvious, and significant cash flow generation during the first half of 2009. I'll turn it back to Chris, I think, to speak about transforming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me. We'll move to slide 31. This is &#x2013; it's now about eight months since I joined the company, and when I arrived, most of the focus on the company, well, I think I remember saying at one point, most people thought of Sanofi as saying it's Plavix and it's Acomplia, Plavix is going to go away and Acomplia was a failure. And I think what we have been trying to do over the last six to seven months is to say that there is a lot more to Sanofi-Aventis than either Plavix or Acomplia.</p>
          <p>It is certainly true &#x2013; and we've put that up front in my very first presentation to you back in February &#x2013; that we will lose sales as most pharmaceutical companies in our industry do, when we lose patent exclusivity on Ambien CR, Eloxatin, Taxotere, Avapro, Lovenox potentially, we don't know, although I have to say when I look at more recent events in United States I have become increasingly skeptical about the possibility of a substitutable generic, but it is clearly in uncharted territory so we've put it there. Obviously world's second-biggest product, Plavix, coming off patent in the first half of 2012. I think we were also very upfront in saying we don't have enough, not to say we don't have any, but we don't have enough new products to replace that.</p>
          <p>So then we said, well, all right, if you are going to lose 20% of your sales, what can you do? And we came up with basically two different approaches here that we're operating in parallel. The first is, I think most shareholders can reasonably expect that before you go spend a dime of their money that you're doing absolutely everything you can as a business to maximize the performance of what's there. And one of the things that struck me as I looked into Sanofi was as much focus as there was around the 20% of Sanofi that is going to go away, the real interesting part to Sanofi is in the 80% that doesn't go away. Now, if you're in another pharma company, the rest of the business, the rest of that 80% is probably stuff that looks like the 20% that's going away other than the patent timeframe is a little further out.</p>
          <p>But when you look inside Sanofi-Aventis, and that's a function of all the mergers we've done, we actually found we had a number of building blocks of businesses that offered an opportunity if we focused on them, and if we position them correctly, not only offer an opportunity potentially offset what we're going to lose, but to actually diversify the company away from a dependency on small molecules, patent protected in the U.S. and Europe. Because that to me is what I really want to do. And I'm focused on 2013 and having a business that has a prospect of sustainable growth. So when I talk about 2013, I don't talk about 2013 as an end-point. I talk about 2013 as where we want to launch the period of growth because I think what's going to happen between now and 2013, everybody knows. I mean, yes, we're going to lose Plavix and we're going to lose Taxotere, but when we actually look at the valuation of the business, what we find is actually that most people &#x2013; let's face it, most people haven't done much analysis beyond 2012 to begin with. But if you look at valuations, it implies a sharp drop-off in earnings per share from 2013 onwards, largely because most people don't know much about Sanofi beyond Plavix and Taxotere.</p>
          <p>And so that's why we really have focused first and foremost to say, well, let's take this business that we already have because these businesses offer you some protection against the devastating effect of these patent expiries. And they offer you protection either through the size of the capital investment and the degree of skills that you need to have to be in that business and vaccines is a great example of that. You could argue insulin is another one &#x2013; we're probably not going to see a substitutable generic for LANTUS one day. Or you have a sustainable benefit because you can maintain brand loyalty and customer loyalty as you have with OTC businesses, or you have businesses where, you know what, you don't really have that much patent protection to begin with, but where we have already figured out how to compete and are better than most companies in these markets and they are unlikely to be disturbed much by patent expiries. Or you could take Japan, where obviously we're just launching the fabulous products that have been major drivers of growth for Sanofi-Aventis over the last 10 years. So if you just take those businesses, those growth platforms, they not only offer you growth, but they offer you growth well beyond the 2013 period.</p>
          <p>Now we also should remember that we &#x2013; although we've been very honest in saying, hey, we don't have as much new products as we would like, we do have some and you've just heard about Multaq. I mean, it's certainly true to say that you do not want to bet the company on finding new blockbusters, but as Hanspeter said at the launch meeting, if you've got one, make the best out of it. And that's what we obviously intend to do with the Multaq, and I would submit to you that BSI-201 is going to be another one. And of course we have a number of other products that are developing.</p>
          <p>So if you like, there has been a first need to make sure that we can take these great businesses and then I always come back and say, remember, Pfizer paid a boatload of money to buy Wyeth really to get to where Sanofi already has in its 80%. Now the middle arrow is really where we come in the transforming program because &#x2013; I'll show you in a slide or two that the organic growth was actually something that is bigger than most people have in mind and it's largely because most people don't know how to value these somewhat non-traditional businesses, if you like.</p>
          <p>But it's also true to say that the company is not managed in this way. So we need to actually think about new skill sets. We need to think about reallocating of resource, we need to think about new structures, we need in some cases to have some new leadership. And we need to do that to be able to really capitalize on these growth drivers because you cannot go out and start buying companies unless you've got a good solid base at home. There is no point having &#x2013; going and buying an OTC business, for example, if you don't actually have someone who runs your OTC business and knows about OTC, who is in a position to judge which OTC acquisitions would be good. So that's why we launched this program, it is first and foremost to make &#x2013; to be able to seize upon these opportunities. Clearly, it is unsatisfactory to continue to be investing in research and development without results.</p>
          <p>And finally, knowing that we're not going to have enough new products coming along, we obviously are pursuing external growth opportunities. So that is the program, if you like, the two arrows, organic growth and transformation that actually enable us to deal with the loss of patents between now and 2012. So let's take them one at a time here.</p>
          <p>We'll go to the next slide. Now, this slide is not meant to be a sales forecast, all right? And I've seen some notes out there that people are looking at that and saying that. That's not what this is intended to do. What this is intended to do is to say, we've been talking about these growth platforms but people don't really have any idea of, well, what can that really do in the 2013 timeframe. And we had a bit of an aha when we did our Emerging Markets seminar and we said, well, actually even while doing much, we can double that business in five years, just at the growth rate we're doing. And when you actually look at all of these businesses and you've heard me say that I don't see any impairment to the growth potential of LANTUS, for example, or if you look at our vaccines business, you can see that we can double those businesses. And if you do &#x2013; and there is not a single hockey stick in here, there are not &#x2013; there is not the hypothesis that we're going to go out and buy more businesses and given that we've already done seven acquisitions in six months, I don't think anybody can suggest that we're going to suddenly stop now.</p>
          <p>But just doing that, you can see that the cliff goes away. That basically doubling just the businesses we have, if you take that 80% and let it become 100% of the business, it is as big as in 2008, and the only reason we took 2008 is those are real numbers. And it's particularly important when you look at costs. I don't like looking at future cost numbers, I like to be able to go back and look at real numbers. You want to take 2009, I'll say the same thing about 2009. That's not really the point. The point is that these businesses have enough organic growth potential to really make a difference to the businesses, is the first point. The second point is, look at these businesses in terms of fundamentals. You have got businesses, again, that are not subject to patent expiry. So even if we didn't do anything else &#x2013; and I can tell you as CEO, I'm not going to spend the next four years doing nothing &#x2013; but even if I were to go play golf, just letting those businesses grow would mean that you're going to be able to grow that business to a level that offsets that. But fundamentally, you also end up with businesses that have much different growth perspectives after 2013. So for those of you who have kind of a black hole for Sanofi-Aventis in your models, this was meant to help you to at least evaluate the piece that we have.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly, we have &#x20AC;4 billion of cash flow after dividends and tax. And we're not going to let that lovely cash go to waste. We're also equally not going to waste that cash, we're going to make sure we continue to acquire businesses that kind of bolt-on to those. So in other words, the acquisition strategy is not around having to fill a gap anymore. The acquisition strategy can be done intelligently and strategically, to actually be able to drive value and in particular drive sales growth. I want to go buy sales, I want to go buy something that can grow.</p>
          <p>So we come back and say, all right, we remember what our three priorities are, this is essentially what I spent my time doing. I'm spending a lot of time trying to drive innovation in research and development. I said I was going to spend 20% of my time on business development. I'm easily spending that, if not more. And we are trying to adapt our company to future challenges and I think in the first half, we've made significant inroads on that, with the goal again though, of not just filling a gap, but transforming this business into sustainable, profitable growth with an improved risk profile.</p>
          <p>So now, what's going on in R&amp;D? Well, remember we are a European company. So when we decide to do change, we are going to go through full consultation processes with our social partners and we are in that process. We're in that process because already back in June, we launched a program of early retirement and voluntary departures in France, which is meant to &#x2013; basically to reduce our head count in research and development and particularly in our head office. The transformation project is not there really to save money per se. Money will come out of that, but it's largely because we're trying to simplify the business and focus our resource around those things that will grow. In my R&amp;D division today, I have a typical pyramidal organization. I have 13,000 people and I've got 11 management levels. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that you are not going to get a lot of innovation going on in that type of an environment.</p>
          <p>So we've done a number of things and the first thing you have to do is say, let's make sure we've got a proper base to go forward with. Let's make sure we have a pipeline that we all believe in so that we can actually understand what kind of resources we actually need. So we did that in the first quarter, we came through, we cut a number of projects that we no longer believed in or which weren't going to go forward for other reasons, such as technical risk and &#x2013; or the return on investment wasn't there. So &#x2013; and through that process, we actually created much tighter governance over what we're going to invest in, because quite honestly we kind of had, I think, a situation where we didn't really have a good robust proof of concept before we advanced into development.</p>
          <p>And when you talk about risk, I think we, as an industry are probably too risk averse prior to proof of concept. But I can certainly say as a company, and I won't speak for other companies on this, but certainly within Sanofi-aventis, we were not risk averse enough before we went into debt development where you're going to spend a lot.</p>
          <p>So that's what we did first. Then we came back and said, well, so what is the organization that is actually going to drive innovation? And I've been working with, with a number of people, most notably Elias Zerhouni who obviously ran the $30 billion a year National Institutes of Health and is credited by people all over the world as having transformed a giant government-run organization. And we sat down and said, you know, just because you divide these things up into ever smaller teams doesn't necessarily say that they're going to be more innovative.</p>
          <p>The fundamental factor behind innovation is the ability to create something disruptive, to challenge the status quo. And if you go read anything about innovation, you're quickly going to find that there is a great belief and there's a number of studies that have shown that big companies cannot do that. Big companies are great at maximizing value, at refining things, at enhancing things, but the very size of the company means that the success of it means that it's very difficult to have people within it and structures within it that really do something disruptive. So if you want to have innovation, you're really going to have to first and foremost think about the culture, the way of operating, the mindset, and the very people that you have.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that, Elias Zerhouni will tell you that research fundamentally changed in the 1990s. Where we used to in the 1980s go through a process of screening everything we could find in the cupboard against known targets hoping for a hit, now we're using the knowledge of genomics and proteomics, and messenger RNA to really come up with ideas for targets. And so there is a creative genius, if you like, that's going on, that's probably going on mostly within universities and public institutions. Then there is also a part which is entrepreneurial genius, which is figuring out amongst the multitude of targets, which would cost you about $20 million a year to validate, which of those really merit development.</p>
          <p>And then there is obviously a whole problem solving and process factor where nobody beats Big Pharma on this. There is nobody that's got better competence and rigor and discipline in really testing and stress testing the science than Big Pharma. And so we need structures where you're talking potentially about multi-year grant processes. You need to have HR process that lets your people leave the organization and go work outside every now and then, come back in. You may need an exploratory structure where you can have people from outside the organization coming in and working with your people, to kind of create a hot bed of thought processes.</p>
          <p>What you can't also do is have your people spread out all over the world. We merge and merge, and merge, and I've been doing this for 20 years, and you suppose that because we've got e-mail, because we've got video conferences, people will be able to work together as though they were together. Ladies and gentlemen, that ain't so. There is a huge value &#x2013; we see this in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we this in the Bay Area, it's important for people to work collaboratively in teams.</p>
          <p>So we need to be bringing people back together again. We're doing this very quickly in oncology, for example. Today my oncology R&amp;D teams are spread across 10 different sites. We've chosen to create an integrated R&amp;D and commercial operation structure, which will be focused in Paris and in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where we can bring companies like BiPar and Exelixis and others into the fold and very quickly be able to move products in and out of Phase I, II, III and on to the marketplace. In diabetes, we're going to do this little differently where we're looking at a horizontal type of integration and looking at the disease state and not just selling more insulin.</p>
          <p>But there is a whole process that is around how do we make people more entrepreneurial, how do we make the organization more porous, how do we change our HR processes, our budgeting processes? And I can tell you in a big company that is going to be a challenge. But I can also tell you that what I've seen in our industry is just tweaking the organization is not going to do it. And I'm not saying we can do this, but I do understand that I think unless we do this, we haven't got a chance.</p>
          <p>Now the other thing I told you was the company was never very openly &#x2013; very open to the innovation of others. Largely in the pharmaceutical industry I think, Big Pharma thought it could do everything best, from soup to nuts, A to Z, research to development. And I think we are seeing evidence of culture change. The fact that we could be &#x2013; buy BiPar and not integrate it, I can tell you it took a lot of work not to "Sanofise" BiPar, but we have been successful. Those are 18 people who brought this product to Phase II and they're now doing a demand-driven integration, demand-driven from their side, not from corporate.</p>
          <p>Exelixis, fabulous partners, they have particular skills in really moving from pre-clinical into Phase I, I'm happy to work with them. And Kirin is a new pre-clinical monoclonal antibody. I could cite the Salk Institute. We have also developed a pipeline of contracts and partnerships, so we are only just beginning on this path. Next?</p>
          <p>And you know we have had multiple acquisitions and I think they've been consistent with the growth platforms that we've outlined. None of them are necessarily big but you've already seen that, hey, there is 178 million extra euros of sales in Q2 and that isn't even a full quarter of some of these. So you don't have to go buy the biggest stuff on the block to actually start to move the needle. I think they've all also been very consistent with where we want to go. Now if I take Shantha, for example, I'm extremely excited about that. It was not an easy one to win.</p>
          <p>Shantha is a company that's been founded in India, what really interested me were two things. The first is obviously there is a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, in India. This is extremely important because it is very difficult if you wanted to go build this facility yourself. I can tell you that I happened to be talking to Tachi Yamada when Bill Gates was visiting our Lyons facility who happened to mention this facility because he had seen it, clearly attesting to the quality of that site. But the other really interesting thing is, is if you want to be in vaccine in marketplaces, you have to have vaccines that are adapted to the diseases that are there. So Rotavirus is a disease against which we have no vaccine, not a big &#x2013; not a terribly nasty disease for children in Europe and the U.S., but deadly to children in other countries. And so, by acquiring Shantha, we acquire a very interesting portfolio of vaccines that are completely adapted to those markets.</p>
          <p>You know, Dr. Reddy, who founded that company has agreed to continue to run it; Alain Merieux who had the vision to spot this thing in the first place has agreed to work with us in creating a strategic committee. So to me, this is very much consistent with the idea of building our vaccines business and building our position in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; I'll finish there and ask J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine to continue on the financial side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as Chris has mentioned, our Transforming Program is not just here aiming to cut costs, but more to transform the company. It is going to work less in silos, more entrepreneurial approach, more of a transversal organization. So very much had the question, where is the savings going to come from? To a certain extent it will come from the ability to create bridges between the various entities on the Group instead of having just an organization by silo, which is more traditional. So just to put some figure on this Transforming Program, we have identified at least 2 billion euro of cost savings recurrent by year 2013 as compared to 2008. Again, as Chris has mentioned, we have taken 2008 as a base because this is where we knew the costs were, so it was clear to assess where we could go 2013. So this is why we're using this base.</p>
          <p>This will involve all the parts of the company and you know that it will involve R&amp;D, it would involve industrial &#x2013; the Industrial division, it will involve the commercial operations and definitely also the support functions which has to be streamlined to redo the process, to make them simpler, less heavy, and to allow also people to work better. We have put a sort of a way to go, and we have defined the first milestone, the first milestone is, of course, 2010. And as you can see from the slide we aim to save 30% of the total so let's say at least 600 million euros, by year 2010 as compared to 2008. This could be a tough milestone on which we will of course report on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Just to give you some hints about how, about what we are going to work on. When it comes to industrial affairs, I mean, one of the issues is, which we're raising very frequently, is how much you produce from the north, how much you produce from the south. It is clear that by now we're producing around 50% from the north, where we are &#x2013; that's 40 &#x2013; yes, 50 when we are selling at least only 40. But just as a result of the acquisitions and some optimization of the production using all the plans we have available all over the world, we will be able to increase the share of production which we produce from let's say the emerging countries allowing for lower cost, but also quite efficient. For instance, the acquisition of Zentiva has allowed us to acquire Turkey, which is really a state-of-the-art plant, which we are going to use for other products beyond the Zentiva products as well.</p>
          <p>Also over this period, where we are going to, when we're going to grow and develop our business outside the Western world, the OECD countries, volumes will continue to grow. And therefore, the productivity will increase just as we have increased volumes by cutting the fee &#x2013; dividing the fees caused by higher volumes. So we could say that at least it would be 10% more or maybe more than that of the actual production in 2013, which will come from emerging countries, or I'd say low cost countries.</p>
          <p>Also we will benefit from the increased volumes in the incidence, that's obvious, we are going to transform some of our platform from the chemical to biological platforms. Typically what we're assuming now, in Neuville where we are moving this chemical facility to produce a dengue vaccine, which will be produced as from 2013-14. We are also building a plant in Vitry close to Paris, which used to be also a chemical site, which was going to be a biological site. We are developing synergies between our pharma and our vaccines business. Although we are going on with regular reduction of production, I think the habit of Sanofi is not to say to make much noise about their efforts, on our efforts to reduce year-after-year our cost base and to improve the productivity of our Industrial division. Here you have put a figure of at least 2% real cost reduction per year, although there is five years to come, which is already something to be achieved.</p>
          <p>On R&amp;D, a lot have been said already, in terms of figures on evaluation, as you know we have the plan to close down four research centers in France, and to concentrate our forces on the main research centers. We are also going to close or to dispose four others outside France, U.K., U.S. and Japan. We have this plan under discussion still, but which has been put on the table, of voluntary departures and early retirements. And all in all, we think that we will be able to make our fixed cost variable, in other terms to be able to have our fixed costs going down along with what we need actually internally in terms of variable costs. Meaning, the cost you spend on projects, on trials, either internal or external.</p>
          <p>Over three years, so we can say &#x2013; when I say three years, it's from 2008 to 2011, it's at least 20% and if I just take the pharma part of the R&amp;D, it's at least 30% of the overall cost, which will be reduced or reallocated to new projects because, as Chris has said, clearly, if we have the opportunity &#x2013; and we will have the opportunity &#x2013; to invest in new projects, we will do it. So all in all, we are creating also from an organizational point of view, a much more flexible R&amp;D organization.</p>
          <p>Commercial, we will take &#x2013; we will of course have to have our organization following the evolution of the demand of the sales and moving more to emerging markets, means developing new models, as it has been presented during the emerging markets seminar. And of course also we will at the same time reduce and make more efficient our organization in Western Europe and in the U.S. on the support functions we will continue to develop for what is, I would say, quite traditional and novel to create shared platforms both in terms of accounting, IT, purchasing, HR, that we have more efficient support functions and to have a lower cost going on the actual productive operations.</p>
          <p>Which leads us to this second graph, which is having consistent with the first you've seen in the few &#x2013; a few minutes ago, as Chris said, this is not a forecast, this is not a guidance, this is for you to understand where we go and how we can transform sales into profit. It's clear that when we're going to lose the exclusivity on some of our products, we are going to lose sales, but also profit. We are also going to lose the revenues, which we are getting from our non-consolidated sales, in particular from Plavix. So it's a bit of a hit on our P&amp;L and our bottom line, which is coming from this loss of profit, coming from the identification of our &#x2013; of some of our key products.</p>
          <p>So in order to fight against that, we have clearly three levers, the first one is the organic growth, which has been described on the implementation of the growth drivers, which will be the main contributor to counteract the loss of profits, which is coming from the loss of sales, but clearly also if you got into other businesses such as generics, or vaccines, the level of margin is slightly lower as compared to what we can achieve in the ethical pharma, even if as you've seen during the first quarter, you manage to integrate that and this is where our cost savings come, this is where the transforming program in terms of P&amp;L and in terms of bottom line will make the gap and will fill the gap in terms of contribution between what we are losing and what we will gain.</p>
          <p>So what we say quite simply is that at minimum if we don't take into consideration the significant acquisition. If you don't take into consideration any further improvement beyond a stabilization of sales, we should be able to stabilize our margins on &#x2013; let's say our net income to sales margins basically in global terms, so that we can stabilize the profit. And I think this is a message we pass for not only we are able to go through the end of some of the patterns over the period up to 2013, but also we're going to compensate through those cost savings on contribution of growth drivers to compensate at the level of the net income. And of course these don't take into account, the use of cash &#x2013; the cash flow we'll generate. So here, I mean it's a minimum case because if we do some acquisitions, which will clearly contribute to further profit here we can recoup with continuous growth of our profit and earnings per share.</p>
          <p>So this is where we are. This is I would say a step in the process in analyzing the profit drivers of the value creators of sanofi-aventis it's not once again a forecast. It is the first step to make you confident that we're going to continue to create value in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me. I'll echo that again, it's more of a roadmap than a forecast, largely because we don't think those numbers will ever come about, because we're obviously going to continue to transform the business even as we leave this meeting.</p>
          <p>Let's go back just and review key achievements for Q2 and next milestones. Obviously strong Q2 results in 2009. We have given greater precision to our guidance it was at least 7%. It wasn't capped to begin with. It's around 10% that might end up being conservative depending on what happens with some generics and with H1N1 vaccine. Obviously a big event for us and being able to launch Multaq with a good label and a good price, I think now three weeks &#x2013; three and a half weeks after the event, I think we feel very confident in the long-term growth potential for LANTUS and Hanspeter's shown you the prescription data, which don't really show any major impact here. I think we are &#x2013; we've been doing a very good job of bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I think I said six months ago these are not necessarily things that are on your radar screens, everybody tends to look at the same thing. And we are taking a very systematic approach of screening everything across the globe, looking for things that fit with our business, asking the question what could we do with this business that existing management's not doing? How does this provide us with top-level growth? We are changing the way we do business with our R&amp;D partnerships. We've done probably more deals in the last six months than the last three years as a company. We've got a long way to go yet, but I would say it's an indicator of something I have found within our company. It may be that we could have been doing more earlier. But I have found actually a very strong &#x2013; very strong willingness and desire to see change. It's a company that was pretty proud of its past, a company that is very competitive, and a company that hasn't been particularly happy about where it's been over the last four or five years. So yes, there's always nervousness in big organizations when you start talking about change, but I must say if there is one thing that surprised me, it's actually the willingness of the company to mobilize around change and I think some of the partnerships that we've been building is just a single indicator of that, but there are of course many others.</p>
          <p>As part of that transformation, there are going to be some cost savings coming out. I can tell you that those are the maximum cost savings that could come out of it, on the other hand having been through multiple cost restructuring programs in my career and seeing zero impact in terms of shareholder value, that's not the lever for growth. We need to streamline the organization, but it's as much as trying to make it go faster and redirect resource to growth than anything. Nobody is going to buy the stock in the company, because we take another EUR200 million of cost out of it. I think we had a very good emerging markets investors' seminar. I think it is clear that we are moving away from the traditional markets &#x2013; traditional businesses, it is undoubtedly easier to value a product where you've got weekly prescriptions and known margins and known market conditions.</p>
          <p>We're moving into more challenging territories, we're talking about countries, not products. We are talking about different businesses, where you can't always get the reliable IMS data and we are trying and have tried with the emerging markets seminar really to provide more information and more transparency in an effort to help you all actually evaluate those businesses. But we appreciate that we've got some way to go on that yet, it is much more complicated than simply a blockbuster in the U.S. and we actually, would also appreciate your feedback on what we could be doing more to help you with those. But that is clearly where our industry is going, it's not just sanofi-aventis. So I think we all have an interest in working together on that. We are expecting an approval for Multaq in the second half of the year; we'll be announcing Q3 results on October 30. And again, and it's the spirit of trying to help understand some of the core franchise of the business, and in line with the spirit of our emerging markets investor seminar, we're going to do another one with our vaccines Group.</p>
          <p>So wrap up here and again just come back to the core objectives through 2013. Again, I think there is no better profit comes out of maximizing organic growth and so we have identified these growth platforms and want to make sure that we are maximizing those. But we do also recognize that that's not going to be enough, if we really want to show growth through 2013 and beyond. We're going to have to continue to seek external sources of growth and diversification, I think we're off to a very good start on that, we've been very active and you'll see even more very soon. And finally clearly innovation is at the core of the company, we have to show that we can transform R&amp;D. But I actually think and I look at BiPar, it's amazing what you can do with a few deals, you can actually put some real assets on the table. We may not have them launched by 2013, I think that wouldn't be realistic. But I think what is realistic is to expect a much more robust pipeline of product for Phase II and Phase III because if we're sitting there in 2012, people are going to be looking out at that point to 2014 and 2015 and that's where you're going to be looking also into what's in the pipeline. So we're going to close with the official presentation and pass back over to you for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering first of all on your long-range target of 2013 profits matching 2008. What you're assuming for Lovenox within that and also LANTUS, are we still assuming here a doubling in LANTUS sales? And would it be upside, if we didn't see a substitute for generic Lovenox emerge and you did see a doubling of LANTUS to your expectations there? And also is it fair to say this is just an absolute base case even excluding further acquisitions otherwise you wouldn't really be prepared to offer that up to the market, right now?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the restructuring charges. Is the 2Q restructuring charge, the total charge or should we expect more? And can you give us a feel for what percentage of those are in cash? And then thirdly on Multaq, I know it's fairly early days yet, but I'm just wondering what the response from payers to the pricing has been to date? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, you were cutting in and out little bit there, but I'll let Hanspeter take the Multaq question and J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, the restructuring charge. On the long range forecast, on all of these things you do the 50-50. I happen to think that certainly a substitutable generic is not that likely, when I look at what's going on with Europe and their guidelines and having to do clinical studies for each indication.</p>
          <p>You really have to question whether the FDA is going to be more aggressive, when I look at what's going on with biosimilar legislation, and some of the interactions we've had, listening to the new head of the FDA, Commissioner Peggy Hamburg, saying that decisions need to be based on science. I think a substitutable generic just doesn't really meet the risk benefit tradeoff. At the same time could somebody do the clinical trials and come with a non-substitutable generic? Possibly. So, I would have to say that if there was no generic ever, either substitutable or non-substitutable but certainly if there was no non-substitutable generic that would represent an upside to that &#x2013; those numbers.</p>
          <p>And again the idea is not to do a forecast and say, because I've also seen some straight lining going on, while if it's the same numbers in 2008 and 2009 is higher, what does that mean for '10, '11. That's not the objective of it. The objective of it is really to say the businesses that are there have an opportunity to grow and grow beyond that and when we do the valuation and I'll perhaps let J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me comment on this. We see the biggest difference between how we internally value the company and how the outside world values the company and what happens after 2013. And therefore we are trying to give a little bit more perspective about what those businesses could be in terms of size and shape, but clearly I am not going to go and spend the next four years of my life to come back to where we started in 2008. So, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, do you want to talk about restructuring maybe you want to add a comment around the?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that what you've said is basically right. I mean what we have tried to show to you, to confirm to you, well, we have &#x2013; of course you can take a lot of scenarios and assess what will be your &#x2013; what will be sales in 2013. Once again it's clear that beyond some assumptions, some average assumptions we can take on the generics and the competition. We are also not taking any acquisitions or let's say any significant acquisition in this assessment. And also I mean what we end with by year 2013 is a much more diversified portfolio with a very &#x2013; much less being exposed to genericification. So clearly a growth &#x2013; a potential for growth beyond 2013, which will be as compared to what we have now, everything being equal will be definitely higher.</p>
          <p>I mean, maybe one of you can make your own assessment about what could be the actual value of the company in 2013, only based on that and once again not taking into account the use of the cash we will generate in between. But you could reasonably assess, if you look at &#x2013; if I look at the value of let's say a generic company or an OTC company or a vaccine company and is listed or whatever. But I mean you could assess some actual value in 2013, based on that which could justify for, definitely for a price &#x2013; a value, which could be higher than where we are today, but it is not my job to do that.</p>
          <p>On the question of restructuring, Graham, so first &#x2013; yes the cost we have or the provision we have taken covers the plans that have which are presently under discussion, either mainly in France and to a lower extent in other places including the U.S., is to a very large extent cash expenses. So it is I mean a severance package will be given or a early retirement package which will be given to employees which will leave the company. This cash will come over years, specifically when it comes to early retirements. It will come over two or three years, definitely on average.</p>
          <p>Third, will it be &#x2013; will there be other restructuring costs? Yes there will be some and you know that the counting role that you take a restructuring cost only when the decision has been taken. But I can say that nothing of the same magnitude, so it will be probably a few hundred more over time, but less under double of what we have taken for the first half. Let's say, somewhere in between depending upon exact conditions, on decision that we will take over a year or two to come.</p>

          <p>On Multaq, we have the product approved since three weeks so we have limited experience naturally. And nevertheless, we believe we have very good chances to get a strong access. Why, I said before we have a strong labeling. We have very good health outcome data. We are in a unique position from a competitive point of view. And so after the first three weeks, and I say this with all prudence necessary, we have a very friendly perception of the product from the payer side.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question on LANTUS. I'm just wondering whether in the ORIGIN study, the Data Safety Monitoring Board has been able to take a look at the cancer safety and whether there's anything, even if you're not able to share it, whether there's work that's been done there? And then on the EMEA requirements, you mentioned that it's &#x2013; you're not going to need to do more clinical studies. Has the EMEA actually outlined what they need and then with regard to the FDA, do you have a meeting lined up with them?</p>
          <p>And then if I can, a couple of regulatory questions. Just Multaq Europe seems to be slightly delayed. Just wondered if there was any conversations you've been having with the EMEA that lead to that delay. And Menactra, the U.S. filing in the babies, that also looks slightly to be delayed, just wondered if there is anything behind that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well we actually have Jean-Pierre Lehner, who is our Chief Medical Officer. So I'll ask him to perhaps address the LANTUS questions first. Jean-Pierre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. The question, first question about the, which kind of information we could get from the ORIGIN study. The ORIGIN study is a study &#x2013; January but also &#x2013; and what we have got there in from the Safety Monitoring Board. The ORIGIN study is a study that is design was not at all I mean in order to find out any, counts incidents. Today, I mean, the Data Monitoring Board are known what we know from us because this is something which has been decided that the Monitoring Board and we are not aware of the decision they have taken so far, what we know is that we did not receive, I mean from them while they have reviewed all the data which are available to them, we have not reviewed &#x2013; we have not received any information about, let's say, any change in the continuation of the study.</p>
          <p>So this question is today very reassuring for the product. The second point, I mean we have got a long discussion with the CHMP about which kind of study &#x2013; technical discussion which kind of study which could be set up in order to make, let's say, all to clarify the situation on the LANTUS. And, as you know, I mean to perform a clinical trials as such is something which is definitively ethically impossible and by the way it will take five to 10 years to get an answer to this question. This is something with the company doesn't want. We doesn't want I mean to have to try to solve the productive issue on the LANTUS, we do not believe so far to five to 10 years, because this is a risk I mean the company will never take I mean for the patients.</p>
          <p>There are other techniques, I mean which allow such as a case control study, which could be performed either in Europe or in the United States and also I mean, we can also have an access I mean to data bank to data registries but not unclaimed database as it has been done in the past particularly in the Swedish, Scottish and German registries, but on let's say electronic medical records database, which are much more precise.</p>
          <p>One of the major confusing point, I mean, we have got on the publication results is the fact that a lot of information are missing today. Those information are, let's say, mainly epidemiological information about the duration of diabetes, concomitant medication. Simply the weight of the body mass index, for instance, which are very, very important confounding factors I mean for the risk of cancer.</p>
          <p>So we will try I mean to get this information in the next month and today we are contracting at the level of the United States with independent scientific societies in order to have the possibility to get this information as quickly as possible. And second, I mean we are today designing a case control study all over Europe. Those are the main features, I mean, we will submit early September to the CHMP. We will complete although in order to shed the light on the issue, pre-clinical studies in order to at the end of the day have a situation to which will be as clear as possible on this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And there's no possibility that the regulators would want to see any of the data that the Data Safety Monitoring Board, has seen for example, there's been no requests or that's not an option that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought I had answered the question that we did not get access to the data. What we know is that so far is that Data Monitoring Committee of the ORIGIN study has not informed us of any change. And this is most of the case, I mean in studies which are, let's say, ongoing studies in order not to disclose any specific results which could bias at the end of the day, the results or the interpretation of the study.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with just on Menactra, it's just a small delay, basically CBR has requested that we provide additional supportive data on concomitant use of Menactra and Prevnar, and this data has actually being generated and we should be in a position to file before year-end, which puts us in a good position competitively.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. You're sending a very, very strong message to value investors by committing to, or giving guidance on a long-range target underlining the sustainability of the new model that you're shifting to. What I suspect value investors would want to hear to feel absolutely comfortable with the thesis, which you're putting out, is that you're prepared to sit out the five years, invest in the strategic areas in the geographies that you've outlined and not be tempted by a high multiple U.S. transaction even if that is a business with rapidly growing assets. So perhaps you would like comment on that, Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, again the objective really is to kind of say, let's put a floor under a little bit of things here. And say here is what the business can do on its own. If we have an opportunity to grow top line and that value doesn't dilute margins, it's a concretive acquisition, and there are those, I mean we would do it. I mean it depends on what you'd call a high multiple, pretty much anything we buy is a high multiple compared to where we are. So &#x2013; but I think, we're not interested in diluting things, I mean I think, the other thing we'd say is we don't want anybody to sit out this thing for five years, we're just saying look at the 80%, I mean one of the things I find when I look at things is that I'm not seeing and I think, I am talking to a few other CEOs in other sectors. And it may be as a result of the financial crisis is that we're not really seeing much fundamental analysis being done any more.</p>
          <p>So if you actually go back and say what is the business worth, just as it is stands today, the terminal value numbers seem to be kind of without any kind of real substance to them. So the objective here is really not so much to say this is a &#x2013; what a value investor should look at. But here is some help in trying to figure out what a terminal volume might look like. What we're going to try to do is generate &#x2013; my ideal if we can do it and again this is in the forecast, but if you say what am I actually trying to do, I'd like to &#x2013; this is a big company. I think trying to get to double-digit growth every year is not going to be realistic, but if I could get to a &#x2013; if I could get to a CAGR of four or 5% on earnings per share over time, then you're going to make a lot of people a lot happier than what they look at the company today and clearly the only way we're going to do that is by adding on businesses intelligently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could add just one follow-up question for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me. Could you give us any indication of given you've given us some indication of revenue and net earnings, at least a floor, would you like to have as some kind of guidance on the margin structure of the group around that time given how you anticipate the mix of the business panning out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on when or where you are looking at. Basically what we say, when we say, we expect to have sales, which would be equivalent to the two way sale and we expect the net income to be equivalent to what we had in 2008. We clearly say that the net income to sale ratio would remain more or less stable. It's clear once again that all over this period, there will be shifts in our structure of cost. On one hand we will produce more in volumes, which will in absolute terms increase our cost of goods and to a certain extent increase the cost of goods to sales ratio quite simply because of the other hand we're going to sell products on the emerging markets with somewhat lower margins or maybe on OTC, you generally expect. We are going to fight against that with the cost savings program which I tried to describe before.</p>
          <p>We are going to continue to shift our marketing on sales spending on the high-cost country to low-cost countries. Also I mean if you are to develop vaccines for instance, it's clear that the ratio of the level of sale of marketing spending you have to sell vaccine is lower than what you have to sell, God bless us in the US. So clearly just as a result of this double shift, there will be a relative reduction of sales on marketing cost.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; I mean this &#x2013; I would say on one hand, it's clear there is no reason to spend R&amp;D against sales generating so very little. But on the other hand, I mean, it depends to a certain extent about the new potential products we could put on the pipe, so if we can have more we will do more, but basically everything being equal, of course we're going to do less as we have started to do as you've seen in the second quarter. And we shed these costs, we aim to continue to reduce it to a certain extent, so it doesn't give you &#x2013; I mean so it's easier to be very in this to take a view on the net income than to take a view &#x2013; a very precise view on the level of margins, or intermediate level of the various margins. But basically, we could say slightly &#x2013; slight increase of everything, I mean, on this base scale, let's say once again, slight increase of the cost of sale &#x2013; of the cost of good to sale for the reason we have explained that reduced to an slight decrease of R&amp;D to sales spending &#x2013; to sales revenues that once again everything being equal on decrease of the SG&amp;A to sales cost for the same base increases, I think this is a trend where we do, and this is how the outlook of our own business will look like within five years from now at least on this base of activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I would just think there is an element that J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me alluded to which is it's not just a level of margin but it's also the structure of the costs, so if you take R&amp;D as an example, basically if we just take the portfolio as it is today then given what we have in there we can clearly reduce our cost, and we are already moving to do that. However, if we have projects and to give you a concrete example, when we acquired BiPar we suddenly had a product going into Phase III. So that's going to increase your costs. But that becomes a variable cost at that point. That's not in someone's budget. We are taking a lot more of the fixed costs out. So if the BiPar product were to fall over or when it ends, that budget ends. If you say you're going to always spend 15%, then what happens is that budgets start looking for other projects.</p>
          <p>So what we're trying to do is take some of the fixed cost out and associate it with projects and if for whatever reason the project doesn't go ahead or the project finishes, then we can pull that cost back out of the structure. And obviously, as J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me said, you are not going to continue to spend versus sales that don't need replacing through R&amp;D such as some of your sales in emerging markets or OTCs and the like.</p>
          <p>So there is an element of cost structure and what it's doing in addition to the actual levels. But I think if you look at the &#x2013; at what J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me has presented in terms of profit, I mean, basically as we look at the business and remember we are already reasonably diversified, we already have 25% of our sales in the markets where everybody thinks the margins are lower. And I think as we said at the emerging markets seminar, we basically have operating margins pretty much everywhere between 40 and 45%. Well, as long as you don't spend 15% of your sales &#x2013; those sales on R&amp;D, you don't dilute your bottom line margin. But it is true that the intermediate steps may move around a bit.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I am sorry if I move from the road map, which is great by the way, to some number questions, just to help me with my starting point, for the terminal value. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me you said, when you talked about your goal to have a real reduction of production costs by 2% a year, you'd mentioned &#x2013; you had said production costs not cost &#x2013; not COGS, so I'm wondering whether there is a difference and if there is a difference how much? What is production costs as a percentage of COGS?</p>
          <p>And in terms of R&amp;D, after first quarter I'd hoped you would be able to tell us by the second quarter some more about your R&amp;D budget. And can you say anything more other than it depends on the project? Is it going to stay around that 15% level we have seen in the second quarter or can you go down from here in view of the terminations you have seen in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And then just a question on your licensing strategy for R&amp;D. Looking at the deals you have done so far this year, you could &#x2013; it appears that you're repositioning your R&amp;D efforts towards the more oncology specialty kind of areas. Now if you look at there have been several primary cares that's coming up for licensing so far this year which went to the competition despite the fact they were in areas where you're currently in. Is it correct to assume that you are less interested in those primary care areas because that's where you want to diversify away from it?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I took properly your question because it was not, I mean, the broadcast was not perfect. I think that when it comes to industrial costs we aim &#x2013; as I mentioned, as it is presented in slide 41, we aim to reduce our production costs by 2% per year over the five years. I think this is basically what we can think &#x2013; what we can say. And then of course, I mean everything being equal, meaning that if we are to produce another product as compared to another one, this may create a sort of shift. But this is basically a key, maybe, element which you could put in, if I understood properly your question, could put in your model, and then clearly you have to account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>COGS. I mean, my feeling about &#x2013; my feeling to COGS yes, I mean this is what &#x2013; I mean the COGS, the COGS includes mainly industrial costs plus some other costs such as some royalties which we are paying. So the overall, the actual industrial spending to say is around 18%, the rest being either royalties we pay on some productivity, if it is your question.</p>
          <p>When it comes to R&amp;D on the third quarter, I think that it is always difficult to say exactly quarter-by-quarter because we are in a process which is more looking forward two, three, five years outlook, not just on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But it appears that the decisions we have taken, everything being equal, to A, stop some projects; B, start to implement a change of the organization, will continue to lead to R&amp;D spending, which would tend to be lower. Also you remember that for the full year we gave the guidance at Q1 that already know the R&amp;D spending for the full-year should decrease by, that we said, a low single-digit. I think we could say now that's a few percent. This includes everything including the increase of R&amp;D spending we may have or we will have in vaccines.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the restructuring or the impact of the restructuring as such in R&amp;D, we will see the outcome of the impact of that more in 2010 than 2009. Quite simply because as you have understood by now we are still in the consulting period. So I mean, when it comes to closing some of the facilities and moving the people, this will take place in 2010, not in 2009. So you will see further reductions as a result of this process in 2010, but not in 2009.</p>

          <p>Maybe on the licensing. I think, again I think six months is kind of hard to judge a trend. We happen to have spotted some things and we're moving towards it, but I'll let maybe Hanspeter say a few words on the primary care and our strategy on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it is within six months, mainly a question of chance, hazards and opportunity. Nevertheless, I believe it's fair to say that today there is more opportunity in specialty care than in primary care. But nevertheless given our today's portfolio we cannot at all confirm that we would abandon primary care. If we find an opportunity to license in a primary care product, I believe that we are an excellent partner given our past and our present in primary care, but as always it needs two to tango.</p>

          <p>And I'd agree with Hanspeter. I mean I think &#x2013; if we find something in primary care where I still think &#x2013; I'm not prepared to say that we are abandoning primary care and moving to specialty. I mean we, I think, have shown especially as a company, I mean, you look at gold standard therapies that this company has built over the years, this is something we know how to do. But as Hanspeter says, you got to have something.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a question on the top line for the roadmap 2013. Could you give us a sense of how comparative you have been in taking into account the output from R&amp;D including or excluding Multaq?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>In the roadmap, we haven't really taken much into account, but except for Multaq.

          <p>Maybe an add-on to this first question. In terms of identification of cost savings, can we assume that you've already taken into account all of the acquisitions which have been announced so far?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have taken into, I mean, the answer is yes or no. I mean if I can say so. Yes, we have taken the acquisitions we have done so far. But when assessing this cost savings program, in particular we have not taken into account the synergy that we expect to generate from the Zentiva acquisition or the Medley acquisition. So we used the 2008 baseline and to be on this base on that, 2008, we had not yet acquired neither Zentiva or Medley. So you can basically say that the synergies that we planned, we used to or we plan to generate in these two acquisitions have not been taken into account in this 2 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just three quick questions. First on LANTUS. Can you just confirm whether you stand by your goal of doubling LANTUS sales from '08 to '12? And then on emerging markets growth, your target of doubling sales from 2008 to 2013, can you confirm how much of that comes from organic and how much comes from M&amp;A? And then lastly, on the investment in emerging markets, could you give us some indication of how much of the cost savings you plan to reinvest or at least some idea of how much is likely to see through to the bottom line? And if that will continue sort of over these next sort of four or five years or whether that will tail off at some point? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, LANTUS, yes. For emerging markets, remember if you're doubling in five years, you're looking for CAGR of around 13, 14, 15%. We did 20% in the second quarter. So to a degree given where those markets are, you don't really need to do that much to double those. I mean, if you look at LANTUS growing at 26%, even just doubling over the five years suggests a slowdown which is logical obviously because the base gets bigger, I mean the dynamic doesn't change.</p>
          <p>I don't think we took that much in terms of &#x2013; I don't think in any of these numbers, we've taken any new acquisitions into account. We just started, here's what the numbers are and what can you do, because in an acquisition you don't know what you're going to do, it's a little like fishing. You don't know when it's going to come into the boat for you and what size it is. So, we really just try to take the business as it is and project that towards 2013 and really get motivated around some transformation that we really need to do. But for the most part, most of it is organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely, I mean, Chris you're right. We have taken no significant acquisition in these figures. I know we have said that significant should be at maximum 1 billion investment. I mean, so clearly Zentiva would be considered in the definition as a significant acquisition. So there might be some bolt-on acquisitions to complete, I mean, if we do an acquisition of 30 million in China or in Indonesia, I mean, this will go into what we plan, I mean, this is a degree of precision we can be. But basically we can say that this is 90 or 85 or 90 or 95% organic and there is a precision you can have by year 2013, and no acquisition of the Zentiva type or whatever taken into account in these figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can contribute. Again there is a question concerning LANTUS, what you see on page 32 is the significant increase of our diabetes franchise is not only LANTUS of course. It includes what we do elsewhere in terms of industrial development. I think it's an open secret that we try to expand our industrial base, it includes what we intend to do in the field of diagnostics. In diabetes, it includes whatever can be done in terms of additional devices. So it is also connected to the overall concept that you have seen in other chart that we will build up a worldwide franchise around diabetes and within other existing products like just for an example, Apidra.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure, I was just wondering how much of the cost savings you've targeted would we expect to see the bottom line or indeed if you can give us some indication about what investments you plan &#x2013; or reinvestments, if you like, in emerging markets and how that may progress over time, whether it will fade away or be consistent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can assume that there will be no cost saving in the emerging markets overall, because in most &#x2013; at least, in the major markets like Brazil or Mexico or China, we will have to invest. But we will show very well leveraged profit and losses for those markets in the sense that our cost base will be growing much slower than our baseline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the only real cost as you'll see as J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me pointed out is the &#x2013; making sure that what we sell in emerging markets actually gets produced in emerging markets. But again, the company is already a long way down that path; of roughly 47% of the volume, around 37-38% is actually produced there. I mean, our biggest single facility is Brazil which is running around the clock seven days week, as an example and we have, I think, 27 factories in the southern hemisphere.</p>
          <p>So obviously if we can continue to manufacture, I mean, Shantha for example, will help. I mean it's obviously going to be not only a high quality facility but it's also a lower cost facility. So those types of cost savings, although that one in particular obviously hasn't been taken into account.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions about vaccines. First of all from the slides you've given Appendix &#x2013; slide 64, I could see that there's a decline by two percentage points of the margin in vaccines in the Q2. I wonder whether there was a specific reason and also what kind of margin increase, if any, you've taken in your 2013 plan for vaccine. And also in the same area, in &#x2013; I understand that in &#x2013; for H1N1 flu vaccine, nobody knows what the yields will be exactly, and what will be delivered. But apparently already in terms of contracts, sanofi has said a little less than its usual market share, for instance, the royalties as announced about $1 billion in contrast with the U.S. And you have about a quarter of that if I understand it well. Is there any reason or will there be more to come? Can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me take the second question first. Like I'm not thinking about market share here. First let's be clear that the demand is outstripping supply for the entire industry. So we will all pretty much sell every dose we make of whatever it is whether it's H1N1, seasonal flu for the North or seasonal flu for the South. It's more question of where you're going to allocate this and where it's going to go. There is some price difference between whether you're selling a seasonal flu in the South or a H1N1 in the North. But everybody is talking to everybody. What's not clear is really what are the yields, what is the dose and how hard is it going to be the make and when is it really going to come off the line?</p>
          <p>And the other problem is that we don't know how long the pandemic season is going to be if you like. Most people are excited about getting the vaccine, but they all want it before Christmas. It is pretty clear we can't manufacture in this industry 6 billion doses of H1N1 before Christmas. So mostly what we're trying to do is not have a first come, first serve basis. I think this is a major public health issue. We are working very closely with the WHO and with national health authorities to say where should we be doing this, we made a donation of 100 million doses but also that will take &#x2013; will allocate 10% of the production right from the first week to the WHO because clearly some countries are not rich enough to stockpile. And you're starting to see anxiety levels increase.</p>
          <p>And I think as a company we do not want to get into a question of should it only be rich Northern countries to get H1N1 or what happens to other countries who can't, or what happens if some countries have stockpiled everything and other countries don't? So if you like we're trying to work with countries and say there's only so much vaccine to go around between now and Christmas. How do we make sure everybody gets that? We're going to have to question ourselves because we are the global leader in vaccines and particularly seasonal flu with the greatest capacity. And as a result, for example, we are pretty much the only people that provide any meaningful doses of seasonal flu vaccine to the southern hemisphere. If we want to make that, we can't make H1N1, and so there's going to have to be a decision made, do we make H1N1, and we sacrifice the seasonal flu vaccine production for the South? Do we try to arbitrate that and keep H1N1 going a little longer and delay the seasonal flu?</p>
          <p>These are the actual real questions that we're dealing with. If the pandemic goes much beyond January, February, that's the time when we would normally start the campaign of seasonal flu for 2010. Nobody is going to be taking that decision any time soon. But you would have to say, well does H1N1 continue beyond February or do you go back to making seasonal flu?</p>
          <p>So these are the real questions, I am not the slightest bit interested in the market share and everything else because as I say, what we've seen is everybody is looking for more flu vaccines here and yes, we will have additional sales. We're just not sure exactly when and how much and where, but I don't think you have to worry about any of us really going without orders here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And about margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The answer is rather simple. This is totally linked to H5N1 where we had revenues last year which we have not this year, so this make the total &#x2013; the overall difference between the margin in Q2 '08 and Q2 '09. I can add also that there is some increase in R&amp;D expenses which is linked to the spending we are now having on dengue vaccine which will continue because currently we're embarking on a large trial which of course will increase at the stage of slightly beyond the spending or at least the spending down divided by sales.</p>
          <p>Going forward what we have taken in our plans is that we have taken into account on one hand the increase of sales of course. We have also taken into the new facilities we are presently building, which at the beginning have been impacting our COGS, sorry as long as we have not fully used. You know that we have adjusted the stockings new flu facility in the U.S. We are going to build one in China. But looking forward into 2013, the country will have full use of these facilities and we will benefit &#x2013; from more optimal on the state-of-the-art facilities and also from higher volumes, not to speak about some which have not been taken in our forecasts so far. So looking forward, we can say globally that the &#x2013; at EBIT level we aim to be around 30% EBIT-to-sales ratio in that sense of course with the conditions I mentioned before.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Dani Saurymper from Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask with regards to Japan now coming up as a growth opportunity. Are you satisfied with your local sort of sales presence in that market? I think 6% of your group sales. So if you could comment on that? Secondly, could you comment on the GLP-1, I believe you started Phase III studies in the first quarter of 2008. Are we to expect an update on that in the second half of the year? And just lastly, just a point of clarification if I may. Have you assumed any revenues in your '09 guidance related to the H1N1 vaccine? Have you already made an assumption of what revenues you might receive but left some on the table for potential &#x2013; more, if that makes sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought that is Japan. I have to differentiate. We &#x2013; I'm content with the growth we have in Japan. I continue not to be content with our presence. We have relatively small market share in Japan, which is smaller than in the rest of the world. But once again we're on a very, very good trend. We have a high two-digit growth in Japan. This will be a little bit lower in 2010 because 2010 will be once again a year with a &#x2013; we'd see obligations to reduce our prices but the underlying growth for the years to come I believe will be in the high two digits mainly because, mainly but not only because we're really benefiting from those products which had growth in the years before in Europe and in the United States. Which means in short if we see an opportunity to strengthen our market share by external growth, we definitely continue to look to it but also there, it depends on opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe to add onto that, Dani, just to remind you that this quarter sales force in Japan was somewhat subdued by the fact that the Q2 2008 comparative quarter included sales of the active ingredient of Aprovel to our local partner. And I'm sure that if you look at Q1 growth, this was indeed as just referred to double-digit rate. And just maybe on the GLP-1 program, basically the program is progressing well. We expect the first results of the mono therapy trying to be available in Q3, 2010, with additional results from other studies to be generated by the end of 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one-and-one. I mean, we have taken very limited contribution of H1N1 sales in 2009 for the precise reason, which I think we have developed already, which is that we don't know exactly what will be the timing of when we will deliver and also have acceptance of the products in particular in the states. So, this may influence partly the sales, which will be booked in 2009, what will be booked in 2010 or for the second reason, which is at a certain time, there is a &#x2013; as there is arbitrage to be taken between seasonal flu and H1N1 pandemic flu vaccines. But clearly you could say that we are &#x2013; we have been conservative all in all on the assumption we've taken for the guidance 2009 in that respect.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions please. First one, just to clarify on your long-term guidance. Does your floor case of flat net income actually assumed reinvestment of a significant portion of the cost savings into the business outside of acquisitions? I'm just asking the question because it wasn't clear to me whether you need the cost savings that you've set out in order it to close the profit gap between the top products that are going generic and the new growth drivers or whether you're actually looking to reinvest quite a bit of the cost savings into the business in order to generate the growth drivers in the first place?</p>
          <p>And my second question, just again coming back to LANTUS and the case control database analyses that you're going to be doing, how long should we plan in terms of a timeline for getting results there? Are we likely to a result in early 2010 and late 2010, would you communicate it all in one go or how should we think about that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the reinvestment and the cost saving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reinvestment of cost savings, it's I mean, it's clear that I mean here I will differentiate my answer. When it comes to reinvestment into development of organic sales typically reinvestment of marketing efforts in emerging countries, yes, we have here a net element which includes reinvestment of the gross per savings we'll generate from lower spending, let's say in markets where we are going to do this pattern typically.</p>
          <p>So in that respect, yes. We are taking into account reinvestment but 2 billion is a net impact. So if we have to think about the gross impact it will be much higher than that. But we are reinvesting part of it in order to get further development sales and growth, typically in emerging market possibly in vaccines to take examples. But if you think about investing into acquisitions then the answer is no, it's clear that beyond that we will generate a lot of free cash flow, which we have not assumed at this stage. So we invest into acquisition, so clearly this will come on top.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could I just add on that, I caution you on using the word guide &#x2013; long-range guidance. It is the guidance if you like, on the existing business from 2008. It's just a projection of that existing business. It's not necessarily what we're going to do in 2013 because obviously we've got three or four years of management effort here. And we'd expect to have a different result but that's just an extension and extrapolation of 2008 as an existing business given also the impact of what we want to do on cost reduction and transformation.</p>

          <p>Yes, I fully understand that chart 44, is this for illustrative purposes, but I was just trying to make sure that I read it correctly. So the way to read this chart is basically to say that the growth drivers that are going to be picking up from the products that are going to generic are at the end of the day substantially less profitable. So, on a net basis you need that 2 billion cost-savings to keep net income flat. And then whatever the management team might be looking at over the next five years could then start generating additional net income growth beyond that. Is that right?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you something. I'll have to add that. I think I have mentioned it already, is that you need to keep in mind that we're not booking the sales generated by LBMS in the U.S. So here we are getting what is scored in our P&amp;L, all the revenues that we are going to lose. So we are going to &#x2013; we need to compensate for that, if you want to get the same net income, I think the same sales as you can understand. So just a result of that. I mean the cost savings is also going to contribute to this compensation but what you said on top is right definitely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry. Some very quick questions. First of all to extrapolate a little bit more on the diabetic franchise just Hanspeter touched on for the 2013 timeframe. When do you think you will be in a position to tell us more about your plans for next-generation incidents to look beyond LANTUS and see where we are against this competition. Second, is it fair to say that with flat net income that will translate probably into positive cash flow in 2013 with CapEx and working capital management? Thirdly, when do you expect your discussions with Merck about Merial to complete or is it anything new to tell us about? And lastly, again for these 2013 guidance, did you assume a flat 29% tax rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the questions. I can take the final few questions. Yes, of course, we are going to generate positive free cash flow on these, let's say, a base case or floor case. All of us are here not only in 2013, but including 2013 when it comes to the tax rate, we have assumed, we have taken into account the fact that we were going to lose some patents. So that we will lose some low tax revenues or low tax revenues coming from royalties being paired through to the parent company. So we have taken that into account so in other terms, everything being equal on this case, we have assumed some increase in average tax rate. But I will play skip because to assess what could be the exact tax rate in 2013 is definitely and act which needs time but I can say that we have taken that into account.</p>

          <p>On the diabetes question, we will be report on the progress of our various projects in disease of diabetes like long-acting insulin within our regular reporting on progress is in research overall. Nevertheless, we all have to hope that by the creation of this new division or business units as the progress will be a little bit accelerated as compared to the past, but besides I have nothing to announce today. Chris, you want to take the Merial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on Merial, I mean I would refer you to our partners over at Merck. I think I've said it before. We like the animal health business if there was an opportunity to extend our participation in that market, we would welcome it, but you really would have to ask Merck about the timing of the decisions. Maybe just a point on R&amp;D, obviously we haven't given a lot of detail around the structure that we're talking about even though &#x2013; because there is a structure that follows the mindset. We'll probably come back in the second half and tell you more about that. We would just prefer to go through our consultation processes at the moment before we put a lot of flesh on that. So I'm conscious that we haven't given you a lot of detail on that at the moment, and we will do that at one point in time.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have a &#x2013; sorry I was having a problem dialing in. On the 2013 guidance you've given, I know you benchmark it against 2008. If I benchmark it against the current year, you know it essentially 2009 &#x2013; it essentially says that revenues might be about 7% lower in 2013 and net income could be almost 10% lower relative to 2009. So it kind of neighbors across the four years if I take those two data points. My question is the trajectory of those financials along the way from 2009 to 2013. So for example my model says that 2009 could be the high and from here to 2013 years could all be lower in terms of revenue and net income. So any comment on their trajectory from 2009 to 2013. And then just a quick question on LANTUS. Can you just tell us what the next important safety data point that we're likely to hear about is likely to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so if you know, the more you go down the path of the transparency, the more everybody else wants obviously. The whole idea again is, flat sales with 2008, let me repeat, is not my forecast for where I think 2013 sales or flat profit with 2008 is not my forecast, where I think profit actually is going to be. All I'm saying is that if you look at the business that existed in 2008, I think there's been a significant under appreciation of what is in the rest of the business because it's so much more difficult to value and it's really management's view of how that business could evolve.</p>
          <p>So if you're going to try to draw a straight line between where you think 2009 is Tim and that number, that's not the way where we're going to see it. I mean I think we know between now and 2012 really where you guys are and if we don't do anything there hasn't been a significant difference between our own internal forecasts and your forecast. There were big differences between our internal forecast post 2013 and where the market was.</p>
          <p>Now, that doesn't say that we're just going to sit on their hands and say we're going to wait for the transformation to occur and all will be good in 2013. We're going to the beach for the next three years, and we'll see you then. Clearly we are going to lose products and we are going to be trying to boost that. My view is that if I were to say to you hey, 2011 looks suddenly $200 million or &#x20AC;200 million better because we did a little extra cost cutting, nobody is interested in that in terms of share price. However, we do know that if we don't do much that there isn't an awful lot of growth between now and 2012, given that we've got some dynamic franchises and some patent losses.</p>
          <p>So, that's why we're already active in trying to define these bolt-on acquisitions and build the delta every year that looks out. And that's why to me the 2013 number is not a forecast because we intend to do different things between now and 2012. However, it doesn't help us much and again if I look at the last 10 years, just driving up better numbers on a year-by-year basis is not what interests shareholders. I mean I can't tell you how many years in my old company where we delivered double-digit growth and nothing happened on the share price because everybody was worried post a certain year. And our discussion with actual shareholders is, you can do all you want. I mean, if I came up with increased guidance for 2009 it isn't going to encourage anybody to buy the shares because people want to know do you have a plan that goes after 2012 that it all doesn't fall apart. And I think our message here really today is that even if you don't allow for acquisitions, because the acquisitions you don't really know what I'm going to buy and when it's going to come. But even if you don't count that the business doesn't fall off a cliff in 2012 basically.</p>
          <p>The cliff is not a cliff anymore. So, now we are in the situation of saying, I want to actually take the business as from today and wherever the jumping-off point is at the end '09. We need to try to do things so that we show growth in '10, '11, '12 and '13. And on that basis you would expect the '13 numbers to look higher. But none of that helps you in terms of shareholder value if you don't actually say there is a base of business there that is actually going to carry you through and that it doesn't all go pear-shaped after 2013.</p>
          <p>So, please don't draw those numbers, those straight lines from your forecast down there. That's not really the spirit in which it was intended. It was always a risk, I guess, to put it out there like that because people assume it's just, well that's what you've forecasted. No, it's just because of all the discussions we've had with investors, we realize that we actually had to help people to kind of at least give management's perspective of some of the parts of the business that nobody's ever really looked at over the last couple of years. But clearly we don't want to go backwards, sideways, or anything like that over the next few years. But that is going to take more of these external growth opportunities and that you know obviously is a little bit opportunistic although we're taking a very systematic approach to looking for those things. Don't know whether that helps you, Tim?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. No, that does, thank you. And then on LANTUS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we are not expecting today any particular plan before the results of this study and particularly that average history we are setting up to so far. The safety of LANTUS is permanently in control within the company of course and if there is no unexpected events, which we believe, we are not expecting any specific safety next point as you say, before the end of the results of the study.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'll just finish one point. We've been through LANTUS and I understand the prudence of the investment community. However I think you should understand that the only people asking us questions these days on safety are the investor community. You talk to the regulators, I think the CHMP was extremely clear in its point that the data that were presented in Diabetologia don't show any link. There is no need to change recommendations.</p>
          <p>We're doing it from the point of view of taking the scientific high road to look at what other studies we can do and also in the interest that should something else come up, because let's face it, and these group of experts they say, well you know, we've known for a long time that there appears to be some link between diabetes and say colorectal cancer. So if someone were to suddenly pop out a study saying that we've seen higher incidence of colorectal cancer with LANTUS as an example, well who knows whether that's LANTUS or that's diabetes, and, or insulin even.</p>
          <p>So that's why in the event that &#x2013; because there is a lot of people who are trying to gain media exposure by doing some of these studies and certainly at some point I think there needs to be a call for saying, if you've got studies and there is information on safety we shouldn't be the only ones who have to share that with regulatory authorities. If people have serious safety concerns about products, they should be at least ringing up the regulatory agency. But that's not what happens. You've got people who are looking to be media stars and hold this information back and try to pop it out in some scientific journal somewhere.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of a fact of life that we have to deal with. We are not aware of any other studies ongoing. But I also want to make sure that should something come up, at least we are doing the studies and we could be protected. But I would emphasize again that the regulatory agencies, all of the experts that we talk to, regulatory agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, nobody is looking at this as a safety issue. So all that questions that you guys are posing, I mean they're good questions and we are trying to deal them but you're the only ones posing them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, I guess there's two data points that have me a little worried on LANTUS, which is that predecessor molecule, that AspB10, which was an insulin analog and that was terminated in pre-clinical development, because it did show higher tumor rates. So that's kind of one data point and then the second data point is that when you guys actually did your animal studies with LANTUS, there was a cancer signal and the FDA reviewers noted that and that's actually in your label as possibly being a signal. So I understand, like there's &#x2013; muddy to analyze all the data on this sort of thing, because we're talking about discrete events with a low event rate. But the history here does at least give something, I don't know, gives me a little bit of pause especially with that predecessor molecule.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The old preclinical package of LANTUS has been reviewed and, very recently by the way, and the conclusion which we have drawn, I mean in 2000, 2001 are absolutely identical. Meaning that today there is no carcinogenic risk as it has been described, I mean for the product you precisely said.</p>
          <p>Second point for the pre-clinical issues, the doses which are used, in the pre-clinical work &#x2013; animal models have nothing to do with what is used in patients, diabetic patients type 1, type 2 are now receiving the product. So no conclusion can be drawn as far as the risk of cancer is concerned for any insulin induced model.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, I would like to add one point. When we are talking about data registries, we are only focusing on LANTUS. We are let's say, having a look to all the insulins because this is a debate and this is why we have decided to embark on that. Not because we're fearing something for LANTUS, simply because we do think that at the end of the day we have to figure out if there a risk for patients, not in vitro, not pre-clinical studies, in patients if there is any risk of using insulin at large in these diabetic patients.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. S&#xE9;bastien Berthon from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen. Two quick questions, please, one on Multaq. Could you walk us through any difference in terms of the market dynamics that would lead to &#x2013; for you to have a different pricing strategy in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And secondly, more on the short-term for what's your view of the Plavix scenarios in Europe following the &#x2013; a number of new generic approvals versus the scenario then we have seen in Germany and probably could you comment on some of the specific countries, because we understand that some generics have had broader approvals than the ones we've seen in Germany so far? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start first with Multaq. Well we develop the Multaq price strictly in line with the economic clinical outcome in function of the local labeling. So I think everything is set. We see so far we have no labeling outside the U.S. so it's impossible to say what will be our worldwide strategy, but true is that our request for labeling is everywhere, is the same as everywhere, built on the same &#x2013; on the same clinical outcome. And therefore I'm convinced that we will have everywhere a very interesting price especially to the existing competition, which is to nearly 100% generic, but has nothing in comparison in terms of health outcome as compared to Multaq. I have been working today for example on the Multaq pricing for Australia, which is relatively close and I can tell you that once again we have a very, very good set of data, which is supportive for a very interesting price.</p>
          <p>Now on Plavix in Europe or in outgoing from the situation in Germany, as I said earlier, we have a limited penetration of generics in Germany equal to approximately 24% in terms of value sales. This is largely due to two facts. First, we have a limited substitute ability as there is a very strong debate today going on in Germany, also on the legal level, should the pharmacist have the right or not to substitute two products which have not identical label. We believe that this a very valuable debate. It's a debate which is also animated by the association of pharmacists because the pharmacist feels that they are exposed in terms of liabilities and we believe there is good reason.</p>
          <p>The second effect limiting penetration in generics, at least in Germany, is that we are flexible with our commercial policy. And built from this experience, we are not too nervous about future development around Plavix and its generic competition. We believe that we are not in a classical case where there is 100% substitution and consequently a very rapid penetration within weeks or months. More I cannot say because of the fact we have today no generic competition except in Germany. There is a product available in the U.K. but it hardly doesn't sell anything as of today as we speak.</p>
