        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our traditional quarterly investor call on the IFRS reporting. We're pleased to present positive results as, hopefully, becomes the tradition. I would make couple of technical remarks.</p>
          <p>Firstly, our financials and our investor presentation slides, as usual, are on our website, in the www.sberbank.ru in the Investors section. You can find them there and we can refer to the slides through this call. And then, I'll probably spend a minute or two on highlighting the main numbers and, as we usually do, I think have become more comfortable for everyone, switch straight on to Q&amp;A so that I can provide some color to your questions.</p>
          <p>We have seen another good quarter in loan demand, and we're continuing to increase the share in retail loans. And that has contributed to us showing the net profit of RUB255.8 billion for nine months, which is an increase from RUB109.6 billion over the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>Our revenues continue to be of a high quality and continue to come from core banking operations. Net interest margin has increased in the second and third quarters this year by 30 basis points and 20 basis points accordingly, mostly driven by the growth of interest earnings assets as a composition and the decrease in the cost of funds.</p>
          <p>We continue to observe improving loan quality, that has resulted in some significant amounts of provisions released in relation to the problem loans, although some part of provisions we continue to create for some new situations in the core corporate loan book.</p>
          <p>We, despite the high operating expenses in the nine months of 2011 as compared to 2010, have been managing to stay in a very comfortable area, 45.7% of our cost income ratio. We see that costs year-on-year growth outlook for 2011 is going to be around 30% in nominal terms year-on-year, which has been a number of times highlighted before, is a managed spike which should not be repeated in the following years. We would guide for the 2012 and 2013 cost growth at low teens, just few points above the inflation.</p>
          <p>We, in the third quarter, have announced our transactions to buy Volksbank International, have discussed that on a separate call, and are continuing to prepare for closing this transaction.</p>
          <p>Before I &#x2013; yes, and what I wanted to also mention in the opening remarks is that we have shown a very remarkable return on equity of 31.5% for nine months of this year, on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>Before I finish my opening remarks, I would anticipate one of the more detailed technical questions that many people have asked us since this morning, so that I can preempt the questions going forward. One of the indicators that we show in this reporting is that our renegotiated loans have grown by 40-odd-percent in this period. Just wanted to clarify straightaway that this is in relation to one single transaction that is large. We have issued, on the 16 of August, a press release on that transaction.</p>
          <p>It still hangs on our website, in the archive of press releases. You can check it. It relates to RUSAL. It bases the renegotiation of this transaction &#x2013; of the main terms of this transaction. Formally, it requires us to put it into this category, although we agree, and our auditors support that, that in terms of credit risk profile, that that hasn't really changed it much, or in fact probably improved it. What was done there is, some tenure of the loan has been amended. There has been some reshuffling in the composition of the collateral, and we are pretty comfortable that &#x2013; and the interest rate has been reduced somewhat, to reflect the improved risk standing of this particular client.</p>
          <p>So we are, therefore, not providing &#x2013; not making more provisions against this particular client. We're just registering the fact that some terms on the loan have been changed without deterioration in the credit quality. So, hopefully that clarifies this well. And if need be, I can probably provide more comments.</p>
          <p>But with that, I suggest we switch to the question-and-answer mode, and we'll welcome questions from you. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There will be a short pause while participants register for a question. Thank you. Your first question comes from Sam Goodacre from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton. Sam from Morgan Stanley in London here. A couple of questions from me on NIMs and asset quality. Can you perhaps give some more detail on the evolution of NIMs in the beginnings of the fourth quarter, perhaps, in terms of any pricing trends you've seen, any re-pricing on the asset side, or indeed, cost of funding pressures? And then, perhaps, the NIMs trajectory into next year.</p>
          <p>And then a second question on asset quality, similar in nature. If you could just detail some of the trends you're seeing across the portfolio, perhaps any signs of deterioration in &#x2013; whether it be mortgages, consumer loans, SMEs or what that might be. And then, again, do you have any expectations at this stage of cost of risks into 2012? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the questions. Starting with NIMs, we see that the cost of the deposits have been rising a little bit in the banking sector. And there were some liquidity constraints in the banking market &#x2013; in the inter-bank market in the recent weeks, as we have all observed them. Those two events are linked. We have watched the situation carefully, and with respect to liquidity, there's probably likely to be continuing pressure on savings rates in the sector from the liquidity constraints, although we don't perceive these &#x2013; we expect these to be of any of a shock nature</p>
          <p>These are just gradual pressure. We, therefore, have positioned ourselves in such a way that in the context of two big rate cuts in the deposit rates that we have done ourselves back last year in April and August, which were pretty significant, I remind you. On a combined basis, they were probably 200, 300 basis points in nominal terms.</p>
          <p>We all well knew that we will probably have to start increasing the rates a little bit coming to the autumn of 2011 simply because the inflation has been somewhat high in the first half of 2011 and the client perception would warrant this. And therefore, we have done a step-up in our retail deposits effective 1 of November, which in terms of the attractiveness for the client we think is very efficient in terms of cost of funding for us is not going to have a material effect, at least nowhere near to the effect &#x2013; to the positive effect of the rate cuts that we have done last year.</p>
          <p>So, we will continue to monitor the situation. Again, competitively &#x2013; from a competitive standpoint, we're not really re-pricing our deposits because the rest of the market very quickly reciprocates those moves. It's more the client perception that will manage our retail deposit pricing.</p>
          <p>So, we will watch the situation and see if any further reaction was needed to be done. But we want to signal that this is not a serious threat to our margin outlook for the simple reason that there is other factors that positively compensate any effect from that. And, again, we mentioned before, re-pricing in our retail deposit is actually quite slow in its own.</p>
          <p>So, the factor that compensates for that, we have also mentioned before it's nothing new, is that our &#x2013; on the asset side, our retail and SME loans grow faster than the rest of the loan book and the margins there are much more attractive in terms of the risk and reward balance. So, our outlook for net interest margins, therefore, for the rest of the year and for most of 2012 is stable. That's NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Quality of the loans, we get this question very often in the recent months, especially ever since this market situation &#x2013; this market difficulty situation started from August/September when S&amp;P downgraded the States and then European story continues to unfold. But we want to make couple of comments on this front.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we believe that not that much fundamentally has changed in the world outside Russia since August/September. Simply most of what's been going into the market is rather recognition of the depth of the problems that have fundamentally already been there by the beginning of this year. Therefore, it's only the most recent weeks and months of, say, the European events unfolding that has started to have more fundamental impact on things because these problems were from being recognized has started to be showing themselves off in the fundamentals.</p>
          <p>So that means that the impact on the Russian economy is, normally in those type of circumstances, is seen with a six to nine months' time lag at least. And that is normally in the circumstances when through, say, equity and debt markets, Russia was a bit more dependent on their state globally. These days, we think Russia is a little bit better insulated because it's not over-leveraged or not running. I'm talking about both the state and the corporate world, and it's not running as big liquidity mismatches as they used to have been back in 2008.</p>
          <p>Also in Russia, any significant liquidity problems that could have been induced from external events are much more subdued because of a simple reason that Russian banks, Russian corporates and Russian regulators, all of us, we've learned our lessons from 2008 and '09. We &#x2013; the Russian monetary authorities in the Central Bank as the regulator are now much more vigilant and alert to any potential disrupt &#x2013; systemic disruptions to the liquidity in the banking market and, therefore, have been reacting to those difficulties very efficiently.</p>
          <p>And therefore &#x2013; although the rates environment has felt this, but the stability in the sector has been successfully preserved, which means even if Russian macro reacts and even &#x2013; it will react slower than previously to any negative scenario that may unfold in Europe. And it's a bit too earlier for that to be seen, and especially too early for that to start filtering through the quality of the loan book.</p>
          <p>So, so far, what we're observing in our books is continuing improvement of the loan quality. We're continuing to deliver extraordinary recovery rates on the problem loan portfolio that we have. We'll continue to see same amounts of loan appetite and loan demand in consumer and corporate world that we've been observing on average throughout 2011. And we believe that structurally those levels are &#x2013; under normal circumstances are sustainable in the Russian banking sector for the nearest couple of years.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but if the outside of Russia story turns out to be really bad, then we believe that the impact is going to be much more limited. And if anything, the threat to the loan growth is going to be coming from liquidity constraints, but of a non-shocking nature, just the constraints fundamentally stemming from the fact that savings are growing, tending to grow a bit slower than the loan demand. That's concerning the quality.</p>
          <p>In terms of costs, we &#x2013; as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we continue to guide for 30-odd nominal year-on-year cost increase, but that should subside into low-teens like between 11% and 13% nominal cost growth for the next two to three years. We continue to cut stuff in the areas where we can generate more efficiencies through process and IT implementation and through improving the quality. But we continue to build stuff in the areas where we developed new business opportunities, or we see the growth warranting this.</p>
          <p>So, we are comfortable that cost dynamics are under control. There's big task in front of us to invest into CapEx and OpEx to transform the bank into something even better than it is now. But we also see that there's some cost efficiencies that we extracted in the early years as starting to compensate for that and especially visible from next year on.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cheers, Anton. Just following on from the first one on NIMs, actually, you said that there was some liquidity constraints in the inter-bank in particular. In the third quarter your balances due to banks has actually increased. So, if we go into an environment where savings do increase, so lending outperforms deposits, what was the funding outlook be there and any sort of impact on NIMs?</p>
          <p>And then, actually, just then a very final one from me. Given you've mentioned VBI, can you give us some more color on your broadest structure in acquisitions? So, you've been on the tape recently saying that you have perhaps curbed plans in the meantime for Turkey and Poland acquisitions. And then also there was some news flow today on BTA. So, just anything around that would be great. And then that's it from me. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On NIMS, the first part of your question, if you could maybe rephrase that, I'm not sure I'm understanding what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, basically, if we were to look at your reliance into next year on inter-bank and wholesale, given deposits will very possibly underperform or lag credit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when I was saying that the savings grow slower, then the demand for loans &#x2013; I was a bit more referring to that being an issue for the banking sector overall. We see that for us here in Sberbank, it's far less of an issue. And the three sources for funding for us is increasing loans to assets from 69 that we've reported now to a more optimal 75, which means, in assets, converging part of our liquidity stash in the form of securities portfolio into the loans.</p>
          <p>Secondly is unlocking some of our more competitive features in our ability to attract retail deposits and improve our market shares there, and not only through pricing of deposits. And thirdly, yes, we have barely scratched our capacity to tap wholesale funding from the markets. We've sort of single percentage points of our liability structure being wholesale funding. So, we're saying, for us, systemic liquidity constraints are not going to be that much of a problem to sustain loan growth pace at the levels that we've been demonstrating in 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of broader M&amp;A strategy, we're saying that we're kind of having a bit of a reserved approach, but we will carefully watch Turkish and Polish markets for any opportunities that may arise. But then, again, it's true that we're not in a particular hurry. For us, it's a long-horizon story to enter those markets and to create competitive offerings there in such a way that we can switch on the volume.</p>
          <p>But in the meantime, as we've been discussing always, VBI fit our target definition comfortably because it's not only a cross-country platform with a central single-governance point, but also it's relatively compact. And, yes, it misses Poland and Turkey. So we may add on there, but the whole time horizon over which we think about is that it will take us a year to integrate, clean-up whatever issues that maybe there, and then make sure that the most important thing is that we can transfer our domestic competitive advantages to those markets comfortably before we switch on the volume. And that will take us a year or two, and afterwards, the volume can be switched either organically or through additional acquisitions in the countries that we've already established a bit of a footprint through VBI.</p>
          <p>So that's the approach. The thing that we will never get tired of stating is that there's absolutely no gigantic mania amongst the Board and the Executive Board of Sberbank. Some very excited people come up to us and suggest that "Oh, because you're Russians, you &#x2013; and you can afford it, you must be having a temptation to buy half of the European banking sector in Western Europe and throwing around various big names that we apparently should be tempted to buy."</p>
          <p>We're saying that neither from a business standpoint nor from risk management expertise standpoint, we're not going to be tempted to do these things. We continue to stick to our strategy of the one that I've just described of gradual compact entrance to the Eastern European region and laboring it pragmatically from there, first quality then volume. And there's not going to be unexpected moves from us there. And my colleagues are suggesting &#x2013; are prompting me that our CEO have made comments about BTA today publicly that we are not interested. So that's the take on the international.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks very much, Anton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. You have another question from Dmitry Trembovolsky from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Anton. I just have a follow-up on the restructured actually. So, if I'm not mistaken, the total increase in the restructured loans for the third quarter was over RUB300 billion, to be precise RUB307 billion. And as your press release, which you mentioned is stating, the RUSAL loan was around $4.6 billion. So, taking a 32 U.S. Dollar-Ruble rate, that implies around RUB150 billion of additional restructuring that you took on board in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So that leaves us with another RUB160 billion of restructured loans, which will be very helpful to know where it is coming from. Is it a real estate? Is it something else equally big that you've done, because that's &#x2013; even ex-RUSAL, there's actually a huge increase in your restructured portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just one second. Yes, my colleagues have just confirmed to me that there's a few other names in there, and they've mentioned the names to me as well. I'm not disclosing them, but I remember the situation as we were discussing them in our credit committee meeting. There are renegotiations of a similar nature where the terms of the loan are renegotiated on the basis of either just some basic changes to the pace of whatever projects our borrowers are running or to the improving valuations in collateral, or changing in the interest rate environments where in most of those cases our borrowers were negotiating for lower rates because their risk profile has been improving. So, there isn't anything that would signal deterioration in the credit quality.</p>
          <p>And if anything, I think we have created good enough positive reputation amongst our loyal investors that in all matters, credit risk, we're very conservative and transparent and open. And if there were a basis for us to provide more in relation to the &#x2013; more provisions in relation to those renegotiations that we have done, then we would have not hesitated to provide more and reflect higher cost of risk.</p>
          <p>But we haven't done this, and our auditors have seen this and they agree that this is &#x2013; in this particular situation, this is the right approach. It is just that the way IFRS requires you to disclose those things, you still show them as renegotiated and because it's a largish transaction. It's safer to do so regardless of the fact that this is more formal and the substance suggest that it should be of no meaningful importance to the user of the financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have NPVs of any of these loans changed as a result of these renegotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they've improved pretty much in all cases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Improved, so increase you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yep, improved as in &#x2013; yeah, the quality of the risk is getting better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I mean is probably what's happened is that you cut rate, so probably the situations were that people were getting loans for like, I don't know, 12%, 15%. And then as interest rates were going down, they came to you asking for a lower rate, and probably the longer maturity, I don't know. So, I would imagine that although cyclical, the NPVs of these loans should have come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we're happy to have that because any change in the rate comes from the improving of the risk component, so the pricing remains adequate. If you could just bear with me one sec.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my colleagues are also prompting to me that, from Moscow, that nevertheless, regardless of the fact that these renegotiations take place, the current operating data that we see is showing that our interest rate differential continues to grow. You remember on a couple of previous calls, we made that distinction that net interest margin is reflecting the retrospective situation in your portfolio whilst interest rate differential is the measure of how much income, interest income, versus interest expense would you earn if the portfolio remain the same from today onwards, which is kind of the reflection of the current rates that are there on the loan. So that continues to grow even if on individual basis some of the transactions are NPVs reducing, for us, all in all we're still enjoying a positive trend in net interest rate differential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just finally on this, I mean, would you be comfortable &#x2013; not <mark type="ph" /> where the (32:06) names, it's too much but would be comfortable sharing sectors where all of this kind of other RUB150 billion in sitting, sector or sectors?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty varied, actually. Good quality sectors there such as telecoms and couple of others, so it's &#x2013; again, it's further to prove that there's no concern we're having on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Just turning up from this one, just another one on loan growth. I just wanted to ask you, obviously it's a very, very strong performance in the third quarter. I guess some of this is related to the fact that people were taking out or were using the credit lines that you've pre-approved them back, say, in the beginning of the year or even in 2010. Understanding on one hand that rates will go up and it's a better world now than later on and also understanding that placing Eurobonds or taking loans term from the Western banks is pretty much impossible. So, how sustainable do you think &#x2013; or, let's putting it otherwise, do you think we will &#x2013; we're up for a slowdown in loan growth in the first quarter and first half of 2012 because this demand which we have seen, this is pretty much lags the demand from what you have previously approved?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a little bit of that sentiment, but it is also countered by a little .bit of a different &#x2013; of an opposite sentiment that we often come across in talking to our corporate clients, because a number of them to whom we would go out and sell and say, "Look, we've recalculated your risk <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:18) and we're happy for you to carry a little bit more leverage and borrow from us because that will make you more resilient to any particular negative scenarios even if they don't occur."</p>
          <p>And some of the borrowers are saying, "Well, actually no. We don't want to over-borrow, et cetera," regardless of the fact that we are suggesting to them that they actually can borrow a bit more comfortably. So it's a mixed sentiment. Some of the entrepreneurs are saying, "Look, I've learned my lessons from 2008-'09. I don't want to be &#x2013; I'd rather be under-leveraged than over-leveraged." And therefore, they see the optimum in somewhat more conservative terms than we suggest to them.</p>
          <p>And some of them are kind of smart and are saying "Well, we comfortably can borrow and there's good opportunity to do some more projects and works and business development and support our business with borrowing." So it's a mixed bag. Therefore, we're saying, the loan demand levels are at about their optimum and are broadly sustainable going forward in a structural way, with the only constraint going forward being a little bit of liquidity in nature, but then, as I've mentioned before, far less applicable to Sberbank than to anyone else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your weekly data that you monitor, the credit committee, you're still seeing this kind of demand coming in, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; on a weekly basis, it fluctuates. Sometimes it accelerates a little bit, sometimes it goes down. And you see this in both the top level credit committee where obviously the big transactions come sometimes not matching the inflow of smaller loan applications. So, it's pretty uneven in all the segments, large, medium and small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And the very final one from me, I noticed in your investor presentation that the GDP forecast you have for next year, which I guess you're using for your budget, is I think 4.1%, if I'm not mistaken. To what extent do you think, to your knowledge, do you think <mark type="ph" /> clearly (36:34) and the think-tank change that, I guess, producing this is comfortable with that forecast, which now is substantially above consensus and even above the government's own forecast, which I think is 3.7%. Because on the back of this, I think, you're producing your budget which has around 20% loan growth in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to a degree, whether it's 3.7% or 4.1% is having much less significance for the banking sector and &#x2013; well, maybe that's a stronger statement, much less significant for Sberbank's own loan growth outlook than to the macro &#x2013; rest of the macro economy and rest of the banking sector. Because our key fundamental approach is that even if Russian economy slows itself in general, if it's faster or slower a little bit more or less, the loan demand structurally is still going to be strong there, because Russia is so fundamentally under-banked and not yet optimally leveraged. And therefore, it's far less of a threat to our loan book growth if it slows down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, one thing probably my colleagues are prompting to me that the most recent comments from <mark type="ph" /> Mrs. Yudiava (38:14) were around 3.8%. But don't hold me responsible for that, we may need to check with her most recent views.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Jason Hurwitz from Alfa Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a little bit of a question relating to the RUB43 billion loss on revaluation of available for sale securities that came below the net income line. Could you comment on the nature of those losses, how much you might have recovered in the fourth quarter, and how we should be viewing this item as a recurring source of income or loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, this is revaluation of the AFS portfolio, available-for-sale portfolio, which is largely consisting, as you know, from high quality low yielding, very liquid, debt instruments of federal, so federal municipal nature and Russian corporate blue chips. The duration of this book is not particularly long and the credit quality of this type of a book is very high. Therefore, it's for a good reason that IFRS allows them to go through capital line as opposed to the P&amp;L line because &#x2013; especially applicable to the portfolios of this type, they're easily recoverable. So that is the reflection of what's been going on in the securities market in the third quarter, more so much closer to September than anywhere else.</p>
          <p>We have seen bigger losses in this item recorded through capital in the earlier years and we've always stuck to the same approach that firstly there's no reason to fix losses from any risk metric approach that you might look at it and we can comfortably sit them out. Our liquidity and strength and stamina of our balance sheet allowing &#x2013; are allowing us &#x2013; and our P&amp;L are allowing us to do that. So we're pretty comfortable that ultimately these losses will reverse themselves out as the situation in the markets becomes reflecting less of an emotional state of the markets than more of a fundamental state of the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>State of the economy. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's clear. So, I mean, basically though when there is market turmoil, it would seem that we should be expecting some kind of losses on this line and vice versa, when the market is recovering, we should be expecting some positive numbers on this line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For that matter, just to give more clarity to your expectations, fourth quarter is not looking particularly stable either, so it is quite volatile. So &#x2013; but then again, as the single smallest denominator being just a quarter, we're not particularly concerned with anything that might happen there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very clear. One other question; just a little bit of further clarification on the renegotiated loans. Would these loans that you have been speaking about that where we saw new renegotiated loans, did you receive any additional collateral or covenants with relation to these loans? And would you say that these loans are fully performing low-risk loans at this stage or are these at least slightly impaired loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are fully performing loans at this stage for quite a while, and some of them forever. Historically, yes, the collateral relation levels there are very strong. I mean, in the case of this one big transaction that we're referring to, the collateral value to the loan is probably like 2.5 times of the loan value. So we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did it increase with the restructuring or they're the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It improved with the restructuring on the big transaction. In all the other cases, it either stayed the same or improved. Because in the vast majority of them, we accompany renegotiations with improving rate conditions, which is again reflective of improving risk position sometimes through the structural, collateral or any other type of security, or through the improvement in the financial model that were run, like sales forecasts are improving or actual sales data is improving, or various other parameters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to just defining this category of loans, is it possible to have completely unimpaired loans be classified as renegotiated according to your definition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Technically it is, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because also it sometimes &#x2013; sometimes the rules play a bit of a trick on you. The same very loan might have been restructured because it was risking into &#x2013; at risk of getting into the impaired category but was caught out and restructured on time to prevent it from being impaired. And then a few periods, quarters or years pass by and there's further renegotiation because the risk profile has improved yet again and the client wants it better optimized to the newly improved conditions, simply because that was that once originally at the point where it was considered as a problem, the second restructuring would under totally new conditions, which are much better, still is required for you to report this as something that you've renegotiated. So sometimes the situation is like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if it was once considered to be a slightly impaired loan, then the rules change such that if you make a positive restructuring in the future, you still have to count it as a renegotiated loan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sometimes that's the case as well. And that is actually the case under both Russian and IFRS accounts, but although it's described and working according to slightly different mechanics, but that's how it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. No more questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just to clarify, those of you who manage to dig out the press release have read there was a VB guarantee that was no longer applicable as a security on that loan since the 16 of August. But then again, that was replaced with much higher collateral values that are securing the loan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening, and thank you for the call. A couple of questions from me; if you could provide some color on the fee and commission income line in the third quarter. It seems like the growth in this particular line has slowed down and, as far as I remember, you were guiding some 20% growth in this line for full year and now it's running only at 13%. If there are any particular reasons behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, slide 12 of our presentation shows that third quarter this year to third quarter last year, it's grown 16.3%. And nine months this year to nine months last year, it's 15.7%. And I think we've always guided much closer to mid-teens, i.e., to 15% growth being sustainable and that some peak periods maybe reaching 20%. So, I wouldn't change this guidance. 15% is a sustainable level for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And the second question is &#x2013; actually it has been touched already due to the mismatch in the loan growth and the deposits. How comfortable you are with the situation that this year has been losing market share in the deposits market? How worried you are and what would be your target loans to deposits ratio that you would remain comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly, market shares, as I mentioned, we made a conscious decision to slide them down gradually in favor of better costs in the funding. We may want to use pricing a little bit more efficiently in somewhat improving the market shares, but as long as &#x2013; I think, this is old tactics. I mean, strategically, we're very comfortable that within the range of 45%, 50%, we can kind of actively manage our market shares based on the tactical preferences that we might have one particular period or another.</p>
          <p>In terms of loans to deposits ratio, I think the one we're reporting now is 99%. But I would caution investors from over putting &#x2013; over-signifying the magic of 100% loan to deposit ratio as applicable to such a unique institution as Sberbank. The quality of our retail savings image and franchise is such that allows us to be very comfortable and, for us, pretty much the range of loans to deposits between 90% and 105% is still a comfortable range within which we're free to manage pretty flexibly, depending upon our commercial preferences in any particular quarter or year.</p>
          <p>And therefore, if all of a sudden, I'm not suggesting that this is necessarily going to happen in the nearest terms, but all of &#x2013; if all of a sudden our loans to deposits ratio becomes, I don't know, 101%, there shouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction. Look, this is still Sberbank. This is still a bank that only monetary terms has the market share in retail deposits of between 45% and 50%. But in terms of client count, at least over 70% of the population have some money with us.</p>
          <p>So, we're much broader and deeper rooted in the society as a franchise than any other institution. Therefore, we shouldn't be measured in such technical terms. I would remind you that there were a couple of polls, one earlier this year, another last year, that were testing the trust level of the population to various kind of big, visible institutions.</p>
          <p>And of course, the institute of presidency of the country, that ranks always number one in this context. But there's also institutions like church, like government, like various other big pillars of the society. Sberbank ranked there repeatedly number two after the church, so &#x2013; and religion. So, this is not something you get &#x2013; I think this is something that you never get applicable to any other bank in the world. So, therefore, there's no magic in the precision of the loan to deposit ratio numbers as will reflect ours. And we also hopefully have created good enough reputation as a management team and our ability to manage all matters, market share, pricing, risk appetite and, of course, liquidity management.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Anton. Just a quick check-up question. You mentioned that now loans to deposits is 99%, it appears that you are looking at the growth loans to deposits. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned loans to deposits 92%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>92%, okay, okay. That's excellent. And just like very last one, on the operating expenses, in the third quarter, it seems that the payroll expenses were down by <mark type="ph" /> somewhat (52:02) 6% quarter-over-quarter. Could you give some color behind this? Is there some new trend, some new round of lay-offs and gains in the efficiency that you were talking about, and this increase in other expenses items. I suspect, it should come new IT costs and other modernization stuff that you're busy implementing, if there is a trend we should be also looking at over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just check. I think third quarter staff costs decrease is a bit of a seasonal impact. Let me just quickly reconfirm that with my colleagues, one second. Yes, yes, there's a more specific commentary coming from my guys in Moscow, because I'm currently sitting in London. It's seasonal because, in the third quarter, most of the vacations are taken and therefore, the costs are attributed not &#x2013; are going not through P&amp;L, but through the accrued reserve for summer vacations and therefore off of the balance sheet. And that's seasonally observed every third quarter that we see. So &#x2013; and then also seasonally, fourth quarter is going to be a bit higher because there's a larger number of working days there in the calendar than, for example, in the first and second quarters. And there's not that many vacations going on. So that explains it. We overall &#x2013; there's no big trend, apart from the ones that we've already been demonstrating.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time for the call, Anton. A few questions. First, on restructured loans, I think we've got enough detail on that. Just a question from <mark type="ph" /> A&amp;P (54:39). What's the total number of loans you have above $5 billion, or RUB150 billion, either way? And secondly, on the net interest margin, I was a little surprised to see your corporate yields down again in the quarter, was looking for flat already. What's the outlook here? I mean, should we expect a pick-up in corporate loan pricing visibly in Q4, or how long will that take? And when you talk about net interest margin stable, stable from the 6.7% that we've seen in the third quarter, or stable from a 2011 overall average level? And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2011, the overall level is <mark type="ph" /> it (55:10).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall level. So &#x2013; good, that's great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the concentration of our loan book, I think that there's a page in disclosures in the financial statements themselves that gives you some metric of, I don't remember, top 20 or something credit percentage in the loan book. So, if you &#x2013; if I were to try and answer your specific questions, like above $5 billion or a particular dollar amount, that will take me some time to do and check the calculations, which would &#x2013; probably it's not practical to do on this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I can give you a bit better color, actually, to use in your model, when you run them about us is that, of all the banks in Russian banking sector, we're probably the [ph best (56:03) in mirror image of the Russian real sector in terms of concentrations in segments, in sectors, in geographies, because this is the safest risk profile for us to maintain, and also this is the most profitable risk profile for us to maintain, from the standpoint of risk and reward balance.</p>
          <p>And we have been kind of religiously sticking to it without succumbing to any temptation to kind of over-arbitrage any particular segment or sector against another. So, other banks have &#x2013; not those particularly specializing on SMEs or retail, but more universal banks are tending to be a little bit more concentrated because of the lack of branch network penetration. Because, look, with 18,000 branches, we're probably 12 times bigger than nearest competitor and 20 times bigger than anyone else in the country. So it is more natural for us to be more evenly spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And on the corporate loan yields, how is it looking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On corporate loan yields, look, there's mixed dynamics. The top few hundred of clients, the Russian big blue chips, have been enjoying compressing yields through the fact that they are good credit, there's big competition for good credit amongst the domestic and international banks. And therefore, they've been commanding a shrinking rate. The improving quality in the segment below the very largest have contributed to the fact that people have been able to negotiate lower &#x2013; somewhat low-ish rate from us on one side, but on the other side, there's a countering trend where the high-ish inflation monthly numbers in the first half of this year has allowed us to negotiate higher rates on some of the other clients.</p>
          <p>So, net-net, it turns out to be, for this particular quarter or nine-month period, a little bit negative margin effect. But again, fundamentally, the mix effect that I mentioned, that our retail and SME portfolios are growing faster, is going to be compensating for that, hence the stable outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. But, I mean, in terms of credit pricing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:09) declines, when I look &#x2013; like, I don't know, country CDS has doubled since we had this little hiccup in August, and almost at 300. I mean, I would expect that you would charge also the bigger clients somewhat more these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, well, here is the important distinction one has to make these days. Is it the state of the international markets, be that debt or equity, it's much more driven by emotional things and unfortunately, you kick a lot of &#x2013; you hit a lot of stereotypes and knee-jerk reactions there. People in the west, because of what's going on in Europe and Americas, is psychologically and emotionally much more scary for people than the crisis of '08, '09 for people living and working in emerging markets. Sometimes tend to think, if it's that bad for us here in the west, something really, really unprecedented, we cannot even try to imagine how bad it is in the emerging markets. Whilst the perception of the people in emerging markets, well yes, another one, we have them every five or 10 years anyway. So, just switch from one gear to another and work somewhat different behavioral patterns in your business, whatever your business in. Hence, we believe that the CDSs and the equity markets are unfairly representing the fundamental dynamics of the Russian risk and the Russian markets.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me ask another way. When I look at RUSAL in particular, the aluminum prices are off like 20% from their peak. These guys run something like 30%, 35% gross margin. So, it will hit the EBITDA. I'm failing to see the improvement, at least over the last couple of months, <mark type="ph" /> like you said (1:01:04). Again, this would indicate to me that you probably charge a little bit more for company exposed to this volatility. So, it's not only the CDS that I'm looking at, was just one reference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. But then, look, what you do is, you &#x2013; for kind of big systemic players like RUSAL, you take longer than tactical view. You see their resilience to certain events over a longer period of time, peaks and troughs, and how they're structured and how the bigger picture stacks up, and then you make your credit decisions based on this.</p>
          <p>And if anything, again, any restructuring solutions that we were putting together for companies that were experiencing difficulties, not even fitting into the problem loan category, as you would put it on the accounts. But back in '09 and '10, when we're putting together those funding solutions for people, we were saying to everyone, look, this isn't a short-term crisis. This is going to last for longer than three years. Therefore, the sensible financial model and your sales forecast for whatever you sell or produce, that you bring to us if you want to get a sensible package, funding package, should really be based on a very benign growth outlook, and factor in some decent probability of another big negative event like '08, '09 on the horizon in the next three, four years.</p>
          <p>So therefore, the restructuring solutions that we've put in place there have already had risk premiums that were probably higher than even the situation that we're having now suggests. And therefore, on relative terms, you would still have good basis to &#x2013; if they perform better than that very conservative scenario, to let them have a bit cheaper funding, because it's somewhat better than originally planned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just a very quick last one, not to annoy the other analysts that want to ask. So basically what I'm reading into your comments, we have seen lagged deposits re-pricing down, and this has now also had been a bit longer on the corporate side. How much is re-priced now to the current level and how much more of the loan book could re-price down from crisis levels also, on the corporate loan side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, there's a mixture of factors in re-pricing of the loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of them we've mentioned, some of them we haven't. It is now a little bit difficult to see how they will stack up very precisely or, rather, more specific than we've just said that, okay, they are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are stable. Simply because, in these current macro conditions &#x2013; and that's not unique to Russia. This is like in all the markets where most of the macro parameters to which you derive these types of outlooks based on a number of parameters. And they stack up with certain patterns which we all used in the previous cycles. The pattern normally suggests which part of the cycle you're in, but those patterns are no longer observable. There's always a mixed bag of signal, and that's in Russia and everywhere else.</p>
          <p>So directionally, you're therefore much more reliant on the qualitative and gut-feel judgment than the technical model calculation. So therefore, we would love to give it more specific. We actually are more specific in our in-house calculations, but not that we're particularly ready to share them publicly. But it still remains difficult to give out a very clear and determined directional forecast. So, I hope we're not different from anyone else here, so &#x2013; including to what your models are showing.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, you are probably sick and tired of this question about renegotiated loans. Can I just ask you, in general terms, whether we should view this classification as technical, i.e., rescheduling of the term or rate, or somehow this is an asset quality issue, primarily, I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I have mentioned couple of times earlier on this already, it is far more technical. We do see that the risk component has not changed, or actually it has slightly improved on most of the transactions that have contributed to the growth in this renegotiated loan category in this quarter. If it was different, you would have seen immediate reaction from us in the reserve lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. We were earning big enough ROEs. And even if I were to be cynical, and said &#x2013; well, look, if we were to massage something, I'd rather put more reserves in and show ROEs of 29% rather than 31% that we've shown this quarter. But we will stick to the premise that, look, we provide whatever the risk is, it's totally bottom up exercise, technical, mechanical. If the risk increases, we provide, if it's not, not. So this is the way we use it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Fair enough. Thank you. And on the topic of OpEx, I noted that head count went down 1% year-to-date, which is well below what we would view as natural attrition rates. So it looks like, whatever that reasons might be, you guys are <mark type="ph" /> high end (67:30), and I think you have fallen short of your implicit target of cutting 4%, 5% a year as your strategy, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can we get clarity on this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. We're using a bit more differentiated approach, because we see, in terms of our business performance, the volume growths and new product development being very successful. So we're happy to add capacity in terms of head count resources to those area where &#x2013; which are accretive for returns. Whilst what we're not letting off is that those areas where staff cuts are required, because we are continuing to introduce process efficiencies and IT technologies, we continue to cut at the pace of about 5% per annum in those specific areas. So, the net-net effect doesn't necessarily mean that it's 5%, but we're happy about it, because we treated &#x2013; this is the way to manage it. If getting more staff to earn more money helps, you should get more staff, but not forgetting to cut it where it's not needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add &#x2013; this is Alexander Morozov from Moscow. If I'm not mistaken, we never promised 4%, 5% every year cut. We promised it once, and it was concerned first-year <mark type="ph" /> operational (1:09:32) strategy. Last year, we delivered almost 10%, if not more, slightly less, and we committed to gradually increase productivity.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, what's really important for us is productivity per head and not the overall head count. At the end of the day, what's important for us is our bottom line results, which is, as of now, according to our vision, slightly exceeds our expectations. So I think it's a little bit a misleading statement about our promise 4%, 5% every year cuts.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from Simon Nellis from Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one follow-up question, believe it or not, on the restructured loans. Could you just give us the typical life cycle of this? I mean, when would restructured loan actually migrate back into performing? And I think in some other jurisdictions basically, any loan that's been restructured has to be actually classified as NPL for a while, I think for six months in some places. Why is that not the case in Russia? That would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Well, look, simply in the way you're putting it, there's a bit of incomparable things in that, non-performing is whether it serves the interest or not; renegotiated is that the terms has been changed. If renegotiation is related directly to the fact that it stops or prevents loans from being non-performing, then of course they're indistinguishable. But we are, therefore, in a territory, we're on the way out of the previous crisis, a lot of what you do in renegotiating the terms of the loan is not necessarily having to &#x2013; anything to do with the risk of them becoming non-performing.</p>
          <p>So, hence, if the expected time to have such discussions on such calls now, then in terms of the way it works, well, non-performing loan is taken out of that category once it has been sustainably performing for at least two quarters. And that's under IFRS and most of the other standards, including Russian. So, therefore, it may come out of the NPLs because we've seen two quarters worth of some financial reporting coming out of the borrower and good cash flows on serving the loan &#x2013; servicing the loan. So &#x2013; but it may not necessarily come out of the renegotiated because the terms have been renegotiated.</p>
          <p>It may come out a little bit later, but then there could be a different dynamics. We will renegotiate where the risk profile will improve, therefore the terms and conditions will improve not because we're saving something but because we're reflecting the improvement in the risk profile, and therefore the cost of the borrowing should become cheaper for someone who may have at some point in time being in trouble before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I'm just wondering to what extent this metric is relevant at all to even talk about, because it seems that it moves in the opposite direction of the NPL trend, and I'm just wondering if it's going to always go that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, once it's renegotiated, it never goes back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Anton. The way you look at it is you watch all the three metrics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, if I may add, it's very important to understand that if we once mark a loan as negotiated, we never can change its status, so &#x2013; until full maturity of the loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's basically what I was asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think it fully explains these different terms and answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then maybe just going on that, I mean, the NPL trend, NPLs in absolute terms were actually flat after having declined for many quarters. What do you think the trend is going forward? I mean, I guess the economic environment is getting more difficult. Would you expect that we've seen the trough and we're going to start seeing NPLs rise again? Do you still think there's more of improvement? I mean, it sounds like you think that there is more improvement to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; in the base case scenario, i.e., the Russian macro continues to muddle through as it has been up to now. We expect great certainty for improving the NPL and continuing to write back the provisions. If an event of comparable magnitude to '08 and '09 happens to the world outside Russia, we're saying that the impact of such an event on Russia is going to be far less than that of '08 and '09. And that therefore will manifest itself in much milder impact on the NPLs because, as I've mentioned a bit earlier, the restructuring solutions that we have been putting in place for the loan that are riskier are based on scenarios that are more negative than the one we're observing now.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we're saying, the incremental cost of risk increase in an event comparable to '08 and '09 to elsewhere in the world would be around one percentage point, not more than that. If it's a &#x2013; something much worse that will bring everyone into the pretty much unchartered territory in the world.</p>
          <p>But even then, our assumption is that impact on credit quality and NPLs and cost of risk for Sberbank is still going to be lower than the one that we experienced in '08 and '09. And that the fundamental proof of that is that we as a bank have been able to show bad debt recovery rates over these past three years of much higher than originally expected by anyone, much higher than anyone else in the Russian market, and at the level that are pretty much the same as banks achieve in developed countries such as UK, France, Germany that we've compared ourselves to.</p>
          <p>And those countries have much more developed legal systems, much more efficient judicial systems, which is not the case in Russia, but we, as a Sberbank player, through our significance and our influence over economies of particular regions, have been able to achieve much higher recovery rates. That allows us to believe that our costs of risks are going to be increasing much less in an adverse event.</p>

          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. You said in the beginning that there are some new situations regarding provisioning policy. Can you give some color on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, new situations have been &#x2013; they are always, in any environment, there's new &#x2013; I'm not sure, maybe I'm not answering the right question.</p>

          <p>You said, the new provisions were created because of some new situations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, whenever you continue to land in the normal circumstances, you tend to carry along certain provisioning when some of the loans go bad, and the percentage of this is comparable to any other normal part of the cycle. So, loan book, I didn't mean anything more specific than just to say that if your loan book is growing, it drags along some minimal provisions together with it.</p>

          <p>Also, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have been going on for about an hour and a half, and I notice that most of the questions have started being repeated. I also have to tell you that we have a press call scheduled straight after this, which we're already seven minutes late. So, I suggest what we do is we go through one last question and then wrap it up. But, as usual, we have &#x2013; our IR team remains open for as many questions as needed and we will be happy to process all of them and send you the responses in due course through the usual channel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Your final question comes from Mr. Bob Kommers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton. Yeah, I'm a little bit puzzled about the whole asset quality situation. Let's forget about the renegotiated loans. As you indicated, most of them are technical issues. But if you look at the NPL volumes, they remained unchanged. And also, there is a material increase in the other assets. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the vast majority of the other assets are loans &#x2013; or are bad loans that have been moved to Sberbank Capital. Could you comment on that? Is that indeed the case? I mean, is it like off the RUB297 billion in other assets, how much of that is Sberbank Capital? And is this &#x2013; how long is this going to be a recurring income stream, because it looks like you're going to make like 5% of your revenues and 10% of your profits out of other income, so any comments regarding that would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, look, other income stream is not necessarily always related to the problem type of the assets and the loans. I'm just checking my &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> here's the (1:25:04) table on this. Right. Firstly, the other income stream that comes from actually selling some of the non-core assets that have fallen into our lap, so some of these things aren't really recurring, but some of those things are operational revenue flows from the assets that we've taken over as problem loans, but then stabilized them and manage to start extracting regular revenue and cash flows out of them.</p>
          <p>And this is indicating the fact that, okay, they're getting nearer to us being able to sell them as operating business or operating assets out to the market as we continue to stick to the strategy of getting rid of non-core assets as soon as it becomes viable. So, we &#x2013; that's the response to the second part of the question. The first one, once again, what was about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, it was just regarding NPLs, right. We see the ratio come down, the volumes are flat. And I just wanted to understand the increase in other assets that we're seeing between, say, Q1 and the third quarter of about over RUB100 billion, how much of that are, yeah, bad loans that were moved to Sberbank Capital? And if they are moved to Sberbank Capital, are they still being recognized as an NPL or are they nor being recognized as an NPL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We generally actually follow <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:26:48)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None of them &#x2013; the easy answer is none of them during this quarter; very, very easy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>None of them recognized as &#x2013; none of them &#x2013; that means none of them is no longer recognized as an NPL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>True. And the basic policy for everyone to be comfortable with is that we actually are not transferring loans per se to Sberbank Capital. What we're transferring to Sberbank Capital is non-core assets where &#x2013; which are normally collateral for those loans. And the rule that we stick to quite religiously is actually that whatever is getting transferred there has to be transferred at an adequate market price.</p>
          <p>So, whatever losses there are to be taken on a problem loan through provisions or plain losses have to be recognized on the bank, because neither from capital allocation nor from tax perspective, nor from any other common sense perspective, it doesn't make any sense to transfer losses to our subsidiary. And also, look, it gets consolidated anyway. So we therefore transfer not loans but transfer assets and take great care to value them at market.</p>
