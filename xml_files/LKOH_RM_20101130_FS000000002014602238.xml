        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you very much for coming to attend to our teleconference. Today, we are holding a teleconference to report on the financial results for the nine months of the year 2010. Based on the U.S. GAAP, and also this press conference is being broadcast on the Internet and we have a conference call too.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress once again that today we are speaking about the financial results for the nine months of the year 2010 and other issues. This conference was to be anchored by Mr. Fedun, but due to some reasons he was unable to attend to this meeting. So, I'm here instead of him. I will be the main speaker. I'm the Deputy Vice President, Andrey Gaidamaka. I would be assisted by Mr. Kozyrev, who is currently the Chief Accountant of the company. We will also be assisted by Mr. Epifanov, Deputy Chief Accountant and Mr. Krasovsky, Head of the Department responsible for the relations with investors. So, let us begin.</p>
          <p>Next slide please.</p>
          <p>First of all, we cannot say but stress this slide. I will not read it out, but this is just about the fact that this presentation is made just forward-looking statements regarded by these principles. I would like to say that for the nine months of the 2010 the company has shown very good financial results. The free cash flow amounted to about US$7 million and during the nine months of the year 2009 the free cash flow amounted only to US$1.4 million. The sales increased up to 76 million, were 34% more than this period last year, and EBITDA reached almost 12 million or 17% increase against the last year. The net income of the company amounted to US$6.8 million, which is 29% more than last year. And net income per barrel of oil equivalent of production was over US$11 per barrel, which is a record high figure.</p>
          <p>You can see that these changes &#x2013; these improvements were achieved due to the very good macroeconomic situation when euros will increase by 34% and the main audit prices increased at the same proportion. But, I would like to say that the taxes &#x2013; first of all, the taxes increased dramatically and the export excise increased by 71%. This way we actually didn't manage to take advantage of this increase in the prices. Actually, mineral extraction tax increased by 38%. You can see that the costs of the company also increased. I would like to specify one of the main factors in that respect the ruble exchange rate which increased by 14%.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. As for the main operating results, the oil production decreased by 2% and it means the organic oil production, whereas the total oil production decreased by 1.4% as the company purchased a lot of &#x2013; because of its increase in the LUKOIL's share. The &#x2013; our marketable gas production increased dramatically by 26% mainly due to <mark type="inaudible" /> gas field in the north of the Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>Total hydrocarbon production increased by 1.6%, and the refinery throughputs increased by 0.3%. In that respect, I would like to mention that within this period of time oil and oil products exports decreased dramatically or significantly. At the same time, the oil products sales increased, this is both attributable to the retail and wholesale sales. This is very good as it shows that the Russian market recovers gradually and the Russian market for the company is more profitable and more interesting from the standpoint of the downstream operations.</p>
          <p>On next slide you can see that we continued to increase the refinery throughputs due to the TRN acquisition and the growth is mainly due to this acquisition and we are increasing our capacity. You can also see on that slide that refining margin in the Russian and Ukrainian refineries was also at a very attractive level in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>More specifically, in terms of the financial results, you can see that we had an increase of the operating costs. Operating costs year-over-year increased by 9.2%, but I would like to say that this was actually against the background of a very strong ruble which was about 14%, many of that operating costs increased proportionate to the strong ruble or strengthening of the ruble.</p>
          <p>Also, I would like to note a very interesting trend that the taxes, excise and export tariffs increased by 50% year-on-year, and if we compare the third quarter and the second quarter the taxes decreased by 1.8%. This is due to the decrease of the &#x2013; our tax rates and the sales prices also decreased. You can see that the &#x2013; our income from the main activity increased and the net profit increased dramatically by 30 and 44% if we speak about the year-on-the-year figures and quarter-on-the-quarter figures.</p>
          <p>This increase includes $338 million. This is due to the cash amount received from CNPC as a result of the dispute resolution, the disputes around the Turgai Petroleum asset. And even excluding this amount, we can see that the financial results are quite strong, are quite impressive and high and the company managed to exceed the expectations of the analysts in that indication. But if we exclude those 338 million of extra income, we can also say that the company was quite successful and we actually met the expectations of the analysts.</p>
          <p>Next slide please, a few words or a few moments, which I would like to stress in terms of the operating expenses growth. The refining expenses as you can see on this slide at the third-party refineries ISAB and TRN. These indicators increased year-over-year towards one of the most remarkable items of the expenses. This was due to the fact that our overseas assets or refineries did not function where we're not operational within the group at the level it is now.</p>
          <p>So, this change is due to the increase in the scale. The same is true for the petrochemical expenses, because we had created some works on the commissioning of <mark type="inaudible" /> assets and those expenses, as you could see, were included into the petrochemical complex expenses, which increased 50% compared to the year 2009. The production started here only in the fourth quarter of the year 2010. This way, I would like to stress that the expenses growth was not significant and to a big extent it was caused by objective factors.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. The previous one, on that slide, I would like to mention that the production expenses or lifting costs are quite stable for the last two to three years. You can see that the company has the lifting costs around $4 per barrel. You can see those costs, those expenses <mark type="inaudible" /> depending on the macroeconomic figures and are not dependent on some increased trends.</p>
          <p>This is good because of stronger ruble in the long-term goes on and inflation rate exceeds the &#x2013; actually, doesn't go at the same pace as the ruble strengthening. It means that the ruble remains at the quite low levels and that's why the oil production is one of the most profitable.</p>
          <p>On that slide, you can see that we see further increase of the commercial and transportation expenses. And so this is quite an objective process, first of all, the pipeline tariffs and transportation expenses increased dramatically by 26%. This is a circumstance which is not controlled by the company. Probably those tariffs would grow later on. And the railroad transportation tariffs also increased.</p>
          <p>This way net income for the nine months of the year 2010 amounted to 3.5 million &#x2013; 5.2 &#x2013; 5.3 million rubles and that share of this growth was offset by the increase in the taxes mainly of such taxes as excise and export tariffs.</p>
          <p>There was some increase of the transportation and operational costs and expenses the ones which I have outlined. And the companies, but this growth in the costs finished the nine months of this year with very good income of $6.8 million. Probably now the most spectacular and impressive results of the company achieved for the nine months of the year 2010 was that the cash flow amounted to about $7 billion. And for us this is the big biggest figure &#x2013; record high figure for quite a while. And this is what was mentioned and stressed by the analysts.</p>
          <p>This was achieved due to a tight control over the investment costs and also due to the launch of very efficient project. This very high indicator of the free cash flow allowed the company to manage a lot without increasing the net debt to purchase a quite big stock of shares when ConocoPhillips sold its package in Lukoil without increasing the net debt, as I said.</p>
          <p>As for the CapEx, you can see that the company managed to retain the same level of the capital expenses, at a level of 4.7 million [sic] [billion]. The same level was achieved &#x2013; a billion &#x2013; the same level was achieved in the year 2009. And you can see that the expenses for the overseas upstream projects increased dramatically. This trend would remain, as far as we plan to increase our CapEx for the overseas upstream projects. And I will specify that a bit later.</p>
          <p>On that slide, you can see that the hydrocarbon production in the international projects increased for the last seven, eight years. And in the nine months of the year 2010, it amounted to more than 100 barrels a day &#x2013; 200 barrels a day. So mainly, this was achieved in such regions as Egypt, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, also the companies, they are actively working on starting the production in Iraq.</p>
          <p>As for the exploration, the most attractive region right now for the company, in terms of the exploration, is West Africa. West Africa should become the key factor for the company's development overseas or aboard. Right now the company has drilled the exploration wells in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire at a depth of about two kilometers. This is real offshore deepwater drilling.</p>
          <p>This is actually what the Russian situation cannot boast, in terms of the number of companies involved in such an activity. At the same time, Lukoil has one of the biggest licensed blocks of about 10.5 square kilometers in West Africa. And, as for the results achieved after the first drilling, the company plans to increase, to drill about '11 appraisal and exploration wells, and this process will take the years 2011 and 2012, and the company plans to spend about $1 billion on that. At the same time, we can say that the freight rate in the year 2010 for the oil rigs and the platforms were optimized by the company, and the company managed, right now, to increase the number of rigs from one to two.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. As a result of all of this activity, the company currently enjoys one of the most attractive positions and it has one of the biggest free cash flows for the nine months of the year 2010. At the same time, the return on the invested capital remains very high, despite big taxes. At the same time, the CapEx and OpEx are mainly attributable to the upstream and they remain at a very competitive level. It's quite interesting to take note of the fact that the hydrocarbon production, as you can see on the bottom slide, is at the low level of the peers group. Once again, I'd like to stress that we do earn too much per barrel of oil equivalent produced. If we compare that with our peers, our earnings in that respect are not too high, but the company invests less in order to achieve such a level of the production. That's why the income per invested capital is at a quite competitive level.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that within the year 2010, the company continued to remain one of the leaders <mark type="inaudible" /> of the relations with the investors and in terms of the corporate governance. The company was awarded two prizes by the RTS stock exchange. First prize was given for the best information disclosure in the annual report, and the second prize for the best annual report in English besides, we were awarded a quite prestigious contest by the magazine Russian CIS, best IR for corporate transaction.</p>
          <p>That's the end of my presentation of the financial results. If you have any questions, I would be glad to start a discussion with the questions and answers session. Yes take the mike please.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. My question is the following. Could you specify what's the percentage of the company's shares is currently owned by ConocoPhillips and whether Lukoil has exercised any part of their option on the UniCredit Bank buyback. In your report, you mentioned you started in third quarter to refine crude oil in third-party refineries Kazakhstan. Could you specify the refineries you're working with and whether it's a long-term agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of buyback of ConocoPhillips' shares, at present I cannot speak about the exact percentage of Lukoil shares and their balance sheet. The information is owned by ConocoPhillips, you should address this question to them. However, I believe it should be somewhere between 2% and 4%. As for this information, you should really address them.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Over 8%, 8.1% if I remember correctly, in our treasury. In addition to this, the company has over $900 million of credit notes, it's also reflected in our balance sheet of UniCredit Bank. These are convertible, in accordance with specific rules, into the company's shares. That's all we can say, that there is more than 8% of our treasury notes.</p>
          <p>Speaking about our refineries &#x2013; our third-party refineries partners abroad, this is not a strategic or a long-term plan of the company. The company currently has four foreign refining complexes abroad, and the priority lies with loading these refineries and improving their economics. The fact you mentioned represents rather small volumes of crude refined in Pavlodar in Kazakhstan. It is rather a small volume. We will be able to give you exact numbers if you wish. It was about 45,000 tons. Any further questions? Any further questions from the audience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like you to specify one thing please. Within the UniCredit option, can you buy back the shares in portions, or is it about the whole package? Today, you approved the mid-term investment program, could you specify the amount of investments for the nearest years?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Once again, I'd like to say that we're talking about nine months 2010. Now, it is true the Board meeting reviewed today a number of issues, including the one you mentioned. However, I would like to now concentrate on the agenda we have for this press conference. Speaking of the buyback conditions, they're well-detailed in our materials for determination of this press conference, that buyback conditions are very much conditioned by the price level, and the range lies between $56 and $60 per share, depending on that price situation, the exercise moment. The maturity is in September 2011. Any more questions from the audience? We have a few questions from the Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. I have here one question from the Internet. Which is has production right for the ESAP. Tomorrow, December 1st, is the time when this option can be exercised. This question comes from Vadim Mitroshin, Otkritie</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true, ERG has the right to exercise this put option, and it is the production that our company has budgeted for such a proposal from ERG. We are ready to exercise this put option at any time within next year. Second &#x2013; just a minute &#x2013; once again I'm asking the audience whether we have any more questions. Very good, no questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the company going to review its dividend policy, especially considering the record breaking profit and cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The company will continue to step-up divided payments. The company has pursued the policy of gradual increase of dividends in the past ten years. We will not abandon this policy. However, it is true we do have a record-breaking cash flow, but most of this cash flow was spent to buy back ConocoPhillips' shares, placing them on the balance sheet of the company. Both buyback of shares and dividends are payment to shareholders and, considering this, the company has paid, in 2010, a record-breaking amount of money to shareholders already. We hope to, and plan to, insignificantly increase dividends in this year's payment, but I don't believe it will be very large.</p>
          <p>Question regarding ConocoPhillips' package of Lukoil shares already answered. I have the same, from JP Morgan. We are not buying our own shares and we have completed the program already.</p>
          <p>Now, this is all from the Internet. I'm giving you one more opportunity to ask question from the audience.</p>
          <p>Since there are no such questions, production for 2011. In the financial statement, this is not mentioned. We have not yet announced production figures for 2011, but it is most probable that production in 2011 will show a certain decrease against 2010. In 2010, no changes &#x2013; no changes happened. We have announced the nine months' results, you have just seen them, no change is expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you specify &#x2013; are you talking about a decrease in hydrocarbons production or oil production, and what's the decrease expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not talking about hydrocarbons in generally, only about decrease in oil production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the exact numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; I already mentioned, we cannot give exact numbers now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said that the dividend policy will not be changed, but dividend payments will be increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dividend policy announced by the company, stipulating at least 15% percent of the company's net profit, will give the company a wide range of dividend timing fluctuation. We are already paying about 20% of our net profit in dividends. We plan a small increase in dividends in rubles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if there are no further questions, this has been a very interesting performance from Interfax. Thank you very much for this. And we hope that next time, you will give us as much attention in the future. And we will be able to talk about our plans more, rather than the already achieved results. Thank you very much.</p>
