          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q2 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mr. Peter Voser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Second Quarter 2010 Results Presentation.</p>
          <p>Firstly please take a moment to read the cautionary statement. Simon and I will take you through the results and update you on where we are with strategy and there will be plenty of time for questions at the end.</p>
          <p>PSC earnings excluding identified items were $4.2 billion in the second quarter, an earnings per share increase of some 33% from the second quarter of '09. Our performance in the quarter underlines that we are delivering on our strategy. Upstream volumes are up by 5.5% and we have delivered underlying cost savings of over $3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We have finished the corporate restructuring phase that I announced a year ago and exceeded our cost and head count reduction targets. With corporate restructuring now completed, we are moving into a mode of continuous improvement and this includes a relentless focus on performance and more asset sales as we trim the portfolio and improve capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>Today we are in a growth window with new projects ramping up well and we continue to make good progress on medium term options with new tight gas deals announced in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some details. Back in March when we had our annual strategy meeting we outlined Shell's strategy for the next several years. We are improving our near-term performance, delivering a new wave of growth into 2012 and maturing the next generation of projects for growth for 2013 and beyond with a portfolio that can support growth to at least 2020. We have made progress on all of these items and themes so far this year.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an update. First on our performance focus; the corporate restructuring program we announced a year ago which was called Transition '09 is now complete. The three new businesses, Upstream America, Upstream International, and P&amp;T, are great platforms for faster delivery of strategy, clearer accountabilities and a more competitive focus. This reorganization plus our programs in Downstream and support functions have taken out over $3.5 billion of underlying costs. This is about 15% ahead of the target we set and six months ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We have ringfenced personal and process safety and asset integrity from these cost programs and we continue to invest properly in those areas. These savings included a target head count reduction of some 7,000 for 2009 to 2011, mostly from non-technical areas. This head count reduction is about 18 months ahead of the target we have set.</p>
          <p>So we have closed a chapter on corporate restructuring. It was really a top-down approach and now we move into what I call the continuous improvement mode. This is all about smaller incremental initiatives to enhance our performance and a more commercial mindset in Shell. It's things like simple structures, standardizationing, contracting and procurement and Lean processes. In support areas like IT and Science for example we are moving standardized functions to shared service centers in low cost countries. We have now 8,000 staff in six shared service centers with more to come.</p>
          <p>Now I also want to put more focus on fine-tuning the portfolio, working on capital efficiency and concentrating on the most attractive growth positions. We are increasing the pace of asset sales here with some seven to $8 billion of disposals expected for 2010 and '11 in both Upstream and Downstream. Downstream we are aiming to make quite significant shifts for example in Europe and Africa. Upstream I think of this as trimming the edges of the portfolio rather than deep changes in ratings and exposures.</p>
          <p>So those are some comments on performance focus. Now turning to the second leg of the strategy with is growth delivery. We are in a delivery window with a sequence of 13 new projects to come onstream in 2010 and '11. These projects underpin our cash flow and production growth targets, an 11% increase in 2009 to 2012, production to 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and a 50% increase in 2009 to 2012 cash flow at $60 oil prices.</p>
          <p>Last year's startups are ramping up well. BC-10, for example, in deepwater Brazil is producing 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We had initially expected 60,000 from this complex reservoir in the first phase.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, we had the startup of the 250,000 barrel of oil equivalents per day Gbaran-Ubie project onshore Nigeria. This will be an important supplier for Nigerian energy and also domestic gas customers.</p>
          <p>Now we have a series of further startups through the end of 2011. The next project to come online will be in Canada, where commissioning of the new mine at AOSP is well under way and startup is expected soon with the Scotford operated expansion in 2011. Major construction at Pearl and Qatargas 4 will be finished by the end of this year with ramp-up for both projects in 2011. So these are exciting times on the growth side and we are firmly in the delivery window here.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the third strategic theme, generating new options for future growth, and this is really about 2013 and beyond. Shell explorers have made five new discoveries this year in the United States and in Australia. We have also worked on a series of acquisitions and joint ventures this year, both upstream and downstream. These are deals like North American tight gas acreage with potential for 16 Tcf of new resources; the Australia cold-bed methane, potential for a 7 to 8 million ton per annum LNG project; and Brazil downstream, proposed JV producing 17 billion liters per year of oil products and 2 billion liters per year of ethanol for biofuels with growth potential.</p>
          <p>Now these transactions are all about getting in early into relatively underdeveloped asset bases and markets where we can apply Shell's technology know how, to create value.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the good relationships we are forming with oil and gas companies from China. Shell is one of the largest direct foreign investors in China, with fast growing businesses in both, upstream and downstream. This year they have developed joint activities with China's oil companies in upstream both within China itself for carry gas and overseas in Australia, Syria, and Qatar. And I think there is more to come from these relationships.</p>
          <p>Now before I hand over to Simon on the results, let me make a short comment on the situation in the gulf. The BP Macondo blowout is a tragedy for everyone affected. There will be far reaching implications for our industry. Shell has a good track record in deep water and in safety management overall. Worldwide deep water production has an important role to play in the global energy supply equation. There is about 6 million barrels per day of production today, growth potential and supply diversity and sustained investment in technology, jobs and services.</p>
          <p>The recent announcement of Shell's participation in the new $1 billion Gulf of Mexico oil spill containment system is an example of where we are working with governments and partners to improve the industry's capabilities in deep water. Now let me hand over to Simon to talk about the Q2 results and update you on the financial side. Over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. I'll start with the macro environment. When we look at the macro trends, we look year-on-year of course because our business is quite seasonal, particularly the Upstream Gas, so the year-over-year approach is intended to reflect those trends.</p>
          <p>If you look at the macro environment picture compared to the second quarter of 2009 the oil and gas market prices, refining and chemicals margins have all increased from year ago levels. The spread between oil and natural gas realizations has widened considerably compared with year ago levels and against the first quarter of this year. And that's mainly being driven by a more rapid increase in oil prices compared to North American natural gas prices and an observed decline in the Q2-to-Q2 gas realizations in Europe.</p>
          <p>European gas is important for Shell. It accounts for some 40% of our worldwide gas production. The slowdown in European realizations is a result of the supply bubble into the EU, so that's combined with the weak demand but results in an increasing proportion of lower priced spot sales. The medium term outlook for gas markets in Europe and globally is robust. However we have seen the impact of the softer European gas pricing in our results this quarter and this could continue for a while yet.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings, earnings for the quarter included identified items of $321 million, excluding those identified items the current cost of supply earnings were $4.2 billion and earnings per share increased by 33% as compared with the second quarter of 2009. The quarter saw higher earnings in both upstream and downstream, driven by the higher industry energy prices I just mentioned, by our own organic growth and by our own cost savings. The cash flow from operations for the quarter was $8.1 billion and the dividend for the quarter is unchanged at $0.42 per share.</p>
          <p>We expect to begin the Scrip dividend program in the third quarter of 2010 and you will see the new timetable for that on the website today. Now let me talk about business' performance in a bit more detail. First on the upstream, upstream earnings increased by 48% to $3.3 billion in the second quarter, higher oil gas and LNG prices, higher volumes and cost reductions from our own programs contributed to these results.</p>
          <p>Those benefits were partly offset by the higher production taxes, the weaker European gas realizations and maintenance downtime in high margin production areas. The upstream production overall increased by more than 5% Q2 to Q2, reaching some $3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production from new sales and sales ramp up was some 160 thousand barrels of oil equivalent today. That more than offset the natural field declines.</p>
          <p>Our LNG sales volume grew by 34% in the second quarter and that compares with the same period in 2009 and as the ramp up in Sakhalin-2 in Russia and in Nigeria LNG where the gas supply picture has improved in the quarter that is really driving the growth. Maintenance downtime in the quarter mostly at oil sands in Canada and the Mars corridor in the Gulf of Mexico, and this was planned maintenance, that impacted production by some 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and of course that is high margin production.</p>
          <p>Let me just update you on Shell's activities in the offshore U.S. First to say that the Perdido platform, the new platform in the Gulf, it was shut down in April for maintenance on the facilities and at the tie-ins to the third-party gas pipelines. We expect Perdido to be restarted back online in October. More broadly as a result of the industry-wide drilling moratorium in the deepwater Gulf and in Alaska, Shell has idled five floating rigs and two platform rigs. We're working with the rig suppliers on the financial impact here and in some cases we've negotiated a 60 to 70% reduction in the day rates for the rigs and the services.</p>
          <p>For now we prefer to keep these rigs idled rather than standing them down so that we'll retain the work and the investment that's already been done on the logistics and safety side for the planned wells. We have taken a $56 million charge for the impact of this action in the second quarter results. It is an identified item and there will likely be further charges in the third quarter of 2010. Our development drilling has been impacted by the moratorium, for example at Perdido, and we expect a production impact of around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year of 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Downstream. Downstream earnings increased substantially from the second quarter of 2009 to some $1.2 billion on a clean CCS basis. The Chemicals earnings increased substantially from year ago levels. There was a relative improvement in Refining but refining conditions do remain difficult especially in Europe and Asia which are of course the main refining centers for Shell. Losses in Refining were around 100 million in the quarter and that compares to losses of around $500 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>Marketing earnings in aggregate were broadly similar to year ago levels. This reflects higher retail earnings and also a generally weak environment for trading activities due to relative lack of volatility.</p>
          <p>So those are the earnings; now turning to the cash flow. The cash flow position continues to improve with cash from operations exceeding capital investment both Upstream and Downstream. At the Group level we are moving into a more cash balanced position and after several quarters of cash deficits we were essentially cash neutral after capital spending and divestment.</p>
          <p>We continue to watch the cash position and the balance sheet very closely, are putting emphasis on costs and capital efficiency. We've made good progress on asset sales, some $1.6 billion of proceeds booked in the first half of this year. The main divestments we've completed so far were from the downstream and represent exits from New Zealand, Greece, and El Salvador.</p>
          <p>On the acquisition side we completed the Eagle Ford deal in Texas, that's shale gas, in the second quarter. We expect the East Resources and the Arrow acquisition to close in the second half of this year. The proposed Cosan joint venture in Brazil, sugar and ethanol in Downstream, it's likely to impact our accounts in 2011 rather than 2010.</p>
          <p>As Peter outlined, we've increased the guidance for asset sales to 7 to $8 billion over a two-year period, 2010, 2011. We're expecting over 2 billion of this to come this year. It does depend on deal timings across the year-end with the rest to be delivered in 2011.</p>
          <p>We sent out the targets for cash flow and production growth specifically for 2012 in our strategy presentation in March. There is no change to these targets here. We are aiming to hit the targets despite the step up in the asset sales, and we will provide a reconciliation of the impacts if necessary.</p>
          <p>Turning to our gearing; balance sheet gearing was 16.9% at the end of the second quarter. That's a slight decrease from the first quarter, reflecting the cash generation. The gearing outlook for the second half of this year, it does depend to some extent on the macro outlook. However, all else being equal, I would expect an increase in the gearing at year-end to around 20% as the impact of the acquisitions comes through. This remains well within the gearing guidance range.</p>
          <p>Peter, over to you to conclude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Simon. Let me summarize before we go to your questions. This year's earnings per share increased by some 33% from the second quarter of '09, and our performance in the quarter underlines that we are delivering on our strategy. Upstream volumes are up and costs across the company are down.</p>
          <p>We're making good progress with those three strategic themes, that's performance focus, growth delivery, and creating new growth options. We have completed the corporate restructuring phase that I announced a year ago and delivered on our cost and head count reduction targets ahead of schedule. With corporate restructuring now completed we're moving into a mode of continuous improvement, and this will include the higher pace of asset sales, 7 to $8 billion in 2010 and '11 as part of our capital efficiency drive and as we focus our portfolio onto material growth positions.</p>
          <p>The priorities remain for a sharper delivery of strategy, aiming for profitable growth and competitive performance. I will call this we are on track for growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, let's take your questions. Please could we have just one or two each so everyone has the opportunity to ask questions. With that, back to the operator. Please poll for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Please, go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. The first one is you have been talking about the impact of the Gulf of Mexico in terms of the rigs and in terms of the development, and so on. But you're keeping your CapEx flat this year. Maybe you can indicate what is it you're accelerating in order to compensate for this? And the second question is, about these growth opportunities that you're talking about. How much of those growth opportunities would be organic versus inorganic and which are the areas do you think that you may still be looking to add to the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Alejandro. I give the first question to Simon and then I'll take the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. The actual Gulf of Mexico impact on CapEx is not that significant this year. We've finished the deal there. We haven't started the next big development. The primary offset for us though is in offshore gas in North America where we have significant programs in six basins now. And that's something we can ramp up and down according to the relatively short-term attractiveness, plus there is an ongoing program to hold the leases through production. So if there's overflow anywhere, that's where the money is going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your second question regarding the growth, we're quite clearly as outlined in the strategy presentations, we are focusing on Australia, North American gas. We have core contracts done with various projects. We had quite significant exploration success over the last 15 to 18 months. We have entered Iraq and obviously you have also the Gulf of Mexico, where we expect to go. We will get back into the deep water where we have got exploration finds, but we also have obviously FIDs which are a queue to come up pretty soon like Mars B et cetera. So I think we have a portfolio and after we have delivered the thirteen projects which are coming onstream the next two or three years, which can give us significant growth through the end of the decade and I think it's a good growth pipeline where we have good flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of adding inorganic assets into this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have got an organic strategy. We have always said that we have got some acquisitions we can do like we have done in North American gas, but at the same time we also have said we will therefore divest let's say, the lower graded portfolio again. So I think we play this as it comes but we have a very rich organic growth strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from Lucy Haskins of Barclays Capital, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Peter and Simon. Could I ask why you aren't lifting your production guidance for this year? Because I understand you are still keeping it sort of flat in the first 2009 environment, given this strong start for the year we've seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead if you have more than one it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second one I guess is also possibly whether there is some potential for you to list your 2012 cash flow targets as well, because we have something approaching an $80 environment in the first half of the year and if we were to extrapolate out, what you manage in terms of cash flow, ex working capital movements. You seem to be within about 12% or so of the implied targets of the 80% uplift from 2009 in the $80 world by 2012. So is this the case on both of those targets? Sort of under promising to deliver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lucy. I give the production short term to Simon and I take the target one on cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lucy. Good questions. We said that we would expect to be flat this year against last year and that we expect a growth from '09 to 2012 by 11%; there is no change in the 2012 expectation, 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This year it's good to be 5% ahead halfway through the year and we would hope to do better to be honest than remaining flat. There is little point in giving a specific target; we're in an industry where as I think it's fairly clear stuff happens. There is still hurricane season to get through; we've done okay in Nigeria this year so far. We've done very well operationally in Nigeria, but there are still potential security issues, et cetera. So we're very pleased with what we've been able to do; most of it is through our own efforts, and we will see where it comes out &#x2013; some upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the second question, I think the delivery machine is rolling well at the moment, Lucy. We had good operational performance and good cash performance. We have given targets for 2012 and we stick with them, and the $80 target there was actually more than 80%, which gives you a significant increase. And I think the 80% also highlights that we've seen an $80 world quite a strong cash flow performance. So we are kind of full mounting to the target, so let us work a little bit more.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, two quick questions. One, Simon, you referenced a likely third quarter charge for the moratorium effect. I'm sure there's still some uncertainty around it, but can you bracket a range of expectations for the order of magnitude third quarter moratorium charge? And then second question, with respect to the weak trading environment in the second quarter, can you quantify more specifically the sequential trading detriment in the upstream and the downstream? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they are both for Simon. Thanks for the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert. We're not sure which quarter it will fall in, but our estimate for the full-year impact of the moratorium is around $200 million after tax. That's the best we can do at the moment, because obviously we don't know quite how the moratorium will unwind. So it's reasonable to assume I guess, split between third and fourth quarters evenly. On trading in general, we don't typically give a specific breakdown either upstream or downstream. I will say it's not been a volatile environment in the second quarter. Volatility creates trading opportunity therefore trading had a relatively quiet quarter. Upstream was down year-over-year, very much still in profit though. The downstream year-over-year is about flat.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. I had two questions, please. First, you had a good quarter on LNG. I wonder if you could perhaps comment on the key trends you are seeing in the LNG markets around the world in terms of volumes and pricing. And then secondly, thinking about net capital spending in 2010, 2011, you're moving out the 2010 number I think from 28 towards perhaps 31 and can you say what we can expect given the amount of disposals for two years, what we can expect for net spending into 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Irene. I will take the second one. The net spending we still keep at 25 to 27 as indicated in March. We have growth CapEx of 25 to 30; I think you can take into your calculations that we are most probably going towards the upper end of that range, but we keep for the time being the net. On the LNG side, trends and pricing, you've got this, Simon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Just one point on next year's CapEx, it is likely that the Cosan deal with it's $1.5 billion or so of CapEx will be reflected in next year's 2011 CapEx and that will &#x2013; will only, around $0.5 billion will be cash impact. So you need to reflect that in projections as well.</p>
          <p>LNG current trends, we are seeing, we have diversion volumes up in Q2, relative to last year, but overall on those diversive volumes the margins were down because the marginal cargo is typically moving into Europe and typically into the UK so demand was reasonably strong. Overall between Q1 and Q2 the volumes were flat on the diversions, but again the margins were down.</p>
          <p>Underlying -- we need to remember though over 80% of our volume is sold on the oil link contracts and over 90, well about 95% is typically sold on the long-term contracts. So demand was actually fairly strong in the quarter overall and we are continuing to see strong medium term to long term demand for the longer contracts. They are currently under negotiation with our long term customers for projects particularly in Australia and we still see a very attractive market there, so I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter in terms of the LNG pricing that we see. Also worth highlighting that although gas remains roughly half our production, that the majority of gas, still around 60%, is overall in total is oil price linked, which means that of our total production around 80% is oil price linked and only 20% is exposed to spot gas prices, whether in the U.S. or in Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, gentleman good afternoon. I had a couple things. Simon, I struggled a little bit by your comments on Perdido. Rather prolonged downtime. Could you talk a little bit about the performance prior to the shutdown and whether that prolonged downtime is associated with the moratorium, or whether there are other factors? The second question relates primarily to the Eagle Ford acreage. Could you put a cost number on that? And if I can sneak in a third, where do you stand on the SR refining deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Mark. Perdido and Eagle Ford goes to Simon and I'll take the SR one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. The Perdido came up early this year -we took it down in April. There were a couple of issues we needed to address. We're doing some work on the rider. We're doing some work on the facilities on the platform and we have some work to do on the connection into the third-party evacuation line in that part of the Gulf, which is relatively new for development. Nothing too much to worry about. We would have been doing new production drilling associated with Perdido. Obviously we currently now cannot do that while the moratorium is in place. So when we bring the platform back up again, we will not be ramping up as quickly as we had originally expected and we have another five wells to drill for the first phase of the Perdido production. And with that is the main driver of the 8,000 barrels a day shortfall this year that I mentioned in the speech.</p>
          <p>The Eagle Ford acreage, there are two vertices, about a quarter of a million acres, some with liquids potential. It's around $1 billion in total that we've invested there. All of the acreage is undeveloped. We are now drilling it, so there's no production reserves associated with it. But that's the basis of the deal that we have &#x2013; $1 billion, quarter of a million acres. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the SR side, which is really around Stanlow, Heide and Harburg, as you may have seen in the announcements, we have actually stopped the exclusive negotiations but I have to say we're still negotiating. But because of that, we have now started to talk to other potential buyers for the possible sale and purchase of the three refineries. The talks are progressing on all of these three assets, but they are at different stages in the process.</p>
          <p>At this stage it would be too early, actually, to comment or give a guarantee that they are actually going to be sold this year, or early next year. So I think we will have to come back to that later on in the year and give you some updates. But we are moving forward. And they are part of our divestment numbers, the 7 to $8 billion but we are not depending on it, it's just that we may end up at the higher end of that number if the three go through. If not, then you may be a little bit at the lower end of that range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. They are no longer exclusive, but still talking to them, but we have got a list of other buyers for the same asset, so we are now in multi-talks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Afternoon, Peter, Simon. Thank you for taking the questions; two, please. Firstly, just on divestments, can you talk about perhaps the criteria for what assets you're selling, and why the change now compared to sort of what you provided in March? What processes in turn have you gone through, and is there a risk that the disposal target actually out-rises? And then just secondly, come back to sort of the financial framework. Are you sort of indicating in spite of the sort of increase in divestments you're not expecting a sort of higher free cash flow for the Group over the next couple of years? I'm sort of thinking about that in the context of the dividends. I mean should we expect the disposal proceeds to come back to shareholders or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Theepan. Thanks for the two questions. I take the first one. I think the way we are actually dealing with the portfolio is a constant drive to hydrate, and therefore the more options we have in the portfolio, it allows us all to do more reserving on our asset sales side. If I go to the announcement, for example, on North American gas, the two deals which we have done, you will have seen in that press release that we said that part of the acquisitions which we are doing there will quite clearly be kind of financed -- neutralized by actually further divestments. So this is the strategy. And obviously, as we are moving along from the March one, we are clearly increasing those things the more we actually do in terms of option generation and hydrating of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So I think you need to see this as a very dynamic process and through that actually increasing long-term shareholder value by doing so. And this is not something which is new, so this is not a thing of the last two or three months. If you go back the last five years, we sold already 30, $31 billion of assets, and therefore this is a continuation. But as we are moving into more options we will accelerate from time to time because we have more freedom. So instead of the 4 billion, what we said before hand, two and two in each year, we are now staying seven to eight, which reflects that policy. The second one, back to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Just a reminder. It's a good question, but a reminder of what we said really in March. We aim the statement to strategic intent not as a mechanical bottom-up count aggregation or addition that in 2012 at $60 a barrel we need to finance the investment program and the dividends from owned cash flow. That was predicated on a 25 to $30 billion organic CapEx program with a level of divestment so that the net was 25 to 27. All of that stays in place, our aim being of course to have an investment level that sustains growth through cycle and the cash generation that enables us both to finance the investments and to grow the dividend steadily.</p>
          <p>We are on our way to that delivery in 2012. We don't change the target. How we get there depends on some of the choices we actually will be taking. We have bought new acreage. We have explored and found maybe more than we might have expected a year ago. We actually have probably more options, as Peter noted, we're likely to be at the top end of the 25 to $30 billion organic spend. Therefore we need to be at the top end of the divestment activity to deliver on that overall financial framework. So it's not a question of not going back to the shareholders. Ultimately it always goes back to the shareholders but we are delivering against a strategic intent, not against a bottom-up arithmetic process. I hope that helps give you some of the thinking as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me also give you maybe one more additional one. I think over the last few years there was a lot of talk about access to resources and I think we are demonstrating or we have been demonstrating that we can get access to resources and options into our funnel. So what we are now doing is actually managing the financial outcomes of that and that is actually I think easier to manage than the first one. So I think the progress which we have seen is a very positive one. Thanks and next question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Question is in Refining. You've obviously had this huge improvement and reduction in losses but you're still losing about $100 million on a quarterly basis. Given that your corporate restructuring is now broadly done, given that we've already had quite an improvement in margins and they may not improve much more, can you just talk us through a little bit more what more you can do beyond the, hopefully the sale of the refineries in Europe to bring the returns in Refining back up to an acceptable level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. A lot of the tough questions today. Thank you. The refining performance, yes, it has improved but still below water and what I would agree was a relatively good quarter for the overall environment particularly in North America. The strategy has been and will remain to reduce our refining capacity; we have taken a million barrels or so out since 2000. We expect to make another 15% over the next year or two. We will do that through divestment or conversion to terminal, or closure, depending on ability to divest. That will take us to the position where we laid out strategically on average larger refineries, more complex and more integrated with petrochemical in the overall supply chain; that overall strategy does need to play out.</p>
          <p>We are taking cost-outs in the refineries as well and we are improving our ability to optimize the flow of products around the refineries within the given supply envelope. That -- the cost and the supply envelope optimization are having an impact and together with the structural, strategic delivery will make a difference such that through cycle we expect a reasonable return out of refining.</p>
          <p>It is not a quick fix; it cannot be a quick fix but we are pulling all the levers and I must put one provider in there. The whole industry has seen an uptick in the costs as we have gone through the last five-year cycle since the Texas City incident. That has meant that we have given high priority to all asset integrity activity and we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>The last comment I would make is on the trading interface; we make money in trading overall throughout the supply chain. We don't include that in refining, but we need the refineries in the supply chain to be able to generate that value. So while the headline number may be only 100 million lost, the refinery infrastructure provides us with quite a lot more revenue generation capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, guys. Two questions, the first is on your European gas volumes, take the point it's a better year than last year but I think you acknowledged that it's still weak for demand. But If I've been inputting my gas sales volumes right over the last 10 years, 2010 is turning out to be a very good year for your gas volumes.</p>
          <p>I just wondered whether something has happened in terms of your overall capacity and availability to supply gas to Europe or you've changed your strategy in terms of pushing gas and maybe spot gas into Europe and therefore sort of running your assets a bit harder. That's the first question; the second question is just on Nigeria and perhaps just take the opportunity to get an update on your feelings on Nigeria. Obviously security a little better, a new government settling in. What are your thoughts about new investments into Nigeria and the outlook for that country? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Jon. I'll take the second one and Simon can think about the first one. On Nigeria, I think indeed as you say, we have seen a more stable situation which really has allowed us also to ramp-up the production again, and also deliver Gbaran-Ubie actually slightly ahead of time and in a very safe way. So that is positive. I think the PIB is being discussed and consulted with the stakeholders. No further things to comment there, that around the process. And we'll see when we get there. As said beforehand, we clearly support the overall objective of restructuring the industry, but there are certain conditions which are of some concern and that's being discussed.</p>
          <p>I think from a funding point of view, this is a much better situation than two years ago. Actually that it allows us, actually also to look forward. For example, taking some investment decisions on further flaring out projects which we have also passed on and these &#x2013; and had the press release actually issued. So I do think all-in-all, a positive development but there is a but to all of this. The normal kind of criminal activities have quite clearly increased. So this is around kidnappings, this is about double guards; this is about stealing or bunkering, as we call it. So there is still a certain, let's say, unease or a shaky situation on the security side which we have to watch. The amnesty is still ongoing as we know. But it's the normal criminal activities which have actually caused some upsets for us in the production, and we have seen that during this quarter and the earlier quarter.</p>
          <p>The divestment which we have announced is progressing, is moving through the approval side so that's also a positive. So I would say I'm carefully positive. We see the impact but quite clearly the PIB plus the overall security situation still offer concern. Depending all of this we will think about growth and further projects in Nigeria over the months and quarters to come. With that, over to Simon on the gas for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yes, it's true the European gas volume is certainly well-up and doing well. Several drivers, really. First of all the Group -- remember now April was very cold. So that actually gave quite a boost to volumes at the margin. We are seeing switching from coal to gas for economic reasons. The price has come down on a spot basis and there are good reasons to switch into gas with power generators. We are seeing some recovery on the industrial side, particularly in Germany and where -- there are new gas powered stations online and across the industry. We are supplying of course, at the margin from Oberliner from the gas assets in the Nam in the Netherlands and our additional Nigerian LNG exports are typically headed to Europe as well, so we're very well placed to capture the extra demand.</p>
          <p>Worth mentioning just on pricing as well, typically our portfolio has been 60% oil priced linked, 40% spot, or spot indexed. As a result of some of the issues we've discussed previously in the second quarter and probably running through the third quarter we're more at a 50/50 level between oil linkage and spot or spot indexation. There was some renegotiation of contracts that enabled us to extend the longer term security of supply at oil linked prices at the tradeoff against shorter term spot indexation, so you are seeing some of those affects in the earnings.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I've looked at the results, given the past circumstances and the relatively small amount of write offs, indicate that something is being done rather right. Longer run, does this mean in your views that there's going to be a lesser production and therefore more use of the fleet and more long term transportation of crude oil and also more long term transportation of LNG. How does that position your company relative to others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Joseph. Thanks for the question. I think if I understand it correctly on the LNG side I think there is from a destination point of view for that which I think is behind your question. We have clearly planned that some Qatar volumes will go into the U.S., which it will -- as much as we can it will not we are sending this to Asia Pacific on the long term contracts or even in the Middle East. But if there is surface volume and it's not going to Europe then most of it will find its way into the U.S. as we have co-terminal capacity there, but so far we have been very good in finding different actually, contractual structures and customs across the world. So as far as I remember I think in Q2 we had actually no LNG going into the U.S. So we could place this in a different way. So can I just check that it was behind your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was part of the thought in terms of the quota. I was also rather wondering as to considering what the probable results are of the on-going shut-downs in the United States, offshore production, which you are going to follow from what is going on, whether that is again something that impacts upon you -- upon part of your operations rather favorably compared to -- with your competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I understand that. I think first of all I would like to start by saying we have obviously a very global portfolio. Most of our projects which are coming on-stream in the next two to three years are actually outside the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. So this gives us obviously the comfort. Now having said that, we have got obviously potential final investment positions coming up like Mars B, for example, which could deliver some of our growth in the kind of '14, '15, '16 era. So we will see how we go forward with that final investment decision. So I think if I summarize it, it's in the short-term 8,000 barrels this year but over the next two, three years we don't see a lot of impact. It could impact post-2015 from a production point of view.</p>
          <p>So, and then from the outside of the Americas into the Americas because we have less production in the Gulf -- the Gulf of Mexico. I think we will see how this goes. I personally would still think actually we will be capable of going on and drilling in the deep water, produce what we can produce and you will have less &#x2013; not less, but you will have not a tremendous number more coming into the U.S. over the years to come. But we will see this overall in the next 6 to 12 to 18 months much better than we see it now.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's a question on Chemicals. Obviously the Asian market is proving quite strong. I was curious as to whether the recovery you're seeing is broad-based across the product slate. And also secondly, whether there are any signs of that beginning to tail-off towards the end of the quarter given the measures the Chinese authorities have taken in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. I think we had a good quarter in chemicals with 18% volume up and this was quite across the various products and the areas which we have seen. So that's for the second quarter. As you have heard me saying, I'm a little bit more negative on the pace of the recovery for the second half. And I would say that some of that is actually linked to Chemicals. I wouldn't link it entirely to China, but I will see some of the designs that the pace is really slower than what it used to be in Q2. So that makes us a little bit more careful in looking forward into Q3 and 4 in general, on the macro environment but Chemicals is certainly part of that.</p>

          <p>Hi there, Peter and Simon. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious about the slide showing the next generation of projects, and particularly on the tight gas opportunity in China. I mean, sort of a couple of pieces to it, but I mean, how close do you think we are to actually progressing that particular part of the portfolio? And how big an opportunity do you think it is? And how cost competitive I think, is probably the more important question. Is it with your LNG portfolio on the Northwest Shelf? Is there any cannibalization of those two sets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mark, thanks for the questions. You're raising a few points in one question. Let me take you through with various points. We have got 8,000 square kilometers of tight gas and shale gas. This is primarily now going to be an exploration kind of try. So some of your questions are regarding how big it is and how fast it comes will depend on the exploration. From a geological point of view this has a lot of similarities to North America so we are quite hopeful there, and we'll see after drilling now how, what the pace is and what the potential is.</p>
          <p>I think from a cost point of view, I think again you will see this, but I would also like to say that we are obviously -- in China, we reduced the China sourcing quite significantly in order to be cost competitive. On the third one which is your cannibalization of LNG, I think we should all remember that China at the moment has roughly 4% gas in their energy mix. Over the next 10 years we see this going up to 8 to 10%, but this is compared to Europe and to other countries across the world. It's a rather low percentage there typically between 20, 25%. So there is an enormous potential for gas to actually meet the demand growth in China, replace some of the coal given its CO2 behavior. So I think China will need sufficient and a lot of gas so that you can actually deliver LNG growth into China, but at the same time have some tight/shale gas domestic production as well.</p>

          <p>Thanks and good afternoon Peter and Simon, two questions. One on Nigerian gas, I wondered if you could just give a little bit of guidance on the impact and the timing of future LNG volumes from the Nigerian investment, the $2 billion investment, to gather gas in the delta. And secondly on disposals, you've given on slide seven a split of upstream, downstream. I just wondered whether you could give us the sort of guidance on the numbers rather than just using my rudimentary read of off the graph, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Simon. I will take the second one and give the first one on LNG -- Nigeria to Simon. I think you were fading out, but your second question was about the split on the disposal side. We said it's both upstream and downstream and we said actually if you take the total amount it's roughly a third each for Upstream International, Upstream Americas and the Downstream.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. Nigerian gas, the $2 billion for the flare out, that gas is primarily targeted domestic gas as opposed to LNG. What we do expect, though is that releases some of the Soku gas currently being used for domestic purposes and the Gbaran-Ubie project once it reaches full speed by the end of the year, where it's about 1.2 Bcf total production. But all six trains of Nigeria LNG, that's 22.5 million tons I think in total, are potentially full. So Gbaran-Ubie, Soku plus the supply from our other partners should effectively almost double the Nigerian LNG output and it's not driven by or dependent on the success of the $2 billion flare program, which we will still face the challenge of course of the Nigerian government financing its share so it's difficult to be absolutely explicit on the timing of delivery of that piece.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two things. Firstly, you mentioned that the restructuring of the business is essentially complete. Obviously, a large number of staff reductions associated with that restructuring. Can you say whether at the half year stage all of those staff reductions have flowed through the system? Or were there still some left to work through? And can you give us some &#x2013; if they haven't all worked through, can you give us some details? Second thing, can you just give us an update on Majnoon, what you're doing or what your immediate plans for the future are? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, David. On the first one, the restructuring, yes, we have as I have said we have worked through this -- the restructuring side but also the cost side so we have done the $3.5 billion cost reduction. So that has been delivered six months ahead of target. On the staff side we had the two tranches, 5,000 and 2,000, which gives you the 7,000 and we said we will get there by the end of 2011. So I would say it this way, all the staff have been informed. Those who are part of the 7,000, I think there is roughly some 800 still to leave the company in the second half but they have been announced and from an accounting point of view we have taken those provisions. So the financial you should not in come anymore. There are some 800 still to go out.</p>
          <p>The Majnoon, yeah, I think we are in full mode of preparation there. We are in the kind of preparation phase and tendering phase, so allocating to the various contractors. We have done more field with it. We are doing the detailed design and I think we are really well progressing there in terms of starting and getting involved. It's a clear target to get to the first commercial production, as you know which is 175,000 barrels by 2012. So that is -- all what we're doing at the moment is aimed at that in order to get to that cost recovery kind of moment when we reach those 175,000 barrels. And you know the field is already producing 45 at this stage. So cooperation within Iraq which the South Oil Company is also very good. So we are very positive on the way they are moving forward here and I see no problems, no issues at this stage.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, a question about your exploration program. Could you perhaps elaborate a bit about the organic resource additions you made in the first half? And could you shed a bit more light on your focus areas of the exploration program in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andriesson. We don't give our results volume update in the middle of the year, but you know, we target over a billion barrels a year out of the overall program from the $3 billion that we spend. We're still assessing some of the actual exploration discoveries, particularly Australian gas that we found in second quarter and typically the Gulf of Mexico as well. So we're on track for the target, is about the best I can say. The other unknown, North American, the tight gas activity, a lot of that is still exploration nature and contributes to the target.</p>
          <p>The second half of the year, we had hoped to do a bit more Gulf of Mexico but Brazil will be a key area. We have another nine wells to drill in the next 18 months in the exploration program there. In particular, should be spudding within a month or so the BMS-54 well in the sub-salt in the Santos Basin. We continue to explore in Australia, and we will continue to takeup. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are starting up activity in China on the tight gas. So exciting potential there. We're continuing in Saudi. And we're also in the middle of an appraisal well on the Kroe prospect in Norway. So that was originally discovered 18 months or so ago. Those are the big ones we're looking out for in the second half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. I have one question concerning the initiatives jointly with Chevron, Conoco, Exxon to accelerate and develop capabilities to contain future potential underwater blowouts in the Gulf of Mexico. I was wondering why BP was not involved. Was it a choice of your part or them? Can you give us some clues on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much for the question. I think it's very simple. We started with four companies. This is really a kind of a small number of companies in order to actually accelerate fast and find a common solution and then develop it, but it is open to whoever wants to join. And so, therefore, it is not a restricted group. It is a very open group. The four companies just felt that BP had enough on its plate and they can join later. They can whenever they are ready in that sense. So there's no exclusion of anybody in all of this. This is about delivering as an industry a solution as fast as possible and it was felt it is easier with a smaller number of companies and then open it up afterwards.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter and Simon. Just two quick ones. The Asia-Pacific gas volumes in the second quarter were pretty weak. I wonder if, Simon, you might be able to give me some color as to why. Secondly, Gbaran-Ubie, is that subject to the MOU fiscal terms in Nigeria? Or is there another fiscal arrangement that's applicable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the first question, Mark? Didn't quite catch that? Asia-Pacific gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Asia-Pacific gas volumes, Simon, in the second quarter were down both versus the first quarter as well as year ago. Is there a particular reason that you might cite?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the primary reasons there is it's fundamentally the PSC effect in Malaysia, the higher price, lower volume. And I think that's the main driver there. The Gbaran-Ubie under the MOU, yes, it's under the MOU. We actually financed it though through &#x2013; you may remember we announced a modified carry agreement a year or two ago. And most of the Gbaran-Ubie development was actually financed through a modified carry which means we're getting additional return effectively, because the government did not finance its share.</p>
          <p>So we get some return there. The gas price has gone up as well and was agreed about a year ago, so we get slightly better returns there. But primarily, the main attractiveness is the LNG that opens up effectively, capacity that was unused. So it's actually quite a good revenue generator for us overall and in that sense, better than you might expect. And the last thing I'd say is actually there's quite a lot of liquids in Gbaran-Ubie gas, quite a lot of condensate and so, overall, quite a good prospect for us. Very little contribution in the second quarter; the main impact is from the Q3 results onwards.</p>
