          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the E.ON's First Quarter Results 2011 Conference Call. At our customers' request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>May I now hand over to Mr. Sascha Bibert, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2011 results conference call. Apart from financials, you've probably observed three differences to our usual doing.</p>
          <p>First, our results were published 30 minutes earlier this morning at 7:30 CET. This should be the general rule forward and we hope that this facilitates the analysis for all of those who need to come up with a conclusion already in the first minutes of the day.</p>
          <p>Second, the results follow our new reporting structure, always a bit painful for those running models, but we hope with our sending you the previous year figures along the new format helped a bit.</p>
          <p>Third and final, Johannes [Dr. Johannes Teyssen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer] is not with us during this call. This has nothing to do with politics or similar. It's purely a reflection of how we will deal with quarterly earnings calls in the future. Johannes will be part of the call for the even quarters, i.e., during full-year and half-year presentations, but the first and third quarters will be handled by Marcus and myself. I think this is in line with what many competitors do and assists a clear focus on the discussions.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to our CFO, Marcus Schenck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome also from my side. As Sascha said, for the first time, we are giving you our numbers along the new reporting structure. We have provided you with a reconciliation of the fiscal year 2010, both for the full year and the first quarter numbers along the new structure ahead of reporting today and hope that this has facilitated your analysis.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that this new structure and the corresponding reporting will bring multiple benefits not only for your analysis, but more importantly, for the internal steering of the corporation. That said, no transaction is easy and we do recognize that it brings about more work for you in the beginning.</p>
          <p>During the course of this year, we plan to provide you with more information, in particular as it relates to our operations. It will take some time &#x2013; or some more time to secure the necessary data quality. Before I go into more details on the Q1 results, let me summarize our view on what certainly will be a hot topic today, namely, the political situation in Germany.</p>
          <p>As you all are aware, the German government is reassessing its energy policy following the earthquake in Japan. The government has imposed a three-month moratorium on the lifetime extension decided last year and has asked operators to take the seven nuclear plants built until 1980 offline during that period.</p>
          <p>E.ON has had to stop its Isar 1 and Unterweser reactors. The Brunsb&#xFC;ttel plant had already been offline for some time and Kr&#xFC;mmel, which is a post '98 plant is explicitly not affected by the moratorium, but had also been offline for, as you know, other reasons.</p>
          <p>In parallel, the EU Commission plans to stress-test the safety of all nuclear power plants in Europe. At E.ON we are confident that all our nuclear power plants satisfy very high safety standards and that ours and also the other German nuclear power plants would come out strongly in any objective safety assessment.</p>
          <p>Although we have doubts about the legal merits of the moratorium, we decided against a claim. The success of such a claim would have been uncertain; and to mitigate damages, we would have had an obligation to restart Isar 1 and Unterweser right away. We found that to be a massively challenging task in today's political environment in Germany.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are convinced that E.ON's long-term interests are better served by adopting a constructive attitude in this debate.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we decided to suspend the prepayments into the Energy and Climate Fund, as these payments are directly linked to the nuclear lifetime extension, which was put under moratorium. We will equally protect the company's interests with respect to the nuclear fuel tax. So far, the nuclear fuel tax has not been paid, as it is only due once we refuel the reactors. So it's not a continuous payment throughout the year, and it's also nothing we can provision for.</p>
          <p>In June, after the revisions of the plants Grafenrheinfeld and Grohnde, as well as Gundremmingen B for &#x2013; where E.ON has a participation, will come to a conclusion concerning a possible legal action against the tax.</p>
          <p>While there might be good reasons for such a claim, we'll of course have to reflect on any new information arising from the current political deliberations. We understand the German government targets a cabinet decision on the new energy strategy by June 6th, including a change of the atomic energy law. The decision shall be based on the recommendations by the new Ethical Commission on secure energy supply and the existing Safety Commission. Both will present the results by end of May. The parliamentary procedures shall be finished by July 8th. Until we have visibility on the final outcome, we will not speculate on the potential impacts on E.ON.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that the new strategy presented in November last year provides a solid platform to face the current economic and political challenges. Our investment focus over the past years has already included gas-fired power generation and renewables. In both of these activities, we have excellent market positions and we believe the direction of our strategy is still right and that we will realize new opportunities resulting from the transformation of the German energy landscape.</p>
          <p>Depending on the precise outcome of the energy debate, we then might have to revisit our financial targets and we will communicate any updates as soon as possible, i.e., as soon as it is available. At this stage, the only thing that we can say with certainty is that the three-month moratorium will cost us around &#x20AC;250 million. More to that when I talk about the outlook.</p>
          <p>So now to the actual purpose of the call, i.e., the first quarter 2011 results.</p>
          <p>As expected and flagged to you in March, the first quarter was a very tough one for E.ON. We have seen a strong reduction in most of the relevant financial key performance indicators for the group. Adjusted EBITDA was down 23% to now &#x20AC;3.5 billion, adjusted EBIT down 28%, and adjusted net income down by 34% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. Operating cash flow took the strongest hit, by falling by 70% to &#x20AC;0.9 billion. However, investments as planned are down by &#x2013; are down to &#x20AC;1.2 billion and the economic net debt was further reduced by &#x20AC;2.2 billion to now &#x20AC;35.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We have now adjusted our 2011 outlook for closed portfolio measures. The EBITDA impact from this adjustment is &#x20AC;500 million and the group outlook range is lowered accordingly. Our new ranges are &#x20AC;10.7 billion to &#x20AC;11.4 billion for EBITDA and &#x20AC;3 billion to &#x20AC;3.7 billion for adjusted net income. Thus, we are basically confirming our targets for 2011, including the minimum dividend.</p>
          <p>In these targets, we are assuming the German nuclear power stations to be back on line after the three months moratorium. At this stage, we have no other bases to work with. Although the headline numbers may be telling a different story, not all is bad for E.ON in the current year. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
          <p>First on our operating business performance, we are seeing impressive growth in Russia as well as in the renewable area with EBITDA growth rates for the first quarter of 55% and 28% respectively. Furthermore, we are making good progress in the negotiations with the major gas suppliers. For about a quarter of our procurement volume, we have already achieved price reductions that allow us to avoid losses on those volumes going back to October of last year.</p>
          <p>Performance management, here we are continuing to successfully achieve our efficiency targets as part of the PerformtoWin program. Of the &#x20AC;400 million that we wanted to add during the remainder &#x2013; during the year 2011, we've realized the first &#x20AC;100 million in the first quarter. And on portfolio management, as you know we are making very good progress with our streamlining activities; by now we've achieved around &#x20AC;9.1 billion in proceeds in total.</p>
          <p>Moving over to chart number two, let me start with the main effects on adjusted EBITDA at group level. The biggest drivers behind the reduction were the following: Gas Midstream, here we have a drop of &#x20AC;740 million in our sales and supply business. You know the story about this and please remember that the first quarter of 2010 in that segment was particularly strong. UK, sales is down by &#x20AC;200 million. Here also we had an unusually strong quarter last year, first quarter last year due to the combination of both low wholesale prices and high volumes in gas which is not repeated this year. The nuclear moratorium, lower power prices and spreads as well as lower earnings in the German DSOs, cost was just below &#x20AC;300 million in total.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, our E&amp;P business is up &#x20AC;90 million, thanks to higher volumes and prices. Russia as I mentioned is up &#x20AC;50 million due to the market opening and demand growth. Renewable generation as a result of additional capacity is up by &#x20AC;40 million and as mentioned last but not least PerformtoWin contributed another &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>I will skip the third chart and go straight to the divisional level. Conventional generation represents the results of the group's nuclear coal and gas-fired generation activities. Hydro, wind, solar or any other types of renewable are part of the unit renewable generation. Our generation experts ensure optimal availability and competitive costs.</p>
          <p>In general, this unit's earnings are driven strongly by the transfer prices to our trading operations, which is responsible for hedging and marketing these volumes. Therefore dynamics in the earnings of this segment may sometimes differ from what one might expect by just taking into account the achieved prices which we report. As usual by the way you can find those in the backup to our presentation.</p>
          <p>This diverging development is especially obvious this year as the transfer prices, for example, for the German outright date back to the year 2008 when forward power prices for 2011 were on average very high, while average achieved prices in the market for 2011 generation output, &#x20AC;8 per megawatt hour lower than the achieved prices in 2010.</p>
          <p>The development of transfer prices is also the explanation for the single biggest positive effect, &#x20AC;240 million up in nuclear generation. In our Nordic plants, we record a &#x20AC;121 million positive operational effect mainly related to higher volumes as a result of last year's outages. The moratorium in Germany, which was put in place on March 16, has cost us &#x20AC;41 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And our steam fleet benefits primarily from higher transfer prices mainly in the UK. In the CCGT fleet, the results were burdened by falling spreads in particular in Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>Over to chart number five. The segment renewable generation includes the former EC&amp;R as well as our hydro fleet. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased by 28% to almost &#x20AC;400 million. Since our hydro fleet also sells the vast majority of its volumes to trading under the transfer pricing concept, the earnings shift described for the outright part of the conventional generation occurs in this segment as well. These shifts were mainly responsible for the improvement of the hydro results. The price impact is plus &#x20AC;37 million.</p>
          <p>In Italy, we mainly benefit from higher revenues for green certificates and on the negative side we incurred lower volumes in Nordic, Italy, and Spain, which cost us in total about &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>The wind, solar and other renewables business segments sees additional volumes from higher in-store capacity compared to the first quarter of 2010. Here, we now are at 3.6 gigawatts compared to 3 gigawatts as per the end of the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Also our Global Gas business has received a facelift due to our new reporting. The upstream result includes the contribution from our Russian gas field, Yuzhno Russkoye. Midstream business is made up of our supply and sales activities as well as storage. Transfers, we showed separately together with our earnings from infrastructure share holdings.</p>
          <p>The Global Gas business saw the already flat significant reduction of earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. The decline was entirely driven by our supply and sales activity where we are being hit by two effects. Q1 of 2010 was a fairly strong quarter with high and still profitable volumes given the cold winter. Q2 of 2011 was also cold but the development that started in Q4 of 2010 continued. We were buying gas mainly under oil-indexed long-term contracts and had to sell it at a negative margin. This led to a negative delta of &#x20AC;756 million, of which the vast majority, almost &#x20AC;700 million is the price effect. Positive compensation came mainly from our upstream activities. Here, it's both price and volume driven.</p>
          <p>Now a few words on the status of our renegotiations. Following the successful closure of the last round of contract renegotiations, we're now in discussions with key suppliers effective October 1, 2010. Since March 9th of this year, we have made first tangible progress. We have already successfully renegotiated a portion of our long-term contract, representing about a quarter of our supply volumes. These agreements were concluded early May and in addition, the renegotiations of the other contracts are moving in the right direction. Hence we have decided not to start arbitration proceedings at this stage and continue commercial discussions. However, should we decide to go for arbitration later on, there will be no adverse consequences for us, i.e., compensation becomes effective as of the October 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>Some of the renegotiation agreements, whether those already concluded or forthcoming, might provide a temporary solution, i.e., price concessions rather than a holistic restructuring to sustainably minimize our exposure to price risks. In this case, we typically agree on a price reduction for the current year while continuing the discussions to come to a structural solution, namely designing a new pricing mechanism to align prices with the markets. Nevertheless, those agreements will already reduce losses in supply and sales in 2011. Although recent developments are generally positive, we keep our outlook for supply and sales unchanged. The renegotiations that we have concluded so far are in line with the scenario assumed earlier this year when we gave our outlook. We continue, thus, to expect a loss of around &#x20AC;1 billion in 2011 for this sub-segment. However, our confidence has increased nevertheless as we have already reached the status originally assumed for by year-end.</p>
          <p>Overall, we still expect that we will not be able to complete all the renegotiations during the current year. In addition, as you know, we are not renegotiating the current gas year with one key supplier based in Norway. Therefore, a loss in supply and sales in 2011 is still highly probable if not certain. However, as previously explained, this is mostly a timing issue. We remain determined to de-risk supply and sales and to recover losses accumulated since the start of the renegotiations.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to trading. Our trading activity is basically not impacted by the new reporting structure. As explained with our full-year outlook in March, we are seeing a strong swing at the optimization results driven by different dynamics of transfer and achieved prices. Whilst transfer price, i.e., the procurement side for trading is based on market forward prices that have seasonal highs in winter months, the sales side of trading typically realizes constant prices for E.ON. Hence, Q1 and Q4 in trading always tend to be weak, whilst the second and the third quarter show better optimization results.</p>
          <p>A positive development in the coal portfolio, which is around &#x20AC;122 million up, was more than offset by the negative developments in our gas and oil portfolio with minus &#x20AC;150 million. The prop-trading activity was negatively affected by the strong price jump after the announcement of the moratorium and in April the situation has been improving again for prop-trading.</p>
          <p>And, now for the first time to the three regional segments. In the segment, we have funded all the regional activities in Germany, distribution in both gas and power, sales of gas and electricity and also heat as well as energy from waste. In the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA of this segment was down 2% to &#x20AC;755 million. The regulated DSO business suffered from lower network revenues. Remember, throughout the whole year 2010 we were positively impacted by certain one-off developments in this area.</p>
          <p>In Q1 of 2010, we recovered &#x20AC;50 million cost that we had incurred in 2009; that effect was not repeated in Q1 of 2011. In the unregulated activities, we improved compared to 2010 by 43%. Sales are up mainly due to operational improvements and heat and others also improved by &#x20AC;45 million.</p>
          <p>Other EU countries include the regional activities mainly in distribution and sales in Europe, outside Germany and Russia. Chart nine's functional breakdown provides additional information compared to the Interim Report where we are showing earnings along the country lines. You can also find the breakdown along country lines in the backup to this presentation.</p>
          <p>First on the main improvements in our distribution business, biggest positive driver is our Czech DSO where we're up about &#x20AC;100 million and there we are passing on increased renewable energy costs, mainly from photovoltaic to the end customer compared to Q1 2010. Also, our U.K. DSO improved &#x20AC;22 million.</p>
          <p>Let me move to sales which is down &#x20AC;250 million. Here, the single most important driver is U.K. retail which is down &#x20AC;230 million. It is flat during full-year reporting. We had expected a strongly negative year-on-year performance, especially in Q1, mainly because the prior year's first quarter performance was so unusually good. Q1 of this year did not profit from lower wholesale prices which we had observed in Q1 of 2010, and furthermore, lower volumes in gas took their toll. However, overall our U.K. sales business is still on a well-performing and profitable track.</p>
          <p>At our regional unit Russia, over to page 10, we saw a continuation of the positive trends in earnings that we have been observing in the past two years. EBITDA is up 55% to now more than &#x20AC;150 million. The biggest drivers were, as in recent past, the market opening as well as the demand growth resulting from a further continuation of the positive economic developments in the country. What becomes more obvious with this set of results is the high share of the capacity market in our earnings for the new units. To highlight this, we have split out the results contribution of our new unit Shatura which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of last year. It highlights that two-thirds of the earnings of the CCGT are related to the capacity market, which provides a stable framework.</p>
          <p>On the following two slides, 11 and 12, we have reconciled net income starting from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net interest expense slightly improved, mainly due to the improvement in our net financial position. In the net book gains, we recorded the remaining Gazprom disposal this year. Last year, the main impact was related to the disposal of generation capacity.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating earnings include prepayment effects for our bonds that we bought back as well as the write-down of gas assets in Egypt. Our tax rate has come down mainly due to a higher share of non-taxable income in the pre-tax results, which is mainly related to the sale of the Gazprom shares. In discontinued operations, there is nothing exciting in this year and please remember that 2010 was related to the disposal of E.ON U.S. Midwest.</p>
          <p>Next chart, you can see the drop in adjusted net income by 34%, fairly simple with depreciation almost constant and net interest result only slightly improved, it's basically the after-tax EBITDA decline that hits our bottom-line.</p>
          <p>Let me move to page 14. Our operating cash flow saw a steep drop in the first quarter. It can only partially be explained by the lower EBITDA. There is a list of further effects that has driven this. First, there is a small positive impact of &#x20AC;100 million due to non-cash effective EBITDA components when comparing the two quarters. In Global Gas, we have used most of our volume than last year. In addition, a number of receivables paid in &#x2013; in the first &#x2013; was paid in the first quarter of 2011 and also receivables have been built up at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we recorded funding of the deficits in the amount of &#x20AC;300 million. Whilst this burdens the operating cash flow, it has no impact on economic net debt and is largely a one-off effect.</p>
          <p>In Trading, the working capital increased mainly because higher volumes have been transferred to Trading from our Global Gas unit, which were then sold into the Trading market.</p>
          <p>In renewables, we received less cash grants compared to the prior year in the U.S., and then in Russia and the Czech Republic we have a sort of I would say a technical effect where the regulator has essentially changed payment terms which is also a one &#x2013; leads to a one-time effect of negative &#x20AC;200 million. The bond buyback cost a &#x20AC;100 million prepayments effect; now the working capital movements add up to &#x20AC;300 million. We clearly do not expect this percentage decline in operating cash flow to continue throughout the rest of the year; that's why I highlighted a the number of effects &#x2013; negative effects of this quarter as clearly a sort of one-off nature.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt has continued to improve. Here, we are comparing to the 2010 year-end level. Investments were reduced by 31% compared to last year. In the first quarter, divestments include mainly the cash in that were &#x2013; that we got from the disposal of the remaining Gazprom shares and a number of smaller transactions. Operating cash flow, I talked about, a special effect clearly results from the reclassification of Central Networks as a so-called disposal group. What we do here is we exclude the net financial position of Central Networks, which is a bit more than &#x20AC;500 million as well as pension provisions related to Central Networks. Both these positions have by now been transferred to PPL.</p>
          <p>Finally, we record further &#x20AC;600 million improvements which include predominantly a foreign exchange effect of &#x20AC;400 million. Remember, end of last year, we talked about the negative effect as a consequence of the weak Euro; this time it went the other direction. The Euro got stronger and that has helped in the valuation of our non-Euro denominated debt.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me now talk about our outlook for the current year. As you see, we have adjusted the 2011 outlook for the effects from the portfolio measures. Our new ranges, technically adjusted, I would say are as follows: Adjusted EBITDA &#x20AC;10.7 billion to &#x20AC;11.4 billion, coming from &#x20AC;11.2 billion to &#x20AC;11.9 billion. This reflects exactly the &#x20AC;500 million EBITDA which we were losing as a result of the disposal of the U.K. and the Italian distribution businesses. Furthermore, we're also confirming this guidance range in light of our three-month moratorium costing us &#x20AC;250 million, which we had not planned for in the original target. We expect that this negative effect can be compensated by higher results from our E&amp;P operation and a mix of other effects that are developing better than planned. So, apart from the technical adjustment for portfolio changes, we do confirm our outlook.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income, here we now see the range at &#x20AC;3 billion to &#x20AC;3.7 billion, down from &#x20AC;3.3 billion to &#x20AC;4 billion. The change in the adjusted net income is driven by about &#x20AC;200 million dilution effect. It's recognized that we initially reduced the less expensive short-term debt and hence the positive impact on the interest result is lower at first. In addition, we foresee a slight increase in minorities until the year-end compared to our budgets.</p>
          <p>Over to the last page, the adjusted guidance also finds its reflection in the individual business in these segments. We have slightly lowered the range for Conventional Generation and Trading to reflect the impact of the moratorium while we have slightly increased the range for Global Gas, taking into account mainly the higher earnings contribution from our E&amp;P business. The biggest change obviously took place in the other EU country segments where we are including the effects of the aforementioned disposals, mainly Central Networks and the Italian gas distribution.</p>
          <p>Let me make one additional observation regarding the outlook for the quarters. Compared to the isolated prior-year quarters, we do expect the quarters two and three of the current year to continue to fall. Q4 will then be the first quarter where we anticipate a recovery compared to prior year's quarter. Of course, when you add it all up, for the full year, we will come out substantially below last year as you can tell from the full-year guidance that we just gave you.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks and both Sascha and I will now happily take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A question regarding the cost on nuclear even if you do not want to speculate too much on it, three months' nuclear moratorium could cost &#x20AC;250 million, why could it be wrong to assume that final closure of these plants could lead to another burden of &#x20AC;500 million for the upcoming six months to come between July and December? So &#x2013; also some qualitative statements would be welcome.</p>

          <p>Yeah, totally surprising question. Yeah, I think it's a fair point. Let me give you some additional information here so that you can do some math. As we had mentioned the moratorium will cost us about five terawatt hours. When I look at the remainder of the year, then of the plants that are at risk, clearly we have to look at Isar 1 and Unterweser. Don't forget we had not assumed in our budgets that Kr&#xFC;mmel would come back online during 2011. When I look at Isar 1 and Unterweser, there is in total roughly another six terawatt hours that can be produced after the end of the moratorium until the end of 2011. That I think gives you sort of a metric that helps to make the case, in a way it also answers I think your question that &#x2013; because you indicated you would add another &#x20AC;500 million; that is too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As such, the five terawatt hours lost are roughly equivalent to &#x20AC;250 million and then add another six terawatt hours and yeah, I think that gives you an indication what that isolated effect is; there could be other impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one add-on question in terms of the nuclear fuel tax, so lower volume means also ease of the burden here which probably would have to deduct, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. When you look at a specific year, it heavily depends on the &#x2013; sort of on the low &#x2013; on the refilling of power plants with fuel watts. Don't forget how the taxation works. It's not a charge per megawatt hour produced. It is also not a constant monthly payment. What it is, is you take a plant into offline, you refill it with new fuel watts, and the moment you restart the power plants, for those fuel watts are actually the volume inserted into the reactor, you immediately pay the full tax on sort of &#x2013; on the gram of uranium that you have inserted, which implies that also when you look at our quarters, it will not come at a constant rate, yeah? Some people have asked us why haven't we seen yet any payments. Well, the reason is no new fuel rod has been inserted and sort of &#x2013; and put again into operation. That will first time happen now, end of May, early June depending on the exact timing of the restart of Grafenrheinfeld and Grohnde.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Vincent Gilles from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Guess what, I'm going to come back to the &#x20AC;250 million, and I won't be the last one. And then I've got a question on gas. On this &#x20AC;250 million, it's a cost without any form of offsetting impact, am I right? So you're not talking about potentially compensating with high load factor for other plants, buying some power somewhere else, offsetting at a higher price, am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Vincent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is, your statement is very cautious on gas. You use the word, making no loss on those terawatt hour, 125, they have been renegotiating. And then you sort of hinted that it's a bit of a one-off, so you're sort of neutralizing these 125 until the end of the year. Should I understand, then, that essentially what you've done, potentially, with Gazprom is, you decided to cut the loss for just one year until the end of the year, and then you go into another round of negotiation? Or should we assume that this quarter of your supply has now been renegotiated for a longer period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not so sure I understand the end of your question, but let me maybe give a bit more color to the renegotiation and what has been achieved. What we said was that a quarter of the volume that is exposed to the gas oil spreads has been renegotiated. You've done the math in a correct way. We've always said that you can look at our total volume which is around 600 terawatt hours. About 100 of that is not exposed to indexation problems and of the remaining 500, about a quarter has now been renegotiated.</p>
          <p>When we say renegotiated, it means that we get a price release starting from October 1, 2010. That will technically imply that you will see sort of the recovery for the fourth quarter of '10 and the first quarter of 2011 in the second quarter of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will not be &#x2013; you said something about neutralizing it. It will not be neutralized. That is part of our ongoing earnings. So that will be reflected in the second quarter. I think what we can say today is that through those three negotiations we feel we have secured basically the relief that we had assumed in our full year budget.</p>
          <p>So, in other words, in March when we spoke about the outlook, we indicated to you that our expectation was a drop by &#x20AC;1 billion, which already included an assumption on certain recoveries. Today, we would say we still see the &#x20AC;1 billion decline risk. What we can tell you is that the recovery is no longer an assumption. It has been secured. And of course, I don't know what will happen for the remainder of the year, but let's see. Yeah, we continue discussions and I think I also told you today that we are not in arbitration and are still trying to make progress with commercial negotiations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everybody. Two questions, please. Number one is on the nuclear scenario. You gave us a bit of a feeling what the second half loss &#x2013; or, loss output and profits would be if these pre-1980 stations stay offline. Could you give us a bit of a feeling what the NPV's impact of the decommissioning provisions would be if these plants have to stay offline? And the second question is actually, again, on the gas contracts. Out of those 25% that you've successfully renegotiated, is the lion's share just fuel price concession, price reduction, or is there a significant share that &#x2013; where the issue has structurally been fixed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, I understand the question as follows: namely, what would a scenario where Isar 1 and Unterweser gets shutdown imply to our nuclear provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; I think there is a &#x2013; first, there is a technical answer and that is there will only be a minor effect resulting from sort of the different timing i.e. the discount effect is not terribly substantial. It's actually very low. But you can tell that -</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Low triple digit million or what means quite low if you can quantify that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lower than that, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to give you an indication, when we saw the lifetime extension look at what changed there to our decommissioning provision. It was a de minimis amount and you should expect the same here. Having said that, and that is something I think we need to bring to your attention and I don't have a number for you. If and &#x2013; it's an if and not a when &#x2013; if the government were to decide that both these plants ought to be shutdown now, we run in &#x2013; or, we are facing a scenario where we are in essence entering a shutdown procedure in a different way than you would do if you had a chance to really anticipate this early on.</p>
          <p>With that I'm implying we think there is a risk that in the coming years, in the coming few years, we will incur certain cost, which otherwise would have been avoided had we known earlier that we would have to decommission these plants. Those additional costs have not been provisioned for in the past, because quite frankly no one here had so far expected that from one way to the other we might be told hey, please shutdown the plant, okay.</p>
          <p>How big that impact is, I cannot tell you today. I certainly do not expect that to be a billion, but I also do not expect it to be just a small two digit million number. But I don't really have a reliable figure for you today. All we can highlight is that there could be a change in the provision resulting from this additional cost. Having said that, I think obviously if a decision on decommissioning needs to be taken, we also need to reflect on where &#x2013; because we will then likely not be just those two plants, what does that imply for the overall assumptions as it relates to the cost development, availability of capacity to decommission and so we will then have to review the impact there, I would &#x2013; this can also be &#x2013; they can technically also be a positive impact from that.</p>
          <p>So, I don't really want to speculate on what were changed to the provision. It is something that, of course, once we have clarity, it's one of the first items that we will communicate to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question regarding the price renegotiations, we have both. We have situations where we have a price relief and a structural solution and we have situations where we have a price relief and continue to talk to our counter-party about the structural solution, where clearly the price relief has put us into a position that suggest that okay, we now have time, which to &#x2013; time to really think through what is a good solution.</p>
          <p>I think yeah, I would like to remind everyone and then I stop talking that it's not us against the producer. There in a way is a, I would say, also a common interest and that is ultimately find or develop the market in a good way. And so we see that the discussions are constructive in a sense that really both sides are trying to think hard to come to a good solution, a good structural solution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I may follow up with a very quick one, has the shrinking gas/oil spread actually made negotiations more difficult, or did it not have any impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean the structural situation is still the same and I mean the mood is not changing on a weekly basis there. Of course, for tactical reasons, there are days when we come up and say, oh no, this and that has happened, and of course, that's reinforcing our position and in &#x2013; as is the case in every good negotiation, when the others have something nice that works sort of in their favor, they try to use that argument. But, ultimately really all discussions are very constructive.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Benjamin Leyre from Exane BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, and good afternoon. Two questions, please. First one on this impact on this renegotiation of gas contracts. Can you quantify, please, the positive one-off impact you will get in May, thanks to this one-off reimbursement of the past losses since October? And the second question, can you also help us understand how you modified, if at all, your forward 2012 oil to gas &#x2013; or gas to oil spread hedging, given the recent improvement in this play? Did you accelerate locking this spread at the lower level, or actually, did you not change anything? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, let me more try to help you establish a sort of a math behind this because I think it will be a recurring theme. As we indicated earlier, about 120 terawatt hours have been successfully renegotiated. We had, I think, on our last call worked out that when you look at the overall exposure for the full year, there was a certain volume where we said, okay, assuming negative gas/oil spread which is somewhere has been fluctuating between &#x20AC;3 and &#x20AC;6 or so. So, take a midpoint there and then multiply it with the volume, you can then see what's roughly the sort of the full year relief and then you can almost divide this by four and then you know what the quarterly impact is.</p>
          <p>So, what it then translates into is that for the last quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, for each of those quarters, there is roughly a recovery of, say, around &#x20AC;100 million, which will be recorded in the next quarter. And then obviously, there is then the ongoing relief in the third quarter, which will be roughly the same amount per quarter. Is that clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought volumes would be more loaded into Q4 and Q1, so the share of these two quarters would be higher. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's directionally fair, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, it's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on your second question, hedging the gas/oil spreads. Well, I think the problem here is there is no liquid market, so there is no &#x2013; I mean to the extent you can hedge your position, we are trying &#x2013; we are continuing to do that when we deem it meaningful, but there are no real liquid markets for that product.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. My question is not on the gas situation, it's on &#x2013; I had some &#x2013; I wondered on the new markets that you've been talking about since the Capital Markets Day back in November. Now that we're sort of six months down the line, can you give us any more color on how your plans are progressing, potential areas that you're looking at, or the kind of structures that you might be looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bobby, I run the risk of reiterating what I'm afraid we've said in the past, and that is &#x2013; I mean, the types of situation we are looking for is the same as we indicated in the past.</p>
          <p>What we've done now or what we've achieved by now is sort of a shortlist of certain markets that we've deem interesting. We have now established teams for those markets. We already have people on the grounds. We are identifying specific situations and have, to some extent, started to approach possible partners or project ideas. That's where we stand.</p>
          <p>We obviously would have a strong preference to come back to you with something tangible when we have it. And as we indicated in the past, this may still take some time, because we clearly recognized that in particular, the first thing we do, all of you will &#x2013; you know, with &#x2013; you will carefully look at this, so do we. And hence we really wanted to be sort of the right first step, which also implies, and that has already factually happened so far, that there are situations that we then have turns down.</p>
          <p>That's where we stand. I know you would prefer me to say okay, if this, this, and that market, and here are the five people we are talking to, but I think you will also appreciate that that would not be terribly smart for me to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I have a follow-up? If you &#x2013; if one assumes that energy policy in Germany changes in the way that we've all been discussing, and that some of the nuclear plants are closed more quickly than you had previously expected, then the carbon intensity of your fleet would increase, all else equal. Do you think you would invest in low carbon plants in Germany to try and sort of fix that position, or that you would invest outside of Germany, given the kind of economics that are developing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, in a way I would almost say to the extent, we are looking at the markets where we have meaningful positions. We are agnostic to geography. What we really look at is the financial merits. If it financially makes a lot of sense to do what you just said in Germany, compared to, say, the UK, Sweden or Russia or the U.S., then we would do it in Germany. If it's more attractive in other countries, we will do it in other countries.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it's I think our job is to invest along the lines of the strategy that we presented where it financially makes more sense. That might be Germany, might not be Germany. But we certainly don't feel like we have now an obligation to replace capacity that will be shutdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Martin Young from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, there. A couple of questions. One is to follow up on what Bobby was just asking about, and that's about the investment. If you look at what's been happening in the UK, it's pretty clear that the major energy suppliers and major energy operators here in the UK, including yourselves, have had significant dialog with the UK government about making the market a place that has suitable incentives to invest, given the challenges that we face here. Clearly, if Germany goes down the route of accelerated exit from nuclear power, they too will have challenges.</p>
          <p>To what extent have you been engaged in dialog with the German government about some elements of market reform, to put in place appropriate incentives for any new generation that's required?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, getting back to the issue of the nuclear moratorium, and potential impact on guidance. It's quite clear that you've had a &#x20AC;250 million hit from the temporary shutdown of those nuclear plants alone. That's been somewhat offset by higher prices on the market, and you've only dropped your guidance for the full year for the Generation business by about &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>Now, extrapolating that for the full year, you can probably say that maybe there's another &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;150 million being the net of the impact of an extended shutdown, with some kind of compensation on the prices relative to where your initial guidance was set.</p>
          <p>Now, that doesn't strike me as too big a number, given that you have a reasonably wide range for the EBITDA and the net income guidance, which when you then put it into the context of the dividend would suggest that you should be able to absorb that and firmly commit to the &#x20AC;1.3 billion &#x2013; sorry, the &#x20AC;1.3 per share dividend, unless, of course, those additional costs that you believe might hit the provisions are going to be treated as ordinary costs, and therefore, impacting your adjusted net income. Is that the right way to think about it? If you do have to shutdown it early then those additional costs will be what triggers a potential risk to the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your first question on market reform in Germany, no, we haven't. Quite frankly, I think right now, we first need to wait for what the German government, or Parliament, will state as the sort of targets at new energy concept for this country. Then we can assess the implications that has for how the market functions? And I think we and others will have to talk to the government in terms of how do things get implemented that they would like to happen, particularly as it relates to any new capacity on the generation side or quite frankly, also possible implications for the group businesses &#x2013; are sort of affected by this.</p>
          <p>But that debate has not happened, to a large extent. I mean I think we first need to wait for what are the ambitions of the government, what directions do they want the energy system to go and once we know that, then I think it's time to talk about how exactly that then can get implemented in whether or not that requires a reform to how the energy market functions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just too early. On the nuclear moratorium, first one technical remark, a change to the nuclear provision will hit adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income. We have always in all the previous years booked any changes to nuclear provisions through EBITs, positive or negative, last time just for your memory, because not so long ago, was in our former market unit Nordic, where in Q4 we had booked &#x20AC;180 million charge for further provisions on the nuclear side. So it will hit our adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>Now, to what extent and I know this is sort of one of the key questions that people have, to what extent an outcome that is different than just a moratorium impacts our earnings this year and the following years, we today can't accept that. I'm clearly convinced that in six weeks, because that posts mid June, which is when the government has said they would come out with where they want to take this. We will be in a much better position to come up with some assessment on this, but today I would only speculate I can give you 10 different scenarios and 10 different numbers.</p>
          <p>And we will then have to assess whether the impact on our is so material and lasting that it also implies revisiting our dividend promise. But given what we know today for a fact, we don't see a reason to alter our dividend target.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi &#x2013; hi, guys. A couple of questions, please. On the Global Gas business, can I just get it clear that you're saying that you have had some past loss recovery as part of some of your renegotiations? And within that, can you also give us some sort of sense of what structural solutions you have reached, what sort of shape that has taken?</p>
          <p>The second question would be, on the forward power prices in Germany, it looks like &#x2013; am I clear, you sell forward more now, as we would expect. But it looks like the average price has come down a little bit, &#x20AC;1 to &#x20AC;2, if I am reading things right from last time. So perhaps you could enlighten me on that.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just a sort of softer one on guidance. I mean, obviously, you've absorbed the &#x20AC;250 million additional cost. So I guess what I'm asking you is, how much more wiggle room do you have at the bottom end of that guidance range? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, first of all, so far, you do not see any impact of the renegotiations in the numbers we have presented today. So in Q1, which is why the result is doesn't look so great. You do have losses on volumes that by now have been renegotiated. And you will see a recovery of that I think that was one of the earlier questions that we had I think Benjamin asked that. You would see a recovery of that in the second quarter, losses that we incurred in Q4 of last year and in Q1 of this year will for those volumes be recovered in the second quarter of 2011. And as I indicated, it's &#x2013; yeah, It's I mean I gave you the math for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine. I wanted to clear that, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on structure solutions, please accept that these are confidential discussions as you can imagine solutions that are being found with one partner are carefully being looked at by other producers, so that's why we prefer to not comment on this at this stage.</p>
          <p>Clearly, once we are through, we'll have to see in coordination with our partners to what extent these schemes can be disclosed or not.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the achieved price, I think we have for &#x2013; 2011 is actually slightly up, if I recall it correctly by &#x20AC;2 for 2012, it's flat; and for 2013, it's down by &#x20AC;1 as it relates to the Central European portfolios. In Nordic, '11 is constant; '12 is slightly up by &#x20AC;2 and '13 is also up by &#x20AC;1. So I don't think we're really showing a big decline here.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just talking about 2013 being down in Germany. So I was just surprised, given that everything has strengthened since the last numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but please be mindful that these are the numbers as of March 31st, yeah, and you are comparing it with the 2000 &#x2013; the December 2010 numbers, yeah. So this year what has been added here is volume that was traded in the first quarter of 2011. So you have to look at the forwards observed in the market for '13 in the first three months of this year. The price increase we have seen predominantly kicking-in in the second half of March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Now I think your last question if I rephrase it, are you saying you think we are at the bottom end of this range now, or am I misinterpreting your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. I mean, you're saying that you've absorbed the &#x20AC;250 million cost and you're still happy with that guidance. So I'm wondering how many more costs you can absorb and still be happy with that guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, ideally, not more. Look, I think I would prefer to stick to the range, the &#x20AC;250 million as we indicated, a good half of that or half of that can be compensated by E&amp;P which is when you look at &#x2013; which is why when you look at the individual segments, you can see that we've actually upped the guidance for Global Gas.</p>
          <p>And then I think I would also say that or I'd like to re-emphasize the statement that I believe I made earlier, namely, we continue in Gas to see a &#x20AC;1 billion decline. We had eight weeks ago assumed a recovery &#x2013; certain recovery. We know today that we have negotiated this recovery. So hopefully there is a bit more compensation that could take place in that segment.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Becker from Kepler Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. I was wondering, given that you thought &#x2013; you looked to be more involved in the discussions on the new energy framework, when you track the price and what politician said, it sometimes sounds a bit simplistic. Everybody appears to be talking about grid extensions and more renewables, while at the same time, the Ethics Commission report last night appears to &#x2013; at the same time, warn about too much renewables, and &#x2013; I'm wondering what your view is, given that you're one of the major players, how you think, given that a nuclear <mark type="ph" /> accident (1:06:02) now appears to be a given, how you want the market to develop, and what kind of technology choices you would recommend?</p>
          <p>Maybe related to that, you &#x2013; do you mention that the moratorium only affects seven plants, which apparently and technically is correct. Do you see a chance for your Kr&#xFC;mmel plant to be returned to the market?</p>
          <p>And finally, if we can consider this one question, could you share with us the euro billion amount in the fuel tax that you have considered in your 2011 guidance? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you can tell us how much in euro billions you have put in your guidance for the fuel tax this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, understood. Okay, on your first question, what do we want &#x2013; or what do we suggest for the system as we move forward &#x2013; the energy system.</p>
          <p>I mean here I would &#x2013; I think I'd like to say that first of all, it's in a way that's not our call. We'll have to see how the market presents itself after a potential shutdown decision by the government, and then my first observation would be well, we selfishly would do what financially makes more sense for us.</p>
          <p>I don't think it's our job to develop the best energy system for the country. I think that as we can see now every day is a decision that is being taken by politics. And I think we then have to see how to best deal with that.</p>
          <p>I always use sort of the equivalent &#x2013; I always use as a reference points here when we discuss this internally, in a way what the politicians and actually what society wants, is what the market wants. Not in all industries; it's always the case that what the market wants is by some objective measures the best thing that they should want, but you can't ignore it.</p>
          <p>I think if society in this country says we don't want nuclear, I think we just have to accept that and see that we financially make the best out of it. That's what we have to do. I think when you look at how the energy system then will most likely develop here is we will have to have a longer period where fossil plants play a role, and in particular we think gas-fired stations are technically the thing that can help address the capacity need that will pop up.</p>
          <p>We think it is fairly optimistic to assume that photovoltaic and offshore winds will allow the heavily industrialized German economy to sustain its strength. So other more reliable capacity will have to be put in place, but that's why we are saying, yes, I think we will somehow have to buy &#x2013; potentially have to bite the bullets as it relates to possible shutdown decisions.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand the fields that will most likely then look promising are renewables and gas, and those are the two areas where, quite frankly, we had our investment focus in the last three years and where we do see strong expertise, which is why I believe I said in sort of in the very beginning of my statement that we also will have to then see whether there are opportunities that we can seize as a consequence of a possible new policy. Not so sure I answered your question, but that's, I think, how I interpreted it.</p>
          <p>As it relates to Kr&#xFC;mmel, yeah, well, first of all, I can make my life easy and say you should ask that question to Vattenfall because they are in charge now. And I think that's a tricky one because Kr&#xFC;mmel by all objective safety standards is actually one of the most modern plants. I would bet that if Kr&#xFC;mmel &#x2013; if and when Kr&#xFC;mmel participates in the European safety standards, it will come out as a topnotch power plant. Yeah, I think it looks like there are other reasons why maybe society has problems with that plant in this country. Yeah, how they then translate that into objective criteria, yes, we'll have to see and thank God that's not a problem that I have to solve, but I think that that's not an easy one, yeah? But I can't tell you whether Kr&#xFC;mmel will come back or not.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Deborah Wilkens from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marcus. Two quick questions. Just coming back on that nuclear tax question, has the fact that you've not paid tax in the first quarter meant that there has been a reduction in your original expectation for the tax burden, if we just ignore the impact for the moratorium? One question. And then my other question is basically &#x2013; and hopefully, relatively straightforward, what is now your current best and worst case for that gas supply loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Deborah, your first question was whether we see a reduction in the tax burden or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically, the fact that you haven't had any payment in the first quarter, does that mean that the bill for the year has become smaller, or is that just a timing issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, yeah, no, okay, no, sorry. Now I understand. No, the bill has not come down. By the way, I think I just gave you the wrong number &#x2013; it's &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>I think what may irritate people is the payment mechanism, which I tried to explain earlier. The amount will not be, say, evenly distributed throughout the year, but it really will come at individual days. And it can then be that on a day we get a bill for &#x20AC;80 million, yeah. So let me again use the example of Grafenrheinfeld. Grafenrheinfeld has now put new fuel rods into the plant. It will likely restart end of May, early June. I think then there is a 15-day period until when the tax bill will be produced. The tax bill will cover the full amount in euros for all the uranium that was newly inserted into the plant. And you then pay that in one lump sum, which is why there can be high payments in one quarter and nil payments in another quarter. So that's why our outlook for the overall amount is not different from where we saw it in March. In fact, we had positive knowledge in March that in Q1 we &#x2013; and I, quite frankly, believe it applies to the three other nuclear operators as well &#x2013; would not pay a single euro in fuel tax.</p>
          <p>So that's the tax burden question, and your second question, sorry, I forgot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. The best and worst case for the supply loss for '11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes. Yeah, I would say by now the worst case is that we will see no further improvement, which means that we will have roughly a &#x20AC;1 billion drop in global, in the supply and sales business. That's the worst case, i.e., that's our outlook. The best case, of course, is we recover all losses in this year whether that &#x2013; well, actually, that's not correct because we have one supplier, i.e., Statoil, where we will only negotiate the volumes of the fourth quarter of this year. Is that clear enough?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... in a way, is the worst-case scenario, because ...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... what we have assumed as recovery we have secured. There will be certain losses because the Statoil volumes are not up for re-negotiation, and how much of the remaining volumes can be negotiated for 2011, I can't tell you today. But clearly there still is a substantial portion of this &#x20AC;1 billion loss or potential loss that is still under negotiation.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two very quick questions. Again, on the never-ending story of the gas contracts, you said the 25% that you did renegotiate is a mixture of structural changes agreed, and ones which only have price relief. Can you give us a split of this 25%? How much did actually see a structural change to the underlying contract? And the second question is on the power market. If, indeed, the 8.4 gigawatts that are currently closed off nuclear capacity, they don't come back, when do you see the supply/demand balance in Germany getting tight?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>On your second question, our analysis would suggest that in sort of mid of the decade '14, '15, the market gets tight. There clearly is some additional capacity coming online in the coming two, three years. There is also some capacity being shut down, and it will not be before 2014, but thereafter depending on how the demand side develops, we will see some market tightness according to our analysis.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions, please, the first one on your guidance for gas midstream. You've talked about a spread of &#x20AC;3 to &#x20AC;6 <mark type="ph" /> per megawatt hour (78:36) and suggested taking the midpoint. If you use the midpoint to the remaining 75%, so about 280 terawatt hour that implies roughly about 1.7 &#x2013; and I'm struggling to see how you would get to &#x20AC;1 billion, thanks to the remaining 25%. I don't know what I'm missing, so maybe you can clarify this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question was on the hedging for Central Europe outright generation. The numbers, in terms of percentage, haven't really moved between the end of 2010 and the end of March, and they're also relatively low compared to the historical trend for year plus one and year plus two. Can you give us some explanation? Is that your view on prices, that's a question of liquidity? Is that basically because you don't know how much you'd be able to produce, and you could be in fact more hedged that you thought you would be? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On your first question, I think the delta is that not all these volumes are, sort of, risk-exposed. There are certain volumes that are sold to customers so that they still allow for a profitable margin. So the overall exposure for the full year was not 500 times spread; it's smaller. I think I tried to explain that in our full-year results call where I was trying to highlight that about two-thirds &#x2013; 70% of that volume was exposed to the gas-oil spreads and when you then do the math you can see that those volumes that are now still at risk and multiply that with the range you get to roughly $1 billion. Yeah, so you can't take the full 500 only about two-thirds of that, then deduct 100 and then multiply it, and then you're roughly there.</p>
          <p>As it relates to hedging, I must say we have not consciously changed the hedging framework. I think it's the job of our traders to sort of optimize at the margin. Clearly, we think at this stage it is advisable to see what will really be the outcome of the deliberations in politics before you make big moves. But yes, I think in our expectations, I would say we're not entirely convinced that the forward prices already reflect &#x2013; fully reflect, really, a permanent shutdown, for example, of seven plus one plants.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just two questions. On your net income guidance today, we're pretty much, if I start from the midpoint, you're saying could be plus 10% and minus 10%. I think last year, it was plus 3% or minus 3%. So I wonder why the range is so much bigger this year. And as a follow-on question to that, do I understand you correctly that as long as the actual earnings by the end of the year end up somewhere within that wide range, your &#x20AC;1.30 DPS commitment stands?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just wanted to understand, given that you've outlined the new timeline as far as the German nuclear policy is concerned, going all the way into July, I just wanted to understand, what do you think will happen on the 17th of June, because as far as I can see, the moratorium would have run out by then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. First, on the width of the range, I think it's basically a reflection on the higher uncertainty that we see in the outlook this year. We had a debate around this, we obviously have a point budget value, but then there is more uncertainty around that. That's how I would answer that.</p>
          <p>On dividends, I'd like to confirm that, yes, as long as we are in that range, the &#x20AC;1.30 is the number.</p>
          <p>And your third question is an interesting one, maybe what happens on June 17 I think this is something that most likely the government has also spotted already that they might have a bit of a problem with their own timing. Look, I mean, we don't have to decide that today. I think we will learn a lot more until the 16th or 17th of June because I think early June the government has said that they will put forward what they think is right, and then put it up for debate in parliament. I think, also, the government ultimately always has the possibility to extend the moratorium. So, again, we don't have to take a decision today, but I think it's something that the government needs to somehow think through and come up with a solution to that. Otherwise, unless we hear differently, in a way &#x2013; I think, yeah, why wouldn't one restart the power plant?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Can I just come back on your first answer, the answer to the first question? Does that mean, if I turn your answer around, that is, as long as the net income stays below that range, there is a danger to your &#x20AC;1.30 DPS commitment?</p>

          <p>I said if &#x2013; it's a logical if &#x2013; if net income is in that range, then dividend will be &#x20AC;1.30, full stop. And so far this is our outlook and I don't want to speculate on a deviation from that.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on the Gas contract renegotiation. The contract that you've just agreed a one-year temporary solution to, is it correct to assume that those will revert to full losses in the fourth quarter this year? And is that included in your &#x20AC;1 billion estimate?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is I think in the past you've said if you have to go through arbitration you're not going to get an outcome until 2012 or even 2013 on some of these negotiations. It sounds like you're a bit more optimistic on the timeframe now. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, we cannot rule out for those situations where only a price relief for the gas year October 1st until September 30 has been negotiated, that will be some relief for the fourth quarter, but not necessarily full avoidance of losses for those where there is no structural solution.</p>
          <p>On your second question &#x2013; look &#x2013; I think all &#x2013; am I convinced that everything will be &#x2013; can be negotiated in the coming weeks? No. I think there still is a substantial risk that with some of the producers we will not come to a solution in which case and I've indicated that we would then go into arbitration, and quite frankly to some extent we actually also fear reinforced in that assessment through those deals that have been negotiated. On the other hand we are not yet in arbitration although technically speaking arbitration should have started early April with almost all the suppliers. The reason why we did not do that is, A, because the suppliers agreed that if we had to go into arbitration at a later point in time still the effective date would be October 1 of 2010 and, B, because both sides were under the impression that a negotiated solution is still possible within a reasonable time period. So in that sense, yes we are still optimistic, but I also don't want people here on the call to leave and say ooh, ooh, well everything will get sorted this year that would take it too far.</p>
