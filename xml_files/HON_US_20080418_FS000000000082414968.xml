          <p>Thank you, Luann. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me here today in Morristown, our Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website, www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year and, of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote. Dave?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Murray, and good morning, everyone. Well, it is wonderful to report another quarter of strong results for Honeywell. Sales were up 11% to 8.9 billion with organic growth across all regions. Segment profits grew 16% to approximately 1.2 billion and margins increased 60 basis points to 14% and net income grew 22%. That solid profit growth, combined with lower share count for the quarter, results in a 30% increase in EPS to $0.85 a share.</p>
          <p>You probably recognized this is $0.02 above the high-end of our previous earnings guidance and it includes over $100 million of repositioning actions in the quarter. That repositioning will help us some in 2008 and more fully in 2009. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at 571 million, which is up 25% for the quarter and more than 100 million over the prior year. So we're really pleased with our first quarter performance. We remain confident in our outlook for the year despite that tougher economic environment.</p>
          <p>We are raising our sales guidance and we are tightening our full-year EPS guidance to the high-end of our previously stated range. We now expect EPS to be in the range of 3.70 to 3.80 for this year, and that's an impressive 17 to 21% increase over last year. Overall, a great quarter of financial performance for Honeywell and we continue to be on track for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>I think it is worth spending a few minutes updating you on some of the highlights for the quarter and to reinforce some of the key themes that we believe have us well positioned for continued performance in the future. First, we really are benefiting from the diversity of our portfolio. We've got great positions in good industries and they continue to be strengthened through our acquisitions and our investments and innovations we continue to win in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Second, our mix of short cycle and long cycle businesses gives our portfolio balance and allows us to deliver consistent financial performance. And third, we continue to benefit from our strong and increasing global presence, especially our great position in emerging regions. All geographies experienced organic growth in the quarter with Asia and the Middle East continuing to lead the way with healthy double-digit growth rates.</p>
          <p>We also continue to be awarded major multi-year contracts and platforms, and that really reinforces the confidence that our customers have in our technologies, our products and solutions, and it really portends continued future growth.</p>
          <p>In Aerospace alone in the quarter, we were awarded over $27 billion of new business, including 1.5 billion from Airbus on the A350 Extra Wide Body, 3 billion from Gulfstream on the G650, and 23 billion from Embraer on their new MSJ and MLJ family of bizjets. When combined with the major mechanical systems that we secured on the A350 XWB last year, we've won over $40 billion worth of contracts, which supports our favorable long-term outlook.</p>
          <p>Next, we continue to effectively deploy our capital and that drives significant shareholder value. Our latest acquisition announcement of Norcross Safety Products is a great add to our ACS business and provides terrific growth opportunities in the attractive adjacent space of personal protection equipment.</p>
          <p>I'm confident our Life Safety team will deliver tremendous gains with this investment, as they have with all other acquisitions that they've completed. It is a great position in a good industry and we expect to do quite well with it.</p>
          <p>We expect the Norcross acquisition to close in the second quarter of this year and despite the integration, financing and accounting costs, all that stuff associated with the transaction, we see no material impact to EPS in 2008. Additionally, in the quarter we also repurchased 7.4 million shares.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're well-positioned to execute and deliver results in a tougher economic environment. The key macro drivers of our businesses &#x2013; safety, security, energy efficiency, energy generation, air travel &#x2013; all these macro trends remain favorable. And despite pockets of softness in selected end markets our portfolio overall remain strong and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments.</p>
          <p>So with that summary, let me turn call over now to Dave Anderson to go through the financials and detail for the quarter and our outlook for the year. Dave?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, good morning. Thanks, everybody, for participating in this morning.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide number 4, and let me start by just giving you sort of a summary recap of what Dave just covered, before going into the business segments and then talking more about the outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Well as we said, sales -- and as the release states, sales were up 11% in the quarter, 8% organic growth, which includes 3% benefit from foreign exchange, as you know we always break out for you those details.</p>
          <p>Sales came in about 200 million better in the quarter than we guided, driven by foreign exchange and also very strong performance from UOP. And, of course, as Dave said, we continue to benefit from the global reach of Honeywell. About two-thirds of the revenue growth that we experienced in the first quarter came from outside the United States.</p>
          <p>Segment profit was up nicely, $170 million or 16%, versus last year. Segment margin improved 60 basis points to 14%. Net income up 22% in the quarter with favorable segment profit, pension expense, partially offset by higher interest expense and, importantly, that repositioning of over 100 million -- $103 million in the quarter. And as we did throughout 2007, we're going to continue to take the opportunity to execute on attractive repositioning projects, which will benefit us for the remainder of 2008 and particularly for 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now the strong profit performance in the quarter as well as the benefit of lower share count drove earnings per share up an impressive 30% to $0.85, again $0.02 above the high-end of the range that we communicated, and again includes over 100 million of elective repositioning actions in the quarter. So in a tougher environment, we continue to execute very well and position ourselves for the future and we remain confident in our EPS outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, finally on this slide, was up $110 million or 25% to 571 million, importantly, another strong indication of operational excellence and operational discipline. Working capital turns continue to improve and are up again in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow performance represents almost 90% conversion and is around two points higher in terms of conversion in the same period last year and supports our full-year outlook to 3.2 to 3.4 billion of free cash flow that we've given you for the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, a terrific start to '08 and, as Dave said, we feel confident in the outlook for the year. We're raising our sales guidance. We're also tightening our EPS range at the high end of our previous range, taking that to -- now to $3.70 to $3.80.</p>
          <p>Let's now go through each of the segments starting with Aerospace on slide number 5. As you can see, Aerospace segment sales were up 7%, segment profit was up 13%. Importantly, margins expanded 100 basis points to 18.6%. Total commercial sales for Aero up 8% in the quarter, commercial OE was up 8 driven by continuing strong OE demand to support production of both new air transport and business jets.</p>
          <p>On the air transport side, air transport and regional OE sales were up 11%. BGA, the Business &amp; General Aviation OE sales were up 3% in the quarter -- and for BGA, mainly due to timing of shipments and a tough comparison to '07 where business jet OE sales were up 12%.</p>
          <p>Now the outlook for business jets continues to remain robust, supported by the increasingly global nature of the industry, and this is an interesting statistic, many of you know this but worthwhile noting: international buyers now account for about 50% versus just 25% in 2003 just five years ago, of the new aircraft deliveries that are projected over the next five years. And this data is really consistent with our annual business aviation outlook that we published, the NBAA survey that we published in September of 2007, really shows the purchase expectations that are up in Asia, Middle East, but also the continued rise in expectations in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now on the aftermarket side for Aero, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8%, the AT&amp;R aftermarket sales were up 6, in line with expectations and by the way also in line with global flying hours for &#x2013; which were up approximately 7% in the first quarter. The B&amp;GA aftermarket sales were up a very robust 11%, driven by increased revenues under maintenance service agreements, higher engine utilization and also the sales of spare parts.</p>
          <p>Defense and Space sales for Aero were up 5% in the quarter, due primarily to the contribution of Dimensions International and also strong performance in surface systems with the TIGER program and then also space benefiting from the Orion program.</p>
          <p>On the margin side, Aero again, very strong performance up 100 basis points, price and productivity more than offset inflation in the quarter. So, again a great quarter for Aero and as Dave mentioned, it's a business that continues to be -- build a very strong base for the future. We are just very, very proud of the wins, at Airbus, Gulfstream and Embraer in the quarter, really positions us very well. And for the full year 2008, we are reaffirming Aerospace sales in a range of 12.8 to 13 billion, up 5 to 7%, margins in the 18.7 to 19% range, so up 70 to 100 basis points over the full year of 2007.</p>
          <p>So now let's go to slide 6 and talk about another very positive story in the quarter which is ACS. You can see sales for ACS up 14%, 8% organic including 5 from FX, represents ACS's 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Now, importantly, we had balanced growth in the quarter between Products and Solutions as you can see from the slide, and I'm going to take you through a little more detail there. And orders trends continue to be positive across both these businesses.</p>
          <p>For Products, revenues were up 14% driven by growth at Life Safety and also Environmental and Combustion controls and significant growth in China, India, and the Middle East, where we continue to benefit from the investments and the increased presence that we have in these regions.</p>
          <p>Now, as expected, we continue to see softness in the North American residential markets, that's just on an ongoing story, part of our planning, part of our bottom-up guidance, ECC and Security particularly. We also saw evidence as expected of slowing in Europe in these same end markets.</p>
          <p>On the Solutions side, again 14% up in revenues in the quarter. The Process business was particularly strong with double-digit organic growth in Americas, Europe, as well as Asia. Our Building Solutions business saw continued growth in North America and Asia. However, they did see some softness in Europe, due primarily the timing of projects and we expect that to come back to us in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now again, importantly, order rates continue to be strong for Solutions, up 13% in the quarter. Overall ACS sales were up low-single digits in the US, mid-single digits in Europe, and over 20% in the emerging regions, when adjusted for acquisitions. So it really speaks again to the continuation of the strength, the broad base and positioning that we have in ACS.</p>
          <p>Another good story in the quarter for ACS was the impressive 20% increase in the segment profit, 50 basis points increase in margin to 10.3%, productivity and pricing were particularly strong showing the good progress the ACS team is making there. Dilution from acquisitions, importantly were in line with our expectations, 50 basis points of dilution in the quarter so, now on our organic basis we actually had 100 basis points of margin expansion in ACS in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now for the full year, we are raising our revenue guidance for ACS by 500 million to a range of 13.8 to 14 billion, reflecting primarily the impact of Norcross acquisition announced but obviously not yet closed. We're assuming at second quarter close and the benefit of some incremental foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Now despite the margin dilution have caused by Norcross, we are maintaining our segment margin guidance for the segment at 11.6 to 11.9%, up 30 to 60 basis-points from 2007.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to Transportation Systems. The story of TS continues to be a contrast between the Turbo business, which continues overall strong and the continued softness that we're seeing in Consumer Products Groups. I'll give you a little more color on that in a moment.</p>
          <p>Overall, as you can see TS sales were up 6% in the quarter driven by a 12% increase at Turbo and a decrease of 3% at CPG. And at Turbo, we saw a nice rebound as we expected in commercial vehicle segment and we continue to focus on the obviously the flawless platform launches in our passenger vehicle business.</p>
          <p>Now we saw some softness developed in the European production rates for passenger vehicles in the quarter, you probably saw some in the press there was flat production in Europe. However, the positive was continued increase in diesel penetration. In fact, diesel penetration was up 2 points from 52% in the first quarter of '07 to 54% this year. And we also saw in the quarter some select OEM delays in new platform launches, which will now be pushed out to 2009.</p>
          <p>So this is another data point to support our expectations for a moderating European economic environment. However, we remain bullish on the outlook for Turbo overall and we see the platform delays which are relatively modest, there's only a minor impact to '08 and corresponding positive for 2009.</p>
          <p>Now in CPG, we continue to face headwinds in the US automotive aftermarket. Volumes were down literally across the product lines as high gas prices and low consumer confidence continue to weigh on discretionary spending in the do-it-yourself aftermarket channel.</p>
          <p>Segment profit in the quarter was down 4%, for TS overall, margins were down 130 basis points to 11.7, really reflecting the CPG volume decline, inflation impacts and also the investments that we continue to make in Turbo product development to support future platform launches.</p>
          <p>For the full year '08, we are maintaining our sales guidance for Transportation at 5.1 to 5.2 billion, up 1 to 3% over in '07. However, we are lowering our expectations for margins by 50 basis points and we now expect something in the range for TS of 11.8 to 12.1 for the full year up about 20 to 50 basis points, reflecting again primarily the CPG softness but also reflecting some additional softness in terms of European economy.</p>
          <p>Now slide 8 highlights, Specialty Materials and absolutely terrific quarter for SM. Sales were up 18%. Segment profit as you can see increased an impressive 38% driving a 280 basis points improvement in segment margins. This is a slide we would like to continue to look at and focus on.</p>
          <p>Now not surprisingly, UOP had a great quarter: sales growth of 23% compared to the prior-year. UOP just continues to experience very strong demand for its proprietary technologies for both refining and petrochemical markets.</p>
          <p>Results in the quarter were particularly strong due to the timing of catalyst and adsorbents sales as well as for both new as well as reload applications. And you'll recall, and we will talk more about this in terms of the outlook for SM and UOP, but we do experience variability in the quarters and we would expect some of this to be actually pulled forward from the remainder of '08 for UOP.</p>
          <p>Now importantly, for SM we also strength &#x2013; saw strength in the other businesses, while we highlight UOP, Fluorine Products was up 12% due to favorable pricing actions, Resins and Chemicals up 24% driven by continued strong demand for caprolactam, but also the impact of higher raw materials, which has a one for one for us in terms of top-line because of our formula pricing.</p>
          <p>As discussed, segment margins for TS very strong, increased 280 basis points obviously the favorable UOP volumes, high mix of catalyst and adsorbents in the quarter, but importantly also productivity and pricing actions by the business. For the full year now 2008, we are raising SM sales guidance slightly to 5.1 to 5.2 billion up approximately 5 to 7% over last year and we're estimating segment margins to be in the 14.1 to 14.4 range, up 60 to 90 basis points reflecting mix impacts and also the flow-through of higher raw material cost which again given the formula pricing really is a one for one in terms of cost as well as top line.</p>
          <p>Well with that recap of the businesses, let's discuss a little bit now our perspective on the quarter and then the outlook for 2Q and the full year. So, let's go to slide number 9 entitled Key Market Assumptions. Now, this is exactly the same slide we showed you at our outlook call last December and again in our Investor meeting in February. And it's really a summary slide, but it's substantive because it reflects the in-depth, bottom-up analysis that we did in terms of our key markets and the assumptions that we've used to develop our 2008 plans.</p>
          <p>Now, the key assumptions here remain intact. Continued strong performance at Aerospace, selected softening in the developing markets, developed markets at ACS, continued robust demand in the emerging markets for ACS, passenger vehicle turbo performance correlated to the European economy but with diesel penetration trends continuing positive. And commercial vehicle turbos strengthening particularly rebounding off of 2007 and again UOP continuing to be quite strong in '08.</p>
          <p>So, again that's just a sort of a stage setter and it's great to think that six months after we actually pulled this slide together and about four months after five months after we delivered it to you, we look at it today and it's intact.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the next slide then, slide number 10. Just as we did at the Investor Day in February, we are showing our business segments on the left hand side and on right side we are showing our actual first quarter sales. So, whereas the prior slide showed you the overall outlook for the markets we served, this in fact is the key assumptions in terms of actuals and outlook for revenues for the company by major segment.</p>
          <p>You will note that the full-year numbers do not include the incremental impact of 2008 acquisitions. This is the same numbers we showed to you in February, for example doesn't include the Norcross benefit or foreign exchange benefit but it's meant to give you some insight in how we are tracking versus the outlook that we communicated previously.</p>
          <p>Let's just tick down a few of the key points: Again, Aerospace performance in line with our expectations; ACS, as you can see the developed markets are consistent with our view of a stronger first half versus the second half of 2008; Also, in the ACS developed markets some benefits obviously in terms of foreign exchange, greater foreign exchange benefit in that first quarter; ACS emerging markets driven by continued strength in China, India and the Middle East, and as I indicated we had recorded revenue increases in those emerging markets for ACS over 20% in the first quarter. You can see in fact shown here ACS emerging markets up 33%; PV, passenger vehicle turbo benefiting from foreign exchange but again an outlook consistent with our view of a weaker second half for European auto production; The commercial vehicle rebound as expected; and then finally UOP off to a terrific start primarily reflecting the timing of catalyst sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, overall we think the first quarter performance sets up very well for the full year and again gives us confidence in achievability of our full-year performance guidance.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to the next slide, which is the 2Q08 preview. We expect total sales in the second quarter to be approximately 9.2 billion, up 8% versus '07 and EPS to be in the range of 92 to $0.94, up 18 to 21%. You can see the highlights there in terms of each of the business segments, in terms of revenues above: Aero we anticipate to be around 3.2 billion in sales, up approximately 6% and again the themes are strong business growth, business aviation growth, flight hour growth, and in line with our assumptions for the full year 2008, aftermarket expectations of flying hours of around 5%. For ACS we expect revenues of about 3.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of 12% and another quarter of balance growth between products and solutions for ACS.</p>
          <p>At Transportation Systems we expect revenues of about 1.3 billion, up 4%, but similar trends to what we saw in the first quarter, in other words continued growth in turbo despite lower production rate expectations for European autos. In CPG we continue to be challenge by soft in-market conditions. And finally for 2Q for SM for Specialty Materials we anticipate sales of about 1.3 billion, up 7% driven by growth across all of the businesses. Overall, for the company again, reflecting our well-diversified and balanced portfolio which is helping us to drive overall strong results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, now let's go to the 2008 financial summary on slide number 12. Again, we're reaffirming our full-year expectations here, raising our revenues by 700 million approximately to 36.8 to 37.4 billion. You recall previous guidance for revenues in the 4 to 6% range increase for the year. We are now expecting in the range of 6 to 8%, reflecting primarily the contribution of Norcross and the positive impact of foreign exchange. We will now expect from a planning standpoint, we are using about a 1.45 euro to dollar relationship versus the 1.40 that we'd used previously.</p>
          <p>We are also reaffirming our margin expectations for the year at 14% to 14.3, representing a 50 to 80 basis points increase over '07 translates to a 10 to 15% increase in segment profitability to about 5.1 to 5.3 billion for the year. And as Dave mentioned previously, we're reaffirming our EPS guidance for the full year at 3.70, 3.80 which is at the high-end of our previously communicated range and represents a 17 to 21% increase for the year. And then finally, as I've stated previously, 3.2 to 3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year.</p>
          <p>So, in summary we feel pretty good looking at slide number 13. About performance for the first quarter, we had obviously some tougher economic conditions but we executed very well. We delivered a strong start to the year. We talk about the planning disciplines, it's also really a reflection of the operating disciplines, the execution focus, the cost focus in each of our businesses. It's really a tribute to the leadership team of Honeywell.</p>
          <p>We also took the opportunity, and this is just incredibly important, to launch $100 million of repositioning in the quarter. As in the past, and as we have shared with you, a very disciplined process for the review and the vetting of these projects and we're looking at attractive paybacks that will support our full-year outlook and particularly benefit '09 and '10.</p>
          <p>The major contract wins in the quarter for aero are giving us significant runway and breadth and positive outlook for future periods, again really testimony to the strength of the technologies but also what Rob and his team have done in terms of the customer facing and customer responsiveness of the organization.</p>
          <p>We continue to pursue HOS and FT initiatives. We are targeting more than 100 sites for HOS or roughly 70% of our manufacturing cost to be under HOS implementation by the end of '08. Our functional costs are targeted to be down around 5.3% of sales in total by the end of the year, that's a reduction from a level of almost 8% in 2004.</p>
          <p>We're clearly seeing the benefits of Velocity Product Development as we continue to grow faster in the markets we serve, due partly to the success of new product introductions, and again, reaffirming our EPS guidance at the high-end of the range and remaining committed to the performance track record that we have been building over the last five years.</p>
          <p>In summary, we feel very confident about our plans to deliver our EPS guidance and very confident about the outlook for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>And with that, Murray, I'll turn it over to you for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think any of us would worry about that, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I've got a question on, you have got some tailwinds this quarter. If I'm doing the math right, it looks like of the $0.19 delta in earnings, you got about a nickel in pension. First of all tell me whether I'm doing that right, because I'm pulling that off of your reconciliation. And then also, currency has to be a pretty nice tailwind for you. And basically I'm just trying to figure out what's in these operating numbers, what's &#x2013; what we can model as kind of being more sustainable as we look towards 2009, and what could be more of a timing issue, as pensions certainly could go a little bit more negative on you next year, I would guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, maybe, David, if I could just take that. Pensions, let's talk specifically about pension and then we can talk about FX as well. But I'd like to put the pension also in context. First of all, the pension numbers, we had about $40 million of benefit on a year-over-year basis for pension. When you look at pension and OPEB together and you do the math, it would translate to about $0.04 for the quarter, pretty close to what we had in terms of guidance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>But importantly, when you look at below the line &#x2013; so in other words, the spread, Scott, between segment profitability and PBT, it's basically even on a year-over-year basis. So essentially what we've done is manage all those below the line expenses to include the higher repositioning expense to basically come out even on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>With respect to foreign currency, we got clearly tailwind from FX in the quarter and it represented for us about a penny over what we had previously guided.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, but maybe, I can't recall exactly, had you previously guided a $0.02 tailwind and now you're a $0.03 tailwind, is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. That's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a little under $0.03 in terms of what we had in the quarter versus around $0.02 of what we had guided previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough, and then the one thing &#x2013; I mean clearly, UOP just had a phenomenal quarter and some of that is timing-related. I always get a little bit nervous when I see a CEO like Nancy retire, maybe leaving on the top here. She's had a nice run of course. But how &#x2013; you know refining margins are falling and the refineries are starting to have a little bit of pressure here. How much of a correlation is there to UOP results with refiner margins? Or is it more of a correlation with sweet and sour where these guys -- obviously more sour crude coming through the pipes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is several dynamics that end up playing in there, it's not just refiner margins, although that is one of them. But there's still a shortage of refining capacity in the world. And as a result of that there are a lot of projects that are still in process, still on the board &#x2013; it's not all of them end up happening. But when you look at the pipeline of projects, it's pretty extensive; as you might expect, most of them not in the US.</p>
          <p>Then there's the other dynamic that you've mentioned on the need to be able to refine heavier oils, and that's a trend that we're also seeing and it's important because refining margins have tended to be better on those heavy oils. We really see this &#x2013; we don't see a diminution in this trend for a while.</p>
          <p>And as for Nancy, yeah I agree, she did a great job for us. We weren't happy to see her retire but when you're approaching 61 and see different things you want to do and, yeah, you've done pretty well, that's &#x2013; you make those kinds of choices. And I think you'll be &#x2013; when you take a look at what Andreas has been able to do in ECC, I think there's a lot of that same opportunity in Specialty Materials and I think you'll be quite pleased with what you see ongoing there. And what we've tried to do throughout the company is for any one of the businesses, is to make sure that there is &#x2013; it's not so dependent on the leader, that if the leader moves on, that the activities that were going on don't continue. But I feel pretty confident about the legacy that Nancy left in place continuing and being added to by Andreas. And I think you'll continue to see good SM news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, for you David Anderson, when you &#x2013; you've successfully taken your capital structure up to probably more optimal levels, but you probably, in this kind of a credit environment, might be pushing up against some limits. I mean, how does &#x2013; how do you &#x2013; first of all, how do you think about that and does it impact, does Norcross and other kind of smart deals you've done impact your ability to continue to buy back stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're, first of all, very focused, as you know, Scott, on continue to improve the cash, the absolute level of cash, and continue to maintain a very high cash flow increase in conversion that we've been demonstrating, and it really starts with that. And we're very mindful, as we've said in the past, of our credit metrics and the very strong support that we've got &#x2013; received and the receptiveness in the credit markets for the Honeywell name. You saw the bond offering that we did in the first quarter, significant over-subscription of that is really testimony of that. And we'll continue to strike the right balance. As we've said before, we think this is a very good opportunity for us in the acquisition arena. We're seeing again continued rich pipeline in flow. So, I would expect that, our kind of expectation for this year would be that we would see a stronger acquisition year versus a share buyback year in terms of prioritization for Honeywell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really more of my question was what kind of additional debt capacity might you have? I mean, what &#x2013; where do you bump into some constraints here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we feel like we've got the ability to fund over the course of the remainder of the year. The acquisitions and the selective share buyback, and we'll do those, we'll do the share buyback on the basis of what actually occurs in terms of acquisitions. We have &#x2013; we feel we have the confidence in our ability to do that. I'm not prepared to share with you specific numbers in terms of debt capacity because it's going to be very much &#x2013; it depends on the location of those acquisitions, US versus non-US, it's going to depend upon the character of those acquisitions and the timing of those through the remainder of the year. But we feel confident in our ability to do that and maintain our credit standing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not afraid. So, on the repositioning, I mean, can we &#x2013; can you give us an update on sort of what you're thinking for the year now, and also just how this fits a little bit with the segment profit guidance, because the high-end of the EPS guidance didn't go up but the segment profit guidance, high-end, did? And maybe that's partly due to this, I don't know. But can you give us sort of the expectation for the year around repositioning in some of the other below the lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Certainly. First of all, in terms of the repositioning, Shannon, we'd be looking at raising our guidance. Previously, we had numbers in the 150 to 190 range, 160 to 190 range in terms of guidance. We anticipate now being north of 200. You know, 250 is probably possible depending upon the performance on the rest of the year, what's available to us in terms of repositioning opportunities. So I think it's a good point in terms of, when you look at the math of the revenue increase, the segment profit, dollar increase that we've given you in terms of revised guidance, it gives us confidence in terms of our ability to move with the high &#x2013; to the high-end of the EPS range despite the fact that we're just through the first quarter. And also from just simply a planning standpoint we've got a holding place now in terms of additional repositioning to offset that higher segment profit. And we'll do it if the projects are &#x2013; support the spending and if the business outlook or the business performance supports it as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just view that Shannon, as things are going well for us, it's a good time to be investing to make sure that when we look out to '09, '10 we're laying the right kind of groundwork there, just like you've seen us do in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean that's getting up to about $0.25 of restructuring or something. Is most of that &#x2013; is the payback pretty quick on most of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, we tend to look at projects again in a one to two year timeframe. So, you're seeing some benefit obviously in '08 from what we've already done, and we see very attractive returns for that in '09, '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on some of that &#x2013; just the margin differentials in the quarter, I mean, I know in Specialty you had the lumpiness, but even adjusting for that, that's I think by far a record for the segment margin. Is there something else also going on there that leads you to believe that you're getting more traction on margin improvement there outside of just the better mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually &#x2013; and I think Dave included some of this in his comments, but we're seeing &#x2013; as you know the Specialty Materials portfolio, you go back a few years ago, wasn't the prettiest. We've done a fair amount of work both in cleaning that up and in making each of those stronger businesses. So, when you take a look at like a &#x2013; say the big three businesses in there, UOP, the caprolactam resins and chemicals and fluorines, every single one of them performed very well based on the work we've done over the past couple of years. And, Dave, anything you want to add.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just last one from me. Given the stresses we are seeing on a number of the airlines and the assumptions around flying hour growth, how you are thinking about that and -- in terms of your assumptions for flying hour growth and how your -- the aftermarket side of your business would hold up if at least the US portion of this flying hours comes down a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the end of the day our Aerospace business is a global one. And they end up being driven as much by what's happening in Asia, Europe every place also in the world, as it is the US. The US can have an impact, but at the end of the day people are still flying and what happens at an airline causes an issue for that airline or too, but overall if people are still flying, Aero keeps going and they keep needing spares. And the biggest drivers of air travel, I don't think are going to change that much and that's the global GDP keeps growing, the world is becoming more wealthy and there's still, even with some of the cost pressures, ticket price pressure is still there. And low ticket prices drive a lot of volume and lot of flights and those dynamics don't really change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, if I could just add quickly, you know the guidance that we gave for ATR flying hours for the year, up 5%, we saw obviously stronger than that in the first quarter, up 7%. And to Dave's point and to our initial guidance we've &#x2013; our expectation has been relatively modest actually for continental US flying and significantly driven obviously by international flying and emerging market growth. And emerging markets has really been supporting global flying hours. The bankruptcies which obviously have been highly visible from a news standpoint are really pretty modest carriers. You know we look at them either individually or collectively in terms of the significance of the flying hour numbers. I think they represent less than 1/10th of 1% of just the US flying hours. So, it's really de minimis from that standpoint.</p>
          <p>And again the other headlines, take for example the headline of the Delta-Northwest merger, you're really looking at very different fleets, Delta predominantly Boeing, Northwest predominantly Airbus fleets, very different routes. As you saw some of the &#x2013; and really the analysis of the merger &#x2013; potential merger synergies, it's really, if you will, back office or G&amp;A. So we would expect continued strong performance in terms of serving both of those important customers. And again for the full year that 5% flying hour growth right now looks like it's very, very much on track, it's not even a little bit conservative in terms of what's built into our numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and, Dave Cote, I guess you feel pretty darn good you don't own a financial services company right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel pretty good to be at Honeywell. It's probably the way to put it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I want to start just with UOP, I mean you did up 23%, the guidance for the year is up five, I mean, I understand your desire to want to be conservative, but the implication is UOP is going to be flat to down the rest of the year, is that really what you're telling us, or how should we think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right, John. It's really what we're saying &#x2013; what we saw, and it's one of those things where, I think we've done a pretty damn good job of forecasting UOP for the full years. There is intra-quarter variability because what we have is pull forward at times, for example, this quarter the pull forward, particularly on catalyst reloads, that occurred at the request of customers. So we saw much more significant impact and increase in the revenues and profitability in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We'll see in the second quarter, actually somewhat of the, sort of the reverse, we'll see actually reasonable top line, but we're going to see margin pressures as a result of lapping very strong royalties, you may recall, in the second quarter of last year in UOP. So it becomes very quarter- specific, but the short answer to your question is that we do expect flat-to-modest declines depending upon the quarter for UOP for the remainder of the year in terms of what we're seeing right now in terms of forward visibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Dave Anderson, if I'm not mistaken, I think your guidance this year originally had assumed that share count was going to be flat, yet you did the 7 million of repo in the first quarter, which seems like it's going to have at least some benefit. What's your capital &#x2013; I mean are you assuming that you're going to be holding share count flat or I mean, it sounds to me like that &#x2013; there seems to me like this should provide even more cushion, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, we are anticipating flat, I think we guided to the 760, you know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...previously, John, now we would probably say it's going to be somewhere in the 755 to 760 range in terms of average fully diluted shares outstanding for the full year. And again, kind of back to my answer to Scott's question, it's going to depend at least in part on the pace and the size of acquisition activity for the remainder of the year.</p>

I'm trying to understand, Dave Anderson, how do you parse the 100 versus the original plan in the context of the 200 in the context of the 5 to 6 that you had laid out. Like how much more did you actually do versus what had been part of that plan?</p>

          <p>Well, what we have provided previously, and just for clarification, we're talking about pension, environmental, net asbestos, as well as repositioning. The sum of those items previously in terms of our guidance was in 520 to 550 range. And now we would be probably looking at something closer in the 600 to 650 range, John, as a result of the official repositioning that we have talked about. To the other numbers, just if I could quickly add, the other numbers are really on track. In other words pension is in line with our previous guidance. Environmental at 200 in line and also net asbestos at around 150 to 160 million this year is in line.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Put up the numbers and the stock can take care of itself. I wonder if you could give us a little more granularity on Aerospace margins, clearly coming through really nicely. And I'm just wondering if there's anything that stands out, whether it's kind of the OE profitability? Certainly not necessarily this quarter, but certainly over the last year or two you would have said the mix is working against you right with very strong OE versus aftermarket. But the margins have continued to go up. So just a little color on really where you're getting the lift? Does anything really stand out as leading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't point to any one thing. Mind you the Aero guys have been doing a nice job of really, I guess, reformatting that business is the way to think about it and that getting away from all the fiefdoms that existed and more of a my product focus as opposed to a customer focus. That shift taking out the bureaucracy cost that went along with it and becoming more focused on the technology and responsiveness to the customer has resulted in doing better on pricing, doing better on controlling inflation, doing a lot better when it comes to productivity and just doing a lot better when it comes to winning orders.</p>
          <p>If I had to point to any segment where I'd say we haven't benefited as much as the industry I'd would still point to defense and that's one where we're just in different markets and as a result of that over the last 4 or 5 years a lot of others have done better there than we have on the defense side. But we'll see that it's not a benefit so much as it is we won't feel as much pain on the way down, when defense spending does start to come down. But other than that, that's the way I'd say it. Dave anything you want to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just underscore your comment by saying that the combination of price and productivity was double the level of inflation for the business. So, it's really to your point in terms of way the organization is executing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a follow-up. I am personally not a huge fan of this Norcross deal, maybe I have it wrong, but....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just explain that to me because in the backdrop of what would seem to be a very target rich environment with kind of the capital markets the way they are. And the business kind of seems like an aside really. You can see how it works, but it's not really kind of a core business for you &#x2013; particularly given that we are still really focused on trying to get these ACS margins up. It feels like it could probably be a distraction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, no not at all. Here is the way I'd look at this one. If you were to look at the fire business, you would look &#x2013; and if we were acquiring the fire business you'd been looking at that and going "Jeez why, what's exciting about this prosaic product, how significant could it be, just detectors and a panel?"</p>
          <p>But the fact is there's a lot of regulation that goes around it. You really have to understand your industry. People are loathe to change when they've got somebody that they can rely on, because you need to make sure the stuff works and it needs to always be in compliance with these regulations; channel and brand mean a lot; as do new product introductions, and you have to make sure that they're in accord with that.</p>
          <p>Well, we've <mark type="inaudible" /> that the life safety business, of which fire is a part, is to look for other industries that are like that. Where are those places were you had &#x2013; where the regulation is significant; where it may seem a prosaic product but the differentiation is significantly greater than people expect; where channel and brand make a difference? And when you look at this segment of personal protection equipment, that's exactly what that is. When you look at the pictures, it looks like a glove, a boot, safety glasses, a safety uniform, respirators, but when you actually take a look at what goes into the product, the technology differentiation that's required, and the amount of regulation you have to comply with, it is a perfect model of that fire business. And what you'll see us do with &#x2013; in this segment, is the same thing that we've done in fire and it's &#x2013; this is going to be quite a winner for us. I'm actually quite intrigued with the whole space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so would this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not a case, Jeff, where we had extra money and said, gee, let's just buy stuff. This is &#x2013; this has met all our screens and even better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The math kind of seems like you are relying on some revenue synergies. Is that not the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in the financial model. We've modeled this the exact same way we have everything else. And that is that &#x2013; this acquisition is more than justified just on cost synergies, and we count on no sales synergies in our financial modeling. When it comes to sales synergies, we do expect them and we push everybody to do it because while we justify an acquisition based upon a base case model, we actually run them to an upside case model, which includes the sales synergies because we don't just want to get a double on this stuff, we want a grand slam on every acquisition that we do. That's by and large what happens and I'm pretty darn confident that's going to happen here on Norcross and that you'll see some quite impressive performance coming from us there. And this is a team; we're grafting it onto a team that executes extremely well. And I'm always loathed to add an acquisition to a business that doesn't perform well; I just don't think it makes sense. In this case, we're grafting it on to a business that performs extremely well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally then, when you're thinking about ACS, are there &#x2013; you have &#x2013; I don't know maybe a whiteboard there with these type of ideas on it. Are there a handful of these kind of sub- industries or sub-categories that are kind of in the sweet spot that you're waiting for the opportunity or was this kind of an unusual opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually you've put your finger on something that we do focus on and, it's funny you use the word sub because we use that a lot ourselves, is that rather than look at industries which can be too big sometimes and you look at stuff that's 20 or 30 billion, we've talked about looking at sub-industries. And when you think about gas detection, for example, that would be a sub-industry; when you think about the imaging business, the hand-held that we'd acquired, that's what I would call a sub-industry; when you look at what we're doing here in personal protection equipment, the very sophisticated PPE, that's a sub-industry. And we're just finding that that's a better spot to look for fragmented growing highly profitable businesses. And we've got a &#x2013; we're having a great success rate with it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you mentioned <mark type="inaudible" /> interesting. You talked about European passenger launches, of car launches being pushed out to 2009. Is that just sort of just the way it goes or is there something that &#x2013; is that because of economic weakness there? I mean, what's driving those pushbacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's a little bit of both. The &#x2013; as they look at how to spend that's a piece of it; the other piece of it is launches do generally get pushed out a bit. I'd attribute it to both and we've kind of viewed it as well, yup, I'll always prefer for '08 but that certainly gives us a nice boost to '09, which as you might imagine, we're always trying to look one or two years ahead. So, it actually kind of helps us there, it's, I'd say, a two-edged sword. It hurts in '08 but it gives us a bigger boost in '09. Dave, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; and just kind of repeat what we talked about earlier, it's relatively de minimis and it's pretty consistent with what we're seeing, in general, Dave, as we talked about which is the &#x2013; an anticipated which is European economy softening auto production rates, some of the consumer, if you will, pull data that we're seeing in terms of registrations are reflecting that. So, I think the guidance that we have given out for the full year really is reflective of that kind of environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the &#x2013; on turning to, switching to Specialty Materials, you've haircut the margin by 10 bps for the full year it sounds like that is just due to the resins mix coming through. What's driving the resins growth, is that just demand from emerging markets? I know you talked about selling into China, is that what is driving the 24% increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is, are you talking about SM in particular?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a dynamic there because of the formula pricing, as raw material costs go up and we pass them through on a one-for-one basis. You do end up with the higher material costs yielding lower margins, margin rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't mean you make less. You actually make more, but it can impact your margin rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the driver of the resins growth, is that emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really across the board. It's the caprolactam demand, where demand is exceeding supply. But it's your point, emerging markets, Nigel, are clearly contributing in that. We've cited the strength of sales to China for example on our R&amp;C business, relatively nonexistent a year ago and very strong today. It's actually exporting product to China at attractive pricing and attractive margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Two more quick ones here. You know, asbestos we have seen Bendix claims almost half last year, then you claimed almost half. When do we start to see that coming through as a benefit to the P&amp;L? And secondly just on the pension OPEB, I noticed you taken it up from 0.2 to a range of 0.2 to 0.3, what's driving that increase for the full year?</p>

          <p>Yes. We have actually seen a reduction in claims and claim values, Nigel, and that's a positive trend. We have seen a little bit higher MISO as a percent, of course that mix influences the overall expense recognition in the quarter. But in general for us the asbestos number is within the guidance that we &#x2013; range that we have provided and is consistent with the full-year expectations that we have for that. And I'm sorry I missed your second question, it was related to pension, could you repeat that?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the pension OPEB, I think on pension OPEB you originally said 0.2 billion full-year guidance and I think now the range 0.2 to 0.3. So just wondering why that's increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just tell you that in dollar amounts, the guidance that we have given is 30 to 50 million a year for pension, 140 million for OPEB, those numbers have stayed the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on the Bendix &#x2013; if its claims keep on coming down eventually that fit should be through into the P&amp;L through a lower charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, you know in the quarter we had $28 million, for example, of asbestos that would compare to an average quarterly run rate at $40 million if you took our original annual guidance of 160 million. So we did see some favorability in this quarter relative to that full-year guidance.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Nigel. So I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to wrap things up.</p>

          <p>Going back to what we said at the Investor Day, we tried to make the point that this was no longer a company that you should look at and just say "Gee, can I get another year out of Honeywell?". We really have put the time and effort over the last five or six years to position our portfolio in a way that would benefit from industry trends, macro trends that would favor us. And we've also tried to put in all those processes that make the operations better every single day.</p>
          <p>So, the first quarter is not a fluke, this is one those things that has come about because of our conservative thought process, putting ourselves in the right positions when it came to where did we see industries going, and from doing a better job every day when it came to our operating processes. And we're quite pleased with how the quarter went, but I would also say this is not the last time that you'll be able to hear something like this from us. I really think that when it comes to looking at your investment in Honeywell this is going to look the part of your long-term portfolio and that you'll end up saying it was a smart thing to do.</p>
          <p>So, thanks for listening and nice sharing good news. Bye bye.</p>
