          <p>Good morning and welcome to Philip Morris International's first-quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Philip Morris International. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release, which contains detailed information on Philip Morris International's 2008 first quarter results. If you do not have a copy, you may access one on our website at www.pmintl.com. Following the completion of the spin-off, historical, basic and diluted earnings per share amounts have been recalculated based on the actual number of shares distributed by Altria Group Inc. on the distribution date. As a result, we have provided in today's news release a reconciliation of 2007 reported results to 2007 pro forma adjusted results by quarter and for the full year on the Schedules 5 through 9.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, our 2008 EPS growth rates will now be compared to $2.79 per share versus $2.78 per share. Today's remarks contains forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement at the end of today's news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer for Philip Morris International. Hermann?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. It is a great pleasure for me to host the first conference call of the newly independent Philip Morris International. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and we are delighted to meet many of you during our road show in March. In our March 11 presentation, we shared with you our longer-term annual growth targets of 4 to 6% growth in net revenues with 1 to 2% volume expansion, 6 to 8% in operating income growth and 10 to 12% EPS growth rates on a constant currency basis. In January, we issued EPS growth guidance of 12 to 14% for 2008 off a base of $2.78. Since then we have witnessed further decline in the value of the U.S. dollar and accordingly we today increased our EPS guidance to reflect our business momentum and current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 full-year EPS guidance now stands within the range of $3.18 to $3.24, representing growth of 14 to 16% from a revised pro forma adjusted base of $2.79. This new guidance includes the marginally positive impact of the acquisition of Interval and other OTP trademarks from Imperial. It also includes an increase in brand building expenditures in some key markets to accelerate growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you our strong first-quarter results. Diluted earnings per share were $0.89, up 29% or $0.20 per share. Of this increase $0.11 per share reflects the strength of our business and favorable currency accounts for the balance of $0.09 per share. Net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were 14.1% higher at $6.3 billion representing an increase of $781 million. After adjusting for currency, net revenues increased by 5.4%, primarily reflecting improved mix and higher prices. Net revenues increased in all four regions and in the vast majority of our top 25 OCI markets.</p>
          <p>Reported operating companies income or OCI were 31.7% higher at $2.8 billion in the first quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the favorable impact of currency, acquisitions and the U.S. Duty Free business, OCI increased by 17.5% compared to 2007. This very positive result was driven by improved volume and mix in all the regions except the EU. Higher prices of the economy in the EU and EEMA reduced administrative costs and the expected skew through the remainder of year and the timing of some promotional marketing and overhead expenses. OCI growth, net of currency was very broad based across most of our markets, this particularly strong growth recorded in Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. PMI's cigarette shipment, volume increased by 2.2% or 4.6 billion units to 218 billion units driven by Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico and Russia, as well as by the positive impact over our acquisitions in Mexico and Pakistan.</p>
          <p>Excluding acquisitions and the U.S. Duty Free business, first-quarter volume declined by 0.5% or 1.2 billion units due mainly to the continued overall market declines in the EU and Japan. In terms of market share, we made progress in many of our top 25 OCI markets, including Argentina, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine. In Poland and Turkey, while we lost share in the lowest price categories, we improved our mix and substantially increased our profitability.</p>
          <p>Marlboro shipment volume declined by 1.2% to 7.3 billion units. This growth in the EEMA, Asia and Latin America regions offset by a decline in the EU. On a like-for-like basis excluding the US Duty Free business, Marlboro volume declined by 0.6%. Outside the EU, Marlboro volume increased by 3.7% driven by strong performance in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. Marlboro Filter Plus, Marlboro Intense and new menthol variants are helping to reenergize the brand in key markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to work on the repositioned L&amp;M in Eastern Europe and are encouraged by the positive developments in the renewal of the brands' smoker base, with an improved age and gender profile. Nevertheless, L&amp;M shipments continue to decline in the first quarter, though volume trends remain positive in the EU region. As we explained during the road show, repositioning of L&amp;M in Eastern Europe is not a short-term exercise, but will take time before positive results are reflected in volume trends. The decline in L&amp;M in Eastern Europe has been largely offset by the very strong performance of the higher-margin Chesterfield, which grew by 18% during the first quarter. The brand is doing particularly well in Russia and Ukraine, but it is also performing strongly in such markets as Italy and Spain. When our other key international brands continue to perform strongly, I would like to highlight the continuous positive development of Poland. Volume increased during the first quarter by 19%, thanks to Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine and we are further expanding the brand geographically to build on this momentum. Parliament, with its unique taste and defined packaging occupies a special place in our portfolio, positioned in many market at the premium price to Marlboro and generating superior margins.</p>
          <p>Let me now comment on key specific developments in our four business segments. I will begin with the EU region, which remained PMI's most profitable region and was the single largest contributed to PMI's reported OCI growth, with an increase of $279 million to $1.3 billion, driven by favorable currency and higher pricing, partially offset by negative volume mix. Excluding currency, OCI in the EU region increased by 9.8%. OCI was only down in one of our most important markets in the EU region, namely France, where our volume and share declined, we believe temporarily. As a result of Marlboro moving above the round price point of 5 Euros.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight in terms of positive OCI developments in the EU, our continuous profitability growth in Italy, our strong recovery in Spain and markedly higher OCI in Poland. This strong profitability was achieved in the context of another extraordinary estimated total regional cigarette market decrease of 5.5%. This decline was driven by higher retail prices across the region, the implementation of further smoking restrictions in France, Portugal and most German states, as well as trade inventory movements in the Czech Republic. Results in the EU during the first quarter of 2008 highlights our ability to successfully grow profitability in challenging circumstances.</p>
          <p>PMI's EU shipment volumes reached 62.8 billion units, a decline of the 3.9 billion units versus 2007, largely reflecting the overall market decline. PMI's overall estimated market share reached 38.8% in the first quarter as positive developments notably in Belgium, Italy and Netherlands and Spain, were more than offset by share declines in France and Poland and the impact of the aforementioned trade inventory movements. Marlboro share was down slightly during the quarter, though there was a sequential improvement compared to the 2007 fourth quarter share. Turning to key markets, our strong performance continued in the first quarter of 2008 in Italy. Our market share was up 0.5 points to 54.7, driven by Chesterfield, Merit and our local heritage brand Diana, partially offset by a decline in Marlboro share, which we are addressing through innovative line extensions, such as the recently launched Marlboro Compact, a product similar in concept to the Marlboro Intense launched in Turkey, but lighter in taste.</p>
          <p>In Germany, total industry shipments were down 2.7% in the first quarter and PMI's reported share declined by 0.2 points. However, adjusted for competitive inventory changes, we estimate that our cigarette share was up 0.9 points, with L&amp;M now gaining share predominantly from other low-priced brands, rather than consumer down trading. We also performed strongly in the fine cut segment with a quarterly share of over 12%, largely driven by innovation.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the total market was up by 5%, following the weak January 2007 sales, driven by a tax and price related buildup of trade inventories at the end of 2006. Our market share was slightly higher at 31.8% behind the strong portfolio across all key price segments, with Marlboro and Chesterfield gaining share. Profitability is also recovering strongly. As mentioned, our business in France has come under pressure, after increased retail prices last year.</p>
          <p>However PMI's total market share has sequentially stabilized compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Thanks to the strong performance of Phillip Morris Filter Kings. We believe that over time, consumers will adjust from the new pricing environment and we are taking steps to further enhance the equity of Marlboro. We are also reinforcing our position in the French fine cut market through the acquisitions from Imperial of the segment leader, Interval. In the EEMA region, we achieved excellent results in the first quarter, helped in part by a favorable comparison to the 2007 first quarter. Net revenues, excluding excise taxes rose 20.8% and grew 11.8%, excluding currency. Shipment volume in EEMA increased by 2.9%, the 75 billion units as we gained volume and market share in the key markets of Russia and Ukraine, continued our growth momentum in Egypt and reinforced our penetration of two markets, which we have entered more recently, namely Algeria and Bulgaria. Reported OCI in the EEMA region, increased by $275 million during the first quarter to reach a level of $792 million driven by higher volume and pricing, a positive product mix and favorable currency.</p>
          <p>This represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 39.7% and 31.6% excluding currency. These results reflect increased profitability across all our Eastern European and Balkan markets as well as other geographies such as Egypt and Turkey, to name just two. Russia shipment volume was up 7.8% in the quarter. Thanks to a favorable comparison vis-&#xE0;-vis quarter in 2007 and our improved underlying business performance. Both net revenues and OCI expanded at the fast pace.</p>
          <p>Our high-end portfolio of Parliament, Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Chesterfield and our infrastructure and scale position us very well in terms of business fundamentals at the time when the Russian economy and consumers in large cities are benefiting from continued economic growth.</p>
          <p>Marlboro recorded double-digit volume growth during the quarter and its market share was up. We are particularly pleased by the progress of the innovative Marlboro Filter Plus, which we introduced in key cities during the second half of 2007. The brand has already achieved the market share in Moscow, some 1% and consumer reach -- research indicates a very positive impact on the perception of the whole brand family.</p>
          <p>The key driver of our continued volume growth and share expansion in Ukraine was Chesterfield, which grew volume by over 30% in the quarter. Overall, PMI's quarterly share reached a record level of 34.7%. Our profitability in Turkey surged over 30% during the first quarter, thanks to higher pricing and an improvement in our brand mix. The share of premium brands in our portfolio was up from 39% in the first quarter of 2007 to 44% this year. Parliament is performing very well, this volume up over 25% in the gain of almost of one-market share point. Egypt also merits special attention, as it is an excellent illustration of PMI's ability to grow volume, share and profitability in emerging markets. The market has grown 2% a year since 2002 to reach 75 billion units last year. Our portfolio is made up of premium-priced Marlboro and Merit, mid-priced L&amp;M and low-priced Next.</p>
          <p>All four brands are performing well, which enabled us to achieve the first quarter market share of 13.5% in the share of the international segment in excess of 75%. Our business in Asia has been strengthened by acquisition and the robust performance of our brands in such markets as Indonesia and Korea. This has helped to offset the challenging environment in Japan, where the overall market is declining, pricing flexibility is limited, Marlboro share has lagged our growth expectations and Lark has been under pressure.</p>
          <p>Reported OCI in Asia was up by a strong 24.5% in the first quarter to $584 million, driven by favorable currency, higher prices and positive volume mix. Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI increased by 17.5%. There were positive developments in nearly all markets led by Australia, Indonesia and Korea, with the key exception being Japan. Net revenues excluding excise taxes were up 10.2% and 6% excluding currency. At 57.1 billion units, shipment volume was helped by the 5 billion unit contribution of Pakistan. Shipment volume was up 10% and 0.4% excluding acquisitions.</p>
          <p>PMI's market share increased in Korea and Thailand, remained stable in Australia and declined in Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines. Marlboro volume increased in Asia during the first quarter and Parliament and Virginia Slims also showed positive trends. The Japanese markets declined by 3.6% in the first quarter but is down 4.3% on a 12 month moving average basis. We are expecting this trend to continue during the year and we might see some temporary disruptions from the introduction of age verification systems for vending machines. PMI shipment volume in the first quarter was down 4%. Our 23.9% share during the first quarter in Japan was off 0.8 share points primarily due to Lark. We have the programs in place to correct this going forward though we expect the recovery to be gradual. We are addressing Lark through the roll out initially in the eastern part of Japan of Lark Classic and Lark Menthol X was launched during the quarter with encouraging early results. The brand family is being supported as of May with an event marketing campaign.</p>
          <p>In addition, Marlboro Ice Mint is performing well in the menthol segments and we have another -other innovative initiatives in the pipeline in order to accelerate Marlboro's growth going forward. We are confident that all these initiatives should help grow our market share in Japan. In Indonesia, shipment volume increased by 5.6% in the quarter and profitability was strong, though our market share was off slightly to 28%.</p>
          <p>Marlboro kretek continues to perform well and provide an overall boost to the whole brand family. Marlboro's share in Indonesia increased by 0.3 share points during the first quarter to 4.2% and we have launched A Volution, the first kretek offering in a super slims form. Korea was the first market that we introduced Marlboro Filter Plus. It continues to provide a stimulus to the overall franchise, with Marlboro's total share up to 4.5%. Parliament and Virginia Slims are also gaining, and late last year we introduced a local heritage brand called Lim.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by regional review with Latin America. At the $152 million, the reported OCI was up 72.7% and 54.5% excluding currency and acquisitions. This increase in profitability is attributable to higher pricing. The impact of acquisitions of local trademarks in Mexico and positive volume-mix developments in Argentina and Mexico, partly offset by difficult trading conditions and distortions related to the January 2007 tax structure change in Colombia. Net revenues excluding excise taxes increased 10.8% and 6.9% excluding currency and acquisitions. Shipment volume was 5.6% higher at 23.2 billion units, but essentially stable after taking into account the contribution of 1.3 billion units from our acquisition in Mexico.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis, Marlboro shipments increased by more than 5% to over 10 billion units as the brands gained share in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Mexico is our most important market in Latin America. Our profitability was up substantially during the first quarter as we gained share, achieved higher pricing and benefited from our recent acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our quarterly share reached a record level of 67% with Marlboro, Benson &amp; Hedges and Delicados all growing. We also successfully expanded our business in Argentina. Our share reached 70.7% in the first quarter as both Marlboro and the Philip Morris brand continued to perform well, thus helping to drive a double-digit increase in profitability. To sum up, PMI achieved very strong first quarter results by a number of measures. EPS growth was 29%. Net revenues excluding excise taxes increased in all four regions and were up 5.4% excluding currency.</p>
          <p>Operating companies' income was also up in each of the regions and was up a strong 17.5%, excluding currency, acquisitions and U.S. Duty Free. Our innovation pipeline is beginning to generate encouraging results, there's more to come in the months ahead. The acquisition of Interval and other OTP trademarks will strengthen our position in a growing and profitable category and will provide us with an attractive economic return.</p>
          <p>We will begin our two-year $13 billion share repurchase program in May. While we expect our marketing and promotional spending, notably behind new initiatives, we will be skewed towards the remainder of the year. We are confident in our ability to deliver the 2008 EPS growth rates outlined in our revised guidance today. We have in place the strategies, the brands and the people to deliver against our commitment to achieve superior returns for our shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will be pleased to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Judy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question is just in terms of your operating growth behavior in the first quarter. I mean clearly we saw a huge operating leverage, with constant-currency revenue up 5.4%, but operating profit up close to 17%. Can you just talk a little bit about what is &#x2013; what's driving that whether it's the timing of some of the cost savings? You've mentioned the promotional spending being more skewed to the back half of the year. Can you just quantify how much that really affected the first quarter and how we think about that for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's of course, I mean as you said, I think it is a combination of all of the above. Yes, we had pricing in the quarter. We had most importantly improving business fundamentals in our overall business, I think in all of the four regions, as you can see by the growth in both net revenues and also operating companies' income. There is some cost skewing towards the remainder of the year, spending skew towards the remainder of the year. Our cost measures that we have taken essentially all across the cost categories are bringing their results in as well. So it's all of the above. So it's an extraordinary quarter, but also if you take it for the year as expressed by our new guidance we have set forth strong growth for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just and following up on that -- just in terms of what is embedded in your guidance as far as the currency is concerned? How much impact are you looking now for the remainder of the year? And does that assume that the currency stay at the same rate today or how you're thinking about that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me -- I think it's basically if I describe to you a little bit the elements. That's went into our new guidance, what did we consider in here. It's actually four elements that went into our consideration. The first one is of course the currency and the favorable currency tailwinds that we see, however I would also like to say it's just April 23 right now and there are a couple of months to come throughout the year. The second point really is that the -- our business momentum improved fundamentals and our business momentum that we see really across our businesses and we can go later into specific markets how they are doing. The third element is also that we want to do some reinvestments into some of our key markets. There is also an opportunity to do so and we will do that in order to accelerate future growth. So there is an investment part going into the equation, if you like. And the fourth element is really some expenses as I said skewed towards the remainder of the year. Then we took all those four and this is how we come to 14 to 16% EPS growth for the year, so it's a mixture of the four elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just my final question, looking at the EU region, can you quantify how much the trade inventory distortions in Czech and Germany impacted your shipment numbers in the first quarter. And secondly, are you surprised at all by the magnitude of the overall market decline following the price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean if we start there -- really it's giving some color on the EU market decline. There is really one effect in there, which is enormous, which is the one of the Czech Republic. If you take out of the total market decline of 5.5% in the EU, the Czech effect, then you're down to 1.9% and we're back to what we believe going forward in the mid-term is the market rate decline for the EU region between 1 and 2%.</p>
          <p>So the Czech situation may be I should describe a little bit what's going on there because it's such a specific and a bit strange situation. Total market in the Czech Republic in the first quarter is actually down by a dazzling 75%. I mean this is a strange situation and is actually what I would call a prime example of undesired effects of a somewhat inconsistent fiscal policy in the country. You don't have efficient forestalling regulations in the market, which means that you can have old tax old-priced products in the markets, with durations anywhere between six and 12 months beyond the date of an excise tax change; that doesn't make a lot of sense. Is of course, also have competitive consequences in such a market.</p>
          <p>The smaller you are, the higher your durations tend to be, because you have smaller volumes. So on your brands, you can have longer duration. You're at a certain disadvantage if you are big like we are in the market. So these are all the distortions, but if something is distorted at such a magnitude, I think that also can give us the confidence that this is bound to change. It might need a transition. It might not change in one go, but it's bound to change. So that is really the most important point to get back to the EU market decline that really has had an impact there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of housekeeping questions. First if I may, Hermann the first one, do you have any color in terms of what CapEx and free cash flow were for the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are on target for our free cash flow targets for the year. So there is nothing unusual. We are perfectly within the guidance that we have given before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you give us an -- how much of the cost-cutting was already realized in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean, we of course see the benefits of our measures, administrative, procurement, operations -- productivity everywhere. Going forward, I mean what we intend to do is actually I mean, to give an update on our cost programs say once a year, not really every quarter, as would probably would be just too much of a detail and you have the swings between the quarters, but really to the essence of your questions, are we on target for our cost savings and productivity improvements, yes we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my real questions here, Hermann. Number one, in terms of the reinvestment that you referred to later on this year. Can you give us a little bit more specifics in terms of what you plan to do and the dollar impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Okay. I mean of course I have to be a bit careful here for our competitive reasons. Let's agree that I give you one example, which is a pretty obvious one, which is Japan. We all remember the situation in Japan that we had the Marlboro take back at the time, we had the distribution focus of our company at the time. There was tremendous profitability increase at that time, also driven by that. We somewhat missed out in the marketing part. We have a new management in place that is really focused on the marketing and on the refilling of the innovation pipeline. So that's really what we want to support. So if you like in Japan I would say, we have put both the human but also the financial resources to correct the situation there and we will invest in where we have our issues. We have our number one issue in Japan, which is Lark. There are two things right now and there is more to come, that is the launch of Lark Classic, out in a part of the market but that's bound to be rolled out to the entire market. There is the support by a really new campaign for the entire franchise that is Marlboro Menthol X launch out there which is performing well. As you know the Menthol segment is a key segment, the key growth segment in the Japanese market. We're out there also in the Marlboro side, with Marlboro Ice Mint. We have more to come there. This is a very competitive segment. So I of course won't say it, what exactly it's going to be but there is more to come on our franchise. So I think these are the areas -- the problem areas if you like and this is of course then also where the money goes the last point maybe to mention which is that the implementation of age verification on the vending machines. That certainly will trigger some changes in the consumer purchasing pattern and that also needs support in terms of sales force distribution, but also in terms of money. So that will be an example of where that's the reinvestment money goes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just as a follow up on Japan then Hermann, given these secular threats in consumption declines, do you see any opportunities on the smokeless side over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes look, I mean as highlighted by our acquisition of Interval, we consider ourselves to be a tobacco company. We always look at all alternatives, but I think for now we always should concentrate on the problem at hand, which really is the decline of Lark and the missing growth Marlboro is stable. The missing growth of Marlboro in Japan as that I would say, we should focus and we will focus on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question, Hermann, if I have my numbers correct using your $0.46 in dividends for the quarter, I annualize that and I look at the share price. Obviously the share price will be up this morning, but I'm coming out with less than 4% dividend yield, which we would see at the lower-end particularly compared to the U.S players out there. When can we expect the dividend payouts to go up particularly, if you look at your very strong balance sheet even after share buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think there we have to stay with the facts, the facts are that we've an annual rate of 184. We had $0.46 for the quarter. The other fact is that we have payout ratio of 65% and the rest is entirely up to the Board and is a Board decision including the timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When is the next Board meeting Hermann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are seven Board meetings throughout the year and if you refer to the after-effect is they had that in August, but that doesn't mean anything on PMI. This is a new Board and the new Board will decide to that question in its entire discretion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just my final question, if I may, Hermann. Obviously you have been a big beneficiary of uptrading in the emerging markets. Now let me be for one second a little bit more skeptical. If people are concerned about the weakness in the US filling over to other markets and you would see a slowdown in the growth rates in the emerging markets, is there a risk that this whole uptrading trend may slow down or in a worst scenario would actually reverse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are two elements in here I think in your question, I mean the first one is that I believe we are in a wonderful position with our premium skewed portfolio to benefit from uptrading in emerging markets. So that is a positive for the entire company. Now of course I mean driven also by the question of rising food prices and so on and so forth could that have eventually some impact on the disposable income of consumers in the emerging markets. Yes that cannot be excluded. I mean that is happening as we speak in Indonesia, but I really have to tell you we don't see any impact on our brands, on our sales from that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you so much, Hermann.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just had a couple of questions for you. And my first one was just to kind of go back to the question I think Fillippe has asked, what about cost saving. Is it reasonable to assume that you -- in the year you have launched a third of those which you outlined for the three-year program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look I mean, it is a three year program we have started the activities which are the basis for the ability to generate those savings already last year and the year before. So these are ongoing programs, overall yes, we will deliver that at a constant pace over the years. It's coming in. The progress &#x2013; the programs are on track everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to go back to, I think that number you gave in your remarks I think you said that Marlboro volume outside of the EU is up 3.7%, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is obviously a very big performance, I'm just curious within that, is there -- you've got a lot of new products focused on Marlboro, you've seen a lot of benefit from those new products, or is this more sort of base business growth with a little kicker if you will from the new products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean the new products and the refilling of the pipeline are really key to the innovation strategy. So if you talk Filter Plus, if you talk Intense, Ice Mint or if you talk Marlboro kretek in Indonesia, these are on the one side new offers extremely attractive for the consumers. That is one thing. But you also do have a halo effect by -- driven by innovation on your entire franchise. So it's good from both perspective, and if you look a little bit into the regional or into the markets, well -- go to Indonesia. There, you have Marlboro kretek doing very well. It is actually we are in the process of expanding distribution to the entire territory of Indonesia. It's doing well and at the same time, we see a renewed growth for what we call their Marlboro Light or either Marlboro traditional. Korea, a little bit of the same thing Marlboro Filter Plus, Marlboro itself also growing to 4.5% market share. Russia, Ukraine I would again say Filter Plus helping in that growth, but also again reenergizing the franchise. You go to Mexico and here you have Marlboro Lights, who is doing very well in the market. So it is both, it is good, it is generating volume by itself as a line extension. But it is bringing news value, energy to the entire franchise and that is how you go about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And then the last question I had for you is just on your marketing reinvestment, the incremental investment. Is that primarily focused on your problem markets, or is it more about generating growth in some of the faster growing markets? So you're trying to fix some problems, are you trying to sort of accelerate growth in some markets with that money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is both. I mean we don't only want to fix the Japanese problem, we also want to grow it. So it's both and this is how you go about investments whether you have problems, but also and maybe even more importantly whether you have growth opportunities, and actually Japan is an example for both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Adelman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few things, Hermann. First of all, I think in '03 when there was a conscious decision to increase investment internationally, the company quantified the spending. Are you willing to do that this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am afraid I am not willing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, Hermann broadly speaking, what's the risk that your incremental spending damages some of the competitive piece that's broken out in so many of these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean of course, the markets are always competitive and our spending is there to improve our situation and that's what we are really are concerned about. And this is what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you are not unduly concerned about a response to your higher spending levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean we do what is good for our company and to strengthen our competitive position, I can't answer for the other companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, Hermann and this was asked before, but let me ask it again. There is such a remarkable improvement in the operating metrics of the company looking at sort of organic volume growth versus local currency operating profit growth. Can you go through again sort of the major dynamics that are resulting in such better performance coming into this year than you enjoyed even in the second half of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, look, I think we really we see here the key elements &#x2013; oh, okay, there's a beep now in the line here. Okay. Can you hear me, all right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can hear you fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Okay, look, I mean what we see here is really I would say the confirmation that -- of what we have said during the road show where we believe we are going and where we believe we can deliver and we will deliver. I mean there is an overall improvement in the business fundamentals. We did not see -- really the disruptive type of excise increases that trigger all of the undesirable consequences that these do. So we see that governments are more conservative here if you like. Or applying those increases in a more rational manner. So that's what's working well. That is an important element. On the other side I would say, while we still have a lot of work to do going forward and we are doing that work. You see that our innovation pipeline begins to be filled up. It is improving and we are getting things out of the gate here, still room to improve and we will improve further and you will see more. But I think these are main elements and in the emerging markets, well we are performing well. We are doing well in terms of market share. We benefit from uptrading in those markets which is the strength of our portfolio. And look, we have -- as we all know, we have seven out of the top 15 brands in the world and even if you look at one of our problems that you clearly have which is L&amp;M in Eastern Europe, yes, we have a problem there and you know what we have done there, revamped the product, the pack, and the campaign and we are really positive that this is going to show results. At the same time indeed I come back to my seven brands out of the top 15. You have Chesterfield &#x2013; another mid-priced brand, actually priced slightly above L&amp;M in those markets which is growing tremendously and helping there. So it's the broadness of our portfolio and the strength of our portfolio that also helps us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Hermann two last things. In Japan with the vending change in that market, what's the risk that the business sort of relives the situation in Germany that you suffered through last year being over shared relative in vending versus convenience stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are two elements to this. First our vending -- we are not over proportionally present in vending share. Actually our share in C-stores is higher than in vending. So the second part of the answer is of course what will be the changes in consumer behavior and purchasing patterns in the market. That's difficult to predict. We will see some changes, and some skews towards the C-stores in the market. To what extent, that is difficult to see right now. But the specific problem we have in Germany, we don't have in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, Hermann in Germany, are you lobbying for increase in the minimum tax size to 26?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean there is certainly something that would make sense. There is something that I believe the government is considering. It's at the end of the day, a governmental decision. We certainly support it, but let's see what the decision is going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That would be a nice precursor to a price increase, my comment not yours. Bye. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jon Fell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing I wanted to ask about was, to more of the reason behind the kind of outsized gain in operating income in the first quarter. Looks to me like first quarter, the proportion of marketing, admin and research cost to net sales dropped by about 300 basis points versus where it was last year? So I'm just wondering how much of that is cost savings stuff and how much of it is just due to timing of your marketing budgets? And what would you expect to happen for that figure for the full year versus last year. Are we going to see it -- an ongoing decline in that charge line as a proportion of sales for '08 or is it going to be broadly similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, there are three things in there. I mean of course, there is the cost saving part in there, there is the second part, which is as we said of some expenses skewed towards the remainder of the year. But there are also some favorable comparisons in there. So last year where we had a couple of one-timers, which we don't have this year. So is those three things in total and the cost skewing throughout the remainder of the year will of course remain throughout the year or it's just the fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a proportion of sales, would you expect that line to be broadly flat or can it decline because of the cost savings element?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean our cost savings are in there. It comes back essentially there to the guidance question, I think there are all of these elements in there. There are our cost savings in there, our productivity in there, but there are also the reinvestments in there and if you take it all together, this is what brings us to the new guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Second question, just on your business model and relationship with the 2008 performance to that, particularly as it relates to volume growth, because I think organic volume growth, the first quarter down 0.8%. You flagged that '08 is going to be a difficult year but that you would hope to be hitting your 1 to 2% volume target in future years. I'm just wondering how you see that as a business and what the reasons for that would be? Is it because you are going to see a slowdown in the rate of decline in the total European market? Is it because you're going to accelerate share within the EU or is it because you expect an acceleration in volume growth in other parts of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first I mean, the real -- the organic number that you should look to is not minus 0.8, it's minus 0.5 because you really have to deduct also there the U.S Duty Free business, which was in our numbers last year and is not in our numbers this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's 0.5. It is actually therefore perfectly in line with what we've said previously, i.e., a slight decline still in 2008. Going forward, look-- I mean we spoke before on different questions about our innovation pipeline and what we're doing for our key brands: Marlboro but not only Marlboro also the other seven. And there also as you can see in the news release, we have nice growth rate on a lot of our other brands. Parliament is doing extremely well, Chesterfield is doing extremely well, Virginia Slims is growing. So that are good signs for our portfolio and for our innovation pipeline across our brands and that's what makes us believe that we can improve and will improve market share performance and I would not just link that just to a region. This is on a market-to-market basis but if you like across the world. The other part of your question is of course the question of the market declines. In the EU, as I said, take Czech out which is really a special situation. You are at minus 1.9. You are within the 1 to 2% market decline that to we see for the European Union and I believe also if you go to Japan, the other important market where we see declines, I think it's going to be the 2 to 3% that we -- as we said during the road show. I think that's what's you see going forward there. As it sharper right now I think that's going to come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the share loss that we have seen in Japan in the last quarter I mean it did seem to accelerate slightly from what we were seeing at the end of the last year. Is there any particular competitive activity that is causing that or have you taken the gas off Lark a bit in advance of relaunching it. What was your explanation for that would you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really I mean to be very frank with you, Lark is a problem. I mean our market share loss in Japan is principally related to Lark. Marlboro is essentially stable and Marlboro is essentially stable, so it's really Lark, where we have to decline. We are doing what you believe we have to do which is skew towards two trends if you like.</p>
          <p>One, Menthol is very important in the Japanese market. That is Lark Menthol X. There we have done something and then, you also have to cover more or let me call, the more traditional, more conservative side of your smoker base, which is not Menthol, which is full flavor, that is the Lark Classic. And overall your performance in the market is also linked to campaigns. We come up with our event campaign for the entire franchise. So we focus very much on it, but while the situation is the situation it is, but we work on it, we work on it very hard and we believe that driven by what I said before and more initiatives to come, we can turn it around.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Christine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick follow ups if I could. Your top line growth currency neutral 5.4%. If we look at your reported volumes of 2.2, suggest real price growth of 3.2. I just want to understand I'm looking at that correctly. Given fewer disruptions in the excise taxes, can you talk a little bit about, firstly what the underlying price contribution was as well as the mix contribution or in fact took away. And secondly, is that a good formula going forward? Should we see that kind of amalgamated price mix growth on the top line on a currency neutral basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, okay. I mean if you take currency out then, really I mean, you will see that the improvement of the business performance is highlighted by the numbers that you've seen. There is actually quite a bit higher than the currency variance, which is only 255 for the quarter. The business performance of course consists of various elements. It's clear that the pricing variance is an important part of that, and actually that's a positive, I would say but it's also clear that it's not the only part in there. There is cost as a part in there, but there is also improved performance in there, which is expressed by an improvement in the volume mix. And the volume mix is positive in three regions and is negative in one region, which of course is the one where it's down is the European Union region. So that's a bit of parameters in the gain here and they all play together. But look, I see improvements if you like in all of them. Pricing is important that's good, that's normal. If you like, we're going to keep on looking at our cost and we will work on our innovation pipeline across the brand which is the volume mix. And I think we see some improvements there, we clearly see actually some improvement there in the volume mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And moving just to two market questions. Firstly in Russia, there was a nice pick up in market growth there and given some easy comp. I'm just trying to understand your perspective of what you think a normalized growth rate might be in Russia in the intermediate term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look I mean the Russian market is actually very difficult to measure to be frank with you. It is growing; to what extent it is growing, it is difficult that is not such a precise measure. But it's one of the emerging markets that is growing. What is more important for us in there actually is the uptrading potential that the market has, where you clearly can see that -- I mean starting this Parliament, there's Marlboro, also there's Chesterfield where this is of course a very attractive market for us and we are doing pretty well. You are right, also with your comment that we have -- there are some easy comps to the first quarter in Russia that's true. On the other hand that shouldn't distract us from the point that Russia is a very good story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And final question Hermann is on China. Can you just update a little bit on the progress there and what you see in the remainder of the year in both the export business as well as Marlboro within China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In China we are really absolutely on track, also compared to what we've said during the road show. So we expect on the domestic market the launch of licensed product -- produced volume Marlboro in China, actually the summer of this year. This is going to come. We are on track on this one. On the international venture, RGD has been launched in the Czech Republic. It's a very successful launch. We've done consumer offtake tests in some shops. We see consumer offtake above 1% market share. That's a very good result for that one. So we're on track there also on our plans to expand further into other markets in the Chinese joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Hermann.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question to follow up. I just wondered -- I was hoping you could discuss more of the outlook in Germany. It appears to be still a market where there's pressure on the premium segment with the low price segment continuing to gain share and OTP as well remaining strong. What are the prospects for that market to stabilize given that the taxes in East European &#x2013; East EU countries now have risen? Are we going to get to a point where Germany stabilizes and then perhaps see a recovery in the premium as we -- as there's more innovation in that market? Or any comments around that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well let me start by saying that Germany will always be a challenging market and that's not just for a cigarette or tobacco category actually for all consumer goods that will always be the case. That being said, let me also say that our operating companies' income in Germany is actually stable, net of currency is stable. Then I would say that there are a couple of good indices in there, but I wouldn't say everything is beautiful already. It's not at all. There is still work to be done but there are good indices. The first one I would say the Marlboro decline clearly has slowed down. It's on the way to stabilization I would think. L&amp;M in the market is the fastest growing brand. It's actually now sourcing from other low-priced brands and not just benefiting from downtrading. Other sales I would say are stable. There are some signs of decline and if you adjust for the inventory distortions that you have seen in the market then our first quarter share is up 0.9. So yes. What we do in Germany is focus on innovation. MX Full Flavor, the new Marlboro version there has been relaunched. Blend 29, additive free version is coming in May. On the OTP part, we are out with the tobacco block, which is really innovation in that segment, it's the perfect make-your-own device if you like. We are selling about 20,000 machines per month, which means you attract 20,000 smokers per month. I think these are all pretty positive things and indices we see there. But I really have to come back to my first point. Germany as a whole will always be a challenging market. That's clear.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you your next question is coming from Adam Spielman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Adam Spielman here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question very quickly if I may. You said that your volume this quarter was down 0.8%. But if you adjust it for the Duty Free, it was really 0.5% decline. If we adjust again for the Czech inventory issues, what would the underlying figure be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean the Czech situation is of course completely distorted there. I mean the volumes in the Czech market are very low this year -- this quarter as we said before. On the other hand, our market share in the Czech market then correspondingly is very high. So it's totally distorted, actually I didn't want to take that out, because it's so much of a distortion. It would be clearly better again. But I think that would not be fair to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Much more important point. This quarter obviously volume has been weak, but your net revenue growth has been good in line with your long-term guidance and your OCI much better. And particularly as your innovation pipeline comes through, is it possible to suppose that actually the &#x2013; we'll continue to see the same pattern. So volume relatively subdued but actually the net revenue line doing significantly better if you like, the price mix very strong, given the fact that your innovation is mainly on premium brands, which will in other words would not help volume but even more help the net revenue line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean you're right that the net revenue line is an extremely important line, and actually we are happy and we are very satisfied that we're within the net revenue guidance nevertheless although we are not yet I would say on our volume target of organic growth of 1% there. So it shows that we are able to deliver on the revenue line even without yet meeting the target on the volume line and in terms of operating companies income, we are also perfectly in line with our longer-term targets as we have given them out. That however will not make us complacent to work not as intense as we do right now on the volume line. Of course we focus in innovation on the premium side of it, but also on the mid-price side of it is I think the best example of that one is L&amp;M in Eastern Europe. So we keep on working on all of them but we are very pleased to see that we are doing well on the revenue line and on the OCI line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a very quick follow-up -- my understanding when you gave this targets in the right shape. Was they were longer-terms targets? You said very clearly at the time you were unlikely to hit the volume targets in this year. When do you think it's -- when does longer term kick in, I guess is the question? When should we expect targets to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean, as you rightly say that volume targets as we have said for this year is that we will see still see a slight decline, we are under 0.5%. I think that is a slight decline. So that's the 2008 guidance on the volume side. We will see sequential improvement, that's our target. Bring it to stable volumes and go forward from there. To put a precise timing in terms of months or &#x2013; also on it I think it is not possible. We want to do it as quickly as we can, believe me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally to come back to the question about the skew of the promotional spend. Because we've clearly one of the reasons that OCI was strong this quarter, as promotion is skewed away from this quarter to the rest of the year? Can you quantify what the OCI might have looked like? Had the skew -- Had promotion be evenly spread throughout the year so instead of it being 17%, would it have been been, I don't know, 12%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean -- really we come back to the guidance. There are really was has to refer what we said. What went into the new guidance, the four elements, which are the currency, the business momentum, the reinvestment and the expenses. So those form, at the end of the day, the basis for the new number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can't give a sort of a more underlined --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't want to go any further than that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Yes, a couple of things. First of all, just to clarify on the promotional expenditure, is it fair to say that, as of now under the new guidance that the total promotional expenditure in dollar terms 2008 is higher than it was when you sort of gave the original guidance at the end of January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean the point is that you have a skew of promotional expenditures through the remainder of the year but one point and the other point is as you say yes, we do reinvest in some of our key markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the total should have been higher, the original, whether it's skewed or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I say. It's two elements on one side, but the reinvestment on the other side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, with regards to the rapid rise of Chesterfield, Parliament and Virgina Slims. How much of that is a sort of geographic roll out or is it pure end market great for those brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look I mean, for example take Chesterfield. I mean Chesterfield is growing really enormously and doing extremely in Ukraine and Russia. Just to give you a feeling for it, if you take the growth of Chesterfield in those two markets, then actually that growth almost matches the decline of L&amp;M in those two markets. So this is not expansion, this is strength of that brand in the market. Chesterfield however is not only strong, in those two, it is also showing good signs in Spain, and in Italy where it's growing as well. So it is growth in existing markets, there of course can be more market where the brand can be expanded to later on, but right now this is existing markets. In Parliament you have key markets like Turkey, or Russia -- their Parliament is doing extremely well. Again it gives us the potential to expand further but it's not just kind of pipeline effects that you see there, this is real growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And also just lastly with regards to the new product innovations. A lot of them seem to be very much skewed towards the emerging markets, so Indonesia, especially Japan is totally an emerging market. But I mean there's quite a lot going on in Japan. But how many should have been introduced to the EU, which seems to be the real core problem area for Marlboro as of longer-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Look I mean -- there is actually already innovation also in the EU. I mean Marlboro MX Full Flavor has been relaunched in Germany in the quarter. It's before that Blend 29 is coming as an additive-free version in May. We have had Tobacco Block also in Germany. So we are having really quite a number of innovations also in those markets, so we don't forget about those, it's coming everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dennis Jean-Jacques with Basso Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi , Hermann, Dennis here, just very quickly just a point of clarification. Are you expecting China to contribute this year to your EPS guidance and where does the China strategy fit in overall in your -- as you look at markets, emerging markets &#x2013; is it a top priority? And the other question I had is in terms of the buyback program. Is there a set kind of buyback, in terms of buying back shares on more of a opportunistic basis or just more kind of an automatic buyback? If you could just comment on that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On China, I mean meaningful EPS impact for this year &#x2013; no. That will be just too small to have an impact. Look I mean the key point really is for China to be the preferred partner of this China National Tobacco Company there. That is really the key in there, it is building long-term relationships in China and that has really two elements to it which is the China domestic element that is Marlboro license production for the summer. And that is then on the other side really doing business internationally with them, that is illustrated by the launch of RGD in the Czech Republic. These are the two elements in there which describe best the overall strategy for China. On the buyback there is look, I mean early May we will start the buyback. This is a two-year program. And it will not be that speculative, we will of course follow all the rules that apply to share buybacks. That's I guess what I have to say on that one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congratulations, Hermann and congratulations in particular with the described halo affect that you refer to around the world as you roll out innovations to meet the consumers' demand for Marlboro, that's a most positive development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. Couple of questions. First, talk about the Interval acquisition and what the market is like in France for loose? I think that's where you suggested that it was intended to serve your need and then what's the market like for fine-cut in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Interval, actually I mean on that acquisition I would say we have said before that we are a tobacco company, there you see we mean that serious. Actually Interval has 14.8% share of the fine-cut market in France. The estimated operating -- company's income of that will be some &#x20AC;25 million, that's about the size of the business there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Important is actually this is the leading brand amongst young adults, legal age to 29. So it complements I will say our portfolio very nicely. We have been in that market in the entire EU region quite a bit. But we have been in there mostly with our cigarette trademarks and there we really have now a real "roll your own" trademark that we have acquired there. So that's another positive of that acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And other markets, their end market, 14.8% share in France, where else do they do business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interval is very much concentrated in France. It exists also Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, i.e., the surrounding countries. But it is skewed towards France. That doesn't mean that it is just a French brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then, you had mentioned at some point during the road show, there were questions about leaf, both the availability of leaf and maybe the unusual class of leaf. I'm wondering whether it has had an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it -- I mean the storyline is exactly the same as we described it in the road show. I mean simply by the fact that leaf durations go well beyond the year, therefore it means that when you buy somewhat more expensive leaf at the beginning, it only will hit your income statement over time. So you have very little effect of that in the first quarter.</p>
