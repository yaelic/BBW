          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Julie and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2010 earnings call. We are delighted to be here this morning to talk with you about our results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principals, so called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplement, both of which are available at metlife.com. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and my have a significant impact on GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; Bill Toppeta, President of International; and Bill Moore, President of Auto and Home.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Conor and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>We are off to an excellent start in 2010, delivering strong results across the board. During the first quarter MetLife generated 8.8 billion in premiums and fees and other revenues, that's up 12% over the prior year period. We grew operating earnings to 834 million. That's up significant from a year ago and it's up nearly five percent sequentially.</p>
          <p>Book values per share approved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value, including AOCI is up 9% sequentially and book value excluding AOCI is up over 2%. The growth we're seeing in the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense control.</p>
          <p>We are also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today.</p>
          <p>Before we do that, let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire ALICO. As I said, before, we expect that the acquisition of this highly complementary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can't comment on ALICO's first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date.</p>
          <p>There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and ALICO associates dedicated to the integration and we have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement, our team visited each of ALICO's major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model, which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses.</p>
          <p>Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority, we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan, and we know the same is true at ALICO. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In the U.S. business, premiums, fees and other revenues increased to 7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top-line growth in corporate benefit funding which more than doubled; retirement products which also increased dramatically; and insurance products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. business, and at 757 million, represents a substantial increase from the 178 million one year ago.</p>
          <p>In our insurance product segment, growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in group life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-medical health revenues were flat, dental revenues increased, but was partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual life premiums, fees, and other revenues were also flat over the prior year, however, sales grew 15%, driven by increases in whole, term, and universal life products and operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior year period with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting, and lower expenses.</p>
          <p>In retirement products, better equity market performance and thus, higher fee income contributed to strong top-line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost 360 million are lower than last year's record levels due to the high demand for MetLife fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over 4 billion are up 9% sequentially, and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline, and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings in retirement products were strong at 159 million.</p>
          <p>In corporate benefit funding, premiums, fees, and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009 driven by higher pension closeout activity, primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continued to drive the excellent top-line growth in corporate benefit funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Finally, within U.S. business, auto and homes results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations, and earnings were steady at 72 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was very good at 88.8.</p>
          <p>MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of 299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period, and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at 53 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees, and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil contributed to top-line growth of 28%. The Asia-Pacific grew 24% due to higher sales, primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top-line increased by 30%, driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe.</p>
          <p>We continue to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally, which is part of the reason why I'm so excited about ALICO. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strength of both companies to accelerate our growth even further.</p>
          <p>Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I'd like to say though that I'm very pleased with the overall performance the portfolio which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter which included impairments of 97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of 1 billion for 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, this month MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publically traded company. In those 10 years we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership, and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Steve Kandarian.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall we continue to see improvement in the markets with rising variable income and lower losses.</p>
          <p>First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million, which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at investment day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year, we believe variable income should remain strong.</p>
          <p>Now, let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline and were $211 million while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write-downs also declined and were $149 million. Excluding the derivatives we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31, down from $10.8 billion at December 31 as spreads declined across most sectors. Overall the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter-end.</p>
          <p>Next I'd like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter, delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter with a loss of no more than $2 million, the second has been restructured and the third is a high quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such we expect limited losses as the recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%. As I noted on the last call, we anticipated that delinquencies might increase in 2010, but would be manageable particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottom out with an average peak to trough decline of about 40%.</p>
          <p>The loan to value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four quarter valuation process or we estimate to the low to mid-70% range if all properties were revalued today. Importantly only 2% of our portfolio has a loan to value greater than 80% and a debt service coverage ratio of less than one times. Furthermore we have seen pick up in office leasing activities, compared to last year and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve. In summary, we remain confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low.</p>
          <p>Finally, given the recent headlines, I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife's exposure to Europe's perimeter region. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending ALICO transaction, MetLife's general account has less than 40 million dollars of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business. ALICO holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt and their Greek bank holdings are de minimis.</p>
          <p>Remember, when the transaction closes these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. And on a statutory basis, ALICO must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country-specific situation we continue to believe that ALICO's portfolio is of relatively high quality with manageable loss expectations.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees, and other revenues which were 8.8 billion in the first quarter are up 12% from the first quarter of last year and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. business premiums fees and other revenues is 7.4 billion reflecting an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in retirement products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns. Also revenue growth in corporate benefit funding is up over 100% from the prior year quarter driven by strong structured settlement and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to reoccur at the same level each quarter.</p>
          <p>International's revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior year quarter driven by growth in all three regions.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operating margins let's start with underwriting results. In U.S. business our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90 to 95%, which is an excellent result. Our individual life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6%, which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter, the non-medical health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in dental utilization, we did experience higher claims. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidents and lower claim recoveries.</p>
          <p>Turning to our auto and home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 91.4% for the first quarter, which is up over the prior year's quarter results of 92.4%. That's due to higher catastrophes and less prior year reserve releases. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 88.68% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior year period, a non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter, compared to a 17 million after tax release in the prior year period.</p>
          <p>Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter with a movement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million, or $0.09 per share, above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at investor day. As Steve explained this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses, our Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8 to 22.5% given at investor day. This quarter we did incur a $20 million after tax or $0.02 per share in Operational Excellence charges and certain other one time items.</p>
          <p>Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one time tax charge of 75 million, or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change for Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation, as well as a $13 million, or $0.02 per share impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations.</p>
          <p>With regard to investment gains and losses in the first quarter we had after-tax net realized investment gains of 2 million which included derivative losses of $19 million after tax. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are in general offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after tax in the first quarter, which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter-end were 3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong. Our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow.</p>
          <p>And with that I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning. Two questions. First on the ALICO deal with respect to the 400% minimum RBC at close guarantee, are there any stipulations in the contract in terms of how ALICO gets to 400%? In other words, if something happens that forces them below, does it necessitate a capital infusion by AIG or can they do something else, such as slow growth or take offsetting realized gains? Any color on that would be helpful, then I'll have another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; no, there isn't a stipulation about how they solve the 400. Though my expectation &#x2013; you know, if you know how &#x2013; but if you know how RBC is calculated and how complex a calculation it is, it's not the thing you can kind of manage two quarters ahead of time by slowing growth. So my expectation is that, you know, if for &#x2013; by the way, and I think I've said this in a number of forums, you know, absent investment losses this year, my expectation is that ALICO's RBC will be well above 400, okay? And so they're going to have some cushion, and so if there are investment losses between now and when we close &#x2013; by the way, our expectation is we're six months away from closing. If there's going to be investment losses you know they have some cushion to probably solve that problem. So my guess is they &#x2013; a capital infusion will not be necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. I guess their ownership stake in MET is a pretty good incentive not to do anything too tricky there. The second question is on derivatives regulation, I know it's early days here, but I'm assuming that you guys are in touch with the folks in Washington about what might happen there. Can you just, at a high level, give us some thoughts in terms of what we should be looking for, what we might expect in terms of an impact on MET.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of being in touch, let me start out there. We both as a company and as an industry leader are very in touch continuously with people on the Hill, you know, and people, you know, in the agencies, and so forth. So, you know, I'll be a little more philosophical about this than you might want, but it would be hard to be more specific.</p>
          <p>I mean, everybody recognizes &#x2013; and I mean, everyone, that closing regulatory gaps to avoid future crisis is an objective. You know, if we had all started out with a blank sheet of paper and said let's identify the challenges and the objectives and from that we'll glean language and that language will be efficient, elegant, and clear relative to reform, one would have envisioned a racehorse, something very elegant.</p>
          <p>In fact, we knew that that was not possible a long time ago. So you've got, you know, realistically given the charged political climate, and so forth, people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time and if you know anything about camels, you can construct one and it might look a little funny and it may not be particularly elegant, but it gets you there, and so we in the industry are working to make sure that the camel gets us where we want to go and it doesn't spit and bite and kick.</p>
          <p>And so that's sort of the philosophical answer. And it's a good one relative to where discussions are. Because, quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes that the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations and we're pretty optimistic that the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually despite the turmoil that we see in the press and we don't think it's going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So you know that's a prognostication, but tune in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one quick follow-up, while the racehorse-camel analogy will probably live on for a while. Warren Buffett I guess was trying to get some rules changed or some sort of an exemption around how much capital or collateral he would have to post or his company would have to post. Is that something that will impact you in terms of how you manage the business? Any thoughts there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it may impact others much more than it would us because remember, you know, in terms of derivative use and what not, being regulated we have a derivative use plan that has to be approved by the regulator. We are collateralized in that activity, and so most &#x2013; the idea of a carve-out for the insurance companies is probably not going to happen, but the carve-out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that both on the liability and asset side most likely will be the result, and so rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions, we'll start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected. So that's kind of the flavor of what's going on at the present.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. The first one is on just your spreads obviously very strong across the board this quarter and I think part of the reason is variable life income, but you've been deploying excess liquidity as well, so maybe Bill or Steve if you could give us numbers on where your liquidity position stood at the end of the quarter and whether you intended to reduce that this quarter as well?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on disability losses or non-medical loss ratio, your disability losses seem like they're picking up &#x2013; not a lot, but they are picking up as the economy's gotten worse and that's a little different than what the results have been for some of the other disability companies which have shown relatively stable margin. So if you could just give some detail on whether it's incidence rates picking up or the recovery is not being that great?</p>
          <p>And finally, just a numbers question, since there were questions on ALICO before. What was the RBC of ALICO when the deal was announced, so we could get an idea on how much they could absorb in terms of losses before having to put in more capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jimmy, I'll take the one on &#x2013; this is Steve &#x2013; on us reinvesting some cash, which we've done over the last couple quarters. Our cash is down over $5 billion since the third quarter and those funds have been invested in a broad array of the normal assets and asset sectors that we typically invest in. So it's been kind of across the board in various different sectors. We've seen spreads tighten in a little bit more recently, but we have taken advantage earlier on in terms of some higher spread assets that we thought had very good risk-reward tradeoffs and that obviously has helped our yields here in our spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jimmy, it's Bill Mullaney. On disability, I think what's happening in disability is really a result of macroeconomic trends. We've been seeing the disability loss ratio tick up really for a good part of 2009. It's actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It's driven by a few things.</p>
          <p>The primary thing that's driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be and that is having a big impact on the loss ratio.</p>
          <p>Incidence is up a little bit, but it's not up a lot, and so we had anticipated that we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We've been raising prices on the disability business. That's one of the reasons why non-medical health revenue was a little bit depressed because our disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn't been taking the price increases.</p>
          <p>So it's something that we've been watching for a while. We continue to manage it aggressively and we think that the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down.</p>

          <p>And related to that, have dental claims been picking up as well or have they stabilized?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we saw a pretty big spike in dental claims starting in the first quarter of '09, which went through pretty much the rest of '09. 2010 is better than the increase that we saw in 2009, but it's still a little bit elevated over where we would have expected it to be. Again, we were pretty aggressive on pricing actions in dental. We re-price most of those either every year or every other year so we took some pricing actions in 2010. That's bringing the dental loss ratio down. So I would say the way I would characterize dental is I would say that the claim activity there is stabilizing and that we expect over time that it's going to improve.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. Just a question on the expense ratio this quarter, it came in very robust, below the low end of your guidance range you provided at investor day. How sustainable is that likely to be and what level of incremental expense saves do you still have from the Operational Excellence initiatives that are yet to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the 21.7 is slightly below the target range in our plan. You know, I think our target range was 21.8% to 22.3, and so we are trending a little bit better than plan. I will also tell you though, the 21.7, if anything, was a little high &#x2013; well, what drove the number? Revenues were better than forecast so that obviously helps the number look better, but also we had some one-time negative expenses which were obviously not planned for. So, I don't know if those quite cancel each other out, but they're probably close.</p>
          <p>I actually think it's quite sustainable, though it is a little bit below plan, obviously, but it's certainly within the reasonable range. How much more room do we have? You know, as you know, we've put out an original expense &#x2013; Operational Excellence expense reduction target of $400 million. We upped it to $600 million at last December and we said we'd be sort of at a $600 million run rate by the end of this year and we are clearly on track to do that. And we feel very comfortable about that number. So that's probably all I'd say today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question. There's been various proposals out there by the regulators with regards to required capital gains commission mortgage loans. Have you done any calculations as to how that would impact your risk-based capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That got jumbled a little bit. Were you talking about some of the proposed increases to the capital for commercial mortgages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, exactly, and what impact that would have on your RBC ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know, there's been some speculation that the NAIC &#x2013; well certainly there's some discussions among NAIC members &#x2013; by the way, that's different than being an initiative of the NAIC, everybody needs to appreciate that &#x2013; that they may raise the capital requirement for commercial mortgages. I think the current number is 2.6% and the idea was that it would go to 4%, but, depending on how your portfolio was performing it could be anywhere from 3 to 5% and it's sort of &#x2013; so interestingly, since I think our performance of our commercial mortgage portfolio will be at the positive end, it's possible that &#x2013; and, depending on how wide that band ultimately is between 3 and 5% and how low it dips, the honest truth is even if this passed, it might have a very, very modest effect on our RBC ratio.</p>
          <p>But I think if you took the midpoint of the range and said 4% &#x2013; I think Moody's put out a piece which estimated the impact on us would be like 25 RBC points. I think &#x2013; I actually think we're obviously very close to what goes on in the NAIC and &#x2013; I think we have to wait and see how that initiative lands, but I don't think we &#x2013; we feel pretty good that that's probably not going to be the final result of the capital requirements for commercial mortgages.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The first question is: I know one of the rating agencies has been talking about and I think has you guys on negative watch on &#x2013; and is suggesting they'd like to see more capital pro forma the ALICO deal. Can you give an update as to where you stand in terms of overall capital adequacy relative to balancing out the ratings situation? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is for Steve. I noticed you had a $160 million increase in net investment income for fixed maturity securities and the actual annualized yield went up by 14 basis points, that compares to 4Q into 1Q and just curious what's driving that, what kind of new money yields you're seeing for bonds and is it possible that you can keep that steady or are you investing below where you are and might we see a drag there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the capital situation, as opposed to aiming this at a rating agency, let me just sort of give you a synopsis of where we think we are.</p>
          <p>We ended up 2009 with a 432% consolidated RBC ratio. That's the highest RBC ratio this company has ever had, frankly, by quite a ways. And on top of that we had 3.8 billion of cash, and so fast forward a quarter, while we had very good statutory earnings on a stat basis a realized investment gain and the cash position at the holding company hasn't changed. So in many ways I think our capital position, frankly, is the strongest we've ever been and I don't think the risk profile of this company has changed one whit, frankly. So certainly we feel like we're properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently.</p>
          <p>Now, the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems and certain categories, especially the real estate business, commercial mortgages. I think we've spent a lot of airtime discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. It's also &#x2013; and that's not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test of a year ago right about this time? You know, when the 19 large financial institutions in this country, we were the only insurance company in that group. Our performance, or our results of their stress test in our commercial mortgage portfolio was &#x2013; we had the highest performing portfolio and it wasn't really close.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; so you know, we feel we're in very good shape. The &#x2013; but I think they're &#x2013; we're at a point in time as I think of the economic cycle where we've gone through a crisis, we've gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by and our results are good and market environment is getting better, I think people will feel better. So I don't know that, you know, the answer is, is that we should be, you know, stockpiling more capital. But we'll continue to monitor it and we'll obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure that they &#x2013; you know, we'd like to persuade them of our position. So that's sort of how &#x2013; that's my general feeling about capital.</p>
          <p>With regard to financing for ALICO, you know, I think we've said this before, we do need to raise some external capital. We said when we announced this transaction, we expected to raise 2 billion of common and that we expected to do that if &#x2013; either publically or privately and if we did it publically we would be in a position to do it sometime this summer. None of that has changed and the only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement, the stock was at $38 and I think it closed yesterday at 45 and change. So, obviously, we don't have to sell quite as many shares. We probably won't have to sell quite as many shares as we originally modeled. So that's sort of where we stand.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then for Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tom. I'd say two factors are driving that increase. One is the reinvestment about 1.3 billion of cash in the quarter. The second thing is we have some inflation linked assets in Latin America and due to some accounting quirks, if you will, that resulted in some more positive net investment income that shows up in that line item. There is an offset though on the liability side, so you might see that elsewhere in the financial statements. The bottom line is that you wouldn't necessarily expect that number to trend up given current yields and spreads in the marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, what kind of yields are you seeing in terms of new money, as it relates to just the fixed income portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's around 5% right now for fixed income. But obviously that varies based upon whether you're buying floating rate assets matching up against floating rate liabilities or buying longer assets matching up against our longer liabilities.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just a couple of questions. First on pension closeouts, obviously some strong sales this quarter, but as you noted they were coming out of the U.K. I'm starting to hear that there's maybe a couple of large deals being worked on in the U.S. and I'm not sure, Rob if you'll comment on that, but maybe we'll get something out of you on it. You know, even as Bill mentioned with your own pension, its funding situation stabilized. So we're starting to see the domestic pension close-out market warm up.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with respect to the legislative development, I guess there's also some chatter &#x2013; or continued chatter out of Washington that we may see some favorable tax treatment change on annuities which have been encouraging people to annuitize. Rob, if you could perhaps comment on that.</p>
          <p>And then, Bill, with respect to the comments you made earlier with the NAIC change to commercial mortgage charge, is that really all that important for you when I would assume it's really the rating agencies charge on commercial mortgages that's really in debate here, and perhaps you could compare the figures you put up for where the NAIC charge or capital charge may go on mortgages for what you're holding now under the various rating agency models. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Colin, it's Bill Mullaney. Let me start by talking about close-outs. We did have a very strong quarter in pension close-outs, particularly in the U.K. The U.K. market has changed quite a bit over the last couple of years. A number of the competitors that were very aggressive in terms of pricing close-outs back in 2007 and 2008 have pulled back, out of the market. There's still quite a bit of close-out activity and as a result, we're writing a fair amount of business and we're writing it at good returns.</p>
          <p>In terms of what's happening in the U.S., I think your observations are right. The market is starting to open up a little bit. I think as equity markets have recovered and funding status of pension plans has improved, there are more deals to be done. I would say some of the deals that are currently close to being resolved are on the smaller end in terms of size. But having said that, there are some bigger deals and there are conversations that have been taking place over a number of months with some larger plan sponsors about the potential close-out activity there. So, we'll see how that ultimately develops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, relative to tax changes, a broad answer is obviously, there's a thirst for revenue from the federal government, and so everyone is working very hard relative to making sure that tax increases at least are consistent with what the overall focus is.</p>
          <p>For example, driven by both the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department at the moment, there's quite a bit of focus on the need for securing more retirement income, and that's work being done by DOL and the Treasury, not driven by the life industry. So one might presume that it would be counter to exactly what the focus is to turn around and focus on taxes out of annuities. But you know, who knows?</p>
          <p>And that's across almost any kind of business activity in the United States. Everybody is hunkering down in terms of making sure there are not unintended consequences about revenue gathering. So I wish I could be more specific, but obviously, again, both we as a company and we as a leader in the industry are very involved in these dialogues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Colin, with regard to your question about commercial mortgages and the capital we hold, and I guess your point was is &#x2013; it's really not so much about what the RBC impact is, it's really about what the rating agencies think we should be holding for capital against those asset classes, and how that may or may not change. That's kind of the gist of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, you know Moody's just put out a piece recently and they were pretty explicit. They sort of said well, the proposed NAIC change is probably consistent with our base case in terms of losses that we expect over the next three years for the industry, and so &#x2013; and so they've sort of &#x2013; but they said, you know the fact that this &#x2013; this doesn't really change our view, because obviously we already had a view about investor losses.</p>
          <p>They did say though, that in a stress scenario, the losses could be significantly larger. And I think that's kind of the point. Because S&amp;P, though I don't think they've put out quite the same sort of piece, is, I think, messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario that the losses in the commercial mortgage sector could be significantly larger and therefore, people need to hold even more capital to deal with the stress scenario. And, you know, this is sort of about an economic capital third SIGMA event or fourth SIGMA event or whatever you want to call it, you know, a tail event.</p>
          <p>And, you know, it's interesting, you know. We obviously build our own economic capital models, and I think have done a lot of really good work. And one thing we've sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard &#x2013; and the world has also learned over the last two years &#x2013; tail events are very hard to predict, okay? And how much capital or what the losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult and it's really more art than science. And this is maybe if you want to think about it, sort of the dispute we're sort of having with the rating agencies right now is, sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. And I don't know if there's any obvious answer to that.</p>
          <p>But I guess I sort of think a couple things. One, I don't think there's any doubt that the quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio is at one end of the spectrum, both in this industry and just generally for that asset class. It is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years is really &#x2013; it was not an effort to chase yield, it was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. And I think anybody who's looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agree with us; it's very high quality, and the statistics we give kind of back that up. So what may happen for the industry I don't think is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us.</p>
          <p>And then I think it becomes a debate about &#x2013; kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment and that's sort of an interesting risk policy decision. I think we're in a very good spot in terms of how we look at it. So that's sort of why we're holding the capital we are today. So I don't know, you know I'm giving kind of a long-winded rant here, but that's sort of a &#x2013; you're right, it really isn't just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact; it really has more to do with what people think ultimate &#x2013; what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, one quick follow-up. On the pension close-outs in the U.S., and as Bill mentioned, there may be some big ones, you have always talked about that as being analogous potentially to an M&amp;A deal. Do you have enough capital available right now, post-ALICO, that you can really be a player, you know, if we start to see close-outs in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. But it may &#x2013; you know, just think about it. First of all, it depends on the size. How big are we really talking here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm hearing big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, some are &#x2013; I think we could come up with a deal &#x2013; I think there are certainly pension plans that are out there that are big enough that probably you know it might require additional capital, so I couldn't say under all cases that we would have enough, but certainly we have enough for any reasonable level of activity.</p>
          <p>And remember, this becomes a capital allocation decision. We're going to generate, even though we're not back to full earnings power, we're going to generate good earnings this year and we're going to have &#x2013; and we're going to generate excess capital this year and then the question becomes where does that get redeployed, okay? If business is good enough and we're seeing a lot of well-priced pension close-out business, that's where it's going to get redeployed to because that's a great growth initiative just like any growth initiative. If there's no big growth initiative, it will get redeployed in another manner. But that's the kind of decision we make every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, I would just make the observation that the &#x2013; that our discussion over the last few minutes in the absolute jumbo market, clearly both the buyer and seller understand the dynamics of everything we've just discussed, so that's just a comment I would make. And there again, I would make the analogy to the M&amp;A business.</p>

          <p>Just a couple of questions, I guess, around ALICO. Steve, when you mentioned the exposure to Greece, you didn't really mention any of the other perimeter countries. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of where we stand there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Bill, you talked about the 400% RBC kind of, I guess, floor. Does ALICO really need a 400% RBC really to operate? And so I guess the question is, is &#x2013; if you get it at 400 RBC are you going to get a company that's effectively overcapitalized given the mix of business it has?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, I'll start. We have to be a little careful in terms of what we put out because these are ALICO numbers, and I'll simply point you to the stat filing Schedule D for them. And if you look at the other perimeter countries, in total, if you look at the Schedule D, you'll see that their sovereign exposure to Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, equaled in aggregate about what they have to Greece, in rough numbers. So, that would give you some direction in terms of their holdings.</p>

And I think that means 350, plus a cushion, and I think we're always &#x2013; I think the debate is therefore, about the size of the cushion. By the way Moody's is, I think, still says 350 is what's necessary to be a AA company, in normal times at least. I think &#x2013; so &#x2013; and I wouldn't think that there's anything about ALICO which would make me change that policy in terms of &#x2013; so you know, I start with the idea if &#x2013; you know, what's good for MetLife would certainly be good for ALICO, so 350 plus is what makes sense. 400, I would not expect that we need to actually manage ALICO to an RBC of 400, but it's 350 plus a cushion, which might get you close to 400.</p>
          <p>So clearly the capital requirements in most of these foreign operations, you know, they're not as tough as they are in the U.S. for instance, or what we really think is required in the U.S. So if anything, the bias is the other direction.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning. I have two questions, one on ALICO, and then one on group insurance sales. With respect to ALICO, you know, I think when you guys announced the deal, one of the things you highlighted was the improved perception of ALICO with Met behind it, especially within the bank distribution channel in Japan. And I know it's been a relatively short period of time, but I was hoping you could give us maybe an update on whether you're seeing any real evidence of that in the sales or surrender activities in the bank channel in Japan from ALICO.</p>

          <p>John, it's Bill Toppeta. I really don't want to front run any announcements that AIG is going to make, including ALICO performance, so I think I'd prefer to defer on that question until after they've made their announcements.</p>

          <p>That's fair I guess. On the group insurance side, your results this quarter I think stand in stark contrast to a couple of your larger competitors in terms of loss ratios. And I know you guys have talked about over the past couple of years some increased competition and maybe not just on price, but on terms as well, and so I'm just wondering with some of the elevated loss activity that we're seeing at some of the guys who maybe were taking market share over the past couple of years whether you're seeing that come back to you in terms of new sales opportunities? And if you could just comment on what January 1 sales activity looked like in the group bus.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John, it's Bill Mullaney. I can give you some perspective on first quarter sales. First quarter sales were relatively strong, compared to our expectation. You know, as I mentioned in a response to an earlier question, we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both disability and dental and as a result of that we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009. And that actually occurred. You see that, I think, reflected in the top-line in the non-medical health segment, but pretty much in line with what we expected.</p>
          <p>From a life insurance perspective, pricing has continued to be very aggressive in group life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we've talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing, really, over the last couple of years. That has had some impact on our sales results or our sales results in group life. Although in line with our expectations for 1/1 we're down relative to 2009.</p>
          <p>But I think the real testament to the way that we run our business is in the mortality ratio. And we had one of the strongest mortality ratios that we've had in group life in the first quarter, which is typically not a great quarter for us. So we really feel like the strategy that we've deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one and we think that that's showing up in our results for this quarter, particularly, as it relates to the mortality issue.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I actually just have one question so we should be able to adjourn quickly. And that is, it just seems like we're in this blissful state right now where your yields are going up, but you're somehow able to pay less to your customers in their crediting rates and my question is why is that possible? One would think that in an environment of improving yields, that would need to be passed on to your customers and that yields and crediting rates would be moving in the same direction rather than in opposite directions. Maybe Steve or another member of the team could help me understand how those two numbers are moving away from each other rather than sort of in parallel? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, you're absolutely right. Given a macro environment both crediting rates and yields should be going up &#x2013; or going in the same direction and then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course, what's happening here is the macro environment didn't change much in the first quarter and interest rates were still very low, and so as liabilities get re-priced, if you will, they &#x2013; or the crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don't change for as much as a year, that means that in a low environment, you're still going to see crediting rates tick down.</p>
          <p>For us, the reason yields have gone up isn't really because the interest rate environment is better, it really is because we're putting more money to work, you know, cash balances dropped this quarter and we're also just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income. So that's why you see the &#x2013; by the way, I would just say that in general, you know, spreads are &#x2013; spreads widened, but they're only getting back to normal, you know, in terms of &#x2013; and if you compare them to our guidance that we gave this year they're a little better than guidance in many cases, but really only back to normal.</p>
