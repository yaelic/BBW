          <p>Welcome to the Morgan Stanley Conference Call. The following is a live broadcast by Morgan Stanley and is provided as a courtesy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on such short notice. What we are seeing is unprecedented in terms of turmoil in the financial services industry. This quarter, in an environment marked by unprecedented ongoing challenges and serious dislocation, Morgan Stanley achieved return on equity of 16.5%, diluted earnings per share of $1.32, and the third consecutive quarter of positive book value growth.</p>
          <p>As stated, we made further progress in reducing our balance sheet leverage, and continue to run high levels of liquidity while maintaining surplus capital. Our Tier 1 ratio this quarter is expected to be approximately 12.7%.</p>
          <p>The third quarter was extremely challenging with a macro environment characterized by continuing illiquid markets compounded by a distinct falloff in client flows. We have strength across many of our industry leading businesses including prime brokerage, equity derivatives, equity underwriting, foreign exchange and commodities.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are very confident that Morgan Stanley with its global diversified business and client franchise is well equipped to deal with the environment we are in and the future environment as it unfolds.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some examples of what we have done. When we realized we had a proprietary position gone wrong in the fourth quarter of last year, we moved immediately to market appropriately, take our losses, execute trades and manage the position down. Since then, we've disclosed our exposures and tried to give you as much granular information to understand our marks across areas of interest to you.</p>
          <p>We are confident with our marking policy calibrated in the first instance to execute to trades where that is not possible to other relevant factors we can point to. As we have all learned, the best way to deal with troublesome assets is to reduce the gross size by sale where possible. And again we will show continued progress in the reduction of exposures and overall leverage since the third quarter of last year and on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>The broker dealer model is a subject of much debate and its viability has recently been most eloquently espoused. I will only add that we believe in the diversified business model of an investment bank and its ability to adapt to different environments. This has been proven over the cycles. Let me also add at this point very clearly that depository institutions do not necessarily better enable us to execute our business and in fact may bring with them their own set of complications.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with an overview of our firm-wide results outlined on pages one and two of our financial supplement. I want to reiterate we have a great deal of confidence in the Morgan Stanley business and brand, what we have accomplished and what we will do in the future. We generated net income of $1.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.32, and a return on equity of 16.5%.</p>
          <p>Firm-wide net revenues were $8 billion and PBT margin was 24%. Non-interest expenses were $6.1 billion, up 20% from the second quarter, largely driven by higher compensation. Non-compensation expenses were 2.4 billion, up 14% from last quarter driven by an auction rate securities provision and the operating results at Crescent, both of which are predominantly reflected in other expenses. We continue to accrue compensation based on our earnings level and assessment of the market. Our year to date compensation ratio is 47%.</p>
          <p>I would have liked to highlight two items that affected our revenues this quarter and to point out that even without them, we had solid revenue growth in our core business. First, as you know, this quarter we sold an additional portion of our investment in MSCI through a secondary offering that resulted in a $745 million gain.</p>
          <p>Second, Institutional Securities results included approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from the widening of credit spreads on firm-issued structured notes of which $941 million were recorded in fixed income and $509 million in equity. Exclusive of these items in both quarters and the gain from the sale of the Spanish wealth management business last quarter, our revenues increased 19%.</p>
          <p>That solid revenue growth, even in these difficult markets, clearly underscores the breadth and depth of Morgan Stanley's underlying client franchise. This strong revenue growth included net losses of $1.3 billion related to trades and writedowns on legacy positions including mortgage related assets, monolines and leverage lending. In addition, last month we announced our intention to repurchase at par approximately $5 billion of auction rate securities held by retail accounts of the firm.</p>
          <p>This has resulted in a provision of $288 million for the estimated difference between the purchase price and the market value of these securities at the date of purchase and other losses. This amount was almost entirely recorded in global wealth management.</p>
          <p>Please let me turn to the businesses. Starting with institutional securities detailed on page five of the supplement, net revenues of 5.9 billion which included the revenue in our structured notes and gained from MSCI was 63% higher than the second quarter. Excluding these items from both quarters, revenues increased 34% of strong results in investment banking and equities and significantly improved results in fixed income.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense of 3.7 billion increased 27% from the second quarter of '08, predominantly reflecting an increase in compensation. However, on a year-to-year date basis we are accruing at levels below last year. Pre-tax income was $2.2 billion. Our return on equity in this sector was 29%.</p>
          <p>In our investment banking segment, we increased revenues across all categories despite subdued market volumes. Looking at page six of the supplement, the investment banking revenues were $1 billion, up 18% from the last quarter driven by higher revenues in equity and fixed income underwriting. During the quarter, we advised on several important transactions including Verizon Wireless' acquisition of Alltel and Dow Chemical's acquisition of Roman Hoss. Significant underwriting transactions included the European rights offering for UBS, Grosist Boss and Imperial Tobacco as well as Rio Tinto's issuance of investment grade debt, the largest ever investment grade issuance out of the metals and mining sector.</p>
          <p>We are also honored to be advising the U.S. Treasury on strategic alternatives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and view this as a testament to the strength of our investment banking franchise. Our pipelines are broadly unchanged from last quarter and continue to be healthy. We are maintaining high levels of strategic dialogue with corporate clients and financial sponsors alike. We are well positioned to take advantage of client activity as it returns to the market.</p>
          <p>Advisory revenues of $401 million increased 9% from the second quarter on strength in the U.S. and Asia although overall M&amp;A volumes remain subdued. Underwriting revenues increased 24% to $631 million. Driven by our participation in the majority of the European financial rights issuances equity underwriting revenues of $379 million were up 27% from last quarter.</p>
          <p>Fixed income underwriting increased 20% to $252 million reflecting higher revenues from loans and non-investment grade issuance as well as improved results in securitized products which were partially offset by slowed investment grade issuance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Page six of the supplement shows total sales and trading revenues of $4.2 billion, up significantly from last quarter across both equity and fixed income sales and trading. In equity sales and trading, we had our second best quarter with revenues of $2.7 billion, 27% higher than the second quarter of '08. Results reflected continued strength in prime brokerage and derivatives, partially offset by seasonally lower commissions. Prime brokerage reported record revenues this quarter with average customer balances essentially unchanged from last quarter. Derivative revenues were flat to last quarter as better trading opportunities driven by volatility were offset by the absence of seasonal revenues.</p>
          <p>Cash equity revenues declined 16% from last quarter on seasonally lower activity levels. Total fixed income sales and trading revenues were $1.9 billion, as revenues increased across nearly all major categories. Commodities increased 164% from last quarter and we're near the solid results we reported in the first quarter. Strong customer flows and an increase in volatility throughout the sector led to broad based strength.</p>
          <p>Interest rate, credit and currency trading revenues combined were up 29% from the second quarter on higher client flows. Interest rate products were up on strong volume and currencies had a strong quarter benefiting from increased customer flows and volatility with favorable positioning.</p>
          <p>Credit trading reported positive results compared to a loss in the second quarter. Better results reflected higher customer activity levels and favorable positioning as credit spreads widened during the quarter. Losses related to monolines were $362 million this quarter. And our aggregate net direct exposure to monolines remained close to last quarter at 2.7 billion. The net exposure includes $800 million of ABS wrap bonds held by our subsidiary banks, 1.5 billion of insured municipal bond securities and $400 million of net counterparty exposure representing gross exposure of 5.5 billion net of hedges and cumulative credit valuation adjustments of $2 billion.</p>
          <p>A significant increase in our gross counterparty exposure reflects the current credit environment impacting the monolines. In managing this counterparty risk through a hedging program that utilizes both credit default swaps and transactions that effectively replace the potentially impaired component of underlying transactions as well as credit valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Significant deterioration in European mortgage fundamentals and continued losses in the U.S. Alt-A residential mortgage market drove losses in mortgage proprietary trading of 640 million. We provide increased disclosure on pages 16 through 18 in our financial supplement.</p>
          <p>On page 16 of the supplement, our total ABS CDO subprime net exposure is now zero and net writedowns of $200 million. You'll see on page 17 of the supplement that we reduced our net exposures to non-subprime residential mortgages to 6.5 billion from 6.7 billion, our gross exposure was 10.9 billion at quarter end down from 12.4 billion last quarter. We continue to reduce our Alt-A and U.K. loan exposures through a combination of executed trades and marks.</p>
          <p>Our Alt-A exposure was reduced to 2.2 billion and our U.K. mortgage loans were reduced to $1.5 billion from $1.9 billion during the quarter. Net losses in non-prime residential were $600 million.</p>
          <p>Our CMBS/commercial whole loan portfolio is well positioned across the regions. On page 18 of the supplement, you can see that we increased our net exposure to 7.7 billion from 6.4, while our gross exposure declined to 19.5 from 22.1.</p>
          <p>Talking through this, this is driven by decreases in CMBS backed warehouse lines, which was reduced in the supplement to 1.6 from 1.9. Commercial loans which decreased to 4.6 billion from 6.3 billion and other secured financing which is reduce to 4.2 billion from 6.1 billion. These reductions were partially offset by the increase in our gross exposure to CMBS swaps which ended the third quarter at 3.3 billion, up from 2 billion last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now whilst we continue to manage down our commercial loan and warehouse line exposures reducing this net exposure 2.1 billion this quarter, we are also acting on opportunities to take directional positions because of widening spreads and volatilities. That is why we give this level of disclosure so you can follow these categories. We recorded a net gain of $200 million in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Other sales and trading revenues were negative $410 million this quarter primarily driven by net losses of 272 million in our lending businesses, which include leverage acquisition finance and relationship lending. These net losses reflect negative market movements and writedowns of 724 million offset by effective hedges.</p>
          <p>Our leverage acquisition portfolio is now $9.3 billion down from 12.7 billion last quarter, as you can see in the footnote on page 7 ever the financial supplement.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we added $3.5 billion of new commitments and had 6.6 billion in reductions. Included in the reductions are 3.4 billion of sales to third parties where we provided senior secured funding of 2.6 billion. I commit to you that where we provided financing under these trades I would inform you of that. The retained senior debt securities are included in our relationship lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>Also included in other sales and trading are investment portfolio losses of $108 million from our subsidiary banks. Total average trading and non-trading VaR increased to $128 million from $112 million last quarter reflecting an increase in non-trading VaR. This was primarily driven by our lending book as we close the remaining pipeline of deals early in the quarter. Non-trading VaR at period end was lower than the average on the subsequent sale of the loans. Average trading VaR was flat to last quarter at $99 million as reductions in commodities and foreign exchange were offset by slight increases in equity and interest rate categories.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital and liquidity, obviously given the volatility in the markets, we remain very focused on maintaining a strong capital position, high levels of liquidity, and prudent leverage ratios. Page 4 of the financial supplement highlights our current capital position. We continue to be well capitalized with excess capital. Whilst we are still in the process of finalizing our Tier 1 ratio for August, we expect to report a ratio in our 10 Q filing next month that will be approximately 12.7%. This increase was driven by retained earnings and stable risk weighted asset levels which we continue to maintain. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue investing in our businesses and take advantage of potential market opportunities.</p>
          <p>We continue to strengthen our liquidity position in the quarter and actively managed our positions requiring significant cash funding and reallocated the balance sheet to liquid assets with significant two-way customer flows. Total liquidity, which includes liquidity at the parent company, bank and non-bank subsidiary levels, was $179 billion at quarter end and averaged $175 billion in the quarter, up 30% from the $135 billion average last quarter. Parent company liquidity was $77 billion at quarter end and averaged $81 billion up from an average of $74 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Banks and non-bank subsidiaries' liquidity position was $102 billion at quarter end and averaged 94 billion in the quarter versus an average of 61 billion last quarter. Because of higher levels of liquidity, we further reduced our commercial paper outstanding to 7.8 billion for this quarter end down 4.5 billion from last quarter.</p>
          <p>Due to significant spread widening, we chose not to issue long-term debt in the public markets and as I mentioned last quarter, we had already covered our 2008 financing needs. However, we did issue incremental non-public structured notes at attractive pricing levels.</p>
          <p>Our overall liquidity planning and financing capabilities continued to work successfully. We are obtaining term, broadening the collateral categories that existing and new counterparties will accept, retaining stability in haircuts and collateral schedules as well as diversifying our regional scope.</p>
          <p>The weighted average maturity across all asset classes in our repo and stock-lending books was over 40 days at quarter end which is unchanged from last quarter. To be clear, when we provide with you weighted average maturity we include all secured financing mechanisms or trades. For example, repos, security loans and collateral upgrades. Across all financial asset classes including fixed income products, equities, capital commitments and other receivables or structured products, in other words, the full spectrum of everything that is funded in our secured funding books.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, the total notional amount of all secured financing was $311 billion, an irrelatively small portion, 22%, of this is overnight. The most difficult to fund non-central bank eligible assets which includes capital commitments and other receivables represents roughly 10% of our funding needs and had a weighted average maturity of greater than 90 days.</p>
          <p>We are managing our balance sheet prudently and further reducing both total and adjusted assets during the quarter. Our discipline in maintaining an appropriately sized balance sheet in today's environment along with our strong capital position has brought our total leverage ratio down to 23.5 times from 25.1, and our adjusted leverage ratio down to 12.9 from 14.1 at the end of the second quarter. Our strong capital position, high levels of liquidity and lower leverage enables us to take advantage of market opportunities. Given the current market dynamics coupled with the significant reduction in our balance sheet, our Level 3 assets increased to approximately 8% of total assets at August 31.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page 8 of the supplement in our global wealth management business, business reported a pre-tax loss of $34 million including a provision of 277 million relating to auction rate securities. Excluding the divestiture gain last quarter, revenues decreased 9% sequentially on low and new issuance activity that increased investment banking and principal trading revenues primarily in fixed income.</p>
          <p>Fees were flat despite lower market levels and commissions fell 6% on slowing transactions volumes. This business continues to provide us with a source of stable recurring revenues. Non-interest expense has increased 10% from last quarter including the provision related to auction rate securities. Away from the provision, non-interest expense is decreased on lower compensation and professional services expenses. Without the auction rate securities provision, PBT for the quarter would have been $243 million and PBT margin was 16%.</p>
          <p>On page 9, you can see the productivity metrics which continue to highlight the underlying strength of this business. Net new assets of 13.7 billion represents our 10th consecutive quarter of positive client inflows and our second highest ever.</p>
          <p>Total client assets decreased 4% from last quarter to $707 billion reflecting lower market levels partially offset by net new assets. Our FA head count increased 2% from the second quarter to 8,500. Our FA levels are now higher than they were before last quarter's divestiture of our Spanish wealth management business.</p>
          <p>We continue to successfully recruit high producing FAs and year-to-date we are seeing record recruiting volume and record low FA turnover. We are net positive both in the number of FA hires and trailing production of these hires across all our major competitors. Both revenue and assets per FA declined modestly driven by the greater number of financial advisers on lower revenue and asset levels. Our bank deposits grew to $36 billion as clients continue to keep assets in cash due to the volatile markets.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to asset management on page 10 of the supplement. The business reported a pre-tax loss of $204 million. Revenues were up 33% from last quarter to 647 million, though this business continues to be negatively impacted by the difficult operating environment. Losses associated with negative marks on our merchant banking portfolios, private equity, infrastructure and real estate namely, were lower than last quarter. Losses on structured investment vehicles held in our balance sheet were significantly lower than last quarter and had minimal impact this quarter.</p>
          <p>As we disclosed last quarter, we now consolidate Crescent, our real estate subsidiary, within asset management which added $85 million in net revenue. These were the primary drivers of our net revenue growth which were partially offset by slightly lower management and administration fees driven by less favorable asset mix and lower average asset balances.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses of $851 million increased 19% for the second quarter primarily driven by the operating cost for Crescent, partially offset by lower compensation. Asset management continues to operate in difficult markets and our merchant banking business is clearly subject to market conditions. This year, the primary driver of the decline in revenues is the negative marks of the real estate portfolio compared to the significant gains reported last year, the lower marks of seed investments, lower performance fees, and losses associated with SIVs.</p>
          <p>Aside from Crescent, our total real estate net exposure which includes direct investments in our real estate, private equity and infrastructure funds was $4.1 billion as of the end of the quarter. This exposure does not include the assets included in investments for the benefit of employee compensation or co-investment plans.</p>
          <p>Turning to pages 11, 12 and 13 of the supplement, you can see the assets under management and asset flow data. Total assets under management decreased 6% to $570 billion primarily due to the market impact in equities. We did generate $1.6 billion in positive flows in the quarter.</p>
          <p>While flows continue to be positive in our non-U.S. and U.S. institutional channels, our retail and U.S. institutional channels recorded outflows this quarter. The retail business continues to be a major focus and we are committed to improving our performance in this space. From an asset class perspective, the 1.2 billion of inflows into core with international money markets driving inflows into fixed income. Alternative products also recorded positive inflows. However, we experienced outflows in a few products. Inflows into merchant banking products were $400 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite our losses this quarter, we are committed to investing in this business as we see many long-term growth opportunities in the asset management area. The turnaround for this business will take some time.</p>
          <p>The issues we are facing are compounded by the current environment. We are keenly focused on improving performance and hired new talent and made organizational management changes. We are also focused on enhancing and utilizing all our distribution channels.</p>
          <p>In merchant banking, our strongest franchise, real estate is at the weakest point in the cycle. However, we continue to attract capital for new funds. In private equity and in infrastructure, we also continued to attract capital and these businesses are currently in investing mode.</p>
          <p>The market environment continues to present many challenges for our asset management businesses, but we are confident that we can drive this business to competitive advantage when markets improve.</p>
          <p>On page three of the supplement, you can see the regional revenue disclosures at the firmwide level. This quarter, 42% of our revenues were international with 32% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 10% from Asia and 58% came from the Americas.</p>
          <p>As you know, we suspended our buyback program at the end of last year. We continue to evaluate this program in light of market conditions. As of August 31, 2008, we did not re purchase any shares of common stock this fiscal year as part of our capital management share re purchase program.</p>
          <p>On September 8, 2008, our outstanding share count was reduced by 24 million shares in connection with employee tax withholding obligations resulting from the conversion of certain restricted stock unit awards previously granted to employees to common stock. I'm reserving the right to restart my share re purchase program.</p>
          <p>Now a few words on the outlook &#x2013; this is clearly the most challenging market environment we have seen. Whilst we expect severe cyclical challenges in the short term, we remain very positive on the secular story. As you know, we've been cautious of the markets and our view has not changed, and we believe the remainder of the year will be challenging especially in the light of recent events. This is why we have consistently focused on reducing our exposure in legacy assets and maintaining surplus capital.</p>
          <p>We have been working with a consortium of commercial and investment banks on a series of initiatives to help stabilize the financial markets and provide additional liquidity if needed. These include among other measures working cooperatively to ensure that Lehman's positions and derivative exposures are unwound in an orderly and fair manner and establishing a collateralized borrowing facility of at least $70 billion that would be available to members of the consortium to provide additional liquidity. In addition, the Fed is also adding more liquidity to the market by expanding the primary dealer credit facility and making other rule changes, significant changes. Investor sentiment remains negative which directly impacts trading volumes and client flows.</p>
          <p>While the U.S. economy continues to be sluggish, the downturn is beginning to spread to other parts of the world. Macroeconomic uncertainty will continue to put pressure on emerging market economies. We do not expect the volatility in the markets to subside until at the very least the mortgage market, ultimately the housing market stabilizes. We believe this environment provides us with the opportunity to invest in our core businesses. We are adding new talent, investing in technology, and expanding internationally. We have a tremendous opportunity to gain clients and market share. Our pipelines remain healthy. While monetizing the near term may be challenging, strategic dialogues continue at high levels.</p>
          <p>The drivers of secular growth globalization, disintermediation and alternative asset pools are intact. Morgan Stanley is well positioned given our leading client franchise global diversification and strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>By way of summary so that you understand the Morgan Stanley view, our business and our brand, we are navigating through this unprecedented environment. We have done it, and we will continue to do it in the future. Thank you, and I will now take your questions.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to just sort of ask you about this issue that everybody is so concerned about the funding viability of the independent broker dealers. Viability is probably too strong a word to use but obviously spreads have gapped a lot. You did allude to that in terms of executing your funding program just this quarter. How do you trade off the cost of funding that you are seeing in the market relative to the desire to grow or not grow the balance sheet and all of that obviously in the context of the fact that you have been bringing down your balance sheet pretty significantly over the last 12 months anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the good news, Guy, is that we pre fund it. So we don't have to issue for the rest of this year and frankly, I can delay issuance in 2009 by a significant amount too. The issue here is I don't believe these unsecured funding levels are sustainable. Now, I don't know where they're going to end up, but I'm absolutely convinced that when the fear comes out of this market and confidence returns, right, you'll get a much more sensible funding level. At that stage, I think it's about fundamental credit analysis of the institutions you're buying into, which is why we are trying to disclose more so you understand the basis of our credit and the risk associated. So I do believe that unsecured funding returns. I do believe it will be at sensible levels when we actually work out what those levels are, that clearly will have an impact on how an innovative, and let's be honest, responsive investment bank will respond in that environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. Maybe we can go to a more granular question which is maybe you can walk us through how the major hedges that you use in, for example, your commercial real estate activities and other areas where you have used hedges, how they performed for you during the quarter relative to what we saw?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It performed reasonably well as you can see from the schedules we've given. We not had any asynchronous behavior on the hedges. Obviously in some areas we find hedges are not effective and we manage the risk appropriately more often than not by selling the exposure, but I think the schedules will that show we haven't had this. We have clearly, TVA, we have taken up significantly in the quarter and that's a cost of doing the business. But I have no issues with the way our hedges have performed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally just on the sub-prime disclosure, where obviously it does net to zero at this point and it's a little bit of a rift on the last question. We see that at zero and yet obviously that is the result of the netting. Can you give us a sense for plus or minus what you think is a reasonable expectation that we might see in further losses ahead?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>I think what you need to look at is we've clearly written down the residuals. They're throwing up some cash still. We've got the super senior sub-prime CDO which is there which is significantly down from, I think, the 14.3 billion we originally showed. The range of, the valuation ranges, it's all very much marked in the low teens. So Frankly, I think that that's pretty much exhausted. We may get some recovery in the earlier vintages but my view is that it's become a non-issue.</p>

          <p>Sure. As you know we do collateralized dealing on margin. Our exposure is not material in terms of income and that's as simple as that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then on the retail brokerage side, I guess we've never seen a situation where you have, potentially 16,000 financial advisers in flux. Is there an offensive plan here to try and capitalize on this situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There most definitely is and we're clearly getting a lot of phone calls and we're very comfortable about that given our &#x2013; even in these turbulent times. So, we feel very optimistic and very positive about the outlook for the growth of that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the prime brokerage side, it looks like, the record revenues even coming off seasonally strong last quarter, how much of that is share gain versus pricing? Could you shed any light on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much pricing, to be honest, and not share gain, and Frankly, given our balance sheet and so on, I'm kind of comfortable with the size of our balances where they are and so I think as I've said to you last quarter, indeed, the quarter before, Prashant, we're looking to pricing power and we're looking to good partners in that business and that's the way we're going to view it. It is certainly not a market share strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the 1.4 billion in write ups on the debt side, is there any change in methodology there? It didn't look like the spreads had gapped up that much more than the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what you've done is you mis-underestimated the duration of that debt. We actually have a longer duration of that debt than the analysts have given which is actually a good thing. To be honest with you, I'd rather our debt wasn't gapping out because it's a distraction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, and then just finally on this and you touched a little bit on the deposit, the need for bank deposits and the perception around, the necessity to have these deposits, it doesn't seem like you're necessarily in that camp. Could you just talk about your $36 billion in deposits that you do have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it's a good thing to have. It's a nice thing to have. It's part of a service for our retail business, and obviously that is pretty much in proportion to the number of brokers you're going to have. So, I think it's an alternative funding source which we like, but I go back to my issue depository institutions are not key to our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. When you mention the Crescent, did you mention the revenue impact? Did you mention any marks related to it in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. If you remember we had cumulative marks up to the end of the second quarter, $300 million. At that point, we said we were consolidating it as part of the consolidation, we clearly had external valuations checked, brought it in. As you know, it was fully consolidated at August 31. We have real estate properties of 4.3 billion but against that we have secured financing of 3.3 billion. So that's the way you should about Crescent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, you reduced your exposures and you have a lot of liquidity, the highest Tier 1 in the group, but there's still the 30 or 40 depending on which account of gross exposure come down some &#x2013; I'm going to combine and make it a long question because they're really interrelated, so I wanted to get the average marks, if you could, on some of the bigger positions in commercial and resi and then I'll...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'm glad you asked that. Despite not liking to use averages due to the wide disparities of value across vintages in ratings, let me say the following regarding some of our key exposures. So on average, a weighted average, CMBS bonds are marked below 70s. The U.S., the average is 66. The U.K., the average is 87, right.</p>
          <p>We continue to trade and observed marks through trading. Senior commercial loans are valued in the high 80s to low 90s, right. Mezzanine commercial loans are marked in the mid 70s. Alt-As are marked in the mid 30s. U.S. and U.K. residential loans are valued in the mid 80s. Just to let you know, post-quarter end we continue to make sales and prove those marks. Sub-prime ABS CDO mezzanine positions are marked in the low teens and our leverage finance portfolio is valued in the mid 80s and as you know, we did reduction trades there which validated our marks as well. Hopefully, that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's definitely helpful. Now on slide four, I think you mentioned you had 7.1 billion of unallocated capital. You took down the capital at the investment bank, just a little geography there. But it's interesting because people are obviously begging for deleveraging. You did some. But you also dangled the carrot of potential buybacks. In this environment with your CDS spreads hitting almost quadruple digits, do you use that unallocated capital and big Tier 1 ratio and big leverage to bring down &#x2013; big capital ratios to bring down leverage some more even though it's an inefficient and inaccurate measure of risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Glenn, I'm going to reserve optionality on that. Frankly, I clearly believe in my book value. There are some people out there who don't. So we're going to manage it in the benefit and interest of our shareholders accordingly. So I have a number of options that I can do and I will pursue those given the strength of our capital position not just on a regulatory capital which you see but also on our economic capital model which as we've gone through with you is a pretty conservative model. So I have a number of options.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Last one. This is an easy one. Do we care about really wide CDS spreads in the short term? We care about much wider funding costs on the debt side in the long term, but as you said, you don't need to fund now so the in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I care that it could be contagion and you got fear in the market and a lack of confidence. It is clearly and people &#x2013; certain people are focusing on CDS as an excuse to look at the equities. So my view is, look, we need these markets to normalize. What we need is confidence. We are confident. The regulators are doing a lot and frankly, I believe this nonsense will end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to highlight the strength and robustness of Morgan Stanley, its diversification and its strengths. I want to have a building block and a bridge to rebuilding confidence in this market where things are frankly getting out of hand and ridiculous rumors are being repeated some of which if I wrote down today and reread tomorrow I would probably think I was dreaming. So that's exactly why we've reported, Mike, because I think it's very important to get some sanity back into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going along those lines so to the extent rating agencies say capital could be fine and liquidity could be fine but they could still downgrade based on market sentiment if it impacts funding. How can you protect yourself against that potential outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's an interesting debate. It's not an overriding thing. My issue is to reach out to our investors, our customers and explain what we're about. Right? At some stage, people are going to have to make that decision for themselves. And so far we are getting a very strong vote from our customers and our real investors. So look, talk to the rating agencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the question is, is 12.7% Tier 1 the right number? I know there's no right number. But does Morgan Stanley need to have significantly higher capital levels through the cycle as a result of current events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think when the dust settles we're going to look at what funding costs are, what the risk adjusted return is on certain businesses. Frankly, I think we need normalized markets to make those decisions. And the great thing about the investment banking model is that it is very adaptable to making those decisions. So we'll deal with it then and I will have a better idea. At the moment I'm very much in the situation of maintaining strong capital, strong liquidity. I keep my leverage down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me get into more mundane questions at least relatively. Revenues, commodities had a great quarter, proprietary trading in equities did really well. How do you feel about the ability to repeat those or your outlook for some of those revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, one of the unfortunate consequences of what's happened in the market is that's clearly some of our competitors are impaired or distracted or gone. And I think barriers to reentry is going to be very high in this business for some of the reasons you've said. So, I feel incredibly confident that when normal markets return with strong customer flow, we are going to be incredibly well positioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I was thinking of commodities. Commodities have come down a little bit here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's a misunderstanding in the way we trade commodities. We tend not to trade from a directional basis. We tend to trade from a relative value basis, Mike, based very much on the strong customer input.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, non U.S., it's been a big growth focus. You mentioned it's slowing some. Are you allocating relatively less capital outside? Are you slowing hiring? What are you doing in response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, at the moment, but I do think we're not allocating at the moment. But let's be honest, we think the smart thing to do here is to hire some great talent and we started doing that, some of which you know about. And that is global. But we also have an opportunity to hire superb talent in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks. My question I guess relates to, you referred several times to when markets normalize and so on. And we all know the old saying about how long it can take markets to normalize versus our patience and so on. And so I guess, looking at your credit default swaps and the model, the investment banking model is really built for credit default swap spreads to be, I don't know, maybe under 100 or under 200 but certainly considerably less than they are now. So I guess what I'm wondering is, what is plan B if it does take longer to normalize? And how your business model might change in dealing with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ron, the issue is, I don't think you can make that decision yet. If we have a systemic change in the model because of funding, we will change our allocation of capital and resources and size issues accordingly. We have been through various changes in the cycle to do that. But at the moment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are some of the changes that you've made so far that might be a guide to what we might...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you clearly reduce your balance sheet and you would take away from the capital intensive businesses or more capital intensive business. But frankly, we're not at that position at the moment. I think it's far too early to know. What we certainly have been doing a much better job of is focusing on businesses that are on a risk-adjusted basis giving us a better return. So we've already been pulling away from certain businesses and you've seen that. But frankly, to talk about funding levels here and how that's going to affect our business at the moment, I don't know the answer. But I'm pretty sure that we will return to a more normal level of funding. And at that point, we will address the issues of what the composition of our balance sheet is and how we allocate capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my concern is that as they say, if it takes longer than expected, then you need to maintain very high levels of capital and high levels of liquidity which then have the potential negative affect of reducing profitability. So I guess I'm just worried about being proactive to make sure that it doesn't get to that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we clearly are very proactive on that, Ron, and we will stay in touch on it, yeah?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Colm, I just wanted to come back to the capital issue, specifically with respect to Tier 1 and the, I guess you'd call it an exposure draft that the BIS has out for comment by mid October looking at re-weighting RWA to put more weight on market risk assets. And I was wondering if you had any comment on that and if you've done any work to try to quantify the impact on yourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have reviewed the new BIS standards, which as you said regard incremental risk and credit products within our trading book. We clearly have been talking with the SEC about these. We're not sure, in fact we're pretty sure that these will not have a material impact on our own capital reporting given our own economic capital model anyway.</p>
          <p>But one of the things that I have been concerned about, Guy, and I've spoken to you before about, is that in this environment you will need to put up more capital against various parts of your trading book. And that comes back to the issue of risk-adjusted returns and how you allocate capital. And I feel pretty comfortable that we can react accordingly in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you don't feel that you've already essentially incorporated that, that if you feel you're going to need to do more, you're not doing it yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we certainly incorporated that, which you referred to. But generally, I think that if you were looking forward, you've got to assume that certain trading books will attract more capital charge. And when that happens, you're going to have to deal with what that means. So, and one of the reasons I maintain such a large capital surplus is to deal with potential regulatory changes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm very well, and you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A little under the weather. The market's making me sick. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the wealth management segment because I think Prashant alluded to it, it just feels like there's a great opportunity for you guys, especially the business with the traction it's gaining recently. I guess I just wanted to ask a question around sort of how the compensation structures are changing for hiring brokers. Just looking to get a range of what sort of you guys will have to pay over like last trailing 12 months and how that's progressing downward or upward over time. How should we be thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's not changing at the moment, and I don't want to get into more detail than that. But suffice it to say that James and Ellyn McColgan are very excited. We're getting a lot of incoming calls. Top quality people. And we feel very, very positive like you do about that business. So I think people are attracted to the Morgan Stanley brand and franchise. They like the nature of this business and the actual stages of us as an independent investment bank. So we get a lot of incoming. And as you can see, we're beginning to hire quite aggressively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then the next question is just an extension of what I think a couple of the other analysts have talked about. Obviously, it's a panic stricken environment, CDS market, et cetera. And I know the decisions to buy back stock are sort of in your control. I see in the aftermarket, your stock's at about 28.20, your book value's 31.25, and I know you guys believe wholeheartedly in your book value. And I'm not implying that something needs to be done now given the precarious state of the markets. But in your viewpoint balancing &#x2013; that balancing act, is that becoming more possible if the markets stabilize if the stock stays here below book value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am preserving all options in the interest of the shareholders. So I will keep a very close eye on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just finally, any color on sort of how you guys are positioning yourselves to potentially take advantage of what's likely to be a lot of distress selling over the next couple of months? I know you guys have sort of done a good job reshifting your balance sheet to maybe exploit opportunities. So do you see yourself being aggressive in that stance? Or you guys are still working through legacy exposures that you still want to be careful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think we're working through legacy. My view is we look at risk-adjusted returns, right? You can clearly see in CNBS, we've taken on that exposure up a bit. We see value there. And that's why we'll continue to give you more disclosure. But look, on a risk-adjusted basis we feel we have the ammunition and firepower to take advantage of these markets. Some of these prices, frankly, have gotten to silly and irrational levels. So we're going to have the ability to take advantage of that. The markets continue to downtrade. We're now I believe at an inflection point in certain asset classes, so we'll see, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, I know you guys have done a good job on the leverage side bringing down the assets. It just feels like the market &#x2013; for better or worse or for right or wrong &#x2013; wants to see that leverage ratio lower. Any thoughts &#x2013; and I asked this on your competitor's call this morning &#x2013; any thoughts of potentially just doing something to calm the market? I think at this point, the market would probably look favorably upon it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of shrinking the leverage with more equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not second guessing this market. This market is a very strange market. So I think we're comfortable where we are and we're just going to continue to disclose and be as transparent as we can be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our last question will come from Roger Freeman from Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Roger, nice to hear from you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's good to be back. I guess, I heard your comments with respect to the sort of the feedback loop between CDS and the stock price. I certainly understand that one well. I guess when you think about the short term impact of the CDS spreads going up, is there an impact in the fixed income business with clients' willingness to engage in CDS trading and that sort of thing? Is there any immediate fallout from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we've not seen too much yet. But this is a very compressed period of time. Most of our clients continue to trade with us. Most, the vast majority, you have some people who are playing games, but they're playing games across the street. In fact, I've taken a number of phone calls in the last two days from my contemporaries at other institutions to find out the games that are going on. But I do think it's a temporary phenomenon, Roger. And I think that the market will stabilize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I guess in terms of some of the flow commentary you were talking about, rates, currencies, commodities, if you were to sort of aggregate that, August versus June, July and September versus August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I mean &#x2013; June &#x2013; look, here's the way I'd put it broadly and then we can &#x2013; June was a very good month. May as you know was a good month if you look at it by quarter, it began &#x2013; May began with a very weak first month, built up, ended in a strong month. We went into June, which was a very strong month. July slowed down. And August actually was a hiatus, right, generally, across all. So that's the way I'd look at it. And that's what you're getting is peaks and troughs in trading activity here, where the market seems to freeze for a while and then come back. So you have to make sure you're positioned and agile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And September so far? Obviously a lot of volatility...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking good so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In your commercial loan and securities portfolio in aggregate, can you bucket at all the property types behind those in terms of retail versus multifamily, anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I mean it's mainly commercial, right? You mean our commercial loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, within commercial, property types, multifamily apartments, that sort of thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mainly &#x2013; we give the categories. We give whole loans, which are commercial whole loans. You'll see it on the schedule. And within Crescent there is a percentage of residential, which is a small amount of residential in that. But by and large, CMBS is commercial, whole loans or CMBS, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay and then just lastly, in terms of the hiring that you've talked about and was written about widely, I guess, back in August &#x2013; how &#x2013; what portion of that may be directed at wealth management as opposed to other parts of the business?  Any...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the irony of wealth management is ongoing business, because that's a very strong franchise which James built up and Ellyn is now really developing. So I wouldn't call that strategic. The hiring that we referred to was the ability to go in and plug gaps. As you know, there are some pretty big names that have come across. Frankly, we've got some new people we can go to given recent events, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks.</p>
