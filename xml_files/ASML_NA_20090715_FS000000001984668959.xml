      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. And I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast.</p>
          <p>As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is of course ASML's 2009 second quarter results. With me today at the SEMICON West venue in San Francisco, California, and co-hosting today's call is Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO, and joining us from our headquarters in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, is our CFO, Peter Wennink.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and fourth quarter results presentation, both of which you can find at our website at www.asml.com, and which will apply to this call and all associated presentation materials. We remind you that the length of the call will be 60 minutes.</p>
          <p>And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you everyone for attending our second quarter results conference call. Peter and I will as usual provide an overview with some commentary on the quarter. Peter will start with a review of the Q2 financial performance and will add some comment on the short-term outlook and I will complete this introduction with some further details on our current position strategy, how we head towards the end of 2009. Following this introduction, we will open up for questions.</p>
          <p>So Peter please, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric and welcome to everyone. As usual, I would like to take a small amount of time to review some of the events of last quarter, as well as some details on our second quarter results. We closed the second quarter with higher than expected sales. However, they were weak in comparison to this time last year and also weak compared to what we consider for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter sales were above our guided range at &#x20AC;277 million. We shipped a total of 10 systems, four of which were new. All new tools shipped were immersion systems, causing a new system ASP of &#x20AC;31.1 million, which is very high. And the ASP of all systems was around &#x20AC;18 million. But that was helped by the high ASP of used systems of around &#x20AC;10 million. That was due to the sale of two used immersion tools in the quarter. Our sales revenues rebounded a bit and we reported a &#x20AC;94 million service and fuel option sales. The company's second quarter gross margin was 12.5% versus 6.7% in Q1, and this reflects an increase in sales from below first quarter levels.</p>
          <p>We maintained our focus on R&amp;D with a spend of &#x20AC;118 million in the second quarter, which is <mark type="inaudible" /> change from Q1. And as predicted, the very weak first half of the year did not impact our cash balance. As a matter of fact, we generated cash, and even including our dividend payment, we managed to stay virtually even compared to our cash balance at the beginning of the year. Net cash from operations was 71 million during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended the second quarter with around 1.1 billion in cash. Like I said, cash flow in the first half was impacted by dividend payments of around &#x20AC;86 million and capital expenditures of 87 million, mainly relating to the new manufacturing facilities, which were finalized in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As for the outlook, Q2 net bookings of 15 systems were valued at close to &#x20AC;400 million. Net immersion bookings were 13 systems and they demonstrated the focus on technology investments. This bookings level pushed our backlog again over 1.1 billion as of the end of the quarter. The backlog now contains a total of 43 systems, 32 of which are immersion systems. And this includes new and used XT immersion systems as well as our newest product, the NXT.</p>
          <p>We believe investments in leading-edge technologies has resumed in the second quarter and is indicative of a pattern of technology spend that will result in a minimum quarterly net average sales level of between 400 and &#x20AC;500 million for the next quarters. This range could certainly increase as a result of a need for capacity, in particular for leading-edge technologies, created by a potential recovery of semiconductor growth, even if this recovery is limited, as there is currently little to no excess capacity at the leading edge.</p>
          <p>We expect Q3 2009 sales to be around &#x20AC;450 million with a gross margin of about 30%. Expenses are expected to decrease to 250 million for R&amp;D and 39 million for SG&amp;A. As previously indicated, we managed the company towards break-even at a quarterly sales level of around &#x20AC;450 million by the end of this year. The targeted cost structure will support all of our strategic R&amp;D programs, and allows appropriate upside for sufficient production capacity.</p>
          <p>Our cash balance in the second half of 2009 is expected to fall moderately below our &#x20AC;1 billion target, as we prepare for shipments of the first NXT systems starting in Q3 of this year, and that will accelerate in 2010. As well as we prepare to build EUV systems for delivery in the second half of 2010. Now all of these products initially carry longer production lead times, which temporarily require more working capital.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn, back it over to Eric, and Eric, for you more on our strategy for the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So as Peter said, we are indeed recovering to a quarterly sales level, which we consider somewhat safe, as these levels are linked to necessary technology transition buys by our customers, which have to happen even during a tough recession. The question is when the capacity buys will add up, will add up to the current sales to bring us back to our secular growth trajectory.</p>
          <p>At this point, there are no sustained indications of the world moving out of recession, as you know, or of semiconductor units recovering to at least the level of the 2008 historical peak. We will have to wait for further signs before being able to forecast such a recovery, which will translate in lithography sales significantly above the current &#x20AC;450 million level, quarterly level that we are guiding at this moment. We can, however, note the certain numbers of positive factors.</p>
          <p>First, the semiconductor industry has significantly shrunk total wafer out capacity. In particular by shutting down all 200-millimeter lines, which will not come back, and by transitioning to new technologies under 300 millimeter, which are much more capital intensive. So this reduction of capacity makes a return to unit growth translate quickly to capacity buys in particular in the leading-edge segment.</p>
          <p>Second point is that the new technologies I am talking about, which comes from this technology transition <mark type="inaudible" /> are necessary for the DRAM/NAND logic sectors and are very lithography hungry in numbers of layers for instance, when using double patterning. And they are also lithography critical in terms of overlay, lens resolution, CD control. All this allows us to project a very rich mix, product mix, and therefore a high product base.</p>
          <p>This is a case for the current push by leading DRAM manufacturers to DDR3 memory devices, as they provide higher performance, speed and power consumption at lower cost. And the need to differentiate by driving technology even faster to 40 nanometers will support a very healthy high-end immersion market in the DRAM business in 2010.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="inaudible" /> flash memory segment currently ranking 30 nanometer technology, will begin preparation of the 20 or 2X node in 2010 to it, the very important $1 per gig target price, target price, in order to start significant penetration in the laptop computer market with solid state drives to replace hard drives. In the third segment, logic and foundry, growth will be sustained by the current aggressive progression to 40 or 45-nanometer node, which now represent a significant share of the total business.</p>
          <p>ASML's strategy and ability to invest heavily in multiple technologies in parallel, namely the XT platform for cost-effective solutions, the, number two, the NXT platform for clinical application with no equivalency performance on the market today or now, number three, a suite of <mark type="inaudible" /> enablers for holistic lithography, and number four, the next-generation EUV technology. All these, the four efforts that we do in R&amp;D is starting to show its strategic value, as the current technology transitions have to rely on the most aggressive technology and can no longer be compromised.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe that this recession is allowing us to focus on our technology execution for significant market credibility gains and will allow us enough sales to manage around the break-even level until our semiconductor customers own unit demand firms up.</p>
          <p>So with this, Peter and I would be pleased to take your question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question, with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get as many callers in as possible.</p>
          <p>Now operator, if we could have your instructions and then the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions.] The first question comes from Mr. Nicolas Gaudois. Please state your company name, followed by your question. Question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, it's UBS. First question is on NAND Flash, I mean you sound a little bit more positive on, I guess some of your discussions you have with these two key customers of that. And if we look at your transition rate in NAND Flash being pretty much close to saturation as of now Intel commenting on solid state driver acceptance yesterday absolutely improving, I guess <mark type="inaudible" /> beyond shrinking investment the minimum requirement for CapEx as well going back next year.</p>
          <p>So if you could give us your view on that as a starting point, it would be great. I will have then a follow-up for Peter on margins. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, thank you for the question. So we, where we, if we had to prioritize the segments which have more, I would say growth potential at this moment, we would still position DRAM first; at this moment there is much more activity in the DRAM sector. But closely command in the sense that there has been a significant overcapacity built up in 2008 also. And we can see that the market demand has been catching up on this overcapacity and for the main customers are at this moment starting to plan for the restart of their business.</p>
          <p>But I would guess at this moment most of the shipments that we will do in the next six months will be going to DRAM and Logic, and that the Flash business will start late into the year and into 2010. Added to this, you are starting to see a conversion discussion of NAND from 30 nanometer, which is the current new technology to 20 nanometer, which again will start early in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And on the cost side, your gross margin guidance for Q3 was probably a touch light versus expectations. So if you could try to find a reason for that, and how should we think about gross margins going into the back end of the year towards your break-even target, in particular as far as viable costs are concerned? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With respect to the third quarter, there are two reasons why the gross margin is a touch light, and it has to do with the fact that one, we are still shipping tools out of old inventory, inventory we had purchased in 2008. We're only going to replenish that in Q3 for shipment in Q4, so cost reduction on modules and parts will only enter the income statements towards the end of the year; that's one. And number two is the cost reduction initiatives that we have started are going to see effect in Q3 but increasingly in Q4. So those are the two reasons.</p>
          <p>And that brings us to the point where we'll reach that 450 break-even point by the end of the year, which is then your driver, what we call the direct material margin, which is currently just a touch over 55%, which should go to 60%. And with our current cost structure of let's say 275 per quarter, you can then calculate that that will bring us to a break-even point by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question come from Mr. Simon Sch&#xE4;fer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's Simon Sch&#xE4;fer with Goldman Sachs. Just getting back to this question about NAND Flash. I'm just wondering what the famous ASML model says about under or over capacity in that segment, because clearly it seems as if the variability towards the end of the year could be coming from that customer base, and as to whether that supply and demand is more in balance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all thank you very much for calling our model the famous model, which I take it as a compliment. And the famous model, let's say is basically saying that with the current reduction of capacity in the world, because of the retirement of 200-millimeter capacity, as well as the transition to 3x and 4x, we estimate the total worldwide capacity between 2008 and currently 2009 to have shrunk by about 20% at this moment.</p>
          <p>So again, the numbers of wafers per month that the installed capacity of the world allows is 20% less wafer per month. So that 20% down in capacity is now hitting the demand curve, which is, has always been sustained. We estimate, I mean we think that the demand curve of DRAM has been, sorry of Flash, NAND Flash has been about stable-ish, two, minus three to 5% 2009 to 2008. So this demand has not been shrinking as much as the capacity has, which again leads us to believe that more than that, this is why we start seeing some activity.</p>
          <p>But this booking activity is clearly, as I said, not for immediate shipment. So there is not a full urgency; the customers are still willing to wait a bit until they see the famous Christmas season. That will confirm that we are back into a growth situation, which again will lead us to new shipment into the NAND sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks so much. And my second question would be, just on the assumption of the 450, I think you're saying is, or you're I think still characterizing as an investment cycle that is really for technology purchases. And so I was wondering whether that means that your mix is still very much skewed towards immersion deliveries, partly because the NXT is kicking off in Q3. But does that mean that your average selling price can be sustainably as high now, just at least over the near-term, as it was in Q2? I know that'll change once capacity comes back into the picture, but does that mean in the next couple of quarters it stays roughly around the same level? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That is correct. Our famous 450 level is based on about 10 to 12 machines. And as you can see, you need to be around on average 25 to 30 million to get to this level. So we do expect this to be sustained. We expect even the ASP to start growing up a bit more as our mix increases in NXTs versus XTs. The XT ASP as I said is 25 to 30 million, the NXT will be in the 35 to 40 million. So you will start seeing this ASP going up towards a sort of mix between XTs and NXTs into I would say Q4 and Q1, Q2 next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Philip Hoffer. Please state your name, company, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen. Short follow-up on the NAND Flash market. Does your guidance assume actually that you will see some orders kicking-in already in the second half of this year from the NAND Flash market, or could that be on top of your current sales guidance?</p>
          <p>And a second question would be maybe a short indication on longer-term margins, if I make the right calculation in terms of your cost savings kicking in, I would say that your next cycle peak margins would be close to 30%, is that something you could confirm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will leave the margin question to Peter; regarding the bookings, yes there will be bookings of NAND into the second half. Those bookings will translate into sales in 2010, and yes there is a potential for upside above 450 per quarter on the NAND, but then I would call it capacity drive. So if I'm right and the business recover and you are back to a curve of growth of unit in Flash, then it will add up above 450. Peter, regarding margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You know, clearly the, what you would say the peak operating margins of course very much depend on what you believe the peak sales will be. But to make things easier for you, you can do your own calculations. We have a direct material margin target of 60%; we will get there. So if you take a 60% direct material margin on a sales level that due regards the next peak, then you need to subtract per quarter, I'll talk about quarterly cost of between 290 to &#x20AC;295 million of cost per quarter. And that is true up to and including a sales level of around &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>So when we're at &#x20AC;800 million, 60% direct material margin, between 290, 295 cost level and you can make your own calculations, which is actually quite easy. And how much above the 800 million you want to go is up to you. That is your own insight, but then you can use those math whereby cost levels will go up somewhat above that level, but that will be based on variable cost. So we would need some more people, but those will be flex.</p>
          <p>Now how do we come to 290, 295? We're currently at 275, which is just over 50 million lower than where we were in the second half of 2008. We are focusing, actually the cost reduction program has now confirmed that we will sustain 75% of that 50 million per quarter going forward even at 800 million sales level, which would then bring our cost level down to that 290 maximum to 295 level. Now, if you run your numbers and you would take, let's say a peak sales level that is above four billion, then you could get to the numbers that you just mentioned. That's pure mathematics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name followed by your question. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This is Sandeep Deshpande at JPMorgan. Hi Eric, just a question again regarding your famous model, I mean, given that semiconductor, I mean, there is some incredulity among investors whether this semiconductor equipment market itself will grow in the next five years versus the past five years. What does your model say in terms of if the NAND Flash market is going to penetrate the notebook as well as several markets, I mean what would be the size of the opportunity for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi Sandeep. Now you can use the term "very famous," because your colleagues say "famous," now we go up. And the very famous model is clearly confirming our target sales of five to say &#x20AC;6 billion in the next three to four years. And this is based on a average semiconductor unit gross of about 8% to 9% per year, so we would have to get back to that. And in order to get back to about 8 to 9%, if I remember by heart, we had a gross of NAND to be in the, I think it was 25 to 30%. And that would correspond to NAND reaching, sorry to solid state drive, reaching a total market share of 10% of all laptops. So if you do that, and if this happens in the next three to four years, then we get towards our five to six billion sales, which is based on the 70% market share, but you can re-create the total market from there.</p>
          <p>So we are doing this simulation on a regular basis, based on what we learn from the different technology mix, because as you say, the simulation, you imagine the simulation tool is as good as the assumptions we've put in technology transition multiplied by the price of each of the tools. And so if you, what we are at today in the next three years or so, is a significant growth of technology, double patterning of some sort, whether it is space double patterning or more sophisticated double patterning with a big usage of the NXT machine, which is this machine that offers a double patterning to an overlay level of three nanometer, which is like half of what is happening today. We've confirmed from the customer that double patterning will require such aggressive overlay. We are the only one offering this type of overlay; we therefore believe that we enable the market to do these technology, aggressive technology, and it reinforces our market share.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, the simulation tool is always telling us about the same result. If sometimes we change the assumptions on technologies, we still come up with the same numbers because at the end of the day, the lithography is blessed by the fact that this technology transition requires ASP increase. So we are supported all the time by either the units or the ASP but if you multiply both you get to about the same number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. I mean just one follow-up, Peter, actually following up from the previous question. I mean if you look back at previous cycles for ASML, the cycle, I mean the two up cycles in the '90s saw a peak EBIT margin for the company at only about 20%, whereas in 19, 2007 you saw over 20%, 24% in 2006 EBIT margin, clearly a market share gain related seeing associated revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, when you talk about this 30% EBIT margin, I mean you didn't give this figure yourself, but I mean is this because of new cost cuts, which you are implementing now, or are you talking about that your market share, it is a function of your market share which will be higher in the upcoming cycles?</p>

          <p>Yes I think that this, the latter is certainly true. When you talk about 2006-07 we had between 55 and 60%, I think we are closer to 70% so that is your share volume; and as you know, there's always a high leverage in the income statement. Like I said, if we're over our break-even point, then we would have 60% direct material margin. Until the, we hit the 800 million per quarter ceiling, there is an incremental addition to your operating income line of 60% of every 100 million, which is 60 million per every 100 million that you'll add. So that goes quick.</p>
          <p>So I think pure sales volume will need help and it will be driven by what Eric said, the growth of the market and our 70% market share as compared to the previous cycle where it was indeed lower. That is a big driver; the other driver is the cost structure. I think we are focusing on the 60% direct material margin, which we were not at in previous cycles. Also, the addition of more software related products driven by solutions we have in the holistic lithography space will also help. And those three things, so basically the new suite of products with more software-like margins, cost reductions that will come through, plus the market share, are drivers for the higher EBIT margin as compared to the previous cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually Mr. I have a question going back to your model, and I apologize if I'm repeating the question, I joined in late. With migration to a 2x node for Flash, what kind of dollars of CapEx are we looking at? And I would also like to ask the same question about DRAM. I do understand a five to $6 billion revenue opportunity several years from now, but what happens with the Flash and DRAM spending over the next 12-18 months? Any color would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take me a bit back because I will have to answer you a bit scientifically understanding or reminding myself of all those numbers. I guess that in our model we probably have, I think total conversion to another technology is probably in the order, in Flash is in the order of the one to 1.5 billion. But to be honest, I would have to confirm that to you; I don't want to give you wrong numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very, how do you say, disciplined as to what we call technology transitions, which we define a certain way. And then on top of that you have capacity adders. So I have to be cautious that the technology transition is like recession independent, which is why we call with a very strong statement that this is 450 million, we have seen this 10 times. But the additional capacity built up on node depend on the numbers of units that this node is going to go for, and that depends on the recession or the getting out of recession. So I don't want to talk about that at this moment without coming back to my lawyer. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also I think you need to remember that those transitions don't take place all at the same time. Customers have different investment patterns. So that is also spent over a certain period. And like is very clear in the DRAM, in a space where you have leaders and you have the followers, that it could be easily 18, 12 to 18 months in between.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me rephrase the question. Back in 2006-2007, DRAM spending was between 25 to US$30 billion. Given this technology migration, do you think that over the next couple of years, we're going to meet or exceed the 2006-2007 DRAM CapEx spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll probably be able to meet it, but not for the same reason. In 2006-7, there was a clear overspend. Every one of us were surprised, if you remember, even though our model didn't show that it would go as fast as this 2007 at the end. It was a probably a 50% overspend when it's compared to the, I would say natural growth.</p>
          <p>But we are pretty optimistic as to DRAM rebuild up of CapEx, mainly because they are ramping now major technology difficulties. Their transition to 50 nanometer is not easy. This is being done by currently the two leaders. Those guys are now running towards 40 nanometer and they are discovering how complicated it is to do these new nodes. So they are ready to go for 40 and 30 type nanometer with double patterning until they transition to EUV, which again is an expensive transition. So through the ASP, the node through the units that we're going to reach a same type level of sales that we had in 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Timothy Acuri. Thanks. How confident are you that you can sustain order growth through the end of the year if in fact utilization at foundries begins to roll over in Q4 as there are some signs that that will happen? Do you think that, you know, the upgrade cycle going on right now in DRAM and later on NAND, is that actually strong enough to sustain bookings growth in the face of rolling over utilization at the foundries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, definitely. The current slight pickup that you saw in bookings have been done based over the, halfway through one foundry and halfway through the second Tier DRAMs. So the next batch of orders in the next six months will be the foundry business, competitors catching up a bit, as well as the first Tier DRAM, and as we just discussed, NAND. They now, there is therefore much more opportunities, more segments which will pick up in the second half than the current ones who've made our current bookings a bit better.</p>
          <p>So I would say the current bookings at 394 million or something, 400 million of system is in the low side of the equation as I could project in the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on top of that Eric, if I may add. When you talk about foundry utilization you have to realize that the leading-edge utilization on 45 nanometers has been very, very high, and the introduction of new 40 to 45 nanometer products is now ramping, which the installed capacity at 45 nanometer is still extremely low as compared to total installed capacity.</p>
          <p>So you could indeed see that if total installed capacity utilization would go down doesn't mean it, at the leading edge, which is basically only like Eric said, only one foundry, that that would go down also with the ramping introduction of new 40 to 45 nanometer products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Agreed. I just asked because we've never before seen a cycle where utilization has kind of rolled back over and bookings have not rolled back over. So I'm just kind of wondering why that would be different this time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, it's Deutsche Bank. My first question is, when you talk about the timing and magnitude potentially of the 40 nanometer, or 4X migration in DRAM with the Korean vendors, I mean, what are they telling you roughly about those two aspects of it, and then I have a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think we are getting is a lot of looks. We realize that it is strategically important for them to run these new nodes a bit earlier than planned for obvious strategic reasons at this moment while year-on business is somehow consolidating; in other terms, where the leaders have to show their colors. So you are getting much more pressure than those guys saying, "well let's accelerate those nodes."</p>
          <p>But as I said, the technology is now extremely complicated, and therefore they need the latest technology, so you get much more interest in our machine, in our high-end machine and with the also holistic lithography, which enables them to do those designs. So you see that happening.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there is going to be a second wave of activities by them when they are finishing up the recipes, and depending on the success of the yield we will have a different trend. So in other terms, I expect a first wave of orders and then followed by another one. And again, the other one, we don't know yet how successful it will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, thank you. And then my second question would be when do you expect sort of government-bailout-funded DRAM vendors so to speak in Japan and Taiwan to come back with orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is also a very good question. So I would try to avoid, I mean specifics of course is in our customer data. But you have heard from the Japanese side that there is interest to invest the money received by the government into also 40-nanometer-type technology, and that will be very much done near in parallel with the first tier. So in other terms, ramping into Q1 and Q2 of 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Taiwanese part, of course as you know, two Taiwanese; part one is the one aligned with the American vendor, and the other one is aligned with the Japanese vendor. The one aligned with the American vendor is at this moment planning a ramp of 50 nanometer, which is, I would say more for volume questions rather than a technology question. The 4X at this moment is not yet in discussion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Fran&#xE7;ois Meunier. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's actually Fran&#xE7;ois from Cazanove. A quick question on the margins. I mean, I am looking at your account in IFRS, and I was wondering when you would officially move to probably only IFRS reporting, maybe next year? And do we have to model something like 25 to &#x20AC;30 million of incremental EBITDA quarter, which it's probably linked <mark type="inaudible" /> option, second thing, but also mostly to amortization of R&amp;D. I know it's not cash, but probably under headline numbers, your headline numbers in the coming years will be around 100 to &#x20AC;120 million higher at the EBIT line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think clearly we don't run the company on the accounting rules in the sense that we just picked the most favorable one. I think we are on the U.S. GAAP for the simple reason that all our peers are on U.S. GAAP. And as you've rightly pointed out, I mean if we would go through IFRS, we would have to capitalize our, a big part of our R&amp;D spend and then amortize that over the expected lifetime, which would mean that our R&amp;D cost in the IFRS income statement would be significantly lower than we currently show in the, our U.S. GAAP.</p>
          <p>Now my personal view is that I don't think that is the right thing to do. I think that given the uncertainty in this industry and the high-risk profile, it is good to expense the R&amp;D. So, for this particular reason, but also for the reason of comparability with our U.S. peers, we stay on U.S. GAAP. And we have also a very large contingent of U.S. shareholders.</p>
          <p>So you are right that the EBIT is indeed higher because of the R&amp;D capitalization and the resulting amortization, and since our R&amp;D is, will go up going forward to a certain level where the capitalization will be higher than the amortization for a certain period of time, we will then have a positive impact on the IFRS results.</p>
          <p>But that's not what we're focusing on. Like I said, we're focusing on comparability, and I think also from a company point of view it's better to get rid of the R&amp;D spend and not take this in as an asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. So when I was talking about margins, big margins, you're taking U.S. GAAP and not...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.S. GAAP, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now another question about, you're talking about de-booking in the presentation. I guess that's order consolidation, could you give us a bit of more flavor about those &#x20AC;71 million of orders which have been de-booked? Where they are coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is something which is not an official de-booking. It's basically a scrubbing of the backlog that we're doing. We're looking at certain orders where we think will the probability of those orders shipping fall outside the 12-month window; if it falls after the 12-month window we take them out, so it's our own choice. And that has to do, for instance, with some orders that we received out of Taiwan where we said, that Eric alluded to, that the financing situation has not improved the government funding, we're not seeing yet the results of that, so that's why we've taken a more conservative approach on backlog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Barclays Capital. Just like a little more detail on the NAND side of the business if you could. You sound quite confidently about the ramp in XT tools and the interest from the NAND side of the space there. And in particular, regarding the move to solid state drives and that $1 per gig target. I was just wondering if the lead customers there for or the lead vendors on that side of things, are giving you any indications as to when they might like to start shipping at those kind of levels, and therefore what kind of confidence you have in terms of a potential of a ramp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, unfortunately I would be disappointing you. We are not the specialist of that. So, I gave you those pieces of data mainly based on editorial comment from our customers. But they do not share with us product strategy; they just kick us because we are not shipping technology fast enough. And so therefore, we know that they want the machine, then we try to make logic out of why they want this and why they drive technology so and so on.</p>
          <p>But I can't really tell you much more than that; the 10% market share target is a well-known target, but in most of those NAND players as you may have heard, and I now understand also that they think they will reach that type of 10% range with a target price of X, I don't remember, for a big SSD drive of 60 gig and 120 gig. And all this would be based on 20 nanometer type technology. So, but again, don't look at us as the specialists for the applications, I can't really help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps on a sort of slightly different angle as relates to the customers, then? You highlighted in the presentation keeping capacity in your system or your manufacturing side at around the &#x20AC;800 million revenue level on a quarterly basis. Clearly we're quite a ways below that, but I presume you wouldn't be keeping it at that kind of level if say over the next three, four, maybe five quarters you didn't think you could get somewhere close to that. So what's your thinking around that side of things at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, it is a very important question because we are asking our self that question to manage the company, how fast a move back to 800 or more can happen? And the message that I gave in the speech at the beginning was as follows: It says, well, we have a base of 450 million. We think that's a base that can last for long time. And on top of it will be a capacity buy. And those capacity buys could happen within a quarter. We can get a surprise set of orders that is definitively, could definitively lead towards 800 in a flash.</p>
          <p>So we absolutely need to have this capacity of 800 in the book in view of that. And the reason we think it can be very quick is first of all, we just had one or two flashes of that already, where we have had questions about shipping within a lead time, oh, in fact within six months basically, certain numbers of tools for capacity reasons, and we know why these things happen short, with short lead time is, there is no excess capacity anymore. It seems that most of our customers have reached the level of utilization, in particular in the areas where it's hot, which is in the new technology, which is too high for taking upside. And therefore, if there is anything that happens in the industry in the world where you go, you go back to level of sales of 2008, which would be about 150 billion of units, if you go back to that level, we are 130 billion unit, then you will go to 800 <mark type="inaudible" /> very quickly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's RBS. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a couple of question starting with the provisions that you took again on obsolete inventories in the quarter, if you could just indicate whether you booked any of that in the cost of sales in the quarter, because if I would add back this 43 million your gross margins would be closer to 28%, rather than 12.5. So I was just wondering where you booked that in the P&amp;L and whether that has come in already? That's my first question, I've got a quick follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually you have seen not only looking at this quarter but with the previous quarters, we always book a certain level of provisioning. So taking it completely out would be great because it means we would have absolutely zero obsolescence waste in this company, which is not realistic. But you are right, we have a conservative policy, we are taking provisioning on the, some of the R&amp;D that we are doing. We are taking provisioning also on some of the inventories that we are having against a period low level of sales that we are seeing.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we have a conservative policy there; you could say well, if you would have been more aggressive with the gross margin it'd be higher, yes, it would have been higher, how much is difficult to say, because we are consistent in the application of this policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's quite interesting, thanks. And if I basically summarize what we've heard today, are we talking about sort of ballpark, back of the envelope PKPS of two euros on U.S. GAAP? If I add that 120 million Fran&#xE7;ois was talking about on the IFRS, I get another $0.20. And if I take into account the provisioning that you have on probably capacity-related tools that will come in the course of 2010, you know, you could easily see another 5%, at least a five point based on gross margins once you reverse those provisions. I mean, your EBIT margins could streak spectacularly above 30% in fact in the next peak.</p>

          <p>I think you just wrote the basis for your own report. It's interesting following the line of conclusions, but we cannot comment of course on that. But I think you can probably write something quite interesting on that thesis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Ramel from Exane BNP Paribas. First question, do you expect more bankruptcy in the DRAM, more in DRAM for the year?</p>

          <p>There is a possibility that in Taiwan one or two players would go. And the understanding that we have is if that were the case, the assets may be transferred to one of the four key players that remain at this moment in this industry. And as you know, the four key players are at this moment considered the survivors of the current consolidation. And again the others are going to be aligned to one of the four temps. They can be aligned with a contract of some sort, or they can be aligned just because their assets have been transferred after bankruptcy. So either or doesn't change much in what exactly is happening, which I repeat, these four key players, four large companies are now going to go for a control of this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one follow-up concerning demand, how do you feel the growth curve of your NAND customer is going forward? Because in the past the NAND guys were able to cut the costs by roughly 50% per year, and it seems it is slowing down to roughly 30% per year. We've <mark type="inaudible" /> requiring more little steps for the <mark type="inaudible" />. It seems that actually the cost curve declined for the NAND players, will reduce significantly compared to what happened over the last five years. So how do you see that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very complicated question, because in this business, as you know, cost is a factor of volume and excess capacity. So obviously the NAND guys have been burnt significantly by an excess capacity due to the fact that there were too many players and too much expectation. So now it seems that the players have agreed to be less aggressive than the DRAM guys, so they have been more selective as to their build up of capacity. And I explained that in fact we see a shrinking of capacity more than anything else. And we do not see crazy investments, we only see technology investments.</p>
          <p>So we therefore expect the installed base to correspond to the demand. And therefore by conclusion the cost per chip is going to become, the full cost per chip is going to be under control. Further to that, the design of the chips allows a shrink level which on paper is justified the price points, of that would be allowing new applications like the solid state drive.</p>
          <p>So those guys, it seems at this moment to be under control of their cost curve; as you said yourself, technology goes down and helped them to go down, but mainly, mainly, mainly, they seem to be investing to demand. They don't invest to market share, if you know what I mean.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes it's Banc of America/Merrill Lynch. I guess my first question would just be on the sort of longer-term strategy, which is that as you see some margin expansion going forward and we're hearing very increasingly that your competitors are struggling or falling further behind, what do you see as the key challenges for ASML on the sort of five year view to maintain customer relationships as the competitive environment becomes potentially more beneficial to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a very insightful question. If you haven't guessed it in fact, the last six months for us has been reinforcement of what you said, which is that our technology investment, over-investment, I would say, is starting to pay. The technology requirements are very, very strong, concerning to the customers, and now we're coming up with products, which are absolutely ahead of competition, whether it is in double patterning or it is in EUV. So this creates an aspiration by every customer to have a significant strategic relationship with us and a strategic relationship is usually a better thing than the commodity type relationship.</p>
          <p>So we are thrilled by this way. But it's a beginning, and we have to execute on it, and executing means making sure the machine works and making sure we do not bring any fear to our customers that we will take advantage of the situation in the future. So we have to be always on our toes to offer them the technology but also the best cost. And you've heard Peter spending time explaining that we want our cost structure to be extremely under control and you've heard him say we don't want to be going for any inflation above the current recession level cost more than say, 10%. If we achieve that we will offer to our customers cost, which also allows us to improve our EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>The big negative, the concern that I have, as usual in <mark type="inaudible" />, is we are a euro-based company, and therefore if the macroeconomic trends make the euro "overvalued" due to financial imbalances in the world, we will be having not such an easy time to enrich our margin. That is our concern, obviously. We've been able to live through this in the past five years, I think we've, of you remember, I mentioned the fact that our competitors have been privileged by a disposition of the yen by about 60% in four years or something. We've been able to manage that by still improving our margin and market share. But we would appreciate that it doesn't continues in that sense and that the euro, standardizes or weakens would be good; if the euro again gets too strong then we'll come back at this call and consider this a bit of a problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much, Eric. And just as a follow-up perhaps, could you talk a little bit about the impact of FlexRay and the BaseLiner announcements that came out yesterday on the financials on that sort of one or two year view? How should we think about that as just a margin effect and pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will voluntarily remain conceptual, because the whole holistic lithography, which comes from our acquisition of Brion, is mixed into three things: It's mixed into the price of our machines, which do not, that we do not discount as we used to. So we strengthened our margins through a stronger pricing where we said, no, there is, if that machine is compatible with a port of the software of Brion, then dear customer you cannot get the same discount. The second point is that we are selling of course Brion's stuff and our metrology stuff, et cetera. So there is a bit of sales, which at this moment is still under 100 million, but it is start to be visible. And the third aspect is it makes our machines more competitive with these options, like as you said, the new illuminator, which is a completely pixelized illuminator maintenance machine, another level above our competition.</p>
          <p>So the three factors will, are currently reinforcing demand, and this is why Peter was starting to say while we are going to try to improve our material margin by two to three or four points, and part of it is included into this value generation bank. But again, it's hidden in those three factors.</p>
