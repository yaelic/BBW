        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, it really hurts to report a negative result, but Cat losses even such an extraordinary accumulation and integral part of our business and unlike investment losses, they are the basis for attractive long-term returns on capital in our core P&amp;C Reinsurance business.</p>
          <p>Net Cat losses of &#x20AC;2.7 billion leave their mark on the figures of Q1 and on the annual outlook of course. This is almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion more and &#x20AC;1.8 billion after-tax, above the expected level. On that background, the loss could have been worse. It is lower than it might have been expected. We had a satisfactory investment result of 3.6% and the shareholders' equity dropped by 11% to &#x20AC;20.5 billion, also because of adverse foreign exchange development and increasing interest rates.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual segments, still on slide three, Reinsurance is performing quite well for life business with good investment result, positive mortality experience in North America and therefore a net result of &#x20AC;259 million, which is above the normal quarterly result and cannot be just multiplied by four. Reinsurance is also not that bad in properly-casualty apart from net Cat losses. The combined ratio of 159.4% after retro and after the impact of insurance risks transferred to the capital market is quite high.</p>
          <p>Let me please briefly explain here that in 2008 Munich Re transferred earthquake risks into the capital market for a major Japanese primary insurer using a parametric trigger. Assuming the coverage had been fully triggered the amount of over &#x20AC;200 million affect the loss ratio by 5.4 percentage points in first quarter standalone and 1.4 for the full year.</p>
          <p>The relief of the same amount which is similar to rate for recovery is shown as a write up on derivatives in the investment result. As the transaction is zero-sum gain for us we show you the net combined ratio of 159.4% after adjustment for this loss payment and the return on equity of 3.6% after adjustment for the write up of 0.4%.</p>
          <p>The combined ratio includes 69.2% for net Cat losses. So, excluding net Cat, it would have been 90.2% while benefiting from a level of man-made major losses which was roughly one percentage point below the five year average. Primary insurance had rather low earnings in Q1 due to a negative one-off impact from our Korean business, the result of the ERGO sub group on a consolidated basis was a disappointing &#x20AC;50 million but it is expected to improve at from the second quarter. Munich Health is well on track.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to the development of the shareholders' equity on slide six. We had an overall decrease of &#x20AC;2.5 billion or 11% as a consequence from the following. First, decline of unrealized gains and losses &#x20AC;737 million. This is mainly due to the rise in risk free interest rates. We still have &#x20AC;4.2 billion unrealized gains, including on and off balance sheet reserves and after policy holders and taxes, it is still &#x20AC;3.1 billion, so quite a substantial amount. We had negative foreign exchange developments minus &#x20AC;557 million. This is due to the strong euro at the end of March, which is relevant for balance sheet items. We had therefore a decline of our foreign currency assets and liabilities, mainly relevant here U.S. dollar and Canada dollar.</p>
          <p>Share buybacks were minus &#x20AC;286 million. This is the final tranche of our 2010/11 share buyback program. Nevertheless, our capital position remains strong according to all metrics. The parent company's results and revenue reserves are booked under the German Commercial Code and these benefit from the existence of the claims equalization provision that offset substantial amounts of the net Cat losses, but it will have to be filled up again during the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>This equalization reserve proves again that it has a very positive value for the company and its shareholders. It stabilizes our result and our distribution capacity over time. The economic capital position also suffered from the net Cat losses, but it benefits from the rising risk-free interest rates, unlike in IFRS. This is due to the fact that the decline of the market value of bonds is compensated by the discounting effects on those reserves, which are not discounted under IFRS and by the decline of the value of policyholders' options and guarantees.</p>
          <p>And also our economic risk capital, our capital requirement declined for the lower asset liability mismatch and market risks in primary life and health insurance, which reduces in case of rising interest rates. Hopefully, it will be very soon that these metrics will be relevant for the capital requirements under Solvency II.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, premium development. Our premiums rose by 11.3% to &#x20AC;13 billion. We had &#x20AC;308 million positive foreign exchange development. For the income statement, we use quarterly average exchange rates and here the euro was weaker than in Q1 2010; that means an increase of foreign currency income and expenses and therefore, a positive impact on our turnover figure. We had only a very small impact from M&amp;A. This is mainly the acquisition of our U.S. health insurer Windsor and &#x20AC;940 million from organic change, mainly large volume deals in life and health reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the overview of our well diversified investment portfolio on slide eight. Although we had a slight shift from government bonds to corporate and to covered bonds, the portfolio remains rather stable. We have managed slight duration decrease by closing interest futures, at the beginning of the year in anticipation of a rise in risk free yields. We have a well balanced portfolio. You may see that at the lower part of the slide that we have only a very small duration mismatch taking into account the Group as a whole was countervailing positions of primary and reinsurance.</p>
          <p>As far as the fixed income portfolio is concerned, I can refer to slide nine of the presentation. Our major position are government or same government bonds hence as a weak spot total of 4% of it in Irish, Greek and Portuguese bonds. Thereof three quarters are held by the life and health primary insurance companies with policy holder participation. I would rather not have them, but the exposure is well absorbable in our overall portfolio.</p>
          <p>Overall, our government bond portfolio was reduced by almost &#x20AC;5 billion, one half of it to foreign exchange and interest rate effects, the other half also through active selling. We increased inflation in bonds and cooperates. This is not visible in these numbers, because it was mitigated by foreign exchange effects. The increase in banks is just due to a higher cash position.</p>
          <p>Now, I move on slide ten, for the composition of our investment result, which is inline with the structure of the investment portfolio. The result of &#x20AC;2 billion equals to an annualized return on investment of 4% consisting of &#x20AC;1.9 billion regular income, minus &#x20AC;137 million from write-ups, write-downs mainly from our swaptions. There are derivative instruments of our primary life insurer to hedge against falling interest rates.</p>
          <p>This number also includes the profit from the transfer of insurance risk to the capital markets, which I already mentioned a couple of times, plus 0.4% or a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million. &#x20AC;400 million comes from net capital gains, minus &#x20AC;210 million, a very big number for other investment income and expenses, this include the development of the unrealized gains on the funds for unit-linked life insurance was a negative swing from Q1 2010 to 2011 of &#x20AC;220 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move on to the segment slide, I start with primary insurance page 12. Premiums grew by 1.4%. There was almost no impact from foreign exchange, hence no impact from M&amp;A. Organic change plus &#x20AC;57 million, which is a slight decline in Germany, Italy and Austria and substantial growth from Belgium.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, the development in primary life, premiums declined by 2.9%. We had lower single premium in Germany and abroad and higher regular premiums, but the increase in regular premiums was not enough to compensate for the effects of the single premiums. The technical result improved by &#x20AC;64 million, but this was mainly due to one-off effects, lower costs especially debt write-downs in the preceding year and also a change of method for allocating income to quarters in IFRS, which is always somewhat tricky because we translate German GAAP into IFRS and we have improved methodology with a positive one-off effect.</p>
          <p>Investments results declined by almost &#x20AC;500 million, this is a minus in the net capital gain of &#x20AC;151 million. And the impact from the unit-linked life insurance unrealized gains and losses as I told you before minus &#x20AC;220 million and also the impact from our derivatives for hedge against low interest rate scenarios minus &#x20AC;88 million. By the way this is a negative IFRS income effect, but it is good news because we benefit from the rise in interest rates, because these risks are only partially hedged.</p>
          <p>From these hedges there was also an impact on the consolidated result, which was bottom line minus &#x20AC;17 million, one-seven, which explains the decline of the consolidated results from Q1 2010 to 2011 and we can be relatively satisfied with this net profit of &#x20AC;10 million adjusted for the effect from the swaptions, which is close to a normal net result from our life primary business.</p>
          <p>I skip now the next slides and continue with primary health. And we see a premium growth of 3%, which is not only due to an increase in premium level and insured, but also an increase in the number of insureds for the first time after many quarters following the abolition in Germany from the beginning of 2011 of the three year waiting period, which was introduced for switching to private insurance. So, this has helped with &#x2013; this restriction has been abolished and that brings us a little bit of an upside for comprehensive health insurance. We had higher investment result, and we had a higher technical result and overall, an improvement in the consolidated result of &#x20AC;20 million to &#x20AC;37 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Primary property-casualty, slide 16, premiums up 3.9% growth in Germany and abroad, stronger abroad. Technical result was still suffering from our international business. And as we told to you in March, during the Analysts Conference in London, we have introduced a couple of measures to improve the situation in the three countries, Poland, South Korea, and Turkey and we see already a significant improvement in Poland, whereas the situation in Korea and in Turkey has not really changed, but we only see a deterioration. If we compare to the first quarter of 2010, there is no further deterioration compared to the situation for March.</p>
          <p>We told you that things will improve, and we expect it to happen in the quarter of this year. For the time being we have very bad result from the international business with a combined ratio of 108.4% and a write-down of the goodwill and other items in Korea, which make up for &#x20AC;34 million, &#x20AC;35 million. By contrast, ERGO Germany is performing well with a combined ratio of 91.2%. I skip the next two slides and continue with Munich Health.</p>
          <p>Munich Health shows a pleasing increase of premiums of 22.7% with a very strong focus now on reinsurance coming from the large volume deals in North America, which we had already commented a couple of times. In addition, we see the effect of the Windsor first time consolidation and positive currency contributions.</p>
          <p>Next slide 21. Munich Health shows an increase in the technical result to plus &#x20AC;8 million and an increase in the investment result, mainly due to the increased investment volumes and satisfactory consolidated result of &#x20AC;21 million.</p>
          <p>So, far from my side and now Torsten will continue with reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The excellent reinsurance in Q1 is massively influenced by the extreme and random accumulation of Cat events we have seen. Over the last 21 years I have been in the reinsurance industry, it only maybe two or three times I have seen or I could observe such an accumulation of events, which occurred here with the floods in Brisbane, the earthquake in New Zealand, the Cyclone Yasi in Australia and last but not least earthquake in Japan.</p>
          <p>Despite all these events are explainable and we can see why the losses produced and I can only underline what J&#xF6;rg Schneider said, these losses do hurt. And the Cat losses are certainly part of our business model and they should be acceptable in our business model because they are within our predefined risk tolerances and are fully reflected in our capital model. So, our integrated risk management pays off and what we have seen here are very rare events, seldom events but nevertheless they are within our risk appetite. Hence the business model should be acceptable as long as we get the right and adequate prices for the exposures we carry.</p>
          <p>After such events usual, then we have of course now to consider the underwriting and pricing consequences for the effective lines of business and markets and the impact on the cycle and I will try to give you a bit later our expectation for the coming renewals following this event.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, and I would like to start with the premium development for the reinsurance worldwide. The premium development in Q1 was satisfactory, particularly when we consider the circumstances in which we had to maneuver, we could show a 16.3% growth in our quarterly premiums and more important the composition of that premium growth is important here, 4.1% was the growth in non-life and 12.2% in non-life &#x2013; in Life Re that means, in the segments and lines of business, which were under slight pressure we have only moderately increased our volumes and we have reported in the January renewal that these 4% points in non-life were achieved by extraordinary treaty insolvency relief treaties, which were not in the market before. In Life Re we see the positive impact of our large solvency treaties and of our new business generation in Asia. So, a satisfactory premium in a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Next slide 24, Life Re in addition to the positive development in life reinsurance, also the results are very pleasing here, we could increase our technical results and J&#xF6;rg Schneider mentioned it already, these technical results have positive impact from our results and all &#x2013; by the way all negative one-time development in 2010 were reflected here in the last year's figure therefore the positive trend. And if this trend is sustainable to the full extent, as mentioned it cannot be multiplied by a four, but we will certainly achieve quarterly results on a level higher than the &#x20AC;100 million in Q1 2010 though the truth is probably in between.</p>
          <p>As far as investment results is concerned and I now consider investment results in life and non-life together and you see the very strong increase in these results. There are two specific sectors of contributors, one is the ERGO dividend and another one and particularly for non-life applicable on slide 25, it's a positive one-time contribution from this large earthquake transaction, where &#x20AC;200 million must be considered as a sort of retrocession.</p>
          <p>Non-life, slide 25, the technical result in non-life is of course a full-year reflection of our Cat events, the underlying basic loss ratio or basic combined ratio is fully in line with our expectation is around the 90% if you deduct the large Cat events. And let me also highlight that we did not &#x2013; intentionally did not improve our non-life results by reserve releases.</p>
          <p>Slide 33, the combined ratio in non-life in the multiyear comparison, of course, it shows the contribution of the Cat events and 69% after retrocession, it's a contribution of all these four Cat events. That means that we are far above our long year average of 6.5% of our non-life premium and we are far above our historic five year average, which was &#x20AC;870 million in Q1 in the respective years.</p>
          <p>The question is now, is Cat our problem or is Cat not our problem? How do we judge that? And again, Cat events are part of our business model and my personal opinion is, despite the extraordinary impact in the recent quarter in 2011, our major concern or more important concern refers to the underlying business in a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>On the next slide or various slides, I would now like to answer various questions regarding our underwriting policy for natural catastrophe perils. And in the recent weeks and months, I was asked, for instance, are all these events we have seen &#x2013; and remember the accumulation of Cat events already started one year ago with a large earthquake in Chile and then, the next earthquake in September 2010 in New Zealand and then the four events, which you see here on the current slide.</p>
          <p>Are these events really random or is there any permanently increasing underlying trend, which we have to consider. We discussed this question with our scientists back and forth and we came to the final conclusion and that seems that the market consensus in the scientific community that the underlying trend is not visible. These events are random. And we have, of course to consider that certain earthquake events might change the stresses in the faults &#x2013; in the various faults and might change the probability after such an earthquake. But that is a different issue, the random occurrence &#x2013; the occurrences we have seen are random. That means no systemic trends, particularly not for the earthquake losses. For weather related losses we have a different &#x2013; bit of a different opinion, here we think we have to consider the long-term trends caused by climate change.</p>
          <p>What about our loss estimate for Japan? And as we mentioned already immediately after the event our &#x20AC;1.5 billion loss in net before tax are based on a model. Why, because at that point in time and even today, no reliable loss information from our clients were available. We currently think that, the uncertainty of all the estimations we see, including our own estimations are high. Why, because there are not much more information available and we think it might take up to six months before we have more reliable picture based on hard loss facts. Nevertheless after the three loss information, which we have received from three larger clients and which to some extent were available in the public press, we do not see any reason that we should change our &#x20AC;1.5 billion loss estimation for the Munich Re. So, our &#x20AC;1.5 billion loss is a concern for us.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 28, second question, do these Cat events change our pricing or our risk models? And we have now a different opinion of the pricing when we underwrite these type of risks and why is this important &#x2013; why is it an important question, because remember after Katrina, Rita, Wilma and we the Munich Re and all the other modeling companies in the world had to change the pricing approach. Why, because the food peril was not reflected in the pricing before and we had to consider the North Atlantic oscillation which changes the hurricane probabilities.</p>
          <p>In this case it's different. We come here to the conclusion that our pricing models and risk models remain unchanged. They can remain and must remain unchanged. We do not see a reason to change it. And that applies for both, for the pricing models as mentioned. It also applies however to the total loss distribution for the whole Cat portfolio. This has not changed by these events.</p>
          <p>And as always after such a series of events, we are caught internally try to answer the question, have we underwritten the Cat business worldwide in a sort of profitable way in the last years or not. And the answer is of course, in the year like 2011 after such events we make a considerable loss from our Cat portfolio but over longer periods of time and we took 10 years in this case, actual loss experienced including the events in 2011 are fully in line with our own loss expectation from our Cat book.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, a few words on our underwriting strategy. How do we steer our Cat portfolio, and how we do manage the big exposure versus the smaller exposures, and the question is it possible to earn back such loss within a short period of time? The answer is basically given by our capital model. And, as you know, our capital model tries to improve the diversification in our overall book of business by combining scenarios, which are largely un-correlated. This means we consider not only the Cat business, but particularly the Cat business as uncorrelated scenarios and try to steer them in a way that they build a maximum of diversification.</p>
          <p>How is that achieved? We allocate &#x2013; we calculate the capital requirement for each of the individual scenarios and then we allocate the risk capital back to the individual scenarios in a disproportionate way. That means larger scenarios get a very high allocation of risk capital per unit of risk, per unit of exposure and the medium size scenarios and smaller scenarios get per unit of risk at relatively small allocation of risk capital as is shown here in the left part of the slide.</p>
          <p>By doing that we achieve the following behavior of the portfolio the large peak risk like hurricane in United States or European windstorm they produce disproportionately high share of our return as the small scenarios get a relatively cheap or low contribution of a profit loading. That means when you ask us now what does it mean in the steering and if prices do allow and always under this assumption then despite of that we have limited risk appetite to further increase our exposures for Atlantic hurricane and for European windstorm and some other scenarios. We have however if prices allow a risk appetite to increase our exposures in the smaller and medium size scenarios again to improve our diversification.</p>
          <p>And next slide and I'll leave now the Cat exposures and comes to the renewal. Renewal April 1, is the third biggest renewal date in the non-life portfolio, the &#x20AC;1.1 billion non-life premium, which you see on the left pillar of this slide contributes about 10% to our treaty book. This was up for renewal now. And as you see here, we continued with our strict cycle management. We gave up a significant portion of the business, but we are also able to write some new business which was profitable.</p>
          <p>Question is, of course, was this renewal already positively impacted, yes or no? And why did you give up business in such an environment where rates did increase. First of all, the renewal of April 1, does not fully reflect the market trends which we have seen as a consequence of the Japan earthquake. Why? Because the earthquake occurred on 11th of March and at that point in time, part of our Japanese portfolio and even a much bigger part of our non-Japanese book in the United States and other part of the world was already renewed. And that means, there was not possibility any more to change pricing.</p>
          <p>What is the business which we had to give up as a consequence of our cycle management approach? Actually, it was not the Japanese business, as the business we gave up and which we see in the second class column is mainly contributed by Casualty business in the United States, extended warranty business in South Pacific and Australia, so all business, which was completely independent by the price changes after Japan.</p>
          <p>The price change, which we achieved in the portfolio, net of exposures after all exposure changes is plus 1.2%. That is better, considerably better than in the January 1 renewal. If you split this 1.2% into a worldwide &#x2013; into a Japanese part, then one can summarize it in a way that the non-Japanese business was basically flat in terms of pricing for plus minus zero. And the Japanese book of business despite a larger portion of already renewed business at the date of the earthquake improved by 7.5% and that includes everything non-proportionate and proportionate business.</p>
          <p>One additional comment in the premium projection here, of the April 1 renewal, we do not show any possible and very likely premium increase from the proportionate book of business in Japan. Here we only show what we have concluded and what we have negotiated with the client. We are, however very sure that the considerable proportionate book, which also covers the earthquake will see significant original rate changes &#x2013; rate increases in Japan, so this will then certainly come on top.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 31, an overview of price changes before 11th of March, before the Japanese earthquake and after the earthquake in Japan. You see in the column before 11th of March, the negotiated or anticipated price changes, single-digit price reductions, which basically followed the trend of the previous renewals and are an indicator of the softening market we have seen. After 11th of March that our prices changed considerably, and particularly you'll see that here in the second and third line for the excess of loss programs, where possible and not finished yet. We achieved price increases in the order between 20%, 25% and 50%. So, particularly, those programs &#x2013; earthquake programs were a strong &#x2013; a strong loss was assumed, when we achieved the 50%.</p>
          <p>In the second row, there's wind and combined treaties are shown here. For the pure wind treaties, which do not conclude any element of earthquake even here price change is in the order of 5% were possible. Then the earthquake proportionate treaties, I mentioned already, here it only shows up to minus 4% price change and minus means positive here for the reinsurer of the change in commission, reduction in commission. So, originally rate changes will come on top. There are certain parts of the portfolio, which are not renewed yet, mainly earthquake cover. Here we agreed together with the client that we postpone the renewal to a later date to get a bit better information first on the basis of which we have more a reliable renewal negotiation, so that will happen in the next one to three months.</p>
          <p>Slide 32, and here I will try to cover the question what does the earthquake loss in Japan and what do the other losses mean for the further cycle, for the further renewal dates in the remaining months of this year. And of course we have only now one major renewal date left and that is July 1. July 1 is the second biggest renewal date for our portfolio and here typical Cat markets and Cat segments like USA, Caribbean, Australia, and New Zealand will come up for renewal. Therefore we have shown them here in the table. And of course it is very uncertain what will happen. It's a bit too early to give a very definite and final projection, but as always after such events, the market will react in the affected segments. And we have a very strong expectation and that is also supported by various indications in the market that the Cat segment will react now and the pricing will change.</p>
          <p>For the Cat renewal in the United States, we expect low double-digit price increase for Cat business. That means that is the sort of conversion from price reduction trend to a price increase now. For Australia and New Zealand, price change is more reliable. Why, because here we have seen the losses during last 12 months. Here we expect very significant double-digit price increases, probably in the order of 50% or even significantly higher. And then we have the remaining book of business for Japan, the remaining earthquake treaties. Here we expect price increases, price changes very similar to the price increases. We have seen under the earthquake program a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p>One segment which is a bit more uncertain, but where we have some positive indications is the large global commercial business particularly when you have risk in Cat prone areas, and here we see all the first times of price increases because these risk needs a worldwide capacity. So, if these price changes should occur, Munich Re is of course well prepared and is very nicely prepared to participate in these price changes, which then should improve our portfolio composition and our profitability. I will however underline that we do not depend our underwriting strategy on such price changes. We are prepared to manage our portfolio in all possible market environments and will at any point in time stick to our profitability.</p>
          <p>Back to you, J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. Let me close with Munich Re's outlook for the financial year on slide 34. Compared to our Analyst Conference on 11th of March, the guidance for the individual segments remains basically unchanged. We will strive for a combined ratio of 97% over the cycle, but given the losses in the first quarter this is no longer achievable for 2011. The combined ratio of primary insurance Property-Causality should end up below 95%. Munich Health will make a positive earnings contribution, while concluding its consolidation phase. The return on investment of slightly below 4%, guidance remains unchanged. The only change is the indication for the Group's premiums written, which have been increased by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;47 billion to &#x20AC;49 billion. This reflects further large volume deals in life and health reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Profits, we expect ERGO to contribute &#x20AC;450 million to &#x20AC;550 million to the Munich Re Group results, the negative one-offs of first quarter will be compensated in Q2 by a positive one-off gain from disposal of real estate. For the Group, originally, we gave a figure of &#x20AC;2.4 billion, this was the forecast and at the same time de facto form of target. The current burden from natural catastrophes after tax is &#x20AC;1.8 billion higher than the figure we project for single quarter. So, naturally, the &#x20AC;2.4 billion is no longer achievable. We have missed our target and are now trying to achieve the best result possible without setting a new hurdle.</p>
          <p>With Life Re, Munich Health and ERGO, Munich Re will be able to partly counterbalance the catastrophic losses from P&amp;C Reinsurance and particularly after major losses as you heard from Torsten, P&amp;C Re benefits from the improvement in term. And with the current tendency of rising interest rates, which bring for us higher returns on one side in the long run and lower risk capital requirements on the other side, going forward we should come closer to our long-term target of 15% return on risk adjusted capital.</p>
          <p>With that, back to Christian.</p>

          <p>Very much. Good afternoon, just two quick ones, please. J&#xF6;rg, first of all, you mentioned the excellent capital position and the pieces moving in opposite directions, so the interest rate positive and the Cat losses negative. Are you implying that the position should be still about broadly the same as where it was at year end? And then the second question is, in the P&amp;C Reinsurance premiums, is there a significant contribution of reinstatement premiums coming in this quarter? Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Spencer, on the &#x2013; your first question, economic capital position, I wouldn't say it's equal but it's come close to. Yes so, one hand we have the positive impact from the rising interest rates, especially but on the other hand we have the enormous catastrophe losses, which are a one-to-one weakening of the available financial resources. So, on balance, overall, quite close to the position of the end of the year, but not fully. Torsten, on Property-Casualty reinstatement premium.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A very quick question, one is on the dividend. I've been speaking with your team in the past month and a bit and on the 11th of March, I remember, and I'm sure my memory is not very accurate, so it's just a memory, that you term the buyback as a kind of buffer and, indeed, is paused or gone for now, but you said you were really very, very committed and it was part of your DNA or business model, whatever, to the dividend.</p>
          <p>When I spoke to your team immediately after Japan it was &#x2013; lots of cautious noises. And then suddenly today I was reminded that Munich hadn't cut its dividend since 1969. So, I'm getting the impression that you're getting more committed again to the dividend.</p>
          <p>So, any light on that would be hugely helpful. I was a little bit puzzled by the second kind of step back on the buyback immediately after Japan. And then on the Life Reinsurance I'm a bit puzzled by the comments here. And I must admit again maybe I wasn't listening closely enough. I picked up &#x20AC;252 million is good number, but then &#x2013; no, no, it's not recurring, you can't multiply it by four. And then just now I got the impression that you were saying life reinsurance partly offsets the non-life reinsurance, which gives me an impression that it can continue like that. I'm incredibly puzzled if that's the takeaway from this, so maybe a little bit of guidance would help. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, let me start with the latter. And I thought of a compensation in the form of any positive contribution to the bottom line, and this is substantially positive. And when we look at the numbers, we are very pleased about the Life Re, but I'd just say, please don't multiply it by four because it's &#x2013; as Torsten said, it's also impacted by gains from disposal, which can't be repeated and by good mortality experience where we do not know whether it's going to be repeated. We also do not know the opposite. But we do not want to exaggerate here the expectations. That is all.</p>
          <p>Second on the dividend, yes, we don't want to cut the dividend. That is true. Second, as I said before, the catastrophe losses will be absorbed by the equalization reserve. That means that our revenue reserves, which are relevant for our distribution capacity will remain intact as long as no further very serious event will happen in the course of this year. It's premature now to talk about the dividend. But we would very much like to keep the dividends on the existing level as long as the underlying performance of the company is good.</p>
          <p>And I would say it is good because these catastrophes are part of the business and provide us with additional business opportunities. But that is all I can say at the moment because we will have to see how the year goes on from now. But I can promise you high distributions in whatever form and dividend rather than share buybacks are very important for this management.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. Just on this &#x2013; I just wanted to ask on your appetite for realizing gains. You mentioned &#x20AC;3 billion number &#x2013; &#x20AC;3.1 billion net unrealized gains still sitting on and off balance sheet. And why I ask is because last year we had the corporate bonds in the first quarter, this year a lot of gains in the equities and, obviously, these are a handy tool to offset large losses a bit, so any guidance on that, please?</p>
          <p>And second question is, from the March presentation, I do remember there was a lot of caution on releasing reserves and we were heading into that 2007 and later underwriting years, but surely, if you could elaborate why you do not intentionally &#x2013; as Torsten said, do not intentionally release reserves. Was it just because we're heading into potentially more losses or more buffers, or is it just shares and prospects? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vinit, let me start. Okay. Thank you. So, the gains &#x2013; the net capital gains we had in the first quarter were not done to compensate for the losses. And there was another reason, a very tactical &#x2013; a technical reason that they were deferred &#x2013; sorry, there were tax losses out there which had to be compensated and that was one reason why we took a couple of gains in the U.S. But a very technical reason not to compensate anything from the losses and we are also do not have any intentions here.</p>
          <p>Up to now, the investment portfolio is managed purely on two considerations; one is asset liability management and second is taking tactical small steps according to our judgment where the market is at the moment. It's not P&amp;L management what we are currently doing. Then to Torsten, with I think in tendency good news from the reserving side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what happens after last reserve review in the last quarter of 2010 in Q4 and during the first quarter of the new year, we do not get new reserve assessments from our clients, but we do compare our expected reserve changes versus the actual figures, those of the quarterly accounts which we receive from our clients. And this comparison, which is still based on the information of our clients from last year is &#x2013; careful word is positive.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless and therefore my comment, we decided not to re-change of overall IVNRs why? Because we think one quarter is not good enough to make such a decision and we would like to wait for harder information for &#x2013; the full in-depth information which we will receive during the third and fourth quarter from our clients and then we will see whether this trend is further supported or not, but first indications are positive nevertheless no reserve released.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, team. Two questions, the first one just on the claims equalization provision and the impact. Have you &#x2013; am I right in saying that that's only done at the end of the year, so there's no real way of giving us any update on the ins and outs from that? Because, from memory, I think if we look at 2005 there were actually quite a lot of additions or one-off additions in 2005 to the claims equalization provision which actually offset a lot of the releases. And looking at your underlying combined ratio, which is actually quite strong, it's quite possible you might have the same scenario in 2011, which means the actual net impact of the release for the life losses may be neutralized a little bit. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the asset mix or the investments mix you've hedged out your equity position quite strongly in the first quarter. I just wondered whether you might give us a little bit more guidance as to the rationale and the sort of timescales, if you have one, to that hedging and whether we should expect that to be unwound any time soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. Your second question the hedging of our equities portfolio. We did that before the Japanese earthquake and then another storm and after the Japanese earthquake, the latter for our Japanese portfolio partially at least. And this was due to our rather skeptical critical expectation about further performance. Up to now the position hasn't been changed there so we are still in the order of 2.8 percentage points, a little bit upside perhaps, but no major change here.</p>
          <p>And second &#x2013; or your first question about the claims equalization provision, it is correct that we calculate it only on an annual basis because we do not officially set up accounts on our balance sheet on an German GAAP basis on a quarterly basis. But we have acquired sound prognosis, which we do quarter-by-quarter and the very clear drive of this equalization reserve has been and will be the business booked under the line of fire.</p>
          <p>And fire is the driver for all the volatility because it also takes into account the coverages for floods and for windstorm and therefore we can be pretty sure that we will have a very release of that reserve. So, if we would set up the balance sheet right now, almost the full and extra losses of the first quarter would be compensated by a release of this revenue reserve. Does it answer your question, Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess I'm just thinking back to 2005 and I think you had a &#x20AC;1 billion release off the &#x2013; from Katrina into Wilma.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yet you had another &#x20AC;800 million, could have come the other way from things like credit and aviation and a little bit in fire as well, actually. So, it netted it down to not so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is true, yes. But has also to do with reserve strengthening in that unfortunate year, which were &#x2013; as Torsten said before, we do not expect for this one.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, I have two questions, please. If I could just come back to the Life Re result, I appreciate your openness in saying that we shouldn't multiply the result by four. But I do remember in the March presentation, you had targeted a technical &#x2013; yes, that's right, a technical profit for the year of &#x20AC;400 million. And now Torsten on the call was saying, on top of the &#x20AC;150 million booked in Q1, you're hopeful that the number will be more than &#x20AC;100 million per quarter going forward.</p>
          <p>So, I just wanted to ask, did I hear that correctly? And if you just &#x2013; if that's true, why have you increased &#x2013; seemingly increased your outlook for Life Re? And then, secondly, if I could ask, I guess going back to the revenue reserves and asking about your ability to pay future dividends, J&#xF6;rg, you mentioned that you'll need to restock the claims equalization over the next few years. I was a little bit surprised when you said few years. I thought the formula, not allowed, but the formula required the restocking to happen over a much longer period.</p>
          <p>And I just wondered will the restocking of the claims equalization reserve depress the revenue reserves in future years and, therefore, impair your ability to grow the dividend going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, Torsten here. I'll start with Life Re. For the &#x20AC;400 million, you remember are correct to the correct figure, maybe we are slightly above so we will see it again but the smallest right figure and &#x20AC;150 million for the first quarter and then not the same &#x20AC;150 million but &#x20AC;100 million plus or something like that for the remaining three quarters is the figure which was &#x20AC;400 million or bit higher, so that it is inline with the figure we gave a few weeks ago. Now, that &#x2013; maybe I [slacked] up on that, but not explainable at this point in time I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, you are right, with the claims equalization reserve, there it is based on the premium level per line of business and on the volatility of in this line of business for a period of 15 and up to 30 years. Yes, so and this is true, but we rather think here little bit more short-term because we can project it easier and there we expect a triple digit drain &#x2013; triple digit low to mid triple digit drain for the next couple of years there per year on a net basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I don't have enough visibility on the rest of your parent company earnings to know if that poses a problem for your abilities to keep your dividend flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it shouldn't, yes. On one hand it is in minus, quite clearly on the other hand, we very much hope that the impact from the nat &#x2013; and we're confident that the impact from the natural catastrophe brings a stabilization of the reinsurance terms and therefore we can earn more than what we have to push into that reserve going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And before we continue, I would like to come back talking &#x2013; I would like to come back to the Spencer Horgan's question which was still open, that was the question, have we booked reinstatement premiums in Q1? Situation is as follows, and there are &#x2013; there is a small amount, a very small amount of reinsurance premiums for the New Zealand and Australia events that is booked as a low double digit million number and but we have nothing booked for the very large Japan event. And why not?</p>
          <p>And there is a simple reason, when the earthquake occurred on 11th of March, then for technical reasons all our booking systems were already closed, so we didn't touch the premiums yet at this point in time, but decided of course to make an assumption and estimation for the loss which we have to assume and to build that into our figures on top so to speak. And therefore the &#x20AC;1.5 billion the figure included reinstatement premiums for the Japan not yet. They will be shown in the next quarter or the next two quarters for the effective treaties and then based on more prudent information from our clients.</p>
          <p>One additional comment I would like to make because you ask this question now and I would like to underline that we never &#x2013; neither, in this case nor in other cases offset, or deduct reinsurance premiums from our loss and estimations. We keep them completely apart and separate and sometimes even book them in different quarters like here now. And why do I mention this because sometimes not often but sometimes it's a practice to talk the loss a bit smaller in the reinsurance market. We don't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I can add that the strong increase in non-life premium in the first quarter might also be due to a technical effect that the allocation of income to the various quarters is not always a precise art. So, we will have to look again into that and there might be a small correction in the next couple of quarters. Please bear with us for the moment about that question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. I have &#x2013; one of my questions is already answered, so I only have one question. I was just wondering whether or not you can offer any kind of commentary, and sorry if I missed anything, on price expectations beyond Property Catastrophe areas, in particular for Casualty and Specialty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to give an answer here, that is big question mark to be honest. We don't make &#x2013; we haven't made any projections in that direction. My general view is and that is more guess or mere small feeling that the farther you are away from the original event in terms of line of business or segment, the less likely it is that prices will change and will react. That is my view now.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, I talk to the underwriters and I said &#x2013; if we were now &#x2013; if we decide &#x2013; let's say we decided now to go to our clients and would like to change the credit prices or Specialty line of business, then of course clients wouldn't have any sort of understanding for this because they had their hard market time already one near ago. This is a very necessary reaction to the financial crisis and the considerable losses they have produced. But they don't need &#x2013; so to speak a second hard market.</p>
          <p>And you can argue now whether this is a good or bad sign when unrelated lines of business or local markets and unrelated from these Cat exposures do not respond. In principle, I would say that this is a sort of sound reaction that problems are tackled or changed where they occur and not that we don't see any sort of this very worldwide upward cycle or downward cycle movement like early of '90s or so.</p>
          <p>I do not expect it in anymore and therefore my last comment we will respond and change our portfolio wherever necessary and irrespective of market price changes which we welcome and like of course we will do whatever is necessary.</p>

          <p>And Maciej and please Torsten, apologize me, to add something with a very primitive eye of a CFO. Many companies, many primary insurers have brought up their sales retention quite drastically in the last couple of years. And they will get their questions from their Board of Management and from their supervisory authorities and perhaps after the events of the third quarter, these questions will be more pressing. And therefore, I very much hope and believe in an overall positive climate for also lines of business and geographies, which are far away from these events.</p>

But J&#xF6;rg, I'm just trying to understand why you're not giving a new profit number for 2011 outlook, because you've basically told us for the individual business units, apart from P&amp;C Reinsurance, that nothing's really changed. The Group return on investment hasn't really changed.</p>
          <p>I appreciate we've had a large catastrophe loss, but you've given us your estimate of that number. You can make an estimate of normalized, whatever normalized is, Cat losses for the rest of the year. So, in your reluctance to give a 2011 new profit number, just clarify what is the greatest uncertainty? Is it further Cat losses, or is it inflation of existing Cat loss estimates?</p>
          <p>I just don't really understand, given your confidence in the business units, why you're not giving a new profit target. Second question, for Torsten, could you clarify again where you think you've got appetite to increase aggregate exposure in Nat Cat? I was a little confused by your comments. I think you were suggesting you had no appetite for more U.S. Nat Cat but you have for rest of world. Could you just clarify what you meant by that? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I understand your remark quite well. And I do not have a good explanation, I must admit, let me try. First, I'm a bit ashamed to come up with the very low number. Second, against this lower number, which is more or less a calculation of what we provided you with today, any change from what could happen in the course of the year could have a major impact &#x2013; a major relative impact could translate into a let's say 30% or 50% or even 50% deviation which would cause us to come with the profit warning or a negative profit warning &#x2013; the warning of an increase in profit.</p>
          <p>This is the reason why we behaved here a little bit opportunistically and say the situation seems to be quite clear. We have an extra loss, which we have calculated quite precisely and we do not have new information so everybody should come to his own conclusion. So, please understand our reluctance here. Torsten?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, question. Where do we limit our risk appetite and where are we prepared if price allows to expand? Your assumption is correct and the top scenarios which falls under this very limited risk appetite and do not allow from our side a further expansion is U.S. hurricane and &#x2013; U.S. and Caribbean hurricane, European windstorm and we also would put into this category California earthquake and the Japanese earthquake and windstorm exposures. So, here we are probably in sort of our upper end.</p>
          <p>When we look at other hurricane exposure, Chile, Australia, South America, New Zealand, various flood periods in Europe. These are examples for perils or exposure scenarios where we have an appetite to increase. But again that is an explanation from our capital model and indispensable precondition is always that we achieve necessary prices. That was the case in Chile and particularly after Chile, after the event last year we have &#x2013; here we expanded our exposures. That might be the case for Australia, we will see.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, thank you. Two questions, first of all, on your Retro protection I was &#x2013; I must admit that I was a little bit surprised by the fact that your Cat bond took a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million. Can you give us an update on your Retro protection Cat bond side costs, et cetera, which may be available or are available for the remainder of the year?</p>
          <p>Second question, your mortality result in Life Re, you said that you have experienced a good mortality experience in the first quarter. That is contrary to the mortality experience of a larger competitor of yours located to the west of you. Can you give us an idea where it comes from, from what regions? Is it across the border? Where does it come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, Torsten here. Let met start with the Munich Re retro program 2011. And we have to differentiate here and I would like to underline that. The Cat bond, which we have explained here is not &#x2013; was not a decision or protection for the Munich Re portfolio. That is not the case. The Cat funds, which is here shown is the figure particularly is the assets &#x2013; on the asset side as a recovery from the retro market, actually it's an ILS transaction.</p>
          <p>It's a combined transaction for &#x2013; it's a transaction for a Japanese client, and we only have this Cat fund recovery because we gave the client the original Cat cover. The Munich Re is here a transformer. We fulfill here a transformer function. These are two combined transactions, not separable. Therefore this is not a Munich Re retro idea, so to speak. That is a service for a client. We have economically zero position in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you earn the fee from it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fee from it and we have the losses, which is normally reflected in the loss combined ratio and then the other part of the same transaction is on the asset side and therefore deducted on both parts of the balance sheet. So, that in not Munich Re philosophy, and not part of our retro philosophy here.</p>
          <p>And when you ask us what is our retro program, our real retro program, so to speak, which helps us to protect our Munich Re portfolio here, everything what we mentioned in the past is still true and Munich Re has only very limited retro covers in place. Why? Because we have a very strong capital position and we only buy retro in the free market, even traditional way or through ILS transactions where the price we can achieve is fully supported by the incoming price, by the price of our incoming business.</p>
          <p>So, it means only if our capital conservation, our capital model, allows to accept such a retro transaction then we go for it. How big is our retro protection, that is a very difficult question because we have not one limit in place, our retro program is sort of patch work program. So, have certain retro cover pieces in place for Europe, certain pieces for U.S. windstorm, certain pieces for Japan, and then for specific areas, we have some ILS transactions in place.</p>
          <p>You could say, depending on the region, it's between &#x20AC;200 million and &#x20AC;500 million in case of a worst case event. And how much of this depending on the regions &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;500 million is to replace, at least for each region one full limit because only for earthquake the retro cover did respond now.</p>
          <p>For all other losses which we have shown in Q1, we could not take advantage of our retro program. That means at least one full limit, it's in place for all areas, in some cases where we have the external protection in place or where we have specific regional covers, even two limits. That's it from my side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Fabrizio from Kepler. And I have, actually, two questions. One is on bond and the second is on the renewals. On the bond the question is about your exposure in corporate banking, which is 44% in cash, as well as the inflation-linked bond of 10%, which I was no longer able to spot in your chart. Here, if you simply could give some colors on why it is.</p>
          <p>Second is about the renewals. Thinking to the prices going up 7.5% within the July renewal, or hoping that they go up from 7.5% in line with Japan, could we expect by end of year the renewals be double digit, which means actually that you also go for some volume increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I &#x2013; Torsten here. May I ask &#x2013; and you asked for the outcome considering all this effect for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The total outcome actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course still bit early and difficult to project, because it really depends on whether our forecast or our projection in terms of rate changes will materialize, but let's put it this way to make sort of qualified judgment now. In the January renewal, we renewed two-thirds of our treaty book and this was the biggest renewal date during the course of the year. And for this nature renewal date and because of the softening cycle we increased a 0.1% price change for our book. That was almost a flat renewal, which was under the circumstances in the market environment from our view a success.</p>
          <p>Now we have another renewal date behind us that is Japan, as mentioned a certain smaller part of the earthquake portfolio is still open, yet for this renewal date we achieved 1.2 percentage points rate change, which would reflect in correspondingly improvement of the combined ratio of this specific business which was renewed. And so, this altogether means from these two renewal dates, we achieved price change between zero and 1.2% now after these two dates. Now, open question mark is the July renewal and what we achieve then, but you can make a judgment now irrespective of the final outcome.</p>
          <p>The full year price change will be a low single digit figure at the end of the day. That is very prudent in my opinion to say, because you need a larger portfolio if you would like to change the full portfolio in non-life that is not possible by July renewal, which only contributes &#x20AC;1.7 billion of renewed premiums.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, single digit is the best projection which we could give now and then of course it depends very much how the remaining business particularly the basic or the traditional business will develop over the next 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, I explained &#x2013; I put my question not a very right way too. The question is, could you, through volume, compensate this in order to have the renewals going up to double digit? Is the demand actually for volume higher after Japan, or high enough actually to have you grow at double-digit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will show larger volume in 2011, but I would never expect that the volume as such compensates profitability or deficiencies in the profitability. The volume in 2011 from best point of view now is so far it's flat over all renewal dates and would it be &#x2013; let's say underwriting philosophy to change that that means to write more volume to compensate profitability, also in our opinion not.</p>
          <p>So, we would also always stick to our underwriting decision on the basis of relative profitability. Of course, when there is a chance to expect, we would like to do that. But as mentioned, this philosophy would not apply for the U.S. scenarios as we have a limited risk of the types there. Here we would prefer to increase our profitability in relative terms, which would increase our premium volume, but would not be supported by expansion of our portfolio. Does that answer your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fabrizio Croce, I hope that I understood your questions correctly. First, how much corporate do we have, some &#x20AC;15 billion plus an additional exposure &#x2013; economic exposure from derivatives of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. And our inflation linkers are roughly &#x20AC;8 billion, which makes up for 10% of the government portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Thomas Noack from WestLB. Just two short questions, first one on Life Re. You mentioned that strong growth in Life Re is due to large volume deals. Are these deals also comparable to the solvency-related deals we have seen in Q4 last year? Or are these new deals more traditional normal Life Re business with higher margins?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Munich Health. You stated a declining premium volume for Sterling in Q1. Actually, my understanding was that Windsor Health Group should support the business model of Sterling. So, when do you expect to see growing volume at Sterling again with the, let's say, support of Windsor Health? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question, I can easily answer, yes, you're right. That is similar to the other large volume deals, mainly solvency relief character. Second, Munich Health, exactly true, the premium income of Sterling, our health insurer &#x2013; our existing health insurer in the United States declined because Sterling has been very active in the Medical Advantage business and there the subsidies have been cut dramatically.</p>
          <p>And the overall framework has been changed to &#x2013; in an unfavorable way and that is the reason why we did the Windsor acquisition, to be stronger in the HMO business type, which support also our business with existing clients. So, we see synergies in the best sense here. And we are confident that we can develop our portfolio favorably for the combination of Windsor and Sterling going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd just like to ask a couple of specific questions. You mentioned a positive change in health insurance in Germany, which &#x2013; at the regulatory level. And I just wondered &#x2013; which helped an increase in volume there. And I just wondered if you could expand on what exactly that was and whether this &#x2013; and what the outlook now is for regulation for that business and for the German private health insurance model. The threats that were there to it, have they receded?</p>
          <p>And the second question is &#x2013; I think it may be a familiar refrain. But you're one of the very, very few large insurers left which still have the significant consolidation column in the segment reporting. And I am familiar with how it arises, but I wondered if you could give us some indication of where it would go if it was allocated out to the other segments and if there's any prospect of it disappearing in future reporting. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tony. On your second question, the huge consolidation effect now, is due to the fact that reinsurance parent company is proud owner of ERGO of the primary insurance and has received a very substantial dividend of &#x20AC;259 million in the first quarter. This is the main reason here and there is also some reinsurance across segments and there are dividend payments within primary insurance from one entity to the other and they do not all belong to the same segment, because the holding company ERGO Versicherungsgruppe AG which is the sub group holding company is booked here in the Property-Casualty segment. So, overall it's a bit disturbing and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask &#x2013; does that mean if you were to &#x2013; if what we talked about, dividend from ERGO to the parent company and the parent company to the Property Casualty column, that if we were to get rid of it, we'd knock it out to the Property and Casualty column?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be reduced by a Life and Property Casualty reinsurance. There the investment result is increased by the dividend and its divided by the two &#x2013; among the two via an artificial key, unfortunately can't be done in a different way. You other question was about health insurance in Germany. We had an increase for our comprehensive primary insurance business due to the fact that there was an obligatory waiting period.</p>
          <p>In Germany, you are normally insured in the social scheme and only as of a certain income you are allowed to move to private insurance. And in 2007, there was a new stipulation that you have to have this high income for three years before you can move. These three years were very important for us because people grew older and created families and so on. So, therefore with the evolution of this waiting period, we have better access to young, well earning employees that is in essence the change.</p>
          <p>And it's a challenge anyway, because this comprehensive private insurance is always under political pressure. In the long run, we are very much relying on our very strong supplementary private health insurance business that means, coverages which are supplementary to the social scheme and which will gain an importance since the social scheme is deadly under-financed and therefore it will have to cut down the medical provision for the insured people and, at the same time, increasing the incentive for them to buy an additional private health coverage. Therefore, we are in the short-term skeptical about this line of business. In the long run, we believe that private health insurance will be one of the fastest growing areas in insurance overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, should we take the concession, if you like, of relaxing your waiting period as a relaxation of political pressure on the private health insurance companies I am familiar with? Or would that be the wrong way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I wouldn't be so optimistic. It's a good step in the right direction, but I don't know whether many more steps will be made here. Therefore, I do not want to speculate here, it's a difficult situation. So, far with it perhaps just a clarification, I said that the roughly &#x20AC;260 million capital gain from the Singapore real estate is divided among the various segments of ERGO, so the net effect is over &#x20AC;100 million, but not close to the &#x20AC;260 million that is what I wanted to confirm, again. So, thank you very much. I do not think that we &#x2013; there is another question, sorry.</p>
