          <p>Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Sberbank Full Year 2010 IFRS Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today on Wednesday, the 23rd of March 2011. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. This is Anton Karamzin. I'm the CFO of Sberbank, and I'm glad to welcome you to our annual results call. We will present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended 31st of December 2010.</p>
          <p>I will start up with a brief run up of the numbers. We are expecting our CEO, Mr. Herman Gref, to join us a little bit later. He is in a sort of out of plan meeting with some of the senior government officials. So unfortunately, his expected timing of return from that is somewhat unexpected for us. But I'm sure we will, in the mean time, keep everyone entertained with the best answers we can provide on whatever questions you may have on our financial statement.</p>
          <p>I will just briefly mention that the presentation with the results that accompany the financial statements for ease of your reference and use during this call is, as usual, on our website and it was mailed on our standard IR distribution mail list.</p>
          <p>And we'll start with the numbers. Our net profit for the year 2010 has totaled RUB 181.6 billion, which is RUB 8.42 per ordinary share, as compared to RUB 24.4 billion last year, which was RUB 1.1 per ordinary share last year in 2009. We have recorded return on average equity of 20.6%. Our cost income ratio remained strong at 42.4% versus 35.4% in 2009. And our core capital adequacy ratio as per Basel I was 11.2% &#x2013; sorry, 11.9% and total capital adequacy was 16.8% as of the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have officially disclosed the financial statements in the evening of this past Monday, giving you a little bit of time to have a reading to the numbers and to help formulate whatever questions that they may &#x2013; of course, we apologize for technical glitch, which caused us to disclose it on the website a couple of hours later from the announced time. And I guess from now on, we should be ready to open it up for your questions, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alex Kantarovich from J.P. Morgan. Anton, I have three questions, one is from net interest margins in fourth &#x2013; Q4. You are saying that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:26) after softening in Q3 should be &#x2013; increase more stable, so checking temperature after Q4, where do we go from here directionally, flattish, down or up? My second level is on the capital adequacy. What level would you consider as optimal, which you intend to maintain? And question number three, is on level of CapEx for the next couple of years. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, thank you for your questions. Net interest margin has some &#x2013; for the fourth quarter that we have reported, has included both some seasonality and some one-off number &#x2013; one-off event. This seasonality is normally caused by the fact that the fourth quarter is the busiest month. And also that the inflation has started to come back again, starting from some time fourth quarter. One-off numbers, which is also to the extent related to the seasonality, ensures that most of the effort in terms of bad debt recovery are also kind of stuck, lined up against the &#x2013; closer to the end of the year and we tend to recover large numbers of &#x2013; over the interest and penalty payments on post-year loans. But the loans are closer to the end of the year. So there were some of the spikes there lined up for November and December, which shown good results on recovery of the interest which contributed to the margin. The reported margin for the fourth quarter as we have shown is 6.7%.</p>
          <p>The first couple of months of our results published under Russian account in 2011 suggest that stripped off from that seasonality, we're probably going to roughly go back. I can only refer to obviously Russian numbers at the moment. They are not entirely comparable, but that will be roughly 6.1% and the outlook for the rest of the year is that what &#x2013; before, we've issued kind of an outlook of about 6.1%, 6.3% margin for the full year 2011. We would probably only slightly revise it upwards to 6.4% &#x2013; 6.2%, 6.4% at this point in time with no major revision of our outlook.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital adequacy, while this is the question where it's clearly visible that ours is not necessarily overly excessive and especially given the fact that we're recording decent return on equity, but we view that there should be some good reason to revisit our targeted capital adequacy ratio once we have a bit clear understanding of what growth matter they're expecting us beyond 2011, what potentially our M&amp;A appetite should be and how much capital currency do we &#x2013; will we need for that. And then after we have fulfilled a recommendation by our supervisory board to update or to formulate our dividend policy within the nearest month to reflect these views for few coming years. So at this point in time, I probably will not be ready to indicate what specific level that we might consider comfortable for the next two, three years. But we're probably months away &#x2013; two, three, four months away from us being able to give such an indication at some point &#x2013; some in the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, we are to see our CapEx to continue its growth roughly at a pace that it has demonstrated from 2009 to 2010. And if you look at the Page 48 of our statement, it shows that additions way back in 2009 were RUB 52.5 billion, additions in 2010 were RUB 63 billion. The reason for that is that on our five-year investment strategy &#x2013; reformation strategy that we formulated back in 2008, we're exactly kind of halfway through, 2011 is year three. And this is where you actually use three in a four of a five-year transformation period. It is where you actually invest rather more money because years one and two, you take the low hanging fruit of productivity gains without investing very much. And you also do the intellectual work of preparing yourself to spend the money wisely and in a very well controlled manner. Years three and four, you do most of the investment and then you start seeing first results in years &#x2013; first material results in years three, four and five.</p>
          <p>So that is why we are saying that we will continue to grow, but at the same point in time, I will moderate that with a couple of commentaries. First, our IT spend, which is significant part of it, in terms of proportions to the other cost items on our P&amp;L, is comparable to relatively modest numbers that the best banks in the world are showing and the best banks, the one that aren't really undergoing a big transformation at the moment in terms of IT. So we're starting from a reasonably good shape in terms of the proportion and we have also, in the past couple of years have shifted the accent from buying mostly hardware and spending less time on software as was the case before 2008. So we've &#x2013; in 2009, 2010, we're doing much more software investment and somewhat holding back on the hardware, so in order to make sure that the next wave of hardware purchases are sensible and well-calculated. So we will be returning to more or less classic split between hardware and software spend on IT within 2011, 2012, as you would see in any decent and efficient bank.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that we do is the reformatting of our branches. Again, with 20,000 branches, we're not doing everything. We've invented the new format. We've piloted two or three of them already. This year, we're going to build &#x2013; completed building the first 20 branches within the <mark type="ph" /> 7-8 standard format (13:18) that will be a couple of branches of new format in different types of cities and towns. But then afterwards, we're going to be gradually converting branches into the new format to spread out all of that investment over quite a number of years, at least, five, six years, if not, longer so that we don't incur big bumps. So again, we think we always choose a bank to do that investment wisely to make sure that it extracts us productivity gains. But we're not planning to overly accelerate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. Thank you. And, if I may, just one follow up on the issue of provisional expense, you indicated the quarter that the pattern would be quite unmoving for the year and perhaps we might see <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:21) the path of provisional expense from Q2. I'm just curious if we would see this expense from Q2 and on fall in to zero and possibly beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it is, more or less, reiterating the two things. Firstly, you're absolutely right. Provisioning is a lumpy item because we clearly &#x2013; our provisioning policy is entirely bottom up. We do no smoothing or leveling for seasonality. We clearly provide against the transactions on an individual basis.</p>
          <p>Also, the second thing, for the sake of clarity is the fact that our full year provisioning line in 2011 is still expected to be a debit charge. That is not to say that we're not going to be recovering very significant amount of provisions as it credit back into P&amp;L. But it is just that the forecasted volume of regular and new lending business is going to drag along with it. Whatever minimal provisions that you do based on various types of products and security between one and whatever, sometimes 2%. Regular provisions of that positive growth outlook in terms of lending volume will generate more provision charge than the release that we are planning.</p>
          <p>So net-net, it will be still a relatively small charge, but hidden within it, quite big recoveries. Again, I would urge not to analyze this over short period of times. With regular balance sheet items, quarter is a minimum. But with provisioning, even a quarter sometimes appears to be a bit too short for any extrapolations, for only six months is something that is more of a reliable trend-setting basis. So we will all have to be a bit more patient about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Anton, a couple of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, a couple of questions. Euro portfolio of renegotiated loans increased by approximately RUB 227 billion. How much out of this amount would have been nonperforming loans if you had not been restructured then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I probably &#x2013; by the way, for benefit of everyone else whose on the call, this is a question related to Slide 20 on our presentation. There's a note at the bottom there that the renegotiated loan before provision for loan impairment amounted to 12.1% of the loan portfolio, as compared to 11.9% in the preceding year. So 11.9% change &#x2013; change from 11.9% to 12.1% in relative terms is not significant in terms of absolute numbers. Obviously, this looks a bit bigger, but our balance sheet is rather big.</p>
          <p>What we can say that &#x2013; the proportion of loans that would have gone non-performing unless they would have been restructured this year is significantly lower than last year because this time, in a rapidly falling rate environment, we &#x2013; a lot of the restructurings that we have done were not like emergency measures being forced by the raging crisis like it was in 2009. It is much more a balanced mix, almost evenly balance mix of the fact that all the rates have gone down and the risk has reduced, as our borrowers have been pulling along &#x2013; pulling themselves out of the trouble with the help of the bank. And we, therefore, would consider to be comfortable to both reduce the rate a little bit to reflect the risk and the risk factor and the market. And to a certain point, reschedule, recalibrate like the repayment schedule to better match the new pattern of cash flows generated by the business &#x2013; new timing pattern of cash flows generated by the business, opposed the crisis once again. So I don't have an exact number with me and this is probably not the one that we would like to disclose publicly because I doubt our competitors are doing that. But it is roughly two comparable components in that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I was referring to their increasing renegotiated loans in the fourth quarter. If you compare the numbers as you just did year-over-year, that &#x2013; the interest is not that significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the first three quarters of 2010, the amount of renegotiated loans kept on decreasing. And in the fourth quarter, you had a jump of RUB 227 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry. I then didn't quite catch the gist of the question. Well, again, there's some seasonality to that and there is also some lumpiness. As I've mentioned that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we will touch the problem loans and whatever numbers associated with them. It's a characteristic feature. You cannot really be extrapolated about that. And again, as my colleagues are showing me some graphs that we use internally right now, the numbers in the first couple of months of this year based on the Russian numbers, actually suggesting that, that was just the one seasonal quarterly bump. That is coming back to more or less the levels we've seen in the preceding three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the percentage of provisions or <mark type="ph" /> it's just (21:55) you've created versus that amount. I suggest your provision is something against those renegotiated ones. So I think on average, in percentage versus this amount of increase in the first quarter, how much...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're getting into too much detail there. The thing is that in some of those restructurings, because a number of them would've been done to actually reflect the reduction of the rate due to the improving risk profile in the changing market environment, not only in terms of rate, but in terms of, for example, whatever goods you borrow or sell and then starting to show better financials. In some of the cases, those bump of restructurings would've been associated with reduced provisions on a particular transaction rather than an increased provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry for going to some detailed questions, maybe the last one. You're amount of nonperforming loans decreased by profit of RUB 52 billion in the fourth quarter. Can you just break down approximately how much of that was sold? How much of that went to renegotiated? How much of that recovered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're ready to disclose that level of detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If anything from the NPL went to you or negotiate loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you see &#x2013; again, I just consulted with my colleagues to make sure that, again, we keep it more or less the same level of disclosure. We will be gradually, as we get through the recovery cycle, see a bit more value in disclosing it to the greater detail. But again, because we sense that after a normal regular cyclical shock event in a developed banking sector somewhere in Europe or in the States, that shock event will last about six to nine months and then there will be some sort of recovery. And then on a plain vanilla, bilateral corporate loans portfolio, which is a majority of our loans, your recovery would be like three, four years. This has been one hell of a crisis, firstly. Secondly, this is Russia, so legal environment causes things to be done longer and therefore, our average recovery cycle is somewhere not three, four years, but probably four, five years. Once we're only hedging just about a couple of years into the cycle, it is &#x2013; we're cautious to send the signals for people to draw trends upon because again, in the early stages of recovery, you tend to be recovering things that are simpler and easier to collect than the other one. So, we, ourselves are cautious in drawing trends or kind of meaningful solutions out of the components that you're trying to probably operate in your calculations. So the one that we have been disclosing so far, just to give you a sense of how things are going on is all the restructured loans that we have done, how many have gone back into the relapse and have had to be restructured again or enter into some other recovery strategies like bankruptcies or foreclosures, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So back in quarter three, we've reported that of the restructured loans, 17 has gone back into relapse. We &#x2013; on the results of the quarter four, we see that this number has reduced significantly and it is now 10% &#x2013; around 10%. Yes, we sense that it is somewhat good indication of the quality of our restructuring efforts because whenever we set the restructuring policy for our troops, for our recovery and credit offices, we're saying you'll be considered good performers if you do it really once and no second helping is required, and that you have adequately estimated the risk and have taken the right decision. Of course, not is all under the influence but we sense that anywhere between 10% and 20% in a macro situation that we're having now is actually quite a decent number.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening, Anton. Just a follow-up question from me on net interest margin, as it's a little bit confusing what's going on on the underlying trend because just by the look at the numbers on your slides in the presentation, it seems that the 60 bps pickup in Q4 on a quarter-on-quarter basis came as a result of a 40 bps decline in cost of funding and 30 bps increase in asset yield.</p>
          <p>So now, you're saying that some element of it was one-off. I assume it was on the asset side probably, and that going forward, we should expect the NIM to shrink back to 6.1%. Could you elaborate a little bit on the underlying dynamic of the cost of funding and asset yield that you incorporate into this guidance? Thank you.</p>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes. Just one second, I'm just checking on the numbers, I'll give you an answer in a second.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think makes it not particularly clear from the graphs in the presentation is also the changes in the mix of the interest yielding assets and liabilities, which sends a little bit of a <mark type="ph" /> lifting (29:46) signals is there, but again, I think we're getting into a bit of a granularity that probably requires us to have a fair look at numbers before we can rationalize it in a single answer. I don't know, we may try and come back to you on this. As usual Dmitry Zhdanovich, our IR head, will be the normal window of communication and these contexts are all in the website.</p>

          <p>Okay. Yes, that would be really helpful just <mark type="ph" /> the ones (30:31) and that of the dynamic of cost of funding and asset yield in your guidance. I'd really appreciate that. And my second question is on the <mark type="ph" /> DRs (30:39), that's one -most of the questions that clients are asking us these days. What is the latest? When are we going to hear something specific regarding the timeline of when it's going to happen and any other detail?</p>

          <p>Well, as our CEO have mentioned to the press on Monday after a Supervisory Board meeting, we get the input from the Central Bank that the timing for this intended sale of the stake is around third quarter, fourth quarter, maybe around October, November or something like that. And we see that with the deposits we received, programs will probably benefit from launching something there earlier than that time rather than wait until that time. We probably very close to giving out some more specific detail on this, we're completing our work on those more specific details and we will keep everyone posted relatively shortly.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon or evening already, I guess. A couple of questions, first, regarding the accrual effect that we might be seeing on some of the loan yields. It seems that for a number of periods up until this one, you had been actually negatively accruing interest. And this time, you finally actually got a slight positive on that, which is obviously a very strong statement that you're doing that negatively for a number of periods. But I think that to some degree the fact that you maybe recognize some of the income from previous periods may have boosted the loan yields. Do you expect to be recognizing significantly more? Because looking at the last two years, it looks like you've actually negatively accrued almost $1 billion of, over 2008 to 2010, almost $1 billion sort of waiting for you to recognize it? If you could clarify that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just one second. Well again, these things are lumpy and what we've seen in the fourth quarter, as you rightly pointed out, contains significant chance of that and as we have just mentioned. Also within that income, it is also the part that is accrued in form of fees and commissions, and also these things that are penalty fees and commissions that are on top of your regular interest rate or even the increased interest rate that that would be associated with the increased risk profile of a particular transaction. So therefore, some of those numbers are actually going to be payable, really, after a few years of the loan duration once you've restructured it, sometimes, two years, three years, four years, maybe longer. So again, they are going to be lumpy associated with a particular payment schedule, so &#x2013; of specific loans, and there's not very much kind of linear extrapolation that you can do with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe could you just comment on why you have &#x2013; many banks during the crisis were accruing interest because of, obviously, problems with getting cash payments and giving a break to their borrowers. But in your case, you were not accruing interest but you were, sort of, not recognizing all of the cash that you were receiving as interest. Could you maybe give some clarification as to why that would be the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But again, this relates to the fact that a lot of these things are in the forms of commissions. So ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would get a commission in cash upfront but we'll be deferring it over the life of a loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. Understood, understood. Now that's clear. A second question regarding write-offs. I noticed that they picked up in the fourth quarter, and maybe do you think that Sberbank and maybe even broadly the sector eventually will start seeing some bigger write-off numbers coming through as the prices get sort of behind us? Do you think that's the beginning of a trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way &#x2013; maybe what we're actually all yet to see, I wouldn't be that certain yet for one particular reason. Again, as we've mentioned, you really lose hope of recovering something after over &#x2013; well over three years, four years here. So &#x2013; and we've been mostly above couple of years, depending upon where your problem would have occurred because not all of them have occurred at the same time. The crisis have had a prolonged nature. So I think the trends in that are going to be visible and with some certainty probably starting from 2012 to be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're still not really going to see a big pickup this year in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. And besides, depending upon how you recover, what strategy you use and how many stages you go through...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question. Going back to this restructured loan point. Are there any borrowers in this restructured part of your portfolio that have no impairment whatsoever, but you did a renegotiation simply because it was a very strong borrower <mark type="ph" /> who (37:39) said, listen, the rates have come down and I can refinance. If you want me to stay with you, then please give me a lower rate? And so it's as simple as that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's very little of that because we actually have to change at least something else in there to really count them as some other parameter of the loan, timing, schedules...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that type of loan &#x2013; that type of situation would not normally be considered in this ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In that very clean scenario where someone like Lukoil comes to us and says, I want a lower rate. It will not be considered restructured.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. That's very clear. Thanks. No further.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is, again, about restructuring. In light of increased level of restructured loans in the first quarter, may I ask if Sberbank starts to provide payment holidays for borrowers, or restructuring mainly implies change of maturity? Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our general rule is that for interest payments, we provide, and we've mentioned this a number of times on these types of calls over the past three quarters, is that &#x2013; the general policy, we don't give interest payment holidays for longer than a month or two if &#x2013; and if it deserves <mark type="ph" /> a seat (39:12) for example, we need to completely suspend the situation until we figure out what the solution is. Obviously, principal amount, timing and schedules are calibrated to match whatever expected cash flows the borrower is going to be generating in a corporate portfolio.</p>
          <p>So there are obviously exemptions to that in really kind of bad unique cases, but the main criteria that governs those is always and only a balance sheet recovery rate. If we can maximize the recovery rate, then we could <mark type="ph" /> flay (39:55) with things, but ultimately, recovery rate is driven more by risk perception than any mechanics that we might want to use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. So it's still the case, all right. And another question is on your progress and placement of receipts. Do you come to understanding &#x2013; or did you come to an understanding, what size of the program you would likely expect to have?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a few sort of follow-up questions, I suppose, still on the behavior of the net interest margins and cost. I note that this &#x2013; and just a few assumptions, if I may, to help us to get to your sort of guidance numbers. I suppose if you could sort of share your current views on the volumes &#x2013; on your volumes assumptions, both on, I suppose, loan and deposits front? But I suppose I'm sort of very interested is that are we &#x2013; is 2011, in your view, still a year when we're going to have an access deposit creation over loans and what's your sort of latest thoughts on this are?</p>
          <p>Secondly, pricing, of course, we had some margin volatilities sort of this year, very much to have driven earlier by the competition on, particularly, the corporate pricing. How has this been behaving sort of recently? Have we &#x2013; sort of have we sort of pretty much reached the bottom of that competition? And are we likely to see repricing into, upwards, into 2011 in line with potential sort of interest rate increases?</p>
          <p>And my last and unrelated question is on the deposit front? You are effectively sort of pricing much lower than the market pretty much in every single maturity bucket particularly in the retail deposits. And again, there is very little competition there, banks are liquid and so forth. Are we likely to see those sort of very low deposit rates continuing into sort of 2011? And I have some more sort of OpEx questions later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of volume outlook, we are saying that our corporate loan portfolio should be growing around between 13% and 15%, which is roughly the same as last year. And hopefully, more or less in line with the market, maybe a little bit better. Just a <mark type="ph" /> tad (42:43) but not full percentage points. Our retail loan book should be growing and the range is a bit broader here, anywhere between 18% and 23%, we think, which should be, hopefully, a bit more ahead of the market than in corporate.</p>
          <p>Excess liquidity generated by faster growth of deposits is hopefully going to subside but not entirely, especially because of the fact that we are seeing some inflation effect, with our outlook for inflation being closer to 10% per annum rather than 9% per annum. Our excess of liquidity will be as much representative of the market's excess of liquidity as usual, and with the oil prices being where they are, that's also the source of retail deposits liquidity overall.</p>
          <p>Market pricing and competition, on the asset side, we sense that we probably have troughed in terms of asset pricing. They have somewhat stabilized at, I don't know if I should call it a bottom or something, but at this level, and our outlook is neutral to positive, mostly because of inflation to a degree &#x2013; to certain &#x2013; not very low, but still to certain degree, due to the somewhat improving demand. Now the pricing in terms of deposits, if the inflation is staying within that outlook of about 10% of more than that, then I don't think the market is going to be radically reacting with the rate. There may be some adjustment. That adjustment is much more probably by the players outside Sberbank, but then we'll see what the second half of the year will bring us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's your sort of interest? Sorry, I should have probably asked that upfront, what's your sort of interest rate view for the rest of 2011, and how it may sort of affect your sort of repricing on the loan front potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, neutral to positive, we sense that the loan growth is not going to be that strong unlike in China, somewhere just to force the regulators to really start reducing the rates very &#x2013; while increasing the reserve requirements and increasing the rates very intensively. So, that will still keep the inflation sort of high-ish because the fiscal policy in the pre-election year is somewhat relaxed and the economy's clearly having some liquidity in it despite the fact that the loan growth is not really, really active. So, all these things overall make it somewhat neutral to positive or rather neutral to increase loan rate environment for us to be expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of sort of your expectation on sort of your sensitivities here, because I suppose over the last sort of year, we have been sort of waiting for slightly, I suppose, more significant pickup in loan demand, pretty much both on the retail and the corporate side. And we have sort of seen quite &#x2013; sort of quite subdued 2012 &#x2013; sorry, 2010 really, and we're still sort of &#x2013; we're still talking about a sort of &#x2013; a relatively subdued 2011 despite the fact that we are sort of benefiting on the commodity side, consumer looks quite resilient and so forth. And we're still sort of oscillating around sort of mid to sort of high teens from a sort of total loan growth perspective. What would have to change in your mind for you to be able to sort of to see higher loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, we would probably see relatively modest economy growth in this year and the following year, and that is clearly reflected in the loan growth outlook that we're providing. I don't see anything radical yet. I would push for the economy to start all of a sudden explosively growing in the nearest future.</p>
          <p>With that, actually, I'm glad to welcome our CEO, Mr. Herman Gref, who has just joined us and open it for a little bit of remarks and address to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:12) conference.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gref will be speaking in Russian and the translation will go straight at the same way as a sequential translation on the same length, so you don't need to switch to the Russian link.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Excuse me for my late join to your &#x2013; to your conference call. And will speak &#x2013; for me, it's more convenient to speak in the Russian language, excuse me for this. Now I'll start in Russian language.</p>
          <p>I would like to bring my apologies for delayed presentation of our report, two or a couple of hours delay. And I gave a warning to our financial department &#x2013; a very strong warning, not to have that repeated in the future.</p>
          <p>And we were also somewhat charged with being one day earlier with our reports, but it so happened that we were presenting our accounts to our supervisory board. There was a very high probability of this information being disclosed to the market from some or other members of the supervisory board, and we preferred to make the disclosure ourselves. So in the future though, we shall &#x2013; we are committed to fulfilling your expectations &#x2013; or meeting your expectations on disclosure on our part. So, we are building a customer-focused company.</p>
          <p>So and we have a broad view on our concept of the customers. It's not only our individual customers, but also our investors, our stakeholders. So &#x2013; and we shall take very seriously all the feedback from you and thank you very much for these remarks. So using this opportunity, I would like to draw your attention to some facts. This year, we are increasing dividend payout by 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>By two percentage points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Two percentage points. And this is the trend we are planning to establish on gradually increasing dividend payout. So this year, we extensively discussed the personalities of prospective members of our supervisory board and thank you for all participation in these discussions. So the end result of these discussions was nomination of Alessandro Profumo, former General Director of UniCredit from the 1of February being my Assistant Advisor. And we are very pleased to have him joining our team because he has enormous experience in the integration of business.</p>
          <p>And the second challenge and task for Mr. Profumo will be assisting us in our expansion outside Russia. So and the first month-and-a-half of this operation and his contribution proves that this contribution is enormous. So we have assessed investor perception of various items and we see that the most sensitive issue is the depository receipts program launched by Sberbank. And I inform you that this Monday, we requested RSP, which is actually the first step in the launching of deposit receipts program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We requested the RFP from depository banks that we might want to choose for that program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>So it helps us to identify the depository bank and launch in April, our program &#x2013; get down to the program in April. So with two months for the entire procedure starting from April. So we visualize end of June as the timeframe for completing the procedure. And we see the substantial increase of liquidity of our stock and as the first step to privatization. So another step on the way to increasing our transparency is easing this year, the first Corporate and Social Responsibility Report. So and this is another step on the way to increasing our capitalization through being more transparent, more comprehensible and predictable for the market. Probably, we are the most transparent Russian company in the market and we shall continue following this way. But frankly speaking, it is a hard way.</p>
          <p>So, I would like also to announce the intention of Sberbank to carry out Capital Day with the participation of the top managers of the bank early in Autumn in Moscow, London and New York. And I would like to thank you esteemed colleagues and I am ready to answer a couple of your questions, if you have such.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Well, as we have <mark type="ph" /> you online (58:20), I would ask a question about the M&amp;A strategy of Sberbank. I mean, obviously, with the Troika transaction, that's taken a giant leap forward in just very recently and you're rumored very often in the region to be looking at one bank or another and not very much seems to come of it until again very lately. Could you maybe set out some priorities of what countries you look at and what kind of timeframe you expect things to happen now that Mr. Profumo is with you? That's all. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For a year, we have been considering various options and opportunities. But so far, it's only the stage of consideration. So and we see a great potential for Sberbank in this market, which has recovered and revived in Russia.</p>
          <p>So we were going to buy one of the market leaders, but we didn't agree on the pricing. So far, we can't state anything certain about expansion both territorial or in product way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now speaking of the situation outside Russia. So we have identified the countries where the markets are bearing some profit &#x2013; interest for Sberbank <mark type="ph" /> promise (01:01:33). They have been identified in our strategy &#x2013; Eastern Europe, some countries in Asia, India and we are going step by step in that direction.</p>
          <p>So we are considering the opportunities of acquisitions in Eastern Europe. But we try to be very cautious in this respect. So we are gaining experience in intra-group consolidation and integration. So we are streamlining our strategy of cooperation with three subsidiaries, which we have currently in various countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would say that the targets we are considering, they will be acquisitions which are &#x2013; or will not be substantial or material from the point of view of our balance sheet. So our focus is on penetration in various markets gaining access, second gaining experience and third, digesting those pieces of business which we have acquired.</p>
          <p>So they are now ready for completion transactions, but we are considering the issue. So but I wouldn't exclude any possible acquisitions. In Russia, it would be point-of-sale businesses and relatively small acquisitions outside Russia to acquire small platforms to gain a foothold for further growth...</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions for Mr. Gref. First of all, in terms of the dividend payout, I'm wondering what do you see as a kind of target or optimum payout ratio in terms of your percentage of your net income.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the privatization of the central bank's 7.6% stake and I'm just wondering whether you could give us some thoughts on whether you would like to really <mark type="ph" /> settle (01:05:30) all of this stake in the market or whether you're also actively looking for strategic investors?

          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the presentation. I guess last year you announced a borrowing program of between $24 billion. Can you please give an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The borrowing program. I guess we will stick to the same approach that we have used for the past two, three years, which means we actually have no dependency whatsoever on wholesale funding and the only reason that we do public borrowings and syndicated loans every once in a while is to carefully construct a reference benchmark yield curve in our interest and therefore, we choose the windows of opportunity in the market from the standpoint of primarily focusing on the price.</p>
          <p>We also like to, as much as possible, stay in the sweet spot of balance between the scarcity value of our debt instruments and sufficient liquidity to make people who trade in them comfortable in working with them on a day-to-day basis. So we will continue to follow this policy and if the windows are going to be turning up, we will probably be thinking about some transactions every once in a while. Maybe somewhat increasing the tenor and venturing into somewhat longer tenors than before. But then again, that will depend on how the market works.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. If I may rephrase my question, if I understand correctly, your borrowings are mostly driven by demand from your clients for U.S. dollar loans. Do you see that probably picking up during this year or do you have something in the pipeline?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Thanks for the call. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to come back on the non-performing loan sales that you said that you did. Can you just take us through the economics of the sales that you've done so just to get a sense of the income statement impact and to what extent was that merely reflected in a reversal of existing provisions and to what extent may that have been reflected in pre-provision profit as a gain or something similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our general policy is that whenever we sell, especially at this time of kind of early stage of recovery cycle, we are only ready to accept very minimal discounts unless of course the situations where you actually have had a chance to work through the problem very quickly and realize that this &#x2013; you foreclose on the collateral and realize that the only thing that is left is actually the collateral itself and you get hold of it legally and you sell it and then it goes down. But these situations are relatively a minority. Usually, our provisioning by the time we sell something is pretty adequate, so the impact on the &#x2013; if not probably a bit conservative. So, the impact is usually either minimal or positive in terms of the provision recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But just to be clear then, so at this stage, it's less the fact that you've <mark type="ph" /> seized assets and/or (01:13:09) selling them and that may produce a gain in other income and it's more about the fact that you've been able to collect on the loan and reverse the provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, so, and then again, it is not unusual although it's not that it is actually a massive practice, but this is very &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:13:25) it's not unusual that for example, a couple of big players in the banking sector would have exposures to both of, for example, two to three different clients and one bank will have a stronger position legally with one client and the other bank not. Whilst on the other client, it will be vice versa so sometimes, banks swap it between themselves. So, these things are also taking place which doesn't mean that you necessarily have a <mark type="ph" /> real like crystallize (01:13:59) any final losses just continuing work on the recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay great. Can I just ask one follow-up? In terms of your overall activity levels in the fourth quarter, is there any expenses or obviously, it's a seasonally strong quarter anyway. But do you think there's any material affect there because the third quarter was somehow depressed because you had lower activity with the fires in Moscow and various other things going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not probably less from that rather than from the fact that the companies were &#x2013; our clients were reacting to what is going on in the monetary environment and reacting to the fact that there is a tax significant, social security tax changes kicking in from the 1 of January. It was rather bringing some of the activity forward into December rather than catch-up from the quarter three.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I'm sorry to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:09)  it's me again, I had a couple more questions regarding the OpEx side. And I think what interests me is how should I, sort of, treat the levels particularly your stock expenses in 2010. Because effectively, what we have seen over the last two years is of course, you are delivering on the program of the, sort of staff redundancies but at the same time particularly in 2010.</p>
          <p>That sort of &#x2013; that  effect was pretty much nullified and offset by the fact that you sort of brought your salary levels to the market levels which if memory, sort of serves me &#x2013; sort of from memory, it was literally high teens to almost 20% increases which effectively were shown in the sort of 2010 numbers.</p>
          <p>Now I have a couple of questions for it. One is that I think your mid-term target from the perspective of the personnel is above 225,000 by 2013, so does it still stand?</p>
          <p>My second question would be are there any more sort of catch-ups from the perspective of salaries that you think you may have to do on a pretty much platform level for those? And three, your sort of cost income ratio, sort of mid-target, sort of between 40% to 45%, should we still sort of stick to that over 2011 and 2012 despite the fact that you're sort of that you told us that effectively third, fourth year of the sort of the modernization of the bank may actually still result in elevated cost levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for good set of questions. It is good to be answering them right in this group because they obviously are interrelated. Now, for the sake of clarity, because from some of the questions we've received through emails, we want to make clarification of the term catch-up that we have used. We are not actually paying any retrospective catch-up for what might have been underpaid because we didn't update salaries for the past three years.</p>
          <p>We are combining the two things now. Any pay revisions that we do are getting effective from the point that revision has just kicked in and going forward. And also, we simultaneously are rolling out improved pay and compensation scheme, which actually means shifts for mass professions, the one like tellers in the counters and workers in our retail branches.</p>
          <p>We are on one side increasing the base portion of the compensation and reducing the variable annual portion of the compensation to get it close to the market. And at the same time, we'll make sure that &#x2013; when I'm talking fixed versus variable, I'm actually talking year end versus base pay. But actually, for mass professions, there's also quarterly incentive that would have been part of the base equation.</p>
          <p>But both quarterly incentive and annual incentives, we're linking much, much closer now to the performance indicators. And the huge work that we have done is to link those performance indicators much closer to the commercial effect, the P&amp;L effect that those, for example, sales people are generating. Therefore, it takes us a bit longer to roll out the pay changes and the catch-up and markups to the market level than it would have normally done, which also means that it is only a part of the markups in the staff pay that have gone through back in 2010. We're going to see some of that going through in 2011.</p>
          <p>Also, the head count dynamics are such that yes, strategically, we've said by 2014, we should be roughly 220,000 people. We're more or less sticking to that trend. You can see that in terms of head count, numbers itself for 2010, the phase of head count reduction is somewhat slowing down, <mark type="ph" /> but that result only (01:20:00) not to me that our resolve there is weakening. It is just that there's two components fully at play there. One is us continuing to cut pretty aggressively jobs where the technology provides greater savings for us and where our investments into productivity have started yielding their results.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, we have been rolling some new functions that were either severely understaffed or sometimes didn't exist in the mix of the jobs that the bank was operating due to the fact that we're shifting ourselves from, as we mentioned is strategy, shifting ourselves from a product-driven bank to relationship &#x2013; client-relationship driven bank.</p>
          <p>With &#x2013; concerning the impact of the social security tax, we have mentioned before that overall, it's somewhere between RUB 13 billon and RUB 15 billion, on top of the number that was there as a result of 2009 pay levels for the full year of 2009. Because those social tax changes have been put in two stages, first, the scales and the brackets of the sliding scale in social tax have been changed for 2010. And then the tax rates have been changed from the beginning of 2011. So from those &#x2013; of those RUB 13 billion, RUB 15 billion of extra cost on top of the levels of 2009, about RUB 10 million are kicking in, RUB 10 billion are kicking in in 2011.</p>
          <p>So combined with what I've mentioned before in the previous &#x2013; from one of the previous questions about the spending pattern on our five-year transformation cycle, years three and four, are normally behavior on how the timing of your spend to execute the strategy to actually invest in both OpEx and CapEx into gaining better quality productivity gains. What that all means in terms of our cost to income ratio is that our outlook is remaining still unchanged. We will be in mid-40s consciously throughout 2011, 2012 and that is in order to make sure that we can sustainably target just 40% and around that in years 2013 and 2014 hopefully. So that &#x2013; with all the one-off things that are going on including the social tax increase and changing the base structure, maybe that doesn't change our outlook. Obviously, with the new pay system being much closer aligned to our financial performance and some more transparent links to the market, we will be able to be much more regular in making sure of a &#x2013; is increasing along with inflation on a year-by-year basis rather than in three-year lumps. But of course, the main reason for that was the fact there was a crisis. Hopefully, nothing as major as that is happening &#x2013; is waiting ahead of all of us in the coming years.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, that answers most of the components of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; no, it does. But just to -- so effectively, we can assume that sort of 2011, 2012 are still the years of the negative sort of operating jaws i.e. that your cost curve will be effectively slightly higher than your &#x2013; that your sort of banking income than your sort of total revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, negative jaws is a kind of a phrase that makes me shiver... Can we use something milder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, but effectively, this is &#x2013; I mean, we're looking at a very good revenue, sort of revenue trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know. Well look, the outlook on the cost line alone is just as I have formulated. What we're seeing somewhat more positive as compared to the way we solve the situation back in 2008 when we were formulating our strategy is that the margin are probably stay higher than we would have expected them even if -- regardless of whether there was a big crisis between 2008 and now or there was -- to be honest, actually in our -- even back in early 2008 when we were just starting to draft our strategy, we were already anticipating them between then in 2014 that there would be some sort of a one-off shock event, which we have to put into the model and into the scenarios.</p>
          <p>So we kind of coming out on the other side over prices with models that run on somewhat different assumptions but largely to the same positive financial result in terms of the bottom line. So the margins and the good product mix somewhat better isn't commissions, proportions and relative mix effect in the positive margin, I mean, in terms of the products. Our better shift to retail lending and getting close to SME lending when risks and reward balance is sweeter. It would be compensating hopefully, comfortably the effect of the sort of lumpy spending that in terms of timing, that is ahead of us in 2011, 2012 and obviously, the unfortunate event of some extra social security tax burden.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. And this actually my last one and just a clarification, did I understand correctly Mr. Gref Oskarovich's comments regarding the depository receipt. He implied that by the end of June, you will be complete with all these at the technical procedures. But does this mean that we should be expecting the DR program straight afterwards or not necessarily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me formulate it this way. The technicalities that are required &#x2013; again, in terms of substance, transparency requirements, reporting timelines, governance, all other things, we're pretty much ready. The formalities he was referring to shouldn't be taking us any longer than between two and four months from now. Where we kick off trade and we're in now, we haven't announced any kickoff so far, but we probably going to be a bit more specific about the timing of the actual launch of the depository receipts within a week or two from now, not more than that. And what we have just done is to &#x2013; as a preliminary steps into the depository banks to see what their reaction is going to be in terms of timing and money.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton. I just want to come back briefly to the renegotiated loans but I'm not sure how much you'll kind of able to tell us. But given the &#x2013; there was this substantial increase in the fourth quarter and we're not really &#x2013; it's not very clear whether there were big one-off loans in there or loans migrated out of NPLs into the renegotiated category. Do you think that in terms of looking at your provision coverage, we should &#x2013; I mean, if you look at your provisions relative to your NPLs, it's now very high.  I mean, it's over 150%. Do you think we should be focusing a bit more of looking at your provisions relative to your NPLs and your renegotiated loans? This is &#x2013; it's quite hard to understand whether &#x2013; if these renegotiated loans didn't go up so much, actually there would have probably been an increase in NPLs in the fourth quarter and I don't know if you can kind of add anything more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our NPLs are pretty well managed in terms of us understanding the situation and I'm not expecting. Of course, any of such parameters provisioning NPLs, renegotiate links, tend to be lumpy. And again, we're probably now more concentrated in our NPLs than the rest of our balance sheet. And our balance sheet is no more concentrated than the rest of the real sector in Russia, the rest of the economy, which is compared to other banks, I'd say that they are probably much more concentrated in terms of single-digit lumpy deals in relation to their balance sheet. That tends to be case. But also, we aren't smoothing anything as we've mentioned before.</p>
          <p>So what I can add in terms of the color is that NPLs per se are more or less under control. There's a hefty component in renegotiation of seeing that aren't over kind of tectonic nature with a sort of a particular transaction. Those are a bit more fine tunings that we do because we're kind of in year two, year three of a recovery cycle of a bad loan portfolio. So in terms of the overall provisioning coverage, again, the world is probably getting a little bit too fixated overall and even us, ourselves, on just linking the NPL 90 plus to the provision itself.</p>
          <p>But in-house, we are sticking much more to the provision as a reflection of our quantified assessment of the risk level. And timing-wise, they don't necessarily match one another your risk assessment, which you're capable to do, pretty much very soon since your client comes over to discuss with his banker problems that he might have. Because that is long before, hopefully, or at least quite some time before that it'll all actually stop servicing the interest and then failed the 90 days before it registers in NPL 90 and we would again measure the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Similarly, so that's on the way into NPLs, similarly so on the way out when you recover things. For example, you've restructured something. It could be relatively mild restructuring. It could be more or less okay client and you may have decently good expectation about the fact that should there be no more external shocks, that it'll probably work themselves out as a whole. But then you first -- and okay, you may even give them a couple of months of interest servicing holiday. So once you've done that, you waive those couple of months, then you would want the debt to be serviced, the loans or the restructured loans to be serviced for at least two or three quarters and accompanied with quite some good financials that are coming out of your clients that match the forecasted model that you built together with them. Before you're actually happy to say it to yourselves, well, okay, yeah, fine, the risk profile is kind of changed notably and I can release some of the provisions, regardless of the fact that the loan would have been servicing pretty well for a quite number of months.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, even if you wanted to do it earlier, I don't think the regulators or the auditors would really be happy with you doing that. So there's certain, as I'd like to put it, rightness in our provision amount where we see we're getting close to them being released because a result of some hard work, how did recovery work that we've put in. But we're not just there yet in terms of substance and formalities that are needed for an actual release even if it's a partial release.</p>
          <p>So that creates a little bit of an overhang and again, maybe in some other banks, the merchant will have a temptation to start releasing things earlier. But we are not really keen to get aggressive in matters like that, would rather seen the provisioning as the most subjective measure of the risk level that we can figure out.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about fees this year and what new products you may launch to generate fees and generally speaking, how we should think about the trends in your fee line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to put very aggressive tasks in front of our product generation units and our distribution people and sales people in pushing further into fees and commissions-driven product. Of course, the additional of investment banking to a franchise has the primary focus of specifically on the fees and commissions line because unlike many of the predecessors and, I mean, universal banks entering into investment banking space, who are not doing it out of the reason that our core business is generating some optimal ROEs and we need to get into prop trading to bet big chunks of capital to generate more returns.</p>
          <p>In fact, we are very risk averse to that and we're not going to be materially changing that approach with the purchase of Troika. Troika is merely the story of completing the full circle of product offerings to our corporate clients, particularly on the fees and commission basis and of course, generating some fees and commission on flow income on trading and on asset management. So the other products, as we have mentioned on the public calls before, is that we're getting some good value out of agency arrangements with cross-selling our insurance products along with our retail lending products and other retail products.</p>
          <p>So things of a similar nature where we do some of the cross selling, we enrich a number of our own products that we launch, providing better quality of service in terms of remote channels, our internet banking, mobile telephone banking and cross selling the products through there as well. We're pushing the fees and commission line as hard as we can in anticipation that obviously on the mid-term horizon, the margins will start compressing at some point, which means that with the business plans are actually involving stable double-digit growth year-on-year for foreseeable future in the fees and commission line, at least 15%. We have delivered more than that in 2010, but we're not resting on the laurels.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything metric or material you'll recommend we look at to track your fee progress. And do you have any targets that you could share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we will be a bit more specific about that, that will be divulging a little bit too much to our competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Fair enough. Okay, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello again. Sorry for a follow-up question from me on <mark type="ph" /> DRs (01:39:23). So I understand they will be obtainable, the timelines that we are going to hear something specific from you in the next couple of weeks, which is great. And I'm not sure if you're in a position to tell us, but maybe you are, any other details at this point &#x2013; I mean, I know you're thinking about the number of different options, maybe it will be a London listing, maybe an ADR. So from that point of view, could you give us some color on what your thinking is right now.</p>
