        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to Baidu's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. We distributed Baidu's first quarter 2009 earnings release earlier today. You may find a copy of the press release on the company's website, as well as on newswire services.</p>
          <p>Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer; and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will be joined by Peng Ye, our Chief Operating Officer; and Haoyu Shen, Vice President of Business Operations to answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2009 as total revenues increased 41% from the year-ago period, exceeding our top-line guidance. As you know, the first quarter was not a easy one, particularly due to the economic uncertainty. But by focusing relentlessly on execution and things we have control over, we've been able to act quickly and efficiently in a tough environment with our highly energized and effective workforce.</p>
          <p>In particular, during the quarter, we took actions to drive sales focus. We implemented programs to elevate customer services. We developed incentive to drive overall results. At the same time, we launched successfully branding and marketing campaigns. This focus on execution and the ability to leverage our accumulated experiences and the scale of our customer base and sales force allowed us to deliver strong results in this challenging time. China's Internet industry is only just emerging. We have and we will continue to benefit from user growth and the growing appreciation of performance-based search engine marketing.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to talk a bit more about a couple of key initiative we've recently announced. First, this month, we officially launched an enhanced bidding platform for online marketing customers called Baidu Online Marketing Professional Edition also known as Phoenix Nest.</p>
          <p>This new platform will run concurrently with our original bidding platform or Classic Edition during a customer transition period. Professional Edition is the result of a long process of looking at how to optimize our paid search average for the benefit of customers and users. Specifically, for online marketing customers, this new platform enables the customers to have more choices for keywords, more tools to manage their marketing budget, and more data points to measure and analyze their returns. For search users, we believe it can improve relevantly our paid search results through a more sophisticated keyword matching system.</p>
          <p>And for Baidu, the Professional Edition while employing more advanced monetization ad words, which we expect over time, should result in enhanced revenue. While this is still a new initiative, customer reaction has been very positive ever since the beta launch in the fourth quarter of last year. We'll keep you updated on the progress here.</p>
          <p>Also as you may know, we have been working on an initiative codenamed Aladdin, which is aimed at improving search experience by uncovering useful parts of the hidden Web. As part of this initiative, this month, we beta launched an data &#x2013; an open data sharing platform, which allows webmasters and developers to summit data to Baidu in order to generate direct search results for dynamic information such as flight schedules and foreign currency exchange rate tables. There is a wide range of potential applications we are confident that Project Aladdin will be a long-term driver of user traffic growth.</p>
          <p>Branding continues to be a focus for us, and leveraging our core competency in search to make positive social contributions is an important part of this. Most recently, we launched a search service specially designed to serve the rapidly growing senior age online population in China. Along these lines, we've also launched search services dedicated to the blind, youth and <mark type="inaudible" /> traditional Chinese literature. Even though these are not revenue contributors, we believe that these services yield important dividend in the form of reputation and goodwill.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we are feeling encouraged on a number of fronts. First, following the Chinese New Year holiday, we have seen a healthy pickup in both user traffic and online marketing activities. With our strong execution capability and persistent focus on user and customer needs, we are confident that Baidu's cost effective performance-based model will continue to be the online marketing platform of choice, particularly in this kind of economy. Of course, we are constantly monitoring market trends to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving needs of our users and customers.</p>
          <p>Thank you again, and I'll now turn the call over to Jennifer for financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello everyone. Before I go into the financial details, I would like to introduce our new Investor Relations Director, Victor Tseng. Victor joins us from Deutsche Bank where he was an equity research analyst covering the China Internet sector. We're confident that Victor's sector experience and his unique perspective will be beneficial to our IR program. So welcome, Victor.</p>
          <p>As Robin mentioned, we're very pleased with our financial results for the quarter driven by our execution capabilities and the fundamental strength of our platform. During the quarter, our balanced approach to controlling cost while investing in important initiatives also allowed us to maintain healthy margins.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at some of the financial highlights for the quarter. The amounts mentioned are in RMB unless otherwise noted. Online marketing revenues for the quarter were 810 million, a 41% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, Baidu had more than 185,000 active online marketing customers, a 15% increase from the corresponding period in '08, and a 6% decrease from the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter was approximately 4,400, a 22% increase from the corresponding period in '08, and a 4% sequential decrease.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue was 124 million or 15.3% of total revenue as compared to 13.3% in the corresponding period in '08 and 14.6% in the fourth quarter of '08. The increase in TAC as a percent of revenue reflects strong performance of some of our partners continuing to drive fast growth of our Union business. In the near term, the trend may still fluctuate. We'll monitor the Union strategy to ensure we continue to manage a healthy balance.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth cost and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue both decreased in the first quarter versus a year ago. This demonstrates continually efficiency improvement as well as increased stability of investment in capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 39% from the corresponding period in '08, primarily due to the increase in marketing expense as part of our branding efforts.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses increased 67% over the year-ago period, primarily due to increased head count. We'll continue to prudently invest in R&amp;D to ensure we are at the forefront of technological innovation.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items, increased in aggregate by 45% to 23 million in the first quarter from 16 million in the corresponding period in '08. The increase in share-based compensation expenses primarily reflect increase in grants to employees.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the first quarter was 199 million, a increase of 35% over Q1 of '08. Total head count as of March 31, '09 was about 6,200, roughly 200 fewer than at the end of Q4 '08. The decrease in head count mainly comes from sales and marketing. Our business is growing and we'll continue to invest prudently in human resources particularly in R&amp;D while at the same time focusing on improving operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Income tax expense was 27 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 12.9% as compared to 6.9% in the corresponding period in '08. The increase was primarily due to some Baidu entities migrating out of tax holiday status.</p>
          <p>Net income was 181 million, a 24% increase from the corresponding period in '08. Basic and diluted EPS for the first quarter of '09 amounted to 5.25 and 5.22 respectively. Net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was 205 million, a 26% increase from the corresponding period in '08. Basic and diluted EPS excluding share-based compensation expense, both non-GAAP measures, were RMB5.93 and 5.89 respectively.</p>
          <p>As of March 31,'09, the company had cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment of 2.8 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditures for the first quarter of '09 were 247 million and 42 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you our top-line guidance for the second quarter of '09. We currently expect total revenue for the second quarter of '09 to be between 1.07 billion to 1.1 billion in RMB. We would &#x2013; that would represent 32% to 36% sequential growth. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's <mark type="audio gap" /> current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the quarter and the guidance. Jennifer and Robin, my one question I guess I'll limit myself to is about active customers. The number at a 185,000 was down pretty significantly Q-over-Q, and I'm wondering if you could give us a little color upon this. Is this mostly as a result of the website cleanups that you guys initiated in the fourth quarter? And to what extent is any of this maybe due to some diverting of resources from the sales force to learning and getting trained up on Phoenix Nest ahead of the April launch, and within that, could you maybe help us understand whether the number of active customers has stabilized in April, and do you expect this number to grow sequentially in the second quarter? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, Peng will answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason, this is Peng. Let me answer your question. I think the three factors contribute in this situation. Number one is the seasonality, traditional seasonality in Q1. Number two is the macroeconomic situation. Number three is the ongoing actions we have been taking to improve the quality of the customer bases. That's it, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, let me just add a little color. The active number of customers is defined to be active during the quarter. So if you look at Q4, although we did take measures to improve the quality of our customer base, a majority of those customers were still active in that quarter. It seems we've done that and we have taken additional measures as we mentioned towards the end of last year, all of those removed customers that don't come back. The full extent will be felt in Q1.</p>
          <p>So in Q1, that &#x2013; basically the number of customers reflected that fact, and in addition as Peng mentioned, the normal seasonality right before Chinese New Year is typically a slower time to acquire new customers. On top of that, the weaker economy, that is &#x2013; the combination of that is the result of the 184,000 customers.</p>
          <p>At this stage, we want to say, as I mentioned in the past, the activities that we've taken to improve the quality of our customer base to a large extent has &#x2013; is over, but we will continue to monitor the healthiness of our customer base and continue to take measures properly, but we don't foresee any major, major change to the customer base going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jennifer, that's an excellent point. If I could really just ask you a quick follow-up, could you maybe give us an apples-for-apples comparison, because your point is well taken that someone who was there in October or November and was removed in December still shows up in Q4 and wouldn't show up in Q1. But to let us kind of understand what a &#x2013; if you kind of normalize the Q4 for the actions you took at the end of Q4, did we see some sequential growth or was the sequential decline less if you look at it apples-for-apples when we look at Q1 versus what really happened at the end of Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, if you look at last year's trend, I think there was a slight increase of number of customers between Q1 and in the end of '07. So I think the normal trend would put us back in line with that range. It's hard to pin down exactly what's in the next &#x2013; the exact number of customers. That is purely a result of the combination of the three factors we just mentioned.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning and allow my congratulations. Could you talk a little bit about Phoenix Nest and some of the changes in monetization? I'm sure you guys have some data around the impact of monetization when you've been beta testing Phoenix Nest. And second, can you talk about some of the potential impact regarding some of the transparency changes in the search results' page from the user side as far as click-through rates? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Haoyu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Haoyu. <mark type="inaudible" />, as you must know that we made Phoenix Nest available to all customers Monday of last week. So we're literally talking about a week ago. So it's still early stage, but we like what we're seeing. As far as how mechanically it improves monetization, I think we can look at a few different dimensions. One is potentially coverage. We're opening out the &#x2013; right now, the left top shaded area for Phoenix Nest. So the coverage of &#x2013; by relative ads, I think, potentially will increase. And also CTR will also improve, because we're using better &#x2013; fewer mix algorithms. So CTR will eventually increase. And also as for <mark type="inaudible" /> really a more sophisticated algorithm &#x2013; a more sophisticated algorithm will encourage the bidders, the &#x2013; or customers to look at the ROI more closely and enable them to look at their ROI more closely, so that potential <mark type="inaudible" /> will also go up. So this is &#x2013; all of these three dimensions will eventually improve, leading to better monetization. But right now, it's really in early stage, but we like what we're seeing, a lot of customers already online, and the system is running smoothly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the, I guess, the search results' page, have you guys added more transparency so your users can see which ads are sponsored? Is there any risk that your click-through rates on that left hand side are going to decline given the greater transparency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No Gene, I think &#x2013; I don't think we need to &#x2013; I mean, clarify this. Phoenix Nest is not about where the paid links are displayed. So it's about the new auction mechanism, the new bidding mechanism. So users don't really see it, the surfers &#x2013; the searchers, they don't really see it. So what we did now in April is we made Phoenix Nest manage the top left shaded area, the sponsors' search area right now. So the users, as far as right now, they don't really see it. So what you're talking about, left or right, in a more transparent separation between paid and natural results, that's about how we display paid links. As we &#x2013; as Robin actually mentioned, as <mark type="inaudible" />, that model will also evolve, but that's a different thing from the auction mechanism we're using, which we're launching now, the new &#x2013; the new auction mechanism, Phoenix Nest.</p>
          <p>These two things are not totally independent from each other, but these are two things. They will both evolve over time. So we'll coordinate the evolution of this platform and auction mechanism very carefully, to make sure that we have a smooth evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one just follow-up question just on the change in the search results' page. I realize that that's independent of Phoenix Nest, but if you could talk about how long that transition is between having search results for a <mark type="inaudible" /> into more of a Google-like model, is this going to be something that starts today and it's going to be, a year from now, you'll be almost entirely having shaded results on the top left, or is it something that will be six months or three months or two years? Any sort of timeframe in terms of how long that transition will take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi Gene, this is Robin. I think we, at this time, do not have a definitive schedule for the full transition process. I guess it will depend on how Phoenix Nest will do in the future and what kind of user experience we would like to &#x2013; to offer in general competitive landscape of this market, that which one is going to more clearly separate the paid and unpaid results, but we cannot commit a definitive schedule at this time.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Mr. Dick Wei with JP Morgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess I think in Q4, you guys mentioned it, about there was a one-time issue, that's why the traffic acquisition cost was higher. I guess, for Q1, if you can get &#x2013; if you can give some more color in terms of the churn ratio or any changes in terms of TAC. And also is the management still maintaining that the bottom, I guess, absolute bottom line is still more important than the gross margin or is that still maintain that thoughts. That would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Haoyu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes so Dick, how are you doing? We realize that the TAC as a percentage of total revenue reached an all-time high this quarter. As we said before, it still largely reflects the faster growth of revenue from our affiliate network than from organic, although in Q1, we're also seeing very healthy growth of revenue from organic search.</p>
          <p>So I think we still maintain our position that we look at this business on a revenue net of TAC basis, but we also are looking &#x2013; we have been and we'll continue to look at this business through &#x2013; on a strategic level and also on a financial level.</p>
          <p>It's very hard to &#x2013; so the TAC ratio fluctuates quarter-over-quarter because of many factors. Some quarters, we added a few big partners, the next quarter, TAC may go up just because <mark type="inaudible" /> start to perform. So that actually, in a large part, explains our high TAC ratio this quarter. In Q4 and Q3 last year, we added a few big partners and <mark type="inaudible" /> up this quarter.</p>
          <p>But going forward, <mark type="inaudible" /> every quarter where the TAC ratio will be hinges on different partners' performance, mix shift, or different operating and mix shift of mechanical partners, and also competitors' move. We realize that this is a pretty competitive &#x2013; this business is pretty competitive. But just to add on, I think when we look at different types of partners, we look closely at what partners can bring us incremental revenue, either incremental users or incremental <mark type="inaudible" /> partners who're more willing to enter into deals with us as partners. So that's what we're looking to doing and we're going to continue to do.</p>

          <p>As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. And the next question comes from the line of Mr. James Lee with Sterne Agee Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow on Phoenix Nest a little bit. Robin, maybe you can talk about this, if you can. Who are the early adopters and which specific vertical customers you're seeing maybe driving this adoption? And is it more the B2B customer who are driving it or B2C, and if I can add one more to that, what is the use of Phoenix business specifically? Is it kind of complementary to the old system that you have or do they &#x2013; do the new people coming on to this system use Phoenix Nest as a main system going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James. I think, at this time, the Professional Edition or Phoenix Nest coexist with Classic Edition. So customers using both &#x2013; I mean those customer who are using Phoenix Nest are also using our Classic Edition. Most of the users of &#x2013; or customers of Phoenix Nest are more matured customers. They understand better how search marketing works and they understand better how to measure the ROI. We have lots of customers from all kinds of different industries, but overall, we would like to encourage more and more customers to shift from the Classic Edition to Professional Edition, and I think those more mature customers would shift first, and they contribute probably majority of our current revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, just some more color to what Robin said. So it's available to anyone, so anyone can participate now. As far as we go out and target the &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> batch of customers to move more quickly into this <mark type="inaudible" />, and those tend to be, if you think about on an ARPU basis, those tend to be the B2C type of customers, those are the &#x2013; the early adopters. And they're running &#x2013; the two systems are running parallel are designed essentially to have the customers move their spending more to Professional Edition because that's the system that will &#x2013; that's the one system they will use eventually. But right now, we are not &#x2013; for people who are on Phoenix Nest we're not shutting down their Classic Edition. We want to make sure that the transition is smooth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Just wanted to congratulate you for the quantum gains on the Investor Relations front with your new appointment. My only question is really just a broad 2009 question about Baidu Union. How should we be thinking about it in 2009 versus 2008 in terms of contribution, margin profile, et cetera? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't think we give specific guidance on the revenue from <mark type="inaudible" />, but we can talk in general about our strategy here. So basically there are two types of businesses that Baidu Union has, one is search, the other is contextual. So on search, which is a majority of our Union business in terms of revenue, as I said a few minutes ago we have different types of partners and we are looking at the different types of partners strategically and financially. We want to make sure that the traffic they bring us is as incremental to us as possible, either traffic or users, and we will have different policies as far as TAC policies are concerned for the different types of partners.</p>
          <p>And P&amp;L ratio has been naturally stable, so <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; to make sure that the average is stable. But on the other hand, we realize <mark type="inaudible" /> competitive market. On contextual side, historically a smaller part of our Union business, we're putting a lot of effort on it this year as far as improving the product, as far as getting better partners, getting better, constant partners online. So I think that business is all incremental to us because we are monetizing somebody else's traffic. But we're working on that, mostly on product side and partner side. So I don't know if that answered your question. We don't give guidance on these numbers, but in general, what our strategy is &#x2013; what our strategy is for Baidu Union this year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions if I may. The first question is, I think &#x2013; well I limit &#x2013; I'll try to limit it to one. Okay, the first question is I think in first quarter, Baidu did have marketing costs and there was even some number being provided. I just wonder if this marketing cost is already behind us? Is there any follow-on payment in the following quarters? And my second question is I noticed there is a drop in customer deposit, where you have increased in the first quarter of '08. Is this because of the cleanup of medical advertisers? If you can give some clarification that will be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Eric, it's Jennifer. On the marketing cost, whatever the activity that we have taken in Q1, the payment has made and the expense booked. So there is no lingering payment related to the Q1 activities. However, as we mentioned in the past, branding is going to be &#x2013; has been our focus and it will be a stronger focus for us this year. So I do anticipate a couple more dollars to be spent on marketing. However, it's unlikely for us to reproduce the magnitude of spend in Q1. So hopefully that answers your number one question.</p>
          <p>Number two on the customer deposit, at the end of Q4, we did have a high level of deposit and you do see a slight decrease at the end of Q1. I mentioned in our Q4 call, the year-end number for '08 customer deposit was a little abnormal, so I wouldn't take that as a normal trend and use that information, because we all know at the end of '08, the economic situation was challenging and I did mention in the prior call that customers were cautious and were holding back on their spending, so we had a lot of accumulated customer deposit. I want to say the behavior of customer deposit has resumed to the normal level, so what you're seeing in Q1 is kind of the normal customer deposit state that you're seeing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Could we ask two things, first a technical question, the cost-of-goods sold outside of TAC grew faster than revenues. Given that you've reduced cost on staff and given that you've reduced on bandwidth, why was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeffrey, it's Jennifer. I'm not sure which period you're comparing to. If &#x2013; because Q1 is a seasonally low quarter, so we typically compare Q1 ratio to the prior year period. If you look at the prior year period, if you take out TAC, I think we actually had an improvement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeffery, this is Robin. The guidance is based on the revenue trend we have seen for the past couple of months, especially after the Chinese New Year. As we mentioned during the last earnings call, after Chinese New Year, economic activities as well as user traffic has been going up. So based on that trend, we calculated that the &#x2013; the 2Q revenue projection. I think so far, we have not seen any dramatic change &#x2013; after Chinese New Year period. So we &#x2013; that's why we're giving a guidance like this.</p>

          <p>Hi Paul, this is Haoyu. So after Chinese New Year, we saw a broad pickup as far as different sectors are concerned. So I don't think I have the sort of exact &#x2013; I can't even point exact three sectors that grew the fastest. So the &#x2013; even the traditional B2B sectors <mark type="inaudible" /> softness before the Chinese New Year, with equally good recovery as far as we can see now after Chinese New Year.</p>
          <p>As far as medical, so I think we mentioned before that once we collected all the paperwork that's needed, that the majority of the customers are back and the majority of the revenue is back. So now, it &#x2013; it's one of the biggest sectors that we have right now and we think it will continue to grow at a healthy rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, great, thank you very much for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about head count? Do the recent head count reductions flow from Baidu restructuring the sales teams that Baidu acquired in the three years after the IPO and if so where do you think you are in the head count sales force restructuring process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi James, this Peng here. The &#x2013; actually starting from the second half last year, we initiated a couple of actions to improve the sales operation efficiency including the streamlined organization, flattening the &#x2013; of management structure, and also centralized a couple of the functions. As a result of those initiatives, starting from &#x2013; actually, starting from the second half of last year, the head count for sales organization decreased, that being mainly the reason. On other hand, we are looking at all the opportunities to make the strategic investments in the sales force, especially for the training organization and also for the development of the Phoenix system as well. So we will take all opportunities to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, this is Jennifer, let me just add to that. Q1, we did see another sequential decrease also on head count. I just wanted to point out, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to look for ways to improve operational efficiency at the same time investing R&amp;D capabilities. Q1 is a low period for us to recruit R&amp;D resources, and typically, the hiring goes out in Q2 and Q3. So I think at this pace of head count, the management is healthy for us, and on the operations side as Peng mentioned, we are definitely looking at ways to improving &#x2013; to improve the efficiency and there might be some resource shift to manage the kind of system capabilities that we have. So I wouldn't take this one quarter as a trend going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if you look at the sales force in total, is it reasonable to assume that having bought your own sales forces in the big cities, you're now roughly where you want to be in terms of sales force and most of the headcounts adds are in research and development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on balance, James, we have been executing a slow shift from heavy concentration on additional sales force hire to a more R&amp;D focus. I think on balance, the total organization, the kind of state that we are in, which going into the Q2, Q3, hiring time, at that time, things will stabilize.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my call. And I have two questions. And first starting with some of your new initiative, such as your online commerce initiative as well as your Japanese &#x2013; Japan venture, and as you significantly speed up your R&amp;D force, and how much of your new R&amp;D head count will go into this initiative? And when should we expect this initiative to be material or meaningful revenue contributor to your company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard, this is Robin. Regarding to the two new initiatives you mentioned, online commerce and Japan, we've &#x2013; we gave a rough guidance at the beginning of the year on the costs associated with Japan, so &#x2013; so this year, the cost will be between 25 to $30 million. For the online commerce, because it's not material enough, we have not disclosed a separate cost for that. This long-term investment opportunities that we view is strategically important. So we are not counting on any revenue for this year, and as contact &#x2013; the product that gets more mature, we'll have a better idea when to monetize that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Robin. And my follow-up question is regarding Baidu Union, and which obviously remains as a bright spot. And given the fact that your archrival, Google China has been pretty aggressive in sealing partnership with the third-party website, and going forward, how would you &#x2013; how would Baidu differentiate from Google to attract more Union members?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think off course the number one consideration for any partners is first time, on content side, is calculate how much we &#x2013; revenue we share with them, so this can only be achieved by better monetization capability that we're developing. Internet is one of those, and we are also launching some new products on contextual side as well. So money is one thing, on the other hand, we are &#x2013; we do have a pretty dedicated team serving the Union partners, either search side or contextual side. I think we have a lot of advantages in terms of how we serve the needs of our partners, how we are respond to the need, and how to communicate with them. So it's combination of many things on money side and also on the service side. So it's competitive, but we do believe we have some advantages on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, just to add what Haoyu just said, Richard, I think when it comes to attracting Union members or partners, two major forces will drive the competitiveness, one is the number of customers or advertisers. The more customers we have, the better we can serve our partners in terms of revenue generation. And the second force is the monetization capability or RPN. So while we're working on a better system, actually we have been continuously improving the monetization capability of the traffic we acquired. So with more customers and better monetization, I think going forward, our Union <mark type="inaudible" /> will be more attractive to potential partners.</p>

          <p>Eddie, this is Robin. I think it's important to clarify by being a search company, we provide all kinds of search services, be it text, image, audio files, or video files. Baidu MP3 has been an audio file search, and we try to make everything publicly available online or searchable by Baidu. We have never provided any download service, and we do not intend to become a content provider for music or whatsoever.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>Got that. So there would not be any initiate using banner advertising to monetizing music, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been using banner advertising to monetize the search service, some of the search services including MP3 search. At the time of IPO that's like almost four years ago we had found more than 3.5 years ago that revenue from MP3 related services represent roughly 5% of our total revenue. I think then the percentage has gone down significantly. So although we would very much like to see a good value chain &#x2013; good business model for digital music, so far the monetization capability for music has not been as strong as we expected, and the user traffic for MP3 search as a percentage of our total traffic is also dropping.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. This is Stanley for Steve. So the question we have is regarding the Q2 guidance. So we noticed that the Q2 guidance is implying a slower year-over-year growth than the Q1, what you guys just announced. So we're wondering, are you guys seeing any slower growth in April or just try to be conservative here?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that really goes back to a couple quarters for &#x2013; because of what happened during the previous quarters, and our revenue mix changed, our customer quality improved, and quarter-on-quarter growth would make more sense at this time than year-over-year growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

We had the Olympic event and we had a very, very challenging quarter in Q4. And so you do have a lower base to work on and compared to the last year's strong performance, just as Robin mentioned, I think at this point, the sequential ratio is more relevant.</p>

          <p>And so we never &#x2013; as a practice, we never break out specifically how much revenue is from our Union business. So you said that the recent increase of tax ratio has &#x2013; is attributed to accounts growth of Union revenue. As far as outlook, we can't predict whether it will continue to go faster than organic revenue or accounts differential will be. So I think we've been talking about how we think about <mark type="inaudible" /> and how we think about Union business in general, we do have our strategies in place and our policies in place, and we'll &#x2013; as soon as you see TAC fluctuate quarter-on-quarter going forward.</p>

          <p>If I could follow up with that 2Q guidance question and maybe you guys can help remind us what are the seasonal factors that's driving the quarter that we should be thinking about? What verticals and high season and maybe besides travel, which will be a good factor, I believe, in 2Q, what other verticals are you seeing good demand? I guess, lastly within your guidance assumption, are you guys including any improved monetization from the potential use of the Phoenix system during the quarter? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hi James, this is Robin. Regarding the Q2 I think it's largely driven by the March performance because of the seasonality every year right after Chinese New Year, there is sudden pickup in consumer activities, be it user or advertiser. So based on what we have seen in March, we give out guidance for Q2. One thing I forgot to mention about the year-over-year comparison is that last year, the Chinese New Year was very late. So you have less opportunity to monetize your traffic in Q1. Therefore, that the Q2 versus Q1 growth will be stronger, and this year, the Chinese New Year is a little earlier, so we've seen more revenue &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> more revenue in Q1 and that's why we see the Q2 growth like what we guided in the press release and the prepared script.</p>
          <p>In terms of monetization, it's an ongoing process. We have been working better monetization algorithms for the past few years and the most significant project has been Phoenix Nest. That being said, Phoenix Nest is a &#x2013; it's a revolutionary bidding system and it's just launched like a week ago. The initial effect to revenue is actually nothing, but going forward, in the long run, we believe that this system will give us a much better capability to monetize our traffic. In terms of verticals, haven't seen anything different.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we &#x2013; hi, James. This is Haoyu. So different sectors definitely have different seasonality. So for example in Q2, now around kind of prior to May 1 holiday, we see pickup in travel for example, so we don't look at it in that kind of granularity, how we give guidance. So what we really look at is the performance in terms of ARPU and the performance of &#x2013; the number of active customers and the new customer positions seen in recent weeks. Then we really look at how, for example, April compared with March last year, how May compared with April last year, then sort of try to account for any differences this year and give out our best forecast. So I think, seasonality is definitely there depending on different sectors each year but we don't look at it in that kind of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everyone. My question is about the long-term direction of your R&amp;D and mainly does Baidu have any aspirations to be a provider of online tools beyond basic search results and search monetization? Now Robin, you and I spoke about this a couple of years ago but I'm still compelled to ask you again, because in an early answer, you said that music downloads &#x2013; your answer to music downloads suggests your sole priority is search, and less priority on how to make search and download a better customer experience, so &#x2013; and I ask because if you look at the global search platforms out there, the market leaders tend to evolve in a direction where there is continuous business development of online tools. So in many ways, I see a competitive <mark type="inaudible" /> as much as Google as well, so again, your thoughts as to the R&amp;D direction of your company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way. I think for Baidu, our goal is to became a media platform in the sense that we provide a platform that monetize traffic for our owned and operated properties as well as our Union partners. By doing that, the R&amp;D focus will need to be active in two fronts. One is the core web search capabilities. It's a very sophisticated and still evolving system. We have lot of efforts putting in that and so far, I think on a worldwide basis, the most beautiful business model for Internet industry is the paid search, and we need to have our own search traffic in order to drive long-term growth for the company.</p>
          <p>And the second front is the monetization capability. That front, I think, we've been late. Only during the past couple of years, we start seriously investing in the monetization capability and the Phoenix Nest is a result of that. With more and more search traffic or inventory to sell and better and better monetization capability, I think this company will be able to maintain a very high growth rate for the years to come. So in that sense, our R&amp;D &#x2013; long-term focus for the R&amp;D team has always been search-related &#x2013; web search-related, be it a natural search or a paid search. We have a number of vertical searches, image search, news search, MP3 search, video search, those designed to help drive traffic to web search, not to make money by themselves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. I think that last quarter you disclosed that you'd spend about RMB40 million on the CCTV sponsorship in the first quarter, which I guess you took through your SG&amp;A line. Is it sensible at all to look at SG&amp;A ex that 40 million or should I assume that if you didn't spend the 40 million, you would have spend 10 or 20 or 30 on something else? So that's one question and then since it's the back end of the call, a separate question. I came across a news story about a confidence plan you have set up to encourage SMEs to experiment with Phoenix Nest where you give them rebates. Could you talk a little bit about the confidence program for the professional Phoenix Nest?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, this is Jennifer, I'll answer your first question. Last quarter, we'd provided guidance that sequential &#x2013; sequentially, we anticipate a 40 million incremental marketing related expense. Yes, CCTV is the majority of that incremental expenditure. We typically also have other annual kind of events that happens in Q1. So Q1 is &#x2013; I think, if your answer is &#x2013; your guess is right, if I take out the 40 million related to marketing, the rest of that will be kind of the other &#x2013; the main SG&amp;A expenses primarily related to workforce and the normal activities.</p>

          <p>Hi, James, first about the confidence plan that we announced just in the past few days, it really aims at encouraging customers to adopt Phoenix Nest. So how it works is if they qualify, <mark type="inaudible" /> as far as their spending on Phoenix system in May, we will provide a rebate <mark type="inaudible" />, that's really a target that <mark type="inaudible" /> adoption.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just want to get an update on the &#x2013; in terms of the mobile search. I guess Robin made some comment in the past, like a little weeks ago and if you can give us some market share data in terms of Baidu's market share in WAP search, that will be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dick, in terms of mobile search, I think there are still lots of uncertainties going forward, as you know, that the 3G network infrastructure wise just got started. It's too early to place a huge bet on that. Right now, let's say the most popular form of mobile search is WAP and we believe that Baidu has the number one position in terms of mobile search traffic wise, and we have a number of mobile search services, web search, Post Bar, and a number of others, but going forward, we expect the format will change, the consumer behavior will change, the rate of &#x2013; for this Internet access will change, and a lot of things will change, and we would like to work with the carriers to come up with better, more innovative solutions for the mobile search users. But at this time, it's kind of too early to tell.</p>
