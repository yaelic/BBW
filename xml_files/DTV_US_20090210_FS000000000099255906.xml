          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tom (:05), and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us for the Fourth Quarter 2008 Financial Results and Outlook Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chase Carey our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel.</p>
          <p>In a moment I'll hand the call over to Chase and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first, I'll read to you the following. On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV Group's and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good day, everybody. We feel good about our fourth-quarter results and the momentum of our business today overall. Let me talk first about the U.S. I believe our brand content and overall customer experience have never been stronger. At a time when many of our competitors are feeling pressure from the broader economy and facing challenges in multiple fronts, we believe our focus on delivering a great television experience to quality customers through increasingly strong and agile sales and marketing initiatives is enabling us to further differentiate us from our competitors.</p>
          <p>These strengths have been enhanced recently by more aggressive offers to new and existing customers. Our offers became somewhat more aggressive in the middle of 2008, in response to both competitive and market pressures and we continued that strategy through Q4.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that our goal has been to neutralize rather than one-up competitive offers, as it is our objective to differentiate ourselves on the quality of our experience, not on price. We do believe these were intelligent investments capitalizing on our strength in the market.</p>
          <p>Taking a minute to look at the fourth quarter in a bit more detail. Clearly, one of the highlights was subscriber growth. We achieved multi-year highs in both gross and net subscriber growth. More importantly, this growth continued to come from quality subscribers with strong advanced product take rates. Obviously, the aforementioned offers also helped.</p>
          <p>Churn was also a highlight. The driving forces behind churn reduction were the quality of our experience and the quality of our subscriber base. We continue to target our sales initiative to quality subscribers and tighten up credit terms to limit involuntary churn.</p>
          <p>About half of our customers now have an advanced product. Churn was also aided by more attractive upgrade offers, and offers targeted our good customers to mitigate broader economic and competitive pressures. SAC was up a bit year-on-year, but pretty close to our expectations.</p>
          <p>A richer mix of advanced products, as well as higher sales costs were the primary drivers. In the fourth quarter, we also began to deploy an HD-DVR box in place of its standard-def DVR, so that an HD upgrade could be made without a box replacement or a truck roll. Without this change, our SAC would actually have been down from Q4 '07.</p>
          <p>Turning to ARPU, lower growth is something we talked about earlier. ARPU growth was actually a touch lower than expected, the primary factors lowering Q4 growth were increased new customer offers, credits to existing customers, lower hardware revenue and lower ad sales. Already touched on the offers and credits, hardware revenue has been dropping as box costs drop, and ad sales clearly were a victim of the economy.</p>
          <p>The other Q4 metric that was a bit higher than expected was upgrade and retention spending. Upgrade and retention was actually about flat year-on-year, but we had expected it to be down. Again, the largest factor driving upgrade spending was demand for advanced products from our existing customers.</p>
          <p>We also increased spending on our MOVERS program and launched a loyalty program for our good long-term customers, and Pat will describe these in more detail in a minute.</p>
          <p>In terms of bottom line results, I believe the number that best signifies our progress is cash flow. In the fourth quarter our cash flow before interest and taxes increased about 45% year-on-year, even with 60,000 more gross ads in Q4. Our Q4 OPBDA grew a more modest 5% year-on-year as factors like higher sub-ads and advance product upgrade demand put pressure on profits.</p>
          <p>Our OPBDA growth was also impacted by an ongoing shift in the split of SAC and upgrade spending that gets capitalized versus expense. Our aggregate Q4 cash, SAC and upgrade spending was up about $50 million year-on-year. The amount of that that was expensed was up about 100 million.</p>
          <p>Turning more briefly to Latin America, much of the strength I noted in our U.S. business was true here as well. Most of our key metrics continue to be strong. Churn is the one metric that continues to run higher year-on-year, with Q4 '08 churn at 1.59%.</p>
          <p>While always looking to lower churn, we are comfortable at this level given the lower SAC and expanding prepaid business in the region. Q4 revenue was up about 15% year-on-year in spite of currency issues.</p>
          <p>In fact, ARPU was down 11% in Brazil in Q4, leading to zero growth there. OPBDA was even stronger with about 60% growth and a nine-percentage-point improvement in OPBDA margins. Our Q4 cash before interest and taxes grew about 50%.</p>
          <p>Overall, we feel 2008 as a whole has been a really good year for the DIRECTV Group. We grew revenues about 15% and OPBDA about 20%. Cash flow before interest and taxes increased over $1 billion.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Pat for more detailed comments on the quarter, and then I'll come back and touch on 2009 expectations.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chase. All in all, I thought we had a solid quarter, particularly in terms of subscriber growth, churn management and cash flow. The one metric that was not as strong that Chase mentioned was ARPU, which we'll talk about a bit later. Starting first with subscribers, we were pleased with the strong demand for DIRECTV, particularly in light of the more challenging economic and competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>The strength of our brand along with more competitive offers contributed to a 6% increase in gross additions to over one million subscribers in the quarter. Despite the continued roll out of FIOS and U-verse this was our best number in 15 quarters.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to point out that the last time we had more gross additions was before we started implementing the tighter credit policies. Much of this growth can be attributed to the strong results from our direct sales channel, which had its best quarter ever by growing 20% over the prior year, while contributing over 50% of our total gross adds. Our other strong contributors to this growth included our local dealers and commercial accounts. But more important than the increase in gross additions was that the overall quality of these subscribers was at or above the levels we've seen in recent quarters.</p>
          <p>Another indicator of the quality of new subs in that 55 to 60% are signing up for HD and/or DVR services, bringing our overall penetration of advanced services to about half of our subscriber base.</p>
          <p>We also did a good job managing churn in the quarter. Monthly churn of 1.42% was flat with last year's level. And I'll remind you that last year's fourth quarter churn rate was 15 basis points better than in 2006. The story has been fairly consistent in recent quarters, namely our higher quality subscriber base combined with increased penetration of HD and DVR services continue to drive strong churn rates. Specifically, tighter credit screening policies and improved fraud management have been driving down involuntary and first-year churn.</p>
          <p>It's also worth highlighting that our full-year churn dropped four basis points to 1.47% representing the best level in about nine years. Adding the strong gross adds and churn together drove about a 10% increase in net adds to 301,000 subscribers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As you probably saw in the earnings release, this was the best number in almost four years. But the number looks even better from a market share perspective as our sequential growth in net subscriber adds was about 50% greater than the combined increase reported by both FIOS and U-verse. In other words, we added about 150,000 more subs in Q4 than Q3, while the Telco's combined increase was only about 100,000 subscribers. This continues a trend we've seen in recent quarters, where the Telco market share gains appear to be coming at the expense of cable companies and Dish Network.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Financial Results. Revenues were up about 8% at DIRECTV U.S. to 4.7 billion. Although the 8% revenue growth is still among the highest in our industry, it's clearly a number below our recent performance due to slower ARPU growth of 3.5%. We've been flagging this slower ARPU growth for several months now, so we're not surprised by it. In fact, our full year ARPU growth of 6.1% was a bit higher than our internal target set at the beginning of the year. You may recall that ARPU has been trending down for many reasons, including lower upfront HD and DVR equipment fees, more attractive offers for new and existing customers and slower ad revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The decline in upfront equipment fees has coincided with lower set-top box costs. So although offering free hardware hurts ARPU, from an economic perspective this has been mostly offset by the 25% decline, or about 400 million savings in CapEx this year, resulting from the lower set-top box costs. And similar to industry trends, the ad sales decline was probably a bit steeper than we had originally expected.</p>
          <p>Regarding our increased promotional activity, it's helpful to look at it in terms of offers provided for new versus existing customers. On the front-end, our offers for new customers were a bit richer starting in the second quarter of last year. Later in the year, we decided to opportunistically capture market share at a time when our competitors were struggling. We believe the unfavorable ARPU impact from these strategies is a short-term issue, because as I mentioned earlier, we've been adding high-quality customers who are signing up for HD and DVR services.</p>
          <p>So although we're likely to see an ARPU impact related to these richer promotions over the next couple of quarters, we expect this impact to diminish as we go through the year when subscribers start coming off their one-year introductory offers and revert to a more normalized ARPU.</p>
          <p>Regarding promotional activity for existing customers, we implemented a more attractive loyalty program for our best subscribers during the second half of last year. This program provides our highest valued customers with offers such as a free upgrade to HD or DVR services and anniversary gifts.</p>
          <p>So here again from an ARPU growth perspective, we're anticipating the impact from this program to lessen in the second half of this year. Another reason for the slower ARPU growth in 2009 relates to the completion of a satellite lease which generated about 75 million of revenue last year. While the contract -- with the contract ending, we will see an unfavorable impact to ARPU growth of between 60 and 80 basis points each quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, the net impact from all of these changes is lower ARPU growth in 2009 as well as stronger ARPU growth in the second half of this year compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>Turning now to profitability. Our OPBDA margin of about 22.2% was down from 22.9% the prior year, primarily due to higher acquisition and marketing costs related to the increase in gross additions, as well as the flow-through effect from some of the ARPU trends I just talked about.</p>
          <p>From a cash standpoint, our upgrade retention and subscriber acquisition costs, excluding the impact from the higher gross ads, were relatively flat compared with the prior year.</p>
          <p>However from a P&amp;L perspective, these costs were higher than last year due to a few items including the higher installation costs associated with an increase in customers acquiring HD and DVR services. The increase in existing customers upgrading to advanced service was in part due to our new loyalty program, which I talked about early.</p>
          <p>We also have implemented a more aggressive MOVERS program because the cost of saving a customer who is moving is far less than the cost of acquiring a new customer. So we're retaining a higher percentage of our customers who are moving, which results in lower churn, but an increase in our upgrade and retention expenses.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Chase mentioned, there has been a shift in the split of SAC and upgrade spending that gets capitalized versus expense. This is mostly due to the fact that our set-top box costs are capitalized and they have been trending lower, while our dish and installation costs are expensed, and they have been trending slightly higher because of the incremental costs associated with an HD or DVR upgrade.</p>
          <p>With these fourth quarter results, we ended 2008 with a full-year OPBDA growth rate of about 14%, while increasing OPBDA margin from 24.8% to 25.3%. More importantly, we hit our target of adding at least one billion of incremental cash flow before interest and taxes compared to 2007. As a result, DIRECTV U.S. generated about 2.5 billion or 73% more cash flow before interest and taxes than the prior year.</p>
          <p>In addition to the increase in OPBDA, the cash flow growth was driven by a 24% decline in CapEx, mostly due to the lower set-top box costs and increased usage of refurbished boxes from our lease program. At the consolidated level, DIRECTV Group's free cash flow, which includes Latin America taxes and interest, finished the year up 76% to 1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>With this growth, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of about $2 billion and a net debt balance of 3.8 billion. Also in the quarter were share repurchases of about 1.4 billion, bringing the total for the year to 3.2 billion. Cumulatively, over the last 2.5 years, we have repurchased more than 400 million shares for over $8 billion, while reducing our outstanding share count by almost 30%.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I thought we had a good quarter capping a very solid year in which we met or exceeded all of our key targets we shared with you at our Investor Day a year ago. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Chase for some closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. Let me turn for a couple of minutes to 2009. While we have many plans for this year, I want to start by touching briefly on three priorities. First, we'll continue to drive our brand and content leadership. We launch a satellite later this year that will enable us to continue to add to our HD experience. We'll continue to build on our leadership in sports and add to the richness of our content with events like Friday Night Lights.</p>
          <p>Our VOD offering will improve in both richness of the offering and functionality with -- in terms of things like faster access and a more integrated experience. We'll also continue to use technology and software to enrich the content experience with features like the DVR Scheduler and QuickTune. Another key initiative in 2009 will be our Whole Home Experience, which will start to roll out in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Second priority will be the continued strengthening and focusing of our sales and marketing efforts in a complicated and competitive market. High-quality subs will be a greater priority than ever. Building our AT&amp;T relationship to its full potential is a key objective. We also think there are real opportunities for us to put cable on its heels by developing relationships with the cellular industry as mobility becomes an increasingly central theme in people's lives.</p>
          <p>The third priority is to improve our customer service. This is one initiative where we came up short of our targets last year in both quality and efficiency. Ownership of a large part of our installed network is giving us much better insight into many aspects of service.</p>
          <p>We have developed tools and technologies like wireless handhelds, dish pointing verification, diagnostics and a vastly improved web experience to improve in performance at many levels. The key here remains execution, and we have a tremendous amount of focus on this priority.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial story for 2009, we recognize that this is a time of unique uncertainty. We've weathered the economic storms pretty well so far, but are fully aware of the risks. Fortunately, we face these issues from a position of strength, when you look at our balance sheet, our cash flow, our competitive position and quality subscriber base. These times may well provide opportunities to capitalize on others' reactions to the challenges.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are not immune, so we're doubling our efforts to be lean and disciplined in every area, from capital expenditures to head count to operating cost. We believe we should plan for things to be bad and have any surprises to be on the upside or the positive.</p>
          <p>With this environment in mind, we expect the U.S. business in 2009 to look a lot like 2008 with solid sub growth, improved margins and significant cash flow growth. Starting with subscribers, we expect net subscriber growth around the 2008 level with a little higher gross adds and churn around 1.5%. AT&amp;T will be a positive, although that will roll out throughout the year, but the AT&amp;T effect will be somewhat offset by plans to moderate our offers a touch. ARPU growth is expected to be in the 4% plus range. We expect 2009 SAC to be around the level we saw in Q4 '08, while we expect to see increased demand for advanced products, we look to find savings to offset that pressure.</p>
          <p>Pre-SAC margin will improve in 2009, though not as much as it did in 2008. Programming costs per subs increase five to 6%, upgrade and retention spending should be around the 2008 level on an absolute basis, maybe a touch higher. We expect margin improvement from areas like service and G&amp;A. Capital expenditures including set-top boxes -- excluding set-top boxes -- will be $500 million plus, but down from 2008. From a top and bottom line perspective, we expect high single digit revenue growth with double-digit OPBDA growth, although down a bit from the 2008 growth rate. We expect cash flow before interest and taxes to be north of $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking a little more closely at the first quarter of 2009, we expect strong subscriber growth with gross adds at or above our Q1 '08 level and churn around the Q1 '08 level leading to another strong quarter of net sub growth. The year-on-year ARPU growth will be below our expected 4% plus year ARPU growth, probably in the two to 3% range. As I noted earlier, we began to enhance our offers for new and existing customers in Q2 '08. Therefore these items are larger in Q1 '09 than Q1 '08. This impact will diminish as we go through 2009. Q1 '09 also has some unfavorable timing on pay-per-view events, which are later in the year in 2009. The high sub growth in ARPU variants will put some pressure on Q1 OPBDA, but we have factored that into our full year expectations.</p>
          <p>Turning to Latin America, we obviously face the same economic risks, with the addition of currency challenges, so we'll be equally disciplined in this region. That being said, we believe 2009 should be a year of real growth in Latin America. From an operating perspective, one of our priorities will be to follow the U.S. Group blueprint in maximizing our advantage in HD and DVR services. In fact, our advantage is even greater than the U.S., because our competitive position is stronger and we can piggy-back on the U.S. infrastructure for cost and functionality advantages.</p>
          <p>Another key advantage -- key objective will be to expand into the middle of the market. We've clearly established ourselves as the premium segment leader. There's a great opportunity to use our leverage to create profitable packages for the mid-market. Our prepaid business is one such effort, but we'll do more in 2009.</p>
          <p>On an individual country basis, there are clearly other priorities and opportunities that we're focused on. From a financial perspective, 2009 should be another strong year for subscriber growth with net adds -- net sub adds around the 2008 level.</p>
          <p>ARPU is a bit tougher to project due to the currency issues. We expect ARPU to decline modestly due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, particularly in Brazil, although we'll do our best to offset currency impacts.</p>
          <p>On an overall basis, we've done a pretty good job protecting ourselves from currency fluctuations, as most of our costs other than satellite leases and set-top boxes are in local currencies. These efforts should enable us to generate OPBDA growth in the low double-digit range. Cash flow before interest and taxes will be relatively flat with 2008, as higher box costs for advanced products and satellite CapEx offset the higher OPBDA.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, despite the economic turmoil and increasing competition, we're very positive on our expectations for 2009 for the DIRECTV Group. We're looking to revenue growth just under 10%, OPBDA growth in the low-to-mid-teens, cash flow before interest and taxes growth of about 30%, and EPS growth of 15% plus.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you for you time. I'll now turn it back to Jon before I return to questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I was just curious on, if you could comment on Liberty with the preliminary proxy out? Can we try to get our arms around some kind of deal structure, what the timing might be? And any comment you can give on the thinking of what an exchange ratio might look like if you go ahead with the Reverse Morris Trust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of steps down the road. But I guess, I'm not going to get sort of putting I guess the cart in front of the horse. I mean, in terms of Liberty, I'm not sure I have a whole lot new to say. They're going forward with their spins, but that doesn't really directly impact us. I mean and I think that situation is probably pretty similar to what we've said. I mean, and what we described before. I think both of us would agree the structure that exists today between DIRECTV and another public company of which DIRECTV is the majority of the value is probably -- would not be optimum from most people's perspectives. And if there's a way for both of us to address that in a manner that makes sense, then I think we would &#x2013; we'd do it. We'd look to do it.</p>
          <p>That being said, we're not going to do something that doesn't make sense for us. It's not affecting our operations, it's not affecting what we're doing with the business as I think our results show. So I think we will continue to talk with Liberty, and see what we can do. To the degree their spin helps, it helps narrow or address some of the issues, I mean, the issues obviously revolve around things like value and governance, to the degree we can address those, I think we both -- I think it will be a positive. But I think the discussions between us and Liberty are constructive, and I think we both see it pretty much the same and continue to try to have positive discussions and continue see if there is a way to I guess reach an agreement that would be good for all parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just switch gears? You made a comment about potential wireless deals. Could you talk about what you envision and do you need one wireless carrier or are you thinking about multiples? And just a last question, you said that advertising sales were down steeply in '08. Can you say what advertising sales actually were in 2008 and how much they declined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Telco -- I mean, the comment is not that specific. I mean, I do think, like clearly the wireless business venue has sort of operated independent of the other sort of aspects of what's become a bundle: broadband telephony, wire telephony and video. And I think there will be more of an interest on both sides for wireless to become a more interrelated part of the other aspects of this business. And I think that's good for the wireless guys and I think good for us. Obviously, some of that's -- and it can evolve in a lot of ways. I mean we've obviously developed functionalities to deal with wireless phones in the DVR Scheduler and the like and content is going to get richer from that perspective, obviously the customer base is that one can create things around, but it's early days.</p>
          <p>I think we -- I think it's a positive opportunity for us, and I think it's an opportunity for us to create a dimension through our relationships, obviously we don't have a wireless, we don't have a cellular business ourselves, but we obviously have relationships with big wireless players, Verizon and AT&amp;T. And I think the real opportunities for us to create win-wins, expand our relationships in a win-win way, to do things. And I think mobility is going to become in multiple ways, more and more value to attribute and a more and more important one. And I think you already see wait and you see how many households are cutting up phone wire and going for wireless telephony, and that experience is getting richer and broadband on a wireless basis gets richer. I think those are all opportunities. What's the shape and form of that as we go forward? I think we'll have to see as we discuss those things.</p>
          <p>But it's certainly I think premature to be trying to pick one path over another, what is the right opportunity other than I think what I was really addressing is from a broad base, is I think it's a real opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>In term of ad sales, probably not, and it is clearly down. And we expect it to continue to be certainly down going forward in the short-term, we'll see where it goes. Again, I think we want to plan, we're going to plan for things to be tough. And I'm probably not going to put a percentage to it or that type of precision to it, but it is clearly a place that we have felt the -- and we've been immune to a lot of the economic pressures. It is certainly one place we've not been immune and we felt the economic pressures that a lot of other players in the advertising arena feel.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. So I think it's pretty clear that you're taking share from Dish and from cable. I was wondering if you could characterize more of that share coming from Dish or whether more of it's coming from cable. And then secondly, we were wondering if you would consider increasing your leverage in the near-term to take advantage of the window of opportunity for high-quality issuers today</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of share, yeah, I'd probably -- I mean, we obviously do try and -- we track and look at where both our subs are coming from and who they're going to. So it is certainly important to us. I guess what I'd probably say on that &#x2013; and I'm probably again not going to get too specific in it. It is both, it's certainly not -- it's not largely skewed one way or the other. It may not be fully balanced, but it is a relatively general sort of share that would not again say it's all. It's largely coming from one of those buckets or the other. It may not be exactly proportional, but I think you'd probably say, if I was describing it generally, you'd say it's sort of generally across the breadth of the market.</p>
          <p>And I guess in terms of leverage, it may be -- I guess everything is relative. You may say it's a little better today than it was a couple of months ago. I certainly would not describe this as a good market. Now I guess, who knows what it is, it could be -- could get worse. And I don't know who's going into it if it gets worse, but I think we'll continue to monitor it. I don't -- I guess, I would not describe -- I think we are a quality issuer, I would not describe the credit markets as favorable. And therefore, I don't think we probably would be rushing into these credit markets unless we really had a reason to do so. And I think we'd obviously wrestle harder with what are the terms in which we get it. But I think as Pat touched on, we sit on real cash today. We are generating real cash going forward in the year. And so I don't think we'd go into these type of credit markets unless, again, we were at a place to have a clear cut reason to do it, because I think in some timeframe these credit markets are going to get better than they are today -- so I mean they're better than they were a few months ago. But I would still not -- not trying to be naive about how quickly the market comes back or the breadth and depth of the credit market problems, but I think somewhere in a reasonable time, I would hope you're going to get a better credit market than you got today still.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there always are. I mean again, I wouldn't say something that was sort of a shift, so clearly there are places we do better and there are places that we struggle more. But I would not have said -- and in some degree, sometimes we have particular efforts to take advantage of something going on in a market. So some of it, it will always vary based on our own target, in essence and it's in taking out the targeted stuff that it's really trying to be opportunistic. I wouldn't say there's been a real shift. I mean, so certainly there are differences between regions and segments. But again, I wouldn't say you've gotten a sort of shift in the short -- and in the last quarter in that regard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think, Vijay, a couple of things. If you look at fourth quarter, revenues for the segment were up like 15%. They probably would have been up probably 40% more or something like that with kind of flat exchange rates. On OPBDA, we were up like 60%. That would probably have been up 15 to 20% absent exchange rates. So it kind of shows also the natural hedge we have in that -- most of our expenses are in local currencies as well. So we get kind of a nice hedge on the exchange risk.</p>

          <p>If I could, one final one. Since you launched your VOD proposition in the marketplace, can you give any color on the take up usage of it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess my first would be &#x2013; it's still &#x2013; we have launched -- it's early days. I mean the take up is increasing. I still think VOD just from a -- for all players as a content offering has to improve in terms of Windows and the like. We are working to -- probably our greater focus right now is really in improving the experience, and really making it easier to use, making some of the functionality more attractive. But I wouldn't say right now it's a -- it's big enough to be driving anything in a material way financially. I think we're quite happy with the growth rate of it, our take up of it is improving. But again I think for us VOD is something that I think we look at a as from a -- if you look at our financials or something, that over a couple of years, as the whole proposition improves, becomes a more meaningful part of the story, not, sort of -- not a few quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Chase, because you said mobility was important, do you need to license Sling technology to pursue your long-term goals there? And then separately, when you look forward with Charter TV on the brink of bankruptcy as soon as maybe next week and Comcast going all-digital over the next couple of years, what's been your experience with those type events in terms of helping drive sub growth? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think if it's -- I don't know -- I think Sling as a technology has -- I mean, it may be something very popular with a niche of customer, but the technology sort of has issues in terms of it being scalable. And I'm not sure that's really &#x2013; but I think your question's, what do people want from a mobility perspective? I think they want a richer experience. I think there's a question of do they really want to watch two hour movies on cell phones? Do they want to be able to interact with their devices at home to record it and watch it on a large screen TV? Is it really geared more towards short viewing of live events that you don't want to miss in sports and news and the like.</p>
          <p>So, I think there is a -- I think it becomes an important part, but I don't necessarily think it's just another screen that looks like your other screens. I think it becomes an integrated part of an experience from a functionality and a content perspective, but I think in a way that makes sense for it. And I think there's some aspects of it that just simply are customer based and sales channel based, I mean, that we can take advantage of. I mean, just on a -- on some sales level, you just go out and look at how many -- the thousands of retail outlets and the like, and as to the degree you can start to create some -- I think, put some meat on the bones -- create some connections past it, maybe some offers with it. And again some more integration between the content and video aspects of it. I think those are all opportunities. I think the way Sling works and piggy-backs on the back of their &#x2013; of the Spectrum, I think probably in any scale starts to &#x2013; I'm not a technology guy, but I've spent enough time with it that I think has some challenges. So I think the early stages of it will probably -- the real focus is going to be geared more towards -- sales, marketing and functionality bits is sort of a logical step forward with the big players in the cellular business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Charter potentially could be filing for bankruptcy next week, I think in the past when cable companies have gone bankrupt, you might have had some opportunities to sort of still share and then you made comments when Comcast went all digital in Chicago a while back. If you can just remind us of that experience and do you think Comcast going all-digital and Charter potentially having some financial issues &#x2013; you know, a lot of public press surrounding that. Are those opportunities for you or is that just sort of a normal course of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's certainly opportunity for us. I mean, again, as you said, we publicly said it with Adelphia, we clearly targeted an array of markets, and they did very well with us. I think we found the digital transitions from creating both turmoil in the market, as well as increasing different propositions for those customers. If they have to deal with the cost of digital boxes, that sort of opens opportunities for us vis-&#xE0;-vis those customers. There are certainly things we do, I mean in many ways the &#x2013; it has become an ordinary -- I touched on our sort of sales and marketing focus, and I think it has become a real strength for our business. And one of the core themes is in all levels to be nimble, agile and opportunistic in whatever shape and form those things present themselves. And certainly those would be probably two larger examples, but they can be &#x2013; it will be retrans bites or sports channel bites or any other noise in the market that I think it's -- if this market gets more competitive, I think you have to be able to take advantage of every one of those opportunities. And certainly, those would be probably be larger ones, in the scope of things.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. Chase, on the channel contribution in the quarter, you said direct sales were up quite a bit in over half the channels. Was Telco down in the quarter, which I guess would make sense given the BellSouth coms, and I know we're only a few weeks in or less than two weeks into the AT&amp;T distribution relationship, but any qualitative or quantitative points you'd want to make on what that means for the year beyond sort of the guidance you laid out. And then one other piece just for Pat on more of an accounting question, but I think your earnings guidance suggests some pretty healthy growth for depreciation in 2009 which does make sense given the set-top payments, but I don't know if you could quantify that for us and what your expectation is for that growth rate over a longer period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And in terms of sales I think, probably what you said is pretty reasonably accurate. Direct sales was strong and obviously the Telcos in the fourth quarter were down. And we've taken some steps to strengthen, I mean, obviously, that was just -- we didn't have AT&amp;T in it obviously. And we've taken some steps to strengthen it, and I think we believe -- we were talking this morning about some of the things with Verizon that are having some positive impacts going forward. But it think that generally would have been directionally correct. AT&amp;T, I'll probably comment more qualitatively than quantitatively. I think, a week in, I'm not going to try and extrapolate a lot in terms of quantitative comments. Qualitatively, we feel great. I mean, we actually -- initially, they weren't sure we'd launch in all 22 states. We did launch all 22 states.</p>
          <p>It was a massive undertaking, and I think that folks at AT&amp;T, as well as our folks here worked together fabulously, from an IT perspective, from a telephony, from an install, from a sales perspective. And I would have said the execution of the launch in one to ten, ten being best, is certainly a nine, if not nine plus. I mean I think they did a really good job on both sides, and I think we feel very good about getting out of the blocks with this. But probably want a bit more in terms of results that just sort of -- before we make any -- we try to make any judgment in a quantitative sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the depreciation, yeah. I think when you look at '08 where our depreciation went up like 600 million because of the continuing effect primarily of the lease-boxes. In '09, it should be something like a third of that 600 as far as the increase. I mean we kind of hit our peak in '09, but the year-over-year growth flows, and then when you get to '10 we go the other way, which we start to see the depreciation actually decline and some of the amortization on some of our prior acquisitions of like Pegasus start to fall off. So you should actually see a meaningful drop in D&amp;A when we get to 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions, Chase. First, what do you think is a bigger market for you in 2009 and which will you focus on? The MDU market or the non-premium market? And then secondly, on churn, just to kind of drill down a little bit. You mentioned that some of the promotions are going to be rolling off in 2009, and on top of that you also -- you recently increased rates. So you must feel comfortable about churn, I guess if you could just talk a little bit about that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I didn't get the MDU versus what? I didn't get the other one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned kind of attacking or rolling out into the non-premium markets. So the market that isn't quite so high end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you mean in Latin America, because that was the Latin America market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was Latin America, okay. So I guess if you could just talk about your thoughts about the MDU market, and any attempts you're going to take at --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the MDU market I would end up saying it is probably more -- is actually a big priority operationally in '09, but I don't think it will actually be something that has an impact. I mean it will have a positive, but I think the benefits from a financial or I mean a sort of metric perspective will really be more over sort of 2010, 2011. I mean I'd say it's a business that takes -- it's billed -- we've got our organization in place, we've got the technological solution in place. We've actually started to make some headway in terms of moving it. I think we've been upfront about saying it's a business we're not realistically, we're not a player in -- it's an important, big market for us.</p>
          <p>But I think a lot of '09 will be really getting some momentum from that business, really in some ways doing it -- we started out in the commercial business in sort of late '07 and did it through '07 and sort of through '08. We started to get some real benefits that flowed through as we went into '08, going into '09. So I think it will -- there will be some positives. There won't be driving positives for our metrics or results in '09. I think they will become meaningful to us from a results perspective as we go into '10 and '11. But I don't want to be saying that it's not a big operational priority in '09. It is an important area, an area we're spending real-time attention to build strengths there and make some investments. Again, we have some investments we're making in the first quarter to upgrade some properties as part of that strengthening. So it is an area we are moving on.</p>
          <p>In terms of churn, yeah, I guess what I should declare is that we're not talking about sort of going, shifting from taking a right turn. I think what we will try and do, and I've talked about it sort of like moderating or tempering, is try and tighten up in a few places. So I think we will clearly continue to, particularly in this economy, have reasonably aggressive offers. I think what we try to do when we get into these things is try and say, it's a little -- can we find pockets or places where we think we could tighten this up. So it's not sort of saying we're going to go, we're going to reverse course back to what we were spending on credits and offers at the end of '07. I think it will clearly be in this marketplace, an important part of our strategy to manage churn. But I think as we can do in a lot of places, I think we can tighten up and find some places where we can refine it. And so I think our goal really ends up being, which is sort of where we've got, is what you really have through '08. It really started in the second quarter of '08, a ramp up in terms of offers and credits. And therefore, as we work through that, I think in '09, we'd look to be much more in a stable place where we're not sort of adding to those and we're finding places we can squeeze it down a little bit.</p>
          <p>But again, I don't want to create the impression somehow we're &#x2013; there's going to be a full circle back to where we are in '08. I think given the competitive marketplace, which I expect to continue to be challenging, and I do think the economy put some pressure on us, I mean there is no question if you ended up saying, what is the economy, the economy impacted us in some places. I mean, yes, and certainly we're spending some of the credits are a result of the economy. And I think that's appropriate for us to do so. And I think what we try to do is make sure we target those credits to our best customers and our most valued customers. And I think we believe we can do a good job of sort of tightening that up a bit. And I think that's more our goal as we go through '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. My first question, Chase, you mentioned the whole home DVR was a priority, or one of the priorities in 2009. I was wondering if you could give us a rough cost there and should we expect that to put some upward pressure on upgrade and retention costs? And then the second question is just on programming cost growth, I think you said five to 6% per sub. It seems like you're managing that line item better than some of your competitors. I was wondering if you could just talk to us about the long run outlook for programming cost growth. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The -- whole home. Well, the first, what we'll really -- the initial phase of it, and there sort of phases to this. The initial phase really doesn't change the cap -- it doesn't change SAC at all. Because really what it is, it's more software that is going to enable boxes, certain boxes to speak with each other. And I guess the specific example would be, if you had an HD DVR, if you had three sets, two HD boxes and an HD DVR, it will be software that enables those two HD boxes to access what you've stored on your HD DVR. So really the iteration that we sort of roll that really is the '09, second half '09, is really a software capability to have boxes share something that -- certainly, not all boxes -- basic boxes don't, but boxes share that type of content. And I think our '09 focus will really be to do that and then refine that experience.</p>
          <p>And then as you go into '10, which will really be the place where you'd probably move forward with that sort of a generation of equipment that really is an equipment set up that is geared to do that. But which is essentially more of a home server with slaves or some sort of different type of device, so it really is a different setup in the home. But that will sort of be the next phase. The phase in '09 is really one that is software driven to enable &#x2013; generates the boxes to speak to each other and share that experience. And I think what we will do is put that out there and our initial focus will be as opposed to pushing the volume to focus on the experience and really improving that experience to be really what it can and a great experience for those customers. And the...</p>

          <p>The programming cost growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Programming cost, yeah, I don't have insights to the others. I mean, it is an area and I think we've publicly -- we'd better spend a lot of time with it, it's you know &#x2013; all you've got to do is look at our financials to know what's our biggest cost and there's not a whole lot &#x2013; I'd say the category pressures that the whole industry shares are probably led by retrans and sports, I mean I guess particularly local sports, you look at the proliferation of these team deals and the like and obviously we have some that are out there already publicly on some of the local sports side.</p>
          <p>So we have couple this year, we didn't last year, in terms of places where we would expect some jumps on -- the MLB network launched in the beginning of the year and Univision is the deal that I think the whole industry came up, because it's a conversion from sort of must-carry to which they have been doing previously to obviously a different approach. So I think probably we may benefit a bit from the fact that we're sort of obviously capturing the benefits of our growth and size over time and getting our contracts down to where they should be, particularly given the size we have in the business. I think we also probably have some of the more challenging -- we're at a pretty stable place, if you wanted to say some of this last I guess a couple of weeks ago, I just saw Dish launched Fox News and so some of the probably more challenging contracts, agreements and the like, we've mostly fought and dealt with and have digested.</p>
          <p>So I think there are probably others that have more issues coming, most of our big group retrans, the O&amp;O (owned and operated) group retrans. We still have a lot of time in. And so I think we're sort of, from a renewal perspective, in a pretty good place vis-&#xE0;-vis a lot of the things coming, and I think appropriately should be capturing some of the benefits that come with our size and our scale, but we certainly are not immune to some levels of the programming cost issues that everybody has out there.</p>

          <p>And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question today, it comes from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. Can you give us a little more impression on how the prepaid program is going down in Latin America, given all the pressures, particularly outside Brazil? And also when you talk about the whole network solution, are you principally looking at SWM-8 on your 2009, 2010 initiatives or do you have some other things in your pocket as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in terms of prepaid, it is -- in the countries beyond SWM -- it's Venezuela is the one where it's the most mature and it clearly is a significant part of the Venezuelan business and it needs to be healthy. I mean, I think Brazil is probably the one that is -- it's new, but far enough along -- I mean, it really went beyond Brazil, they're still probably all in a building process. So Brazil has actually got more scale to it. And I think Brazil is still in a process -- we're shaking it out. I mean I think it's been a bit of a -- I think it's been okay, but not -- but it can be improved. So I think we've done -- we've had it in the market, we'll make some refinements to the prepaid, it recently improved a bit. But I think that's still up -- still a launch that we have some work to do to get it to where it should be, and I think the other countries are probably a little early to -- they're okay, but they're just not far enough along to probably to make too many real judgments about it.</p>
          <p>You got a little bit -- on the whole home, certainly SWM is a part of -- it becomes an integral part. I mean SWM is an installation technology that does certainly enhance the whole -- communication within the home, and it is an installation technology we are using for most of our more advanced setups these days. More than half of our HD DVR customers are getting SWM. I think as we -- again I think with new technologies, we want to be prudent how fast we deploy it. So I think that the SWM installation will clearly continue to expand as a percentage of our installs. I think SWM will be essential part of sort of the whole home experience, it clearly enhances the ability to move content around in the home. And so, yes, the two do come together, but we'd be &#x2013; SWM has a lot of other -- I mean, it just has efficiency and effectiveness and flexibility, and it really gives the ability to sort of get into drop-shipping boxes and the like. So as we make sure with any new technology, I think we want to, before we deploy it too broadly, we want to make sure we take some of the bugs out of it and get some experiences and learn from it in a more &#x2013; doesn't matter how much you test something in a lab, you find when you put something in half a million homes you get a different -- you learn some things you didn't learn, no matter how hard you tested it with 1,000 boxes in a controlled environment. So we are sort of in that place of deploying it reasonably broadly with a higher end -- the HD-DVR universe for our new subs. And as we go forward I think we'll clearly widen that out, but it marries up pretty well with the Whole Home as we launch it out to club those customers that have the setups that will be relevant to the software upgrade will be the ones getting SWM.</p>
