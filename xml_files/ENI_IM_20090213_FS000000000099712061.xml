    <participants>
      <participant id="0" type="corprep">Paolo Scaroni, Eni Chief Executer Officer</participant>
      <participant id="1" type="corprep">Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer</participant>
      <participant id="2" type="corprep">Claudio Descalzi, Chief Operating Officer Eni Exploration &amp; Production Division</participant>
      <participant id="3" type="corprep">Domenico Dispenza, Chief Operating Officer Gas &amp; Power Division</participant>
      <participant id="4" type="corprep">Angelo Caridi, Chief Operating Officer Eni Refining &amp; Marketing Division</participant>
      <participant id="5" type="corprep">Ladies and gentlemen, our industry is undoubtedly facing uncertain times this year. Eni is well-positioned to continue to delver value to its shareholders. In the short-term due to our low cost profile in E&amp;P and to our cash generation in Gas &amp; Power, and in the longer-term, due to our fast growing E&amp;P production and our leadership in European gas sales.</participant>
      <participant id="6" type="corprep">Our strategy remains clear. We are committed to maintaining our strong credit rating, executing a disciplined and flexible CapEx program, and providing superior returns to our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. And we'd now be pleased to answer your questions.</participant>
      <participant id="7" type="corprep">Operator:  Good afternoon. Yes, first we will take the questions from the floor and then from the conference call. It's Irene Himona, BNP. Yes. The microphone please here.</participant>
      <participant id="8" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Irene Himona&gt;: Thank you. It's Irene Himona at Exane BNP Paribas. I had three questions please. Firstly at your new $43 oil price for 2009, assuming Gazprom does not actually exercise their call option, could you give us a sense of what happens to your gearing by year end and what oil price you would need to cover your CapEx and dividends?</participant>
      <participant id="9" type="corprep">Second question on E&amp;P in this environment of price weakness, do you intend to continue the strategy of selective M&amp;A activity?</participant>
      <participant id="10" type="corprep">And thirdly, as the owner of a rather large oil services company, can you perhaps share your views of oil service costs in 2009?  Thank you.</participant>
      <participant id="11" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Do we answer question by question? Okay. Let me clarify this Gazprom Neft issue. Now first of all, Gazprom has a call on the 20% which should be exercised by April. And this is, would recognize to us a total value of around $4.3 billion. Am I correct?  $4.3 billion, which is the original price plus the interest at 9.4%. Now, if they do not exercise their call, and I would like just to remind you that every time we have been debating this issue, they said they will, including maybe 20 days ago. This will allow us to write in our book's production reserves in the amount of 200,000 barrels a day of production, roughly 3 billion barrels of reserves.</participant>
      <participant id="12" type="corprep">The day after all that Eni will be a different company. Because, we will achieve in one second, the whole growth that we have been promising to the market in the next four years. As a consequence, if this will happen, we will sit down and review our plan to take into consideration this acquisition, because at this point it would be a real acquisition. We will review in this CapEx, we will review our position, we'll review everything. So for me, it's hard to answer to you mathematically what we will change, because Eni will be a different company that day.</participant>
      <participant id="13" type="corprep">Now second question, M&amp;A, yes we will continue to make very selective asset acquisition, essentially even the First Calgary acquisition was an asset acquisition more than a company acquisition at the end of the day. Anywhere, where we would meet our scenario, so this will be compatible with what we see as the future of the price of oil, and we would be making real synergies.</participant>
      <participant id="14" type="corprep">If you want to give you my view about potential targets, which will comply with this, they are very limited, and in any case normally they are fairly small. So you should not expect big moves, because we -- normally it's difficult to make synergy in big moves, and in any case, we don't see them really available in the market.</participant>
      <participant id="15" type="corprep">On the oil service, do you want &#x2013; he is the client, so maybe he answer rather than me...</participant>
      <participant id="16" type="corprep">&lt;&lt;&lt;A&gt;</participant>
      <participant id="17" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Claudio Descalzi&gt;: Talking about services as a client, because it's clear that in the new environment, there is a strong and new debate about project services, and how we can do things together. Because it's tough not just for them, it's tough for everybody. So, I think that we continue because, as -- from our point of view, from our strategic point of view, growth is, sustainable growth is the main issue.</participant>
      <participant id="18" type="corprep">So, I think and that is the same thing also for the services. So, we already -- a lot of contract or project with the commitment, so I think that is a -- we'll have a sustainable growth. We have to, we are renegotiating some contract. From our point of view just 50% of our future project in the next full year is settled and defined. So, we have room to renegotiate and for what we are looking now is &#x2013; there is room to renegotiate, because it's more a company dropping lots of projects, so, the offer in the market is much better than before. So, there is a reduction of the premium, and there is availability from the services to restock and get better tariff.</participant>
      <participant id="19" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Or, excuse me, I'd like just to add one thing on your previous question, our M&amp;A activity. Our M&amp;A activity will not exist until we have got a clear view about Gazprom Neft. Okay and I forget to tell you, so you should not expect to be active from now to April.</participant>
      <participant id="20" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; James Hubbard&gt;: Hi, James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, one on Gas &amp; Power, one on E&amp;P. On Gas &amp; Power, do you now think that you've largely complied with the unbundling requirements from the Italian gas regulator? And in that context, can you just remind us of the position of Snam Rete Gas, what you're required to sell down to and when and what you intend to do with that?</participant>
      <participant id="21" type="corprep">And then on E&amp;P, I noticed the 2050 figure has slipped one year from 2011 to 2012. Is that just a function of slightly tighter cost control and maybe high grading some -- your portfolio activities? And in the same breath, what's happening with Goliath? I think there was a contract award relatively recently, but it doesn't seem to appear on your list of products for the next four years.</participant>
      <participant id="22" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: In Gas &amp; Power, the reorganization of the regulated business we made yesterday had nothing to do with let's say with unbundling in the sense that all three businesses were already unbundled from an organizational point of view. So, we were already there. Now, of course, the fact of putting everything together makes life a little easier because the three businesses which have to comply with some unbundling organizational issues are together, and this is of course, something which makes our life easier, but we were already complying with that.</participant>
      <participant id="23" type="corprep">Now, in terms of the Snam Rete Gas, that's a forced sale. I would consider that this issue is somewhat behind us in the sense that we do not see a consensus from this majority, but even from the previous one, to force us to unbundle the transportation system in Italy. And I would say that even in Europe and in general, in the public opinion, the attention in the gas business is more -- has been moving towards security of supply rather than towards competition issues, which do not seem today the real problem that it's &#x2013; of which everybody is worrying about, particularly after the latest Russian &#x2013; Ukrainian crisis.</participant>
      <participant id="24" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Claudio Descalzi&gt;: Second question is -- Goliath, because as you know is the first oil development in the Bering Sea, so we confirm our commitment. We are the operator and it is a strategic project for Eni. And, yes, your market is not in the four-year plan, because as scheduled, Goliath is in 2013. We just awarded the contract for the engineering to Sevan. There is a good alignment with the partners and also with the minister, with the institution, so is on track. For sure, we changed a little bit our strategy and we subdivided the contract, the engineering and the construction later on so we can capture all the possible benefits of this environment. So, but it is on track and there is a strong determination from our side to go ahead.</participant>
      <participant id="25" type="corprep">Talking about the production, or the shift of the production, we rescheduled, we didn't drop, rescheduled some projects, big projects, especially in the LNG. So, we talk about Damyiet and Phase III of Karachaganak. So we rescheduled and we shift out of the plan with the saving or reduction of cost in the plan of 2.5  billion, and the shift of some production outside the plan, that is the main reason.</participant>
      <participant id="26" type="corprep">&lt;&lt;&lt;Q&gt;</participant>
      <participant id="27" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: I'm not sure I understood your second part of your question, which business -- the lubricant --</participant>
      <participant id="28" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Ah, the chemical. Oh, yes. But this is not an easy question of yours. Let's see. On refining the answer is pretty simple; yes you are right, we are not big in refining, but we are very big in Italy, and we think that we have all the elements of making reasonably good money in Italy. You can see even this year we continued to gain market share in marketing. We have by far the best distribution in the country. We've 30 plus percent market share. To -- just to give you a number, we've been gaining in the last 12 months 2% market share. 2% market share moving from 29.8 to 31.8, which is a big thing for us. We are quite positive of our continuing market share, and also our refining business first of all is somewhat tailor made to some crude we produce particularly in Italy. I'm referring particular to the Sicilian heavy crude, which has Gela as the natural refinery. And we can, we see that with some improvements, our refining business can be profitable. That -- it will always remain fairly small, but we are quite happy to see it small, particularly now with so much new refining capacity coming on stream and with the market which we see weak for a long time, in terms of sales.</participant>
      <participant id="29" type="corprep">Now, chemicals. Chemical is a complete different story. We have been inheriting our chemical business in many years ago. So, it's a long story behind us. We've been shrinking and shrinking this chemical business, trying to make it more efficient, and to make it, let's say resilient to difficult times. We are not yet there, we have to continue to improve this business. Now of course, we tried to keep it at least cash neutral so that doesn't absorb a lot of cash from the other businesses, which is not always very simple. It has been so in the last five years. This business has actually generated cash, not absorbed cash.</participant>
      <participant id="30" type="corprep">In the past, we tried to sell it. There has been a long negotiation in 2003 and '04, I think, to sell. Then the negotiation collapsed. Today, I think that even to dream to sell the chemical business in Europe would be impossible, as we see the health of the big chemical groups in Europe. So, we will continue to do what we have been doing with some success, streamlining, becoming more efficient, and trying to keep it at least cash neutral.</participant>
      <participant id="31" type="corprep">Operator:  Next question?</participant>
      <participant id="32" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Mark Iannotti&gt;: It's Mark Iannotti from Merrill Lynch. You made over &#x20AC;650 million worth of upstream provisions, can you maybe give the detail of which assets you have written down, assets...</participant>
      <participant id="33" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Impairments...</participant>
      <participant id="34" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Mark Iannotti&gt;: Impairments. Can you just give the detail of what assets or acquisitions you have impaired this year and how confident you are, well, given you talked about the vast amount of your portfolio now breaking even at 35, how confident you are that we will not see any more impairments unless we go to an oil price materially below that level?</participant>
      <participant id="35" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Okay.</participant>
      <participant id="36" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: So, in terms of impairment, as I've already stated during the presentation, the amount that we have provided for at year end or over the year were in the region of &#x20AC;990 million. But, the portion affecting the E&amp;P is quite lower because it's the region of 650, and I would like to stress the fact that most of these devaluation, these impairment is not directly linked to the fall in oil prices but predominantly linked to changes in fiscal regulation and environmental regulation, which negatively affects the cash flow expected from a certain initiatives. And in particular I am referring to our investments in the Gulf of Mexico and in Turkmenistan. These are predominantly affected by fiscal environment regulation or modification in already existing agreements with the government. Then as far as the valuation associated with the foreign oil prices are concerned, if I were remember we are talking about a small amount of the total portion because it should be in the region of &#x20AC;300 million, which is relatively a small amount compared to the total portfolio.</participant>
      <participant id="37" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Iain Reid&gt;: It's Iain Reid, Macquarie. Paolo do you think you could explain exactly what this friendship tax between your country and Libya exactly means in terms of impacts on Eni? And what you think the ongoing tax rate is going to be for the company in the year, in the scenario which you've described?</participant>
      <participant id="38" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Well, this Italy and Libya concluded at the beginning of September, I think  September, a long pending discussion around war damages or colonialist damages that Italy made to Libya. Libya has been complaining about this for many, many years. In several occasions we had, we being by far the biggest Italian presence in Libya, we felt that a positive conclusion of this very long discussion would have been a positive effect on our relationship. So, we of course welcome the new peace, so to say, between Italy and Libya.</participant>
      <participant id="39" type="corprep">Now of course we welcome much less the fact of being obliged to pay the bill for it, because as you, what you are probably mentioning is the fact that there has been a tax, which in some way impose the cost of this treaty on our shoulders. Now we have been, we are looking at it quite closely to be sure that this tax, it is appropriate from a constitutional point of view and from a large European point of view as well. And of course, if &#x2013; look, I don't like taxes in any way, never, but if we will find that this one does not comply with Italian and/or European regulations, we will of course appeal.</participant>
      <participant id="40" type="corprep">That was your question. You had there another one?</participant>
      <participant id="41" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Iain Reid&gt;: Yeah, what do you think your overall tax rate is going to be?</participant>
      <participant id="42" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: The overall tax rate.</participant>
      <participant id="43" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: Hello. We do not expect to have a significant modification in the future as far as the effective tax return is concerned. We have closed 2008 with a tax rate which approximate 51% of the taxable income at the Group level, of course. And even in presence of the burden which Paolo has just explained, we do not expect a significant variation in the foreseeable future.</participant>
      <participant id="44" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Neil McMahon&gt;: Hi, Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. I just got two questions. The first one is, looking at the upstream portfolio, you've made some exploration successes in the Gulf of Mexico as well as in Australia, but these are still areas I think you might consider your position overall as not being as strong as you may like in those two positions. Is that still the case? And do you still see LNG as a particular area that you want to grow into? And I've got another question.</participant>
      <participant id="45" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Claudio Descalzi&gt;: Okay. So, I think that we can't compare our position in the Gulf of Mexico and in Australia, that's for sure. We made a lot of good discovery in Gulf of Mexico with a very good time to markets. So, most of the discovery we made in the Gulf of Mexico, we will put in our plans, so we will be able to put in production in the next three, four years.</participant>
      <participant id="46" type="corprep">In Australia is different. Talk is true, we are not so strong. And we made some good discovery in Kitan that also in this case within that, the time to market is good, because we intend to put in production in 2012. So, but it's clear that in Australia we are weaker than in Gulf of Mexico now. And also, we don't have big projects.</participant>
      <participant id="47" type="corprep">Talking about LNG generally, LNG is still, in the long run, is still a strategic issue for us. We continue to develop our projects -- talking about the Brass LNG or the Train 7 in Bonny or Angola LNG that was one of the two LNG awarded last, sanctioned last year. We reduced, we're drawing down just Namieta(1.09.24), because we are negotiating prices and also the prices for the gas. But that situation, that we are still putting a lot of efforts and pressure and tension on the LNG issue.</participant>
      <participant id="48" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Neil McMahon&gt;: Just going back to Australia and Gulf of Mexico. Given the fact that you are number one in Africa and very strong in other places such as Europe. But is that where we're likely to see bolt-on asset acquisitions in those sort of locations rather than continuing to go after positions in Africa?</participant>
      <participant id="49" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Look let me give you the -- somewhat our strategic geographical view on that. Yes we are very big in Africa. We like Africa, we want to grow in Africa. We entered Gabon, lately. We might be entering other African countries where we are not yet. In any case, when we speak about Africa and particularly Western Africa, we are looking at a place where we feel to be particularly at home with our organization, structure, et cetera. Northern Africa as well, and we sort of look at this very keenly.</participant>
      <participant id="50" type="corprep">As far as Gulf of Mexico, following our Dominion acquisition last year we feel that there it's a limited production, I think we produce 110,000 barrels. 110,000 barrels, so we are probably number five or number six in the Gulf. But 110,000 barrels. We have a good organization, we feel that is a place where we certainly want to be part of bid rounds, we were looking at opportunities -- yes?</participant>
      <participant id="51" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Claudio Descalzi&gt;: We have also big exploration. We have more than 500 licenses. So --</participant>
      <participant id="52" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Yes, we are quite pleased to have been able to keep with us essentially everybody coming from Dominion, which was a real risk. So, we look at the Gulf of Mexico as a place where we want to stay. Now other areas of the world might be under scrutiny to make sure that either they are material or we have enough prospectives in order to make them material one day. We certainly take the view that even a place of the world, we are non-material, we are small and we do not see how to become material, well we can divest.</participant>
      <participant id="53" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Neil McMahon&gt;: Just one very quick final one. On Gas &amp; Power, the demand situation in the fourth quarter was particularly weak. Just looking through the first month and a half of 2009, and the first quarter, any update given that the colder weather, how bad it's looking this time around?</participant>
      <participant id="54" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: I can correlate to your question, if I know how longer cash will stay there. I cannot give you an answer of course. Nobody can you give this kind of answer. Will it last six months, 12 months, one year and a half. I don't think that anybody today is daring to give an answer to that. But, anyhow our consideration of that, even if the situation we had last December or this January will continue all the year, anyhow the EBITDA from the Gas &amp; Power division will at least remain what it had been for 2008.</participant>
      <participant id="55" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: So to show you how resilient it is, because December and January have been really extremely bad months. Particularly for a business so stable as the gas business is, and this is due to the fact, we think that industry all across Europe has actually shutdown plants, using the Christmas holidays as a mean to reduce inventories or to reduce production to cut cost. We do not think, but this is me, I don't know if Domenico agrees with me, that February and March will be less heat than December and January as compared to December and January of previous year. So the month on month will probably be less down. I don't if you agree.</participant>
      <participant id="56" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: We hope.</participant>
      <participant id="57" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: We hope; he hopes.</participant>
      <participant id="58" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jon Rigby&gt;: Okay. Yeah, it's a Jon Rigby from UBS. Can I just explore this issue on gas, because, are there any issues with your take or pay commitments if we have a particularly bad winter and then an extended period of recession in Western Europe, so that you build up a gas bank that ultimately present you with a problem with some of your largest suppliers?</participant>
      <participant id="59" type="corprep">And the second is, any update on Union Fenosa Gas, and what your position is there?</participant>
      <participant id="60" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: Well, for the first part of the question, is it true that if this current slowdown will continue. We could go a stretch by which we would suffer a little bit, of take or pay obligation. But, just remember that, luckily I should say, generally we had this Ukrainian, this Russian/Ukrainian crisis and of course, this is a usual disposal to take or pay. On the same time we have some Force Majeure effect on some of the import from Algeria for instance, so even this could [inaudible](1.15.08) our product a little bit. Then I want to remember to you that take or pay means you pay some gas at least partially, you have the time to recover this gas later in the following years.</participant>
      <participant id="61" type="corprep">If we will incur this situation, today I cannot say that we'll incur in this situation, this also mean that we'd pre-pay some gas at a very low price, although we expect this summer the price will be very, very low. And then I have the opportunity to take this gas later when eventually the gas could be, the price could be a little bit higher on that.</participant>
      <participant id="62" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: In any case, in the history of the Gas &amp; Power division, so history goes back 50 years, we never paid, we have never been into a take or pay, and we feel that this year it would be very unlikely that we will be in those position. But, even if we were this does not mean that you pay if you don't have the gas. You pay and you buy forward some gas, so to say. So you're buying gas for the future. And I would also add that the fact of being so internationally spread as we are, gives us a flexibility and a set of opportunities that other players will not have, because the fact of selling gas all across Europe will allow us to move gas from one place to the other in order to avoid take or pay, or to increase our receipts.</participant>
      <participant id="63" type="corprep">On Union Fenosa Gas, I've read this morning so that the anti-trust, the Spanish anti-trust considers perfectly logic that the number one in the market owns 50% of the number two of the market. I have to say that I have a different view about what anti-trust is, but never mind, we will do whatever we can on legal terms to reverse this decision.</participant>
      <participant id="64" type="corprep">Operator:  Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes through from the line of Jason Kenney [Ing Wholesale Banking]. Jason, your question please.</participant>
      <participant id="65" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: Hi there, it's Jason from ING. Congratulations on the conference strategy outlook, and thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. A follow-up on the Gas &amp; Power discussions earlier. The 4Q Gas &amp; Power was a bit of a disappointment. And I know there has been low volumes, but there was an FX impact in there. I just wondered about the moving parts around FX and the assumptions that are implicit in your kind of steady state margin outlook going forward for particularly for marketing?</participant>
      <participant id="66" type="corprep">And then a second question, if I may. Paolo in your opening remarks you mentioned that Eni had avoided the high cost Canadian tar sands, but from memory you did attempt to get exposure there. And of course do you have Venezuela and Congo heavy oil exposure. And I just wondered if you could maybe talk around the advantages of your heavy oil exposures over a Canadian heavy oil exposure?</participant>
      <participant id="67" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Let me start to answer your &#x2013; the second part of your question before I move into the first one. Now, you are right &#x2013; you are right, we had been very close to do a deal in Canadian oil sands. But we pulled back. But we decided not to go ahead, which I've to tell you that sometimes I'm thinking back about that decision, which we took I think it was January 2007, in '08 &#x2013; 2007 or '08, '07. And I think was one of the wisest decision I have ever taken in my life not to go ahead.</participant>
      <participant id="68" type="corprep">Now, moving to our two heavy oil, or unconventional oil initiatives, first of all in both of them, we haven't bought anything so far, so no cash disbursement whatsoever. We've not been paying a company, we've not been paying a bonus, we've not been paying even an investment. So, let's say so far our -- I mean, we didn't put a penny into it as far as we are talking today.</participant>
      <participant id="69" type="corprep">And second, even if we were particularly the Congo oil sands would be profitable today at our scenario, because for several reasons including the fact that we have gas, we have gas from Bundi(1.20.26) etcetera, we consider that these are profitable at $40 a barrel.</participant>
      <participant id="70" type="corprep">Now as for the Venezuelan tar sands so, what we call Junin 5, this one can even be profitable at this scenario for the portion of it which will be using existing facilities. So let's say it is something that we consider, let's say our unconventional oil is much better than some other unconventional oil, and we feel quite in good shape in that.</participant>
      <participant id="71" type="corprep">Now, let me answer to the -- because this is something, which probably we've not been clear. On the Gas &amp; Power results of the last quarter 2008, in which quite correctly you said it has been disappointing, the difference of roughly &#x20AC;500 million.</participant>
      <participant id="72" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: Yes.</participant>
      <participant id="73" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Has been generated, 200 by the economic downturn, so sales that we didn't make and we were expecting to make. 200 by the euro effect, so almost half of it was the euro effect, and the rest -- the rest Alessandro was...</participant>
      <participant id="74" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: Predominantly the market.</participant>
      <participant id="75" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Prices, prices.</participant>
      <participant id="76" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: Yes.</participant>
      <participant id="77" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Prices, competition, so prices in fact. But, let's say so answering to your question looking forward if you imagine a euro very weak and continuing to weaken, yes we will have the euro impact, but in terms of commercial factors, so real commercial factors, the difference is not 500, but is only 300.</participant>
      <participant id="78" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: 100 yes. And of course we have to remember even the very warm climate we had in the third quarter.</participant>
      <participant id="79" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Yes. There is also the climate which is worth roughly 50, am I correct?</participant>
      <participant id="80" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: Yes, about 50.</participant>
      <participant id="81" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: So out of the 500, 200 is the euro and 50 is the climate, 250 is -- yes the market conditions.</participant>
      <participant id="82" type="corprep">Does it clarify something to you?</participant>
      <participant id="83" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: Yeah, I was just wondering about the FX underpinning your $43 per barrel and other oil macro assumptions for the medium-term outlook?</participant>
      <participant id="84" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: I'm not sure I have understood your question.</participant>
      <participant id="85" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: What euro dollar do you assume?</participant>
      <participant id="86" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: The dollar for this year 43 and then growing slowly to 257 in 2012.</participant>
      <participant id="87" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: No, that's Euro price,  Eurodollar.</participant>
      <participant id="88" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: I can give you the numbers if you want.</participant>
      <participant id="89" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: The Euro dollar is changed &#x2013; the Euro dollar changes; it's 130.</participant>
      <participant id="90" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: 130.</participant>
      <participant id="91" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: 130.</participant>
      <participant id="92" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Jason Kenney&gt;: Okay, thanks very much.</participant>
      <participant id="93" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: Thank you. 130 plus.</participant>
      <participant id="94" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Domenico Dispenza&gt;: All over the period.</participant>
      <participant id="95" type="corprep">Operator:  The next question comes through from the line of Domenico Ghilotti [Equita S.I.M. S.p.A.].</participant>
      <participant id="96" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Domenico Ghilotti&gt;: Good afternoon to everybody. On the Italgas and Stogit deal, I would be interested in the capital gain you will have in 2009, and more in general on the Gas &amp; Power division if you are considering some other operations to release further hidden value. So if you are still considering some other operations in the division?</participant>
      <participant id="97" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: No, to your second question the answer is no. We are not considering other operations. And on the first one, is not really relevant the capital gain because it's all consolidated, am I correct?</participant>
      <participant id="98" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Domenico Ghilotti&gt;: Okay, and the SpA level so is not ...it's something you -- can okay.</participant>
      <participant id="99" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: No, no of course since the situation doesn't change the present scope of consolidation so the effect from a group perspective is absolutely zero.</participant>
      <participant id="100" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Domenico Ghilotti&gt;: No I was most interested in at the SpA level if you add some capital gain at SpA level?</participant>
      <participant id="101" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: No.</participant>
      <participant id="102" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: No, the only one thing on a consolidated level that will change will be, apart from the efficiency, but will be &#x20AC;1.5 billion of new equity following the increase.</participant>
      <participant id="103" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Alessandro Bernini&gt;: Exactly.</participant>
      <participant id="104" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: The new capital entering into Snam Rete Gas, so that's the real change.</participant>
      <participant id="105" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Domenico Ghilotti&gt;: Okay.</participant>
      <participant id="106" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Domenico Ghilotti&gt;: Thank you.</participant>
      <participant id="107" type="corprep">Operator:  We have no further questions coming through on the phone line. I will hand back to your host to continue today's conference.</participant>
      <participant id="108" type="corprep">&lt;Q &#x2013; Neill Morton&gt;: Hi, it is Neill Morton from MF Global. I'm just going back to your comments on Congo tar sands. In recent months you have done deals in Congo, Angola, Papua New Guinea, and your press releases makes reference to the Eni model, and you imply that you have a differentiated strategy in accessing resources and negotiating with national governments. Could you perhaps explain what is peculiar to your approach? Why couldn't other IOCs replicate what you are doing?</participant>
      <participant id="109" type="corprep">And just secondly, I just wanted to clarify the Gazprom Neft option. You seem to imply it's an either/or event, are you excluding the possibility of other options in the sense that could you offer Gazprom a time delay, could you allow them to make staggered payments on that stake?  Thank you.</participant>
      <participant id="110" type="corprep">&lt;A &#x2013; Paolo Scaroni&gt;: No, listen, first on Gazprom Neft, no, yes you are right. Let's say the contract we have implies a call, and a call either you exercise it or not, or it expires. So, in principal this, now of course we have such a wide relationship with Gazprom, including the fact that we buy from them 25 billion cubic meter of gas every year and just to give you a number last year we sent over a check of roughly &#x20AC;8 billion to Gazprom. So, let's say in this relationship there might be some other alternatives which we will consider, but the contract is saying there is a put expiring in April.</participant>
      <participant id="111" type="corprep">Now on the so called Eni model, let me, but first of all we have made no deal in Papua New Guinea, no deal no. But yes you are right in Congo we have been making deals, in Angola, in Nigeria etcetera. Now what we try to do in addition to our upstream activity is very much related to the development of the countries. Now on this has played a major role our activity in producing electricity for the countries. Most of those countries, in spite of having large resources, lack desperately electricity. And we have been using associated gas in particular to produce, to run, to build and run combined cycle, so gas-fired generating plants to produce electricity which had been of great benefit to the country in three reasons. First of all we give a value to the associated gas. Second, we avoid flaring which is something, which of course is a priority, and thirdly because we contribute to the development of the country.</participant>
      <participant id="112" type="corprep">Now in order to do that and do it economically because the fact is not just of doing it, but it has to be something that complies with our investment requirement. It is a kind of complex negotiation which we concluded I would say successfully in Nigeria a few years ago. We have been replicating in Congo. We will be replicating in Angola and we are ready to replicate in many other countries. And this is one pillar of our so-called Eni model.</participant>
      <participant id="113" type="corprep">Then we're probably more active than many other countries in areas such as health interventions, agriculture. For example in Congo, we're developing a huge project in order to produce biofuel. We have experts in agriculture which we send over and we help the country to develop this area. This, then another I would say key feature is how we use locals. We are probably the company which used most the locals there, countries such as Nigeria and Congo you hardly see an expatriate.</participant>
      <participant id="114" type="corprep">So, we are capable through our school and our integration to have a higher percentage of locals, and of course, governments love the idea that we develop skill. We've a whole presentation with six legs of intervention, six legs &#x2013; like our dog there, you can see. We come with a dog with six legs, six are the legs of our intervention in our Eni model. The most important one is of course electricity because this is a very hard fact. The others are relevant, but we believe that our model which we've been developing in years really allows us to have particularly in Africa an access to resources that not many other of our competitors can achieve.</participant>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  Welcome to our 2008 Results and Strategy Presentation.  2008 was a very good year for Eni.  All of our divisions produced robust operating results, despite deteriorating market conditions in the last four months of last year.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P, we increased production by an industry leading 5.6% not net of the PSA effect.  In Gas &amp; Power, we consolidated our leading position in Europe and reported &#x20AC;1.9 billion of free cash flow, confirming the stability of the divisions' cash generation.  In R&amp;M, we continued to gain market share in the declining Italian market.  These achievements in the contest of an exceptionally favorable environment for the first half of the year resulted in &#x20AC;10.2 billion profit, a 7.7 increase over 2007.  This has enabled us to propose a final dividend of &#x20AC;0.65 per share making a total dividend of &#x20AC;1.30 per share for the full year.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Alessandro for an in depth analysis of our 2008 results, I will take you through the strategic rationale of our regulated business restructuring, which we announced late yesterday evening.  This deal will enable us to, first, build a strong integrated player in the European regulated gas market, second, extract significant synergies, and thirdly, provide investors with greater visibility of our regulated and non-regulated businesses.  All in all, restructuring our regulated businesses will enable us to fully unlock the value of this asset for Eni shareholders.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Alessandro.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  As just mentioned by Paolo, the sale of Italgas and Stogit to Snam Rete Gas creates a unique player in the regulated gas business.  The two companies at triple the regulated asset base or around ten times enterprise value on EBITDA, which is in line with utilities market multiples, and well above Eni's current market valuation.</p>
          <p>As Snam Rete Gas will finance the acquisition through a capital increase up to &#x20AC;3.5 billion, half of which subscribed by Eni, and up to &#x20AC;1.3 billion of long-term maturity debt.  Eni's consolidated operating results will benefit from the expected synergies that can be achieved from this integration and that the Snam Rete Gas estimates to be around 2% of the new group 2008 EBITDA at regime in 2012.</p>
          <p>The deal will impact Eni's consolidated net debt as a consequence of the capital increase attributable to third parties by approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion.  Snam Rete Gas advisor already signed a pre-underwriting agreement for the quota offered to the market.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the results and to the challenging market environment we faced during the last quarter. Commodity and currency prices were particularly volatile, with Brent 38% down compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  European refining margins at $7.7 per barrel on average and the euro depreciating more than 9% versus the US dollar.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter adjusted net profit was &#x20AC;1.9 billion down 27% mainly as a result of the weaker operating performance and of the higher net financial charges that reflected negative mark-to-market evaluation on financial derivatives.</p>
          <p>The reported net profit for the fourth quarter was negative at &#x20AC;874 million significantly impacted by inventories write-down and impairments of fixed assets.  On a full year basis adjusted net profit amounted to &#x20AC;10.2 billion up 7.7% versus 2007.  The adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter was about &#x20AC;4.1 billion down 25%.  This was due to the weaker operating performance of our Upstream and Gas &amp; Power business segments due to falling oil prices and the lower natural gas demand.  These negative effects were partially offset by stronger performance of the Refining &amp; Marketing division.  Adjusted operating profit for the full year 2008 was &#x20AC;21.8 billion up 15% compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>In the Exploration and Production, the adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter totaled &#x20AC;2.8 billion declining by 33% on a like-for-like basis.  This decrease is due mainly to lower hydrocarbons realization prices in dollars, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and increased exploration expenses.  These negative factors were partially offset by the depreciation of the euro versus the US dollar.  The revision of the oil and gas price is a scenario associated with some changes to fiscal and environmental regulation rules, led to asset impairments for around &#x20AC;650 million in the fourth quarter and &#x20AC;990 million all over the year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit for the full year was &#x20AC;17.4 billion, up 24% from a year ago. The improvement reflected the higher realization prices and the increase production sales volume partially offset by the appreciation of the euro versus the dollar, higher operating costs and amortization charges mainly due to increased exploration activity.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Gas &amp; Power division, the adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter amounted to &#x20AC;812 million, 38% down over the same period of 2007.  This weak performance was due to the three billion cubic meter lower volumes sold in Italy mainly as a result of the economic downturn and climate effect, the weakening of the euro versus the US dollar that negatively affected our gas purchase costs, the competitive pressure, and the lower electricity sales.  These negative elements were partially offset by the Distrigaz consolidation as of October 2008 and the higher contribution from regulated activities and international transport.</p>
          <p>For the full year, the Gas &amp; Power division posted adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;3.5 billion, a decrease of around &#x20AC;550 million from 2007 reflecting the lower results recorded by its marketing activities in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Refining &amp; Marketing adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter accounted for &#x20AC;200 million compared to &#x20AC;95 million adjusted operating loss for the same period of 2007.  This result reflects higher refining margin, the depreciation of the euro versus dollar, as well as the stronger marketing margins and higher market share in Italy.  These positive elements was partially offset by lower throughput and the CO2 emission costs.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;566 million, up 72% from a year ago.  The improvement reflected stronger Refining &amp; Marketing margins.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Petrochemical business Polimeri Europa, posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;91 million compared to &#x20AC;129 million loss in 2007.  The negative result slightly improved compared to the same period of 2007 combines higher realized margins and lower plant utilization, as a result of the reduced global demand.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering and Construction sector, fourth quarter adjusted operating profit amount to around &#x20AC;300 million versus &#x20AC;250 million in 2007.  The increase is mainly attributable to higher results in both offshore and onshore construction activities as well as drilling onshore.  The other activities segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;91 million mainly as a result of receivable write-off.</p>
          <p>Finally, Corporate activities posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;114 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;64 million in 2007 as a consequence of higher R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>This slide compares our sources and uses of cash for 2007 and 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008 was a record &#x20AC;21.8 billion. That coupled with cash from disposal of &#x20AC;1.2 billion for a total sources of cash at &#x20AC;23 billion.  We used this cash to fund around &#x20AC;14.6 billion of CapEx to acquire assets for <mark type="inaudible" /> of &#x20AC;4.3 billion and to return on a consolidated basis &#x20AC;6 billion to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt as of the end of December increased by &#x20AC;2.1 billion, up to &#x20AC;18.4 billion, and our net debt to equity was 0.38, unchanged in comparison with the end of 2007.  Eni continues to have good access to debt capital markets.  In the last month, through our EMTN program, we issued around &#x20AC;3 billion of medium, long-term bonds to consolidate our financial debt structure. In addition, Eni continued to utilize commercial paper market for flexible short-term funding.</p>
          <p>From a strict liquidity perspective, we can rely on more than &#x20AC;7.7 billion of cash and committed undrawn facilities.  The strong cash generation, the higher credit rating, and the availability of diversified committed bank lines without material adverse change conditions in the financial covenants give us the flexibility to address further environmental weakness.</p>
          <p>Finally, in 2008 cash return to Eni shareholders was &#x20AC;5.7 billion, of which &#x20AC;0.70 per share representing the 2007 final dividend paid in May, &#x20AC;0.65 per share representing the 2008 interim dividend paid in September, and the share buyback for around &#x20AC;0.8 billion. The overall cash distribution allows us to generate competitive returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and now I'll hand you over to Paolo. [applause]</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I will now take you through our strategy and targets for the next four years.  Our strategic direction has not changed.  We continue to push the three pillars of our strategy.  First, production growth and reserve replacement in Upstream, second, European market leadership in Gas &amp; Power, and third, greater efficiency in R&amp;M.  Throughout the recent high oil price environment, Eni maintained a conservative long-term oil price deck of 50/ $60 a barrel.  This is why our strategy remains solid even in today's challenging environment. In line with our previous assumptions, we now forecast a long-term price deck of $57 a barrel beyond 2012.  In the near-term, however, we see significantly lower prices and high volatility.</p>
          <p>Before taking you through our 2009 &#x2013; 2012 plan and targets, I will spend a couple of minutes on the short-term outlook for facing our industry.  We see the current difficult environment continuing for at least 12, 18 months.  Our Brent price assumptions for the full year 2009 is $43 a barrel in line with average price in January.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the gas market, European volumes will remain flat in 2009 for the first time for several years.  In Italy, we see demand actually contracting and at the same time we see new gas entering the market putting pressure on margins.  In refining, new capacity will come on stream resulting in a global surplus of refined products.  As a consequence, we foresee in 2009 TRC margins in the Mediterranean basin to drop to an average of $3 a barrel.</p>
          <p>As you can see our short-term outlook is negative but Eni's resilient business portfolio is ideally positioned to cope with this industry challenges.  Our E&amp;P division is well positioned to withstand a low price environment with industry leading lifting costs of $7.5 a barrel, this very low lifting cost is the result of our high exposure to first, low cost areas such as Africa, second giant projects and third conventional oils.  The acquisitions we have made over the past two years have strengthened our presence in low cost legacy areas while we have been steering clear of higher cost projects such as the Canadian oil sands.</p>
          <p>We also face the lower oil price environment with a utility like Gas &amp; Power business whose profitability is largely independent from the oil price.  This provides us with a key point of differentiation from our peer group.  Of course, Gas &amp; Power sales are affected by the economic slowdown, but this in fact is mitigated by the steady cash flow of the regulated businesses and continuing international growth.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M, where the outlook is particularly negative, we see being small as an advantage.  Overall, our business portfolio is resilient in the context of the current turbulence.  This resilience enable us to keep investing, to deliver superior growth over the planned period and beyond, while at the same time rewarding shareholders with an industry leading dividend.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our four-year planning targets and starting with E&amp;P.  In Upstream, we will achieve industry leading growth of 3.5% per annum and 3% between 2012 and 2015.  We will also replace 130% of our production in the planned period.  Our growth will be driven by our exposure to fast growing oil producing regions, with our operations in Africa growing by over 4% per year.  During the planned period, we will add 525,000 boe a day of new production with an average breakeven of $35 dollars a barrel.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, we will benefit from our strengthened market leadership in Europe following the Distrigaz acquisition.  We will leverage on our additional scale to continue to grow market share in Europe, develop our trading capabilities, and improve flexibility and efficiency.  We will also continue to benefit from the integration between Gas &amp; Power and E&amp;P to deliver synergies for both businesses.  All this will enable us to generate cumulative EBITDA of &#x20AC;20 billion over the next four years from our Gas &amp; Power division.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M, our targets are to improve EBIT by &#x20AC;400 million by 2012 and to make the division cash neutral even in a very negative scenario.  To achieve these targets, we will upgrade the best positioned refineries investing in our proprietary EST [Eni Slurry Technology] technology, gain market share in Italy through loyalty programs and superior service quality, and deliver operational cost savings of &#x20AC;150 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our overall Group level targets.  Efficiency continues to be our priority.  During the past three years, we cut costs by almost &#x20AC;1 billion. We have now raised the bar and are targeting an additional &#x20AC;1 billion of cost cuts for the next four years, taking our overall cost reduction to almost &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>At the Corporate level, we will reduce our cost base by over 7% in real terms over the next four years.  All of our businesses will also contribute to lowering our cost base.  E&amp;P will reduce operating expenses per barrel in real terms preserving its cost leadership position.  Gas &amp; Power will continue to reduce the cost to serve for its 6 million customers by 7% a year.  R&amp;M will deliver a further $0.7 a barrel of cost savings by 2012 streamlining its workforce reducing energy consumption.</p>
          <p>Over the next four years Eni will invest &#x20AC;48.8 billion across its businesses.  Our CapEx program remains broadly unchanged as compared to the previous one for three reasons.  Firstly, our oil assumptions in previous plans were sufficiently prudent.  Secondly, our investment opportunities remained attractive even in a lower price environment due to the focus on low cost areas in E&amp;P and our higher exposure to regulated businesses with guaranteed returns. Thirdly, while the new CapEx plan has a broader scope in E&amp;P and Gas &amp; Power, the costs of implementing the program are lower due to cost savings.  We have also adapted a more selective approach to our investments in Refining &amp; Marketing.</p>
          <p>Around half of the planned CapEx for the next four years is not yet committed providing us with the flexibility we want in order to respond to changing market conditions.  Even in highly uncertain markets, Eni will continue to generate considerable amount of cash in the planned period.  Our cash allocation philosophy is based on the following three priorities.</p>
          <p>First, maintaining a strong capital position and credit rating, second, continuing to invest to fuel profitable growth throughout the Brent cycle, and third, rewarding our investors with superior yields.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to the Heads of our Divisions, who will give you more detail on the key drivers of the 2009 &#x2013; 2012 plan.  Claudio, to you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Paolo.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  In line with our history of industry leading growth in 2008, Eni production pro forma was the highest among its peers, setting a new record.  This result was achieved while the oil price hit the maximum level averaging around $100 per barrel.  Net of the PSA effect, our production was above 1.84 million barrel, an increase of 5.6% versus 2007, well above our original targets of 1.8 million.  This excellent result has been achieved through timely completion of all the 11 plain main(25.17) start-ups, strong focus on operation, effective integration and development of all the acquired assets. In an industry plagued by declining production, Eni continues to deliver a steady sustainable and profitable growth.</p>
          <p>We have continued to pursue our M&amp;A strategy focusing on highly synergic assets with significant upside potential.  Consistently we acquire conventional assets characterized by fast scale-up of production to 250,000 barrel per day in 2012, a breakeven price below $50 per barrel.  On top of that, we have already identified material upside resulting in higher 3P reserves and significant value creation.</p>
          <p>Last year, we replaced 135% of our production at the current prices.  Looking after next four years, new project start-ups, exploration activity and continued application of announced technology will enable us to replace 130% of our production at our price deck of $57 per barrel.  Our resources are based on solid 3P reserves, and on high potential prospects located in area where we have synergy cooperations. More than 95% of our 2P reserves would generate positive cash flow even at $30 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Exploration will be the pillar of our sustainable growth.  In 2008, we have discovered more than one billion boe.  More than 85% of portfolio has been renewed over the last few years strengthening Eni's position in areas with short time to market and competitive breakeven price.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have enlarged our resources base through the addition of new unconventional plays in Congo and Venezuela.  We have a long history of growth and of achieving our target throughout the cycle of the industry. Over the last decade, Eni has record an average growth rate of 5.6% per year.</p>
          <p>Our future growth will be a continuation of our strong performance to-date.  We target to further increase production by 3.5% until 2012 and by 3% thereafter.  We will hit these targets and achieve superior, valuable, and sustainable growth, thanks to a top quality portfolio geographically focusing, resilient, with one of the lowest breakeven price among our peers, high exposure to the most competitive giant projects, a unique approach to business leveraging on pioneer formula of cooperation with producing countries. And as Paolo mentioned, our unique integration with Gas &amp; Power division.</p>
          <p>Our growth strategy is straightforward and simple and benefits from strong geographical focus on three areas where we are a leading producer. These main areas characterized by low lifting costs and a competitive time to market will absorb more than 90% of our CapEx and produce more than 90% of our output.</p>
          <p>Africa, where we are the number one producer is our legacy area and will remain central to our strategy, with 1.1 million barrels per day of expected production by 2012. Central Asia and Russia will also contribute significantly to growth, with the production of 180,000 barrel per day by 2012.  OECD countries will continue to deliver a stable plateau at around 600,000 barrel per day.</p>
          <p>Our growth will be driven by robust pipeline or start-ups through 2012. In addition to the 11 start-ups delivered last year, in 2009 we will again complete 11 new projects. Our total CapEx this year will be around &#x20AC;9 billion of which 7.5 billion devoted to development. Consistent start-ups over the next four years will add 525,000 barrel per day by 2012. These initiatives are generally characterized by high equity enticement, operatorship, and are located in our core areas.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio on new projects sustainable on an average break-even of $35 per barrel will deliver more than 500,000 barrel per day of additional production by 2012. Around 50% of our new production will come from project that have already been sanctioned. That said, most of our construction activity has yet to be awarded. This will enable us to benefit from the ongoing reduction in upstream costs and further improve our break-even price.</p>
          <p>Giant projects such as Kashagan, M'Boundi, the gas field in Algeria, and the Western Libya Gas Project will account for an increasing share of our production during the planned period and beyond. In addition, unconventional oil giant projects and LNG will further sustain our long-term growth. Most of our giant projects are resilient at the price of $40 per barrel and will constitute Eni's backyard for the future.</p>
          <p>Eni competitive portfolio ensure that our investment plan remain attractive even in current market conditions and allow us to confirm a CapEx program of 33 billion in line with the last plan. Our investment flexibility progressively increases enable us to reschedule some projects in order to benefit the most from the recent downturn with a little impact on production.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have established a dedicated task force to capture the cost of reduction. This initiative which has already identified clear action for material saving, is regularly assessed by the top management.  The results obtained so far are on track to reach &#x20AC;5 billion of saving in the next four-year plan with a breakeven price reduction of $4 per barrel.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our simple and straightforward strategy based on efficient operation in low cost areas will continue to deliver a superior and profitable growth even in the current market condition.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and now I'll leave the floor to Domenico for Gas &amp; Power.</p>

          <p>Well, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  Gas &amp; Power EBITDA stood at &#x20AC;4.5 billion in 2008, a decline of 12% versus 2007.  The result was impacted by the severe economic slowdown in the fourth quarter.  While the performances in the first nine months of 2008, were in line with the previous year, EBITDA from marketing activities in the fourth quarter registered a sharp decline of around &#x20AC;570 million. The decreases are partially attributable to warmer weather condition and the weakening of the euro versus dollar. The real bad news has been the economic downturn, which caused a 13% decrease in gas sales in Gas &amp; Power sectors in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall Eni's gas sales in the year were stable, bolstered by our international growth, including <mark type="inaudible" />(34.45) gas.  The volume sold increased by 5%.  By contrast the regulated activities in international transportation posted an impressive result outpacing last year's record, and confirming the stable record of this utility-like business.  Following the sharp economic slowdown in the last few months of 2008, we are now expecting European gas demand to be flat in the year 2009.</p>
          <p>In Italy, we expect that the gas market will decline by 1%. Over the plan period, we've revised down our expectation of average European oil(35.31) growth from 3% to 2%.</p>
          <p>In Italy, the ability of larger gas volumes coming from new import infrastructure is likely to further increase the competitive pressure.  We will face this challenge by leveraging on our strong domestic position and our European leadership. Our large and diversified supply portfolio is another key asset giving us variable flexibility from both an operational and trading perspective. In our domestic market we will maintain a market share of over 50% and defend profitability. In each of the sectors we operate in we will target the most profitable and loyal customers.</p>
          <p>In gas sales to power generation clients, we're planning to hold our market share stable, leveraging on our flexibility and risk taking capacity. In industrial markets, we will increasingly select the most valuable clients tailoring the pricing and services to their specific needs.  We will continue to enlarge our customer base in residential market <mark type="inaudible" />(36.53) for which we target a penetration rate of 20% of our customer base by 2012.</p>
          <p>A key focus in Italy is operational efficiency. We will further the use of our cost reserve for residential clients by 20% between 2008 and 2012, optimize our operating and maintenance cost in power generation.On the international stage, the Distrigaz acquisition will help drive the sales growth and market share gains in our targeted markets.</p>
          <p>We expect our sales outside Italy to grow by 7% per year over the next four years. In France and Germany we will benefit from Distrigaz existing client base and set forth. In Belgium, we expect to preserve the Distrigaz leadership. We will also leverage on Distrigaz best-in-class as a trading team and platform to become a leading player in growing Northwest European liquid gas ops.(38.07)</p>
          <p>In the Iberian Peninsula, we are planning to further strengthen our leading position. We will reach market share of 16% by 2012, taking advantage of equity gas from Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, we aim to reach 6.5 bcm of volume sold by 2010 through <mark type="inaudible" />. Outside the Europe, we will increase our presence in the United States where we can leverage on equity gas from mainly Gulf of Mexico asset as well as from LNG supplies to Pascagoula terminal.</p>
          <p>Maintaining our leading Italian position in growing our European market share will enable us to increase overall gas sales by an average of 2% a year to 124 bcm by the year 2012. We will deliver &#x20AC;20 billion of EBITDA over the next four years leveraging the resilience our regulated business and our profitable international growth of our sales.</p>
          <p>In the next four years we'll invest seven billion in Gas &amp; Power an increase over 500 million from the previous plan. 75% of this CapEx will be invested in regulated business with a guaranteed returns. Of the remaining 1.8 billion, 0.7 will fuel the development of an annuity project starting in 2011. This will leverage on our unique combination of E&amp;P Gas &amp; Power and storage competencies.</p>
          <p>The additional storage capacity will be ideally located to complement Eni's production, sales, and training activities in Europe. It will further enhance the flexibility of our portfolio in solving(40.21) the most valuable customer segments.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;0.7 billion, we will complete the investment program in Power Generation. This will increase our storage capacity from to-date 4.9 gigawatt to 5.5 gigawatt in the same period, and consolidate Eni's position as the third largest producer in Italy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and now Angelo, back to you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Domenico. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. R&amp;M <mark type="inaudible" />(41.04) improved sharply in 2008. Excluding more favorable environment for refining margins operating profits were up by 12%. The strong commercial margins, and improved market share have been partially offset by higher refinery shutdowns and CO2 emission costs. Anyway, the Division's operating performance was further strengthened by cost saving initiatives with a 6% workforce reduction in Italy and energy consumption enhancements.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead at the next four years, we see a significant deterioration in the refining environment. Global demand will decrease due to the negative economic cycle, gradual improvements in energy efficiency, and the increase in the use of biofuels. Meanwhile, global refining capacity will increase with the new grass root projects coming on stream in Middle East and in Far East and many existing sites being upgraded in the US and Europe.</p>
          <p>To tackle the challenging scenario we will: optimize our refining capacity in Italy through the sale of weaker assets; lower our breakeven level, through our focused CapEx on secondary conversion and partner cost savings; increase marketing profits with focused growth in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>We have three main priorities for the next four years. The first is to deliver additional cost savings of &#x20AC;150 million, mainly through improving energy efficiency and cutting maintenance and labor costs. In Refining, we will increase our conversion index to 65% and achieve a middle distillate yield of 45%, more than double the yield in gasoline.</p>
          <p>Three new hydrocrackers will come on stream in 2009, in Sannazzaro, Taranto, and <mark type="inaudible" />(43.29). In marketing we will further grow our Italian market share to 32% through loyalty programs and an extended range of non oil services.</p>
          <p>Abroad, we will focus on three countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria where we enjoy significant advantages in terms of supply, logistics, and brand awareness. We want to increase our market share in these three countries to over 10% through opportunistic acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The significant turnaround potential in all our activities will enable use to increase R&amp;M EBIT by &#x20AC;400 million in 2012 excluding scenario effects. Our increased profitability will be driven by our focused CapEx plan which has been reduced by one billion or 28% compared to last year's plan.</p>
          <p>The three new hydrocrackers coming on stream in 2009, as well as the step up of our new S plant in 2012 will largely complete the strengthening of our key refineries. As a result, beyond 2010, we expect to further lower our CapEx requirements, significantly improving the R&amp;M division's cash generation. We're also confident that as technology enabling us to fully convert heavy oils and residues mainly into middle distillates, will also help us in getting access to new upstream assets.</p>
          <p>Thank you very for your attention. I will now hand you over to Paolo for his closing remarks.</p>

          <p> Tim Whitaker, Barclays Capital (57.34). You are a significant upstream company and growing your European gas business but you still remained sub-optimally sized in downstream oil. I just wonder why strategically you need to be in that at all, and whether you should just simply seek to exit? And also your, very small business, but chemical seems to be making significant loss -- shouldn't you just shut that down, and what's stopping you doing that?&gt;&gt;</p>
