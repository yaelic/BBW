        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, London and good afternoon Hong Kong. In the first six months of 2009, I am delighted to announce that we have once again achieved very good results. Profit before taxation rose 10% to $2.84 billion, income rose 14% to $7.96 billion. The cost income ratio improved 7% to less than 50% and the Board has declared an interim dividend of 21.23 cents per share, which is up 10%.</p>
          <p>These remain testing times for banks and we remain cautious about the near-term global economic outlook. However, we have achieved record results through our disciplined management approach and the diversity of our business and markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking has had a very strong first half as we drive to become the core bank for more of our clients, deepening relationships, and providing them with a broad range of value added products and services.</p>
          <p>Despite unhelpful headwinds, we've also made good progress in Consumer Banking in the first half, repositioning the business to service customers in well defined segments, whilst at the same time improving operational and service efficiency. I believe that the bank has a very clear and focused strategy, and we have no intention of deviating from this. Our strong levels of capital and liquidity have given us a competitive advantage and our decision to raise further capital today will further reinforce this and support our future growth.</p>
          <p>We recognize the need to rebuilt trust in banking and believe that international banks are an essential part of any successful economy, whether it is facilitating the resurgence of trade across our markets, enabling our multinational clients to conduct complex business transactions, or servicing the needs of an increasingly international class of consumer. Global recovery won't happen without international banks such as Standard Chartered.</p>
          <p>I joined the bank's board two years ago in August 2007 as Deputy Chairman and more recently became Chairman. During that time, I've traveled to many of the countries in which we operate and have experienced it first hand our deep local heritage. This year we are celebrating the bank's 150 year anniversary both in Hong Kong and Singapore. These are very important milestones, which serve to remind us how much we are part of the fabric of our markets. Our people have an extraordinary set of shared values including the firm belief that building a sustainable business means that long-term economic profit is dependant upon the sustainability of the communities, of which we are an important part, this governors how we go about business, everyday. These are powerful reasons I wanted to be involved with Standard Chartered, and why I am delighted to have been chosen as Chairman of the bank.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered today has a strong Board and talented management team. With a great diversity of experience, and over the coming months we will be seeking to strengthen our Board of Directors still further. I'm very pleased that Mike Rees will be joining the board as Group Executive Director with immediate effect. Over the last six years, Mike has done an exceptional job in transforming Wholesale Banking and he will be a great addition to the Board.</p>
          <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Sunil Mittal for the valuable contribution he has made to the Board over the past two years. With increasing demands placed on his time, we agreed it was difficult for him to spend as much time as he considered appropriate on Standard Chartered business and he decided to step down last month. Sunil, once again a very big, thank you.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, a very good start to the year, we have sustained our good performance despite the economic &#x2013; the difficult economic environment. And now I would like to handover to Richard, who will take you through the results in more detail. Richard?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good afternoon, Hong Kong, good morning, London. As John has said, Standard Chartered has delivered another strong performance in the first half of 2009 and let me draw at several key highlights. Record levels of income over $7.9 billion and record levels of profit over $2.8 billion. Substantial income momentum, the Group has generated around an extra $1 billion of income over the both the first half and the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Income on a reported basis is up 14% year-on-year or 25% on a constant currency basis. Demonstrable cost control; costs are well controlled up only 3% on the first half of 2008, delivering double digit jaws. The normalized cost income ratio fell below 50%, a proactive approach to risk. Impairments, although increasing, are developing in line with expectations. Total impairment in the first half of 2009 is 15% below the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Strong profit growth up 10% on the first half of 2008 or 19% on a constant currency basis and up over 40% on the second half of 2008. Capital, we have created organic core Tier 1 equity of $1.4 billion in the first half, which together with the disciplined approach of the management of risk-weighted assets, means that the Group has also been capital ratio accretive in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Liquidity, we remain highly liquid and are continuing to attract good levels of high quality deposits. Excellent normalized return on equity of 17% well within our target range of mid-to-high teens. And let me take you through the numbers.</p>
          <p>At a Group level, income has grown 14% during 2009 driven by excellent momentum in Wholesale Banking with income growth of 37%. Expenses are benefiting from a robust discipline and focus and have grown 3%, resulting in strongly positive jaws of 11%. Excluding the impact of PEM Group, expenses have actually fallen by 1%, reflecting a continued focus on costs, but also the impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of $2.8 billion was up 10% on 2008. Now within the first half performances, two items of a singular nature to watch for, although they broadly balance each other. Firstly, income in the first half of 2009 has benefited from the buyback of Tier 2 notes announced in April, totaling $248 million. Secondly, expenses included provision of $170 million taken against structured notes issued by PEM Group.</p>
          <p>You'll also recall that in the first half of 2008 income included the profit on the sale of the asset management company of India totaling $146 million and these items are all normalized from earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Performance metrics, for clarity we are showing on this slide the first half 2009 and comparative period earnings per share and dividend per share numbers. The comparative periods have been adjusted for the impact of the rights issue. Dividend per share has grown 10%, whilst profit attributable to shareholders has grown some $98 million or 6%, EPS has fallen 10% as a result of the impact of the rights issue, but also as a result of a higher effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>The ETR of 29.8% is slightly higher than our normal underlying rate due primarily to differed tax adjustments and some adjustment to prior period provisions. We are in advanced stages of agreeing all outstanding U.K. tax computations to 2006 and we expect to conclude these discussions later this year, and any further adjustments which will not be material, will be booked at that stage. We expect to see our ETR back at around 28% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, the balance sheet is conservatively positioned, well diversified and highly liquid. The strength of our deposit franchise is a key differentiator and a source of competitive advantage. Our focus on liabilities and disciplined deployment of the balance sheet has again resulted in a strong ratio of customer loans to customer deposits, the A/D ratio.</p>
          <p>As of 30th of June, 2009 the A/D ratio was 78%, up slightly from 75% at the year-end. A/D ratios in all of our major geographies except the Americas, Europe and U.K. segment dropped under 100%. The Group remains a strong, double-digit, billions net interbank lender and the liquidity ratio remains excellent at 24.1%.</p>
          <p>Our loan book is well diversified by country and by sector. The Group's balance sheet has as you know very limited exposure to problem asset classes. You will see that our total balance sheet decreased by some $24 billion since year end as a result of a fall in the derivatives assets.</p>
          <p>Capital, the Group's strong capital position continues to improve as we organically generated some $1.4 billion of core Tier 1 equity and we are proactively improving both the quantum and quality of capital. During the first half of the year we enhanced our capital base through liability management exercises and the issuance of $1.5 billion of Innovative Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>We have improved our funding profile issuing some $3.5 billion of senior funding in euros, dollars and sterling in the first half and as a bank, within our funding profile we have very low levels of refinancing maturing over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Core equity is up at 7.6%, Tier 1 is at 10.5%, and total capital is at 15.8%. We have this morning announced a capital raising of about &#xA3;1 billion or $1.6 billion, by an accelerated book build. Adjusting for the process of this placement the pro-forma core Tier 1, the Tier 1 and the total capital ratios as of 30th June, 2009 would have been 8.4%, 11.5% and 16.6% respectively, and Peter will talk to you about the transaction rationale.</p>
          <p>Turning to geographic performance, despite some tentative signs of recovery, trading conditions in the Group's main operating market remain challenging. But in spite of this challenging economic backdrop, income and profit performance for the Group has been broad-based and strong.</p>
          <p>Profits in Hong Kong fell 12% on the first half of 2008 as impairment increased and wealth management income, although showing some signs of recovery, remained well below the levels seen in the first half of 2008. Profits were, however, up 61% on the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Singapore had an outstanding first half, with income up 37% and profits were up 36%. In Korea, we continue to reshape the business to good effect. However, profit fell by 61% on a headline basis on income that was down 19%. Increased impairment was driven by incremental charges for KIKOs and pressure on the unsecured portfolios. On a constant currency basis, income was up 10% and profits down 49%.</p>
          <p>Other APR, which includes geographies such as China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia saw income down 1%. Income in China grew rapidly, up 22% to $372 million and income originated in China but booked elsewhere was up 60%. Operating profit increased 137% to $135 million although Consumer Banking in China has continued to incur losses given the impact of our investment program. In other APR, overall, profit before tax fell 18%.</p>
          <p>In India, you should bear in mind the comparative period included the gain on the sale of our asset management company of $146 million. Striping this out, income in India increased 9% and profits were up 14%. The results in India have also been materially impacted by foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis profit in India is up 37%.</p>
          <p>Middle East and South Asia, or MESA, had strong income growth of 29% and profits have been impacted both by ongoing stress in the unsecured portfolio and significant corporate provisions.</p>
          <p>Africa had an excellent first half. Income grew 29% and profit was up 69% and on a constant currency basis these results were better still with income up 60% and profit up 117%.</p>
          <p>The Americas, U.K. and Europe region is predominantly a wholesale business and the underlying performance in the region is similar to elsewhere in the world, and has been excellent. This region has seen good ALM gains given its role as a liquidity center, and you should adjust the 2009 numbers for the gain of $248 million on our liability management exercise and also reflect the 2008 including $130 million of ABS related write-downs.</p>
          <p>Now Consumer Banking; during the course of 2009, in the Consumer Banking business, we have continued to strengthen the basics, whilst changing the strategic focus of the business. Consumer Banking income fell 15% and expenses fell 9% with operating profit before tax down 57% to $348 million.</p>
          <p>But momentum through the first two quarters of this year is good and quarterly income is accelerating. Compared with the second half of 2008, Consumer Banking income is down only 3% and profit was up 11% as we reined in costs. The margin dynamics in Consumer Banking in the first half of the year have been mixed. While asset margins have held up well, liability margins have compressed by some 55 basis points since the year end, dragging Consumer Banking income but offset to some degree by volume increases.</p>
          <p>We choose to run high deposit levels, improving their mix and accept the earnings trade-off for the resilience that it provides. Wealth management income has remained under pressure given still muted consumer appetite for investment products and this low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Mortgages have performed well, with margins and market shares up in Hong Kong, in Korea and in Singapore. In Singapore we are capturing 20% of new business and in Hong Kong we are capturing 19% of new business being booked. SME, which as you know is a liability led business, saw liabilities grow 24% year-on-year. Deposits in SME are over twice the level of loan balances.</p>
          <p>Incoming SME has fallen 20%, primarily as a result of the impact of liability margin compression. In difficult market conditions we have repositioned the book, increasing the proportion of secured lending and adjusting pricing to reflect the risk environment, around 60% of the SME book is secured.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking, has seen good balance sheet velocity for both assets and liabilities. Assets have grown 5% in the first half primarily in the secured products, as we have taken good market share in a number of key markets. Deposit-gathering has been an area of real focus, and as of the end of the first half of the year Consumer Banking was contributing some $46 billion of surplus liquidity to the Group.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expenses, as we anticipated falling income in the first half of 2008, we initiated a series of cost reduction initiatives. These initiatives have continued and accelerated through the second half of 2008 and into the first half of 2009. Against the first half of 2008, expenses have fallen by 9% or 18% excluding the impact of PEM Group. Around half of this decrease results from the impact of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Against the second half of 2008, expenses are down 14% excluding the PEM Group impact and are currently running at a monthly run rate last seen in the first half of 2007. We are seeing real evidence of traction in our cost efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>Business-as-usual costs for example are down $100 million and head count is down by nearly 3,000 or some 6% since the end of 2008. And importantly, our cost discipline is creating capacity to continue to invest. We are being selective and disciplined in our choice of investments. In the first half of the year, we have invested in the optimization of both, the number and efficiency of call centres with standardized processes and expanded our mobile banking offering to 20 markets and our Internet offering to 26 markets. We have also added almost 250 relationship managers in premium banking, SME, and the private bank, and opened 25 new outlets in Korea and in China.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment, the Consumer Banking loan impairment charge has increased to $563 million. This is up 7% or $38 million over the second half impairment level with increases in Korea, India, and the UAE partially offset by improvements in Taiwan and in Hong Kong. We have continued to de-risk the loan book by focusing on secured assets, 75% of the consumer loan book is fully secured. 18% is unsecured, and 7% is partially secured.</p>
          <p>We have tightened our underwriting standards, reshaped the unsecured business away from high risk segments, significantly increased collections capacity and upped collateral requirements.</p>
          <p>Let me show to you in little more detail. This slide shows the quarterly trend in Consumer Banking loan impairment. Let me draw out the key points on this slide. Looking at mortgages, loan impairment has increased by some tens of millions of dollars, primarily as a result of pressure in the UAE and in Taiwan. Delinquency trends in our largest markets remained broadly stable.</p>
          <p>Within SME, you can see that impairment is running significantly below the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2008. Approximately, 10% of all SME loans are now booked under government guarantee schemes. We have continued to decrease the size of the unsecured business installment loan portfolio down from just under $2.5 billion in the first half of 2008 to $1.8 billion now.</p>
          <p>In other loans, a book of $22 billion has included $13 billion of credit cards and personal loans. The vast majority of the $394 million impairment in other loans was driven by this unsecured portfolio, although loss rates have stabilized in the first two quarters of the year. Other loans also include secured private bank and wealth management lending where loss rates are negligible.</p>
          <p>When thinking about the trend into the second half 2009, we see upward pressure in the UAE, India, and Korea balanced by improvements in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Our current expectation is loan impairment in the third quarter will be flat on the charge for the second quarter of the year as loan impairment stabilizes.</p>
          <p>To summarize for Consumer Banking overall, resilience in income in a difficult environment, strong cost discipline, and loan impairment under control and stabilizing. Consumer Banking is making good progress in its strategic shift, has a strong and increasingly liquid balance sheet providing substantial surplus liabilities for the benefit of the Group and is well positioned for the upturn in our markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wholesale Banking, the first half of 2009 has been excellent for Wholesale Banking with broad based and diverse top line growth across multiple products, geographies, and segments. The continuing focus on client relationships, tight management and capital, liquidity and risk have been key enablers of growth and a differentiating competitive factor.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking operating profit grew 36% on income that grew 37%. Expenses rose 16%, reflecting increased levels of profit related remuneration and selective investment in key product capabilities. Cost growth remains well below income growth, delivering strongly positive jaws of 21%. Impairment has increased, reflecting the deteriorating external environment.</p>
          <p>We continue to be disciplined in managing the relationship between risk-weighted assets and income growth with an ongoing focus on origination and distribution of assets. Risk-weighted assets grew by 12% since the year end. Credit migration has been partially offset by decreasing balance sheet. Market risk-weighted assets increased by almost $9 billion as we expanded our commodities business and also as a result of FSA rule changes.</p>
          <p>Income; client income, the major engine of Wholesale Banking revenues grew strongly, up 24% and contributes 69% of total Wholesale Banking income. Total Wholesale Banking income in the first half of the year was almost at the same level as for the full year 2007. Three of our four client segments, each generated income of over $1 billion in the first half of 2009 with global corporates in particular performing strongly up 50%. The fourth segment, commodity traders grew 55%.</p>
          <p>Looking through the product lends, lending and portfolio management income grew 67%. Transaction banking grew 2%. Within transaction banking trade was up 33% with rising margins ahead of falling volumes.</p>
          <p>Cash and custody was down 17% on the first half of 2008, despite balances increasing to $85 billion. Global Markets achieved an excellent 54% growth with strong growth across a broad range of products, but in particular in financial markets and in Corporate Finance.</p>
          <p>Looking at income in more detail. As in previous periods, client income continues to be the main component of total Wholesale Banking income. We continue to become more important to our clients, deepening relationships and driving client income momentum. Effective collaboration across our network has again proved to be a powerful competitive advantage and we are seeing particularly good traction in the provision of banking services to Chinese, Korean, and Indian corporate as they internationalize.</p>
          <p>Lending income was up strongly from 246 million to $412 million, reflecting significantly increased margins in many geographies. Lending volumes have increased only 5%.</p>
          <p>Trade grew strongly year-on-year, but also importantly was up 13% on the second half of 2008 reflecting strong client demand. In trade, margins were up by some 61 basis points since the year end and we are continuing to benefit from the changing competitive environment by increasing market share in multiple markets.</p>
          <p>Cash management income was down as volume increases were insufficient to compensate for margin compression of some 57 basis points and material drag to earnings.</p>
          <p>Global Market had an excellent six months and as in previous years, remained very predominantly client driven business. Within Global Markets, own account income encompasses ALM, Principal Finance and the client flow trading business captured within financial markets. Financial markets has had a very strong first half, and I'll talk about this on the next slide.</p>
          <p>ALM income, up 8% on the first half of 2008 or 40% on the second half to $557 million, reflects high levels of liquidity and also sharply upward sloping yield curves in the early part of the year. Hong Kong and Singapore showed particularly strong ALM income in the first half of the year. As mentioned in our pre-close announcement higher yield in positions that have matured are being replaced at lower levels.</p>
          <p>Corporate Finance income of $615 million, up 68% exceeds the full year income for the Corporate Finance business in 2007 and pipelines remain excellent. Our Principal Finance business has a strong track record of creating value for its investments. Realizations of $135 million in the first half of 2009 were up 75% on the first half of 2008. We are selectively investing in this business and we remain very happy with the quality of the assets.</p>
          <p>Looking at financial markets in more detail. Income in financial markets increased to 68% to over $2 billion with 60% of this being client income. Our traditional trade and cash businesses provide significant flows to the rates and FX businesses.</p>
          <p>In the first half of the year, clients have been more proactive in hedging their risks, and we had seen good market share gains in FX. In rates, more clients are using rates products, especially in capital market and the Corporate Finance transactions driving increased volumes.</p>
          <p>Bid-offer spreads were also wider in the early part of the year, reflecting higher levels of volatility. And reflecting these higher levels of pricing as well as increased volumes, FX income grew 16%. Rates increased 72%. We are ranked the number one provider of interest rate and currency derivatives across Asia.</p>
          <p>Commodities and Equities is a relatively new business in which we have been investing over the past three years. Income increased from $48 million to $236 million reflecting higher commodity price volatility and expanded geographic and product coverage. Capital Markets where income increased over 90% from $118 million to $226 million saw good levels of origination.</p>
          <p>Turning to loan impairment, Wholesale Banking loan impairment was a net charge of $525 million to the income statement, up from $53 million in the first half of 2008 and $331 million in the second half of 2008. And there are three areas that have impacted upon loan impairment. First of all, across the book the overall portfolio continues to perform and we are seeing a staccato series of individual small loan impairments with no particular geographic or industry concentration.</p>
          <p>The second factor is specific derivative related impairments of some $70 million, primarily in Korea, an echo of last year's KIKO issue. Thirdly and materially, significant impairment taken against local corporates exposures in the Gulf region.</p>
          <p>Early Alerts, our early warning system, which rose strongly from the year end have fallen in May and in June, although it remains too early to tell if this is part of a longer term trend. We remain vigilant and have continued to take a proactive approach to risk. We regularly stress test our loan book for a variety of scenarios, and given the uncertain external environment, we remain cautious on the outlook. Our cover ratio remained stable on the year-end position.</p>
          <p>Overall, Wholesale Banking has again delivered another strong set of results with record levels of income, a firm grip on costs, and focused management of risk. It enters the second half with robust transaction pipelines. Profit in the first half of the year is almost at the same level as for the full year 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to American Express Bank. AEB delivered just over $300 million of income in the first half of the year with business-as-usual expenses running at $195 million for the first six months. AEB has delivered profit of $90 million pre-integration expense. Integration expenses are significantly down at $30 million, and profit before tax in the first half was $60 million.</p>
          <p>In the first half of the year we have realized cost synergies of some $70 million, and in line with our earlier expectations, we are now clearly tracking to realize business-as-usual cost synergies of over $130 million in 2009. In addition, 2009 will also see a substantial fall in integration expenses to below $70 million. AEB has also been a powerful liability engine contributing good levels of liquidity to the Group. We remain confident of EPS accretion and double digit return on investment in 2009, and expect a strong delta of over $200 million between 2009 and 2008 operating profit before tax.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet, the Group remains strongly liquid, both in parts and as a whole, with a diverse and growing funding base. Current accounts and savings accounts, or CASA, grew by some $18 billion, with time deposits falling $15 billion since year end. We have consciously focused on improving the mix of our deposit base and as a result, the proportion of CASA has increased to just over 50% of total Group liabilities. Total deposits fell 2%.</p>
          <p>The Group's strong liquidity profile has been a key enabler of business and a significant source of competitive advantage. We have the liquidity strength to service our customers' needs. Wholesale continues to source high quality corporate deposits, particularly within its cash management business. Consumer is a high quality deposit gatherer across multiple markets providing further resilience to the Group.</p>
          <p>Assets, our balance sheet remains as before a source of differentiation and strength for the Group. We have low loan to values on our mortgage book with an average of just over 50%. Short maturity profile on our wholesale loan book with around 70% of the book under one year, our ABS carrying value is now $3 billion or some 0.7% of assets. And during the first six months, we saw good levels of redemptions on our ABS portfolio of over $850 million, only $23 million was charged to the income statement for impairment in the first half, and we remain confident in the quality of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We have low exposure to commercial real estate to level three assets and to leverage loans. Overall exposures are diversified over geography and sector with no material concentrations. We have a conservative funding profile with very limited refinancing pressure in the next few years. The balance sheet remains robust and well diversified.</p>
          <p>Turning now to outlook, the second half of 2009 has started well. The momentum in Wholesale Banking has continued, and profit in July is ahead of the first half average monthly profit run rate. Transaction pipelines are robust. However, that said, we do remain watchful on the outlook and have positioned conservatively.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Banking, income is rising and both expenses and impairment are under control. A significant improvement in Consumer Banking income is dependent on the timing of further recovery in consumer confidence attaching to investment products and a turn in the interest rate cycle.</p>
          <p>Disciplined execution of our strategy, our diverse income streams, deep client relationships and effective management of capital, liquidity, and risk remain key to success in 2009. We are, as we have said before, in great shape and we are gaining market share across multiple products and multiple geographies.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I'll hand over to Peter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Richard. Good morning London and good afternoon Hong Kong. Richard has explained the numbers and to a large extend they tell the story themselves. Once again, we have delivered record profits on the back of record income.</p>
          <p>What I'll do now is give a bit more color on our performance over the last six months, set out the strategic priorities for both businesses and the Group as a whole and in that context explain the logic of the equity placing announced today.</p>
          <p>In looking at the strength of our performance over the last six months, I wouldn't want you to think it's simply because we somehow escaped the storm, that our markets, our businesses were in some way immune to the crisis.</p>
          <p>In fact, in the first half of 2009, the full force of the global economic crisis hit Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Exports and GDP fell dramatically. Unemployment and business failures surged. Yet despite such turbulence, we continued to deliver.</p>
          <p>Against this is backdrop, I could spend a lot of time talking about our achievements and there is much to be proud of. Markets like Singapore and Africa put in outstanding performances. Businesses like FX and Rates did superbly well. But rather than do that, I have deliberately chosen to focus on some of the more challenging markets and businesses, where we faced real headwinds.</p>
          <p>So. first of all, Korea, obviously, a 61% drop in profits is not a great outcome. The extent of this fall was exaggerated by the depreciation in the Korean won, but even adjusting to this, profits were down sharply.</p>
          <p>Income fell 19%, largely due to falling demand for Wealth Management products as well as the impact of de-risking the SME book. Costs were also reduced, falling 23%. But loan impairment doubled to 185 million.</p>
          <p>But beneath these rather disappointing numbers, we are making good progress in transforming our business in Korea. In Consumer Banking, we have great traction in CASA. Our share of new deposit inflows is up over 50% to 8.9%, and we are also winning market share in mortgages with new business at significantly higher margins.</p>
          <p>New and relocated branches, 25 in the first half, outperform existing branches across the range of metrics; revenue per customer is three times higher, asset booking eight times higher.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale Banking, which now constitutes 40% of total income, we are deepening client relationships and expanding product capabilities. Onshore income grew 8%, income from Korean clients booked elsewhere in the network increased by 150% to 75 million.</p>
          <p>In June, we became the first foreign institution to gain approval to form a financial holding company. This will allow us to cross-sell products to our client base and enhance efficiency through sharing resources.</p>
          <p>So despite these H1 results, I am confident about the prospects for our business in Korea. We still have much to do, but we have big aspirations of this business. Indeed, I won't be satisfied until we are making at least $1 billion in profits in Korea.</p>
          <p>MESA or Middle East &amp; South Asia is another region where we've seen a sharp reduction in profits, down 43% year-on-year. The MESA region includes Pakistan as well as the Middle East itself. In Pakistan, a challenging political and security environment, a depreciating currency, and the impact of the global crisis resulted in income falling 21% and profits down 75% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>We have taken action to de-risk the book and reduce costs, and we'll continue to run our business in Pakistan defensibly. Whilst we don't anticipate a strong return to growth in the near term, neither do we see much further downside.</p>
          <p>The Middle East is being affected quite severely by the crisis, and this has had a negative impact on both our businesses. In the first half, we actually achieved strong income growth, up 29%, driven by Wholesale Banking, but we have also seen a sharp and significant increase in loan impairment in both businesses.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking loan impairment increased by 88% to 143 million. Wholesale Banking took significant provisions relating to certain local corporates in region; loan impairment increased from only 4 million in H1 2008 to 317 million in this first half.</p>
          <p>In response to the deteriorating environment, we have acted decisively to de-risk our portfolios in both businesses and to contain costs. However, despite these immediate challenges, the Middle East has extraordinary wealth and huge potential for growth.</p>
          <p>So although we will continue to be quite defensive in our risk stance, we're still very much open to business, still investing to grow. Indeed, this slide shows us opening our third branch in Qatar last month. Korea and MESA are two geographic regions where we have faced big challenges.</p>
          <p>From a business perspective, Wealth Management and Deposits in Consumer Banking has been one of the most severely affected. In H1, 2008 Wealth Management and Deposits contributed 1.5 billion, 47% of total consumer banking income.</p>
          <p>Following the failure of Lehman, demand for investment products collapsed, whilst reductions in interest rates cut deposit margins. Wealth Management and Deposits income fell to 1.3 billion in H2, 2008 and 1.1 billion in H1, 2009, a $400 million reduction year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management accounted for most of this decline as individual investors fled from unit trusts, equity link products, anything highly structured, but there are no indications that investor appetite is beginning to reappear.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, for example, average daily fee income in June was more than double the rate for Q4, 2008, and around 60% of the level this time last year. It's still early days, but with Q2 Wealth Management income 7% up on Q1, the signs are encouraging.</p>
          <p>Deposit income also fell by about 100 million year-on-year, with margin compression more than offsetting the 12% increase in deposit balances as we continued to benefit from a flight to quality.</p>
          <p>Both Wealth Management and Deposits are geared to the upswing. When investor confident returns and interest rates begin to rise, income will surge, and this will have a powerful affect on the bottom line of Consumer Banking.</p>
          <p>But we're not anticipating it will be quite like it was, We are fundamentally reconfiguring our Wealth Management business, shifting the balance from product sales to client needs, focusing more on portfolio management and sourcing more of our investment products internally.</p>
          <p>And in Deposits, our emphasis is on CASA, up 34% year-on-year, not time deposits and on wining primary bank relationships through payroll and innovative propositions tailored to the needs of specific segments.</p>
          <p>Korea, MESA, Wealth Management and Deposits, these are examples of some of the challenges we faced in navigating the crisis. We have not come through unscathed. But the strength and diversity of our business and the way we tackle the problems has enabled us to continue to deliver record profits.</p>
          <p>Let met now turn to the big picture and talk about the strategic priorities in our two businesses and the group as a whole, starting with Consumer Banking. Faced with a sharp reduction in income and a rapidly deteriorating credit environment, Steve Bertamini and his team responded swiftly, cutting costs, de-risking the book. But we've not stopped at tactical actions. We've also begun a comprehensive transformation of the business. In fact, what we are doing now in Consumer Banking has many parallels with what we did in Wholesale Banking several years ago; a shift in emphasis from products to customers, significant investment in global re-engineering projects, a more disciplined market participation model.</p>
          <p>Central to this transformation is a shift away from product sales towards much greater focus on deep multi-product customer relationships. Now this is not just marketing buzz. We are changing the way we've managed performance, incentivise staff, make risk decisions, design products. This is a big complex change program.</p>
          <p>Priority Banking, our service for premium customers is a tangible example of what we are doing. We've completely redesigned the proposition to make it clearly distinctive. We launched this proposition, this new proposition two weeks ago in Hong Kong, last week in Singapore and will roll it out across eight key markets over the next two months. We've increased the number of Priority Banking relationship managers by 110 in the last six months and plan to take it to around 1,650 by the end of the year. It's about 1,300 right now.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking has had a tough 12 months, but I am confident we're through the worst of it. Q1 income was up on Q4; Q2 was up on Q1. Loan impairment has stabilized, costs are under tight control. We are making very good progress in reshaping Consumer Banking and I am confident that we can and will turn this business into a powerful engine of sustainable profit growth.</p>
          <p>Most of this growth will be organic. But we will also look to make acquisitions where they compliment our organic investments. For example, we are in discussions to buy some small businesses in India and China, which may or may not result in a transaction. If they do, the consideration is likely to be in the low hundreds or millions or dollars.</p>
          <p>However, as we have said many times before looking or even discussing and actually doing are by no means the same thing, we have to be convinced of the strategic logic, the cultural and business fit, and above all, it has to make financial sense.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking is tackling immediate challenges while fundamentally transforming the business model. Meanwhile, Wholesale Banking continues to have strong momentum with profits up 36%, on the back of income up 37%.</p>
          <p>We have stuck to our client-led strategy. You will no doubt have seen this permit many times before. At heart, we are a classic international commercial bank, focusing on lending, trade, cash management and the associated interest rate and foreign exchange hedging. The majority of our client revenue comes from these core activities.</p>
          <p>Transaction banking relationships are the bedrock of our client franchise. They provide the platform from which we can provide value-added and strategic services, such as debt capital markets and corporate finance.</p>
          <p>Our focus is on building deep, long-term client relationships. In fact, we have not sought to add many new clients during the crisis. Instead, we have deployed our capital and liquidity primarily in support of existing clients; and in doing so have further deepened these relationships. Income from our top 50 clients is up over 40%, the number of clients from whom we earn income of over $10 million is up 67%.</p>
          <p>Underpinning this deepening of relationships is a steady development of our capabilities. Corporate Finance is one example. In 2002, we had a very small Corporate Finance business, making a few tens of millions. In H1, 2009, the 450 staff in Corporate Finance generated over 600 million.</p>
          <p>This is an example of us adding capabilities to meet the needs of our clients. And it's important to emphasis it's that way round. We look at our clients and work out what we can provide in a competitively advantage way. We don't start by building product capability and then find clients to sell to. That's what we mean by a client-focused strategy.</p>
          <p>I am frequently asked about the sustainability of own account income. We look at own account in three bold segments: ALM, Principal Finance, and the flow trading component of our Financial Markets business. In the first half, flow trading in Financial Markets has been the big driver.</p>
          <p>Substantial increases in client trading volumes, wider bid-offer spreads as a result of the volatility drove flow trading income, which is essentially the income that results from being a market-maker to clients. It's not proprietary trading. We have no proprietary trading desks, nor do we intend to.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to H2, we do anticipate some negative pressures on own account income. ALM will likely be lower given the probable shape of the yield curve and the bank's positioning. Flow trading will probably be affected by the narrowing of bid-offer spreads, and also the seasonal effects on trading volumes. Principal Finance realizations, by their nature, are lumpy and somewhat hard to predict. However, our general expectation is that over time own account will tend to grow broadly inline with client income.</p>
          <p>So our two businesses have somewhat different priorities. In Consumer Banking, it's about dealing with the headwinds whilst simultaneously transforming the business model. In Wholesale Banking, it's about disciplined, sustainable growth, striking the balance between grasping the opportunities, while not overreaching.</p>
          <p>Mike Rees has done a tremendous job as Chief Executive of Wholesale Banking, consistently striking the right balance between boldness and caution. I'm delighted to welcome him to the Board.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Group as a whole, the overall strategy remains unchanged. We have taken the time to step back and review our strategy in the light of the crisis and the fundamental changes happening in the world of banking. Put simply, our main conclusion was that our strategy appears even more compelling than it was before.</p>
          <p>We will remain focused on Asia, Africa and the Middle East markets that offer growth and which we know intimately. We will remain focused on building long-term deep relationships with our clients. In fact, the shift to more customer-focused model in Consumer Banking reinforces this. We will continue to run our balance sheet conservatively. Our liquidity and capital strength has proved a real competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>We will continue to run ourselves as One Bank, leveraging the synergies between the businesses and geographies, stamping on any silos. We will continue to focus on organic growth as the primary driver of value creation, with acquisitions playing an important, but secondary role. And we will continue to nurture and reinforce our distinctive culture. Standard Chartered is a rather different sort of bank, and I want to keep it like that.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the equity placing we announced today. This morning we announced we would raise about &#xA3;1 billion or about $1.6 billion via an accelerated book build. Why are we doing this, when we are delivering record profits and when we are already strongly capitalized? At its most simple, the answer is that we are strong and we are wining and with more capital we will be even stronger and we will win more.</p>
          <p>We have learned the power of playing from strength. Our distinctively strong capital and liquidity position have proved a powerful competitive advantage. Our balance sheet strength reassures stakeholders and attracts customers, which in turn reinforces the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>More capital will also enable us to take full advantage of the opportunities emerging from the crisis. Asia will emerge faster than the rest of the world. Our clients are moving to grasp the opportunities. Our deal pipelines are strong. We are winning market share in both businesses, in many products, in many markets. We want to be there to support our customers as they turn the crisis to their competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>And we also see merit in having a substantial capital buffer, well above what we strictly need, at a time of almost unprecedented uncertainty. While the economic environment has undoubtedly got somewhat better, particularly in our markets, we're far from out of the woods. And regulatory expectations about capital requirements have, if anything, got more confused and confusing, with new numbers and arguments appearing by the week. In this context, it makes sense to have the margin to stand above the fray.</p>
          <p>It is also important to make clear what aren't the reasons for making this placing; it's not about filling some black hole in our balance sheet. Whilst we have experienced increased loan impairment, the strength of our overall performance means we have been able to take this in our stride.</p>
          <p>It is not because we are intensely gloomy about the outlook. Yes, there are challenges, but on the whole, our parts of the world are looking better. And it is not about funding an acquisition spree. Yes, we may find some opportunities, but we will be extremely selected. We're raising capital not because we need to, not because anyone has told us to, but because we want to stay ahead of the game.</p>
          <p>So, how are we thinking about the outlook? The bank is in great shape. We've finished the first half with good momentum and we've began the second half strongly. We're on the right part of the world and we've got the right strategy. But whilst I am very positive about the bank, our strategy, our momentum, the shape of the business, I don't underestimate the scale of what's going on around us. The aftershocks of the crisis, the rebalancing of the world economy, the rewriting of the rules for banking, these are far from over.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered has a long history. Last year, we celebrated 150 years of history in China and India. This year we're celebrating our 150th anniversaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
          <p>We've experienced a lot of ups and downs along the way. But this is a bank that rises to a challenge, that works together as one team. Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Standard Chartered for their professionalism, commitment and teamwork.</p>
          <p>By sticking to our strategy, staying focused on the basics of banking and staying true to our values and culture, we've shown resilience throughout the crisis, consistently delivering record profits. I am confident we will continue to deliver for the rest of the year and beyond.</p>
          <p>But simply weathering the storm is not enough. Whilst I don't underestimate the challenges, we do see this crisis as a strategic opportunity to deepen our relationships with clients, to win market share, to transform our competitive position. That's our goal, that's the logic of raising more capital.</p>
          <p>I'll now handover to Jaspal, Ben, and Julian to take your questions in Hong Kong. John, Richard and I will answer your questions in London. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one. You mentioned several times the impact of the absolute interest rates on the Group's revenue. And is that impact are now reflected in the first half base case? Or given any particular hedges that the Group might have, will there still be any financial drag looking forward from here if short-term rates stay where they are? So that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is on the pro forma core Tier 1 ratio of 8.4%. How should we interpret your words of what you are going to do with the capital going forward, do you intend to run that back down again as RWA growth outpaces capital creation? Or is that the new world level that we should get used to?</p>
          <p>And the third question is inside the Wholesale Bank, if you could comment perhaps on the cost income ratio dynamics of own account revenues versus client revenues? And therefore as client revenues and as the mix looks to normalize going forward, everything else equal, should we anticipate the cost income ratio to shift back up again, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the third one is definitely one for Richard. Why don't I take the second one first on the capital issue. And then, you can have the low interest rates and the <mark type="inaudible" /> own account client revenue cost income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That'll give you time to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sort of work it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital placing takes our core Tier I on a pro forma basis to 8.4 and to our Tier 1 on to 11.5, and our objective is &#x2013; we have two simultaneous objectives. First is to further strengthen our balance sheet to make it even more competitively distinctive. And secondly, to have more capital to deploy as our clients take advantages of the opportunities that they see. And we're seeing a real shift in mood in our clients, particularly in Asia.</p>
          <p>I think it would be reasonable to expect that we'll strike a balance between those two objectives, so it'd be reasonable to expect that our core Tier 1 will stick at eight and above, and our Tier 1 will stick to 11 above.</p>
          <p>And to pre-empt the obvious question of why did we pick the amount we're raising? The amount we're raising is effectively the minimum we can raise which simultaneously gets us comfortably above eight and 11 and gives us more capital that we can deploy as we see opportunities to support our clients. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one which is the interest rate impact on numbers going forward, I mean, there are two broad elements, I think, of the liabilities to which we supplied. First of all as we've talked about is the deposits within the Consumer Bank. And I think actually we pretty much bottomed out at this stage in terms of the flow through into these half numbers. And with regard to interest rate compression liability, I'm &#x2013; compression on the Consumer Bank.</p>
          <p>The second element is within Wholesale, people often underestimate the liquidity quality of the Wholesale Banking business, which has a very significant portion of the &#x2013; cash management, which is frankly the equivalent of having the current account of a corporate very high quality deposit, it's very high quality deposit base. That is also seen, I think, about 55 basis points drag coming through. I think the picture is a little bit more mix there in terms of how we'll see continued volume growth and we are seeing very good volume growth, and maybe a little bit more compression to come in that. But I don't believe material. So, overall, I think it's pretty much baked in into the numbers you see at the moment.</p>
          <p>On the cost picture, again the picture is often more difficult because of the rates of differential investment going on into different aspects for the business. So hiring of people, we've hired very good people. And across the Wholesale Bank, we've hired certainly very strongly into financial markets. And within financial markets, clearly, we have a proportion of those individuals engaged in client flow trading.</p>
          <p>Investment in systems, clearly again, continued investment and improving of systems, because we are rolling out products into multiple geographies and increasing product set. So you'll see the growth in commodities income, that's as much driven by rolling an extended product range out into more geographies as a high level of ongoing investment.</p>
          <p>I don't want to cause a rift within the Group. The company as per the higher remuneration paid in aspects of the Financial Markets business, the Group that might be paid in but often called more boring parts of the business. But also the flexibility of our remuneration costs has improved and increased year-on-year. So what you now see in the Wholesale Bank and lot of it's driven by the growth in financial markets and corporate finance and global market activities, is the proportion of Wholesale Bank's remuneration that is now performance-related, it is 53%, that's up from 44% a year ago, which was 41% a year before that and 35% a year before that.</p>
          <p>What that tells you is that the variability of the cost according to income is also improving in that part of the business. So if you do or if we do see slowdown in that business, then actually we'll also see a commensurate fall in the underlying remuneration levels that we'll be paying and that's a significant part of the cost base in that business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon. Just two questions, one, specific focused on Middle East. Looking at &#x2013; just want to get flavor of the impairment outlook, obviously the 317 that was booked in Wholesale Banking was a big part of the 525 in terms of the impairment charge. A lot of that &#x2013; I wanted to know was that coming from the commerce and finance parts of the loan book, which seems to be the bulk of the Middle East and South Africa, so MESA Group? And also, I notice that you are expecting a significant recovery in UAE 2010, how much of that is already baked into your current assumptions?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a broader question just again about the shape of the Group, really comparing Consumer versus Wholesale? Now, in past couple of years, obviously, there has been a big migration into Wholesale. And there is quite a difference between I'd imagine the operational gearing and the timing of the benefits of operational gearing between Consumer and Wholesale. I mean, kind of hacking on to Ian's question, would you expect that, if flows stay relatively healthy you'll be enjoying quite a few of the benefits in terms of the operational gearing by allocating more to the Wholesale Banking side?</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. The &#x2013; at the pre-close, I was signaling that the wholesale loan impairment was going to turn out to anywhere between quite a wide range. I mean, yes we carry event risk, but if you remember I think I was signaling between 330 and 630 and a bit million dollars 330 to 630, it could possibly have been under 300. Essentially, what we're seeing here is a significant provision level against a number of local corporate exposures, yes, attaching to the segment you talked about the broad commerce arising in the Gulf.</p>
          <p>You can see the impact of that coming through both in the gross NPL increase, but also in the level of provisions &#x2013; specific provisions that we've taken. And I think you'll see that we have taken let's say a significant piece of the possible risk exposure there. So, I think, in commerce it's a large part of the MESA NPL and it's also a large part of the Group's increase in NPL.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the shape of the Group, I mean, we don't think there is a particular science to what the percentage of the Group should be in CB, Consumer Banking, and what percentage of the Group should be in Wholesale Banking. And I'm certainly not going to tell Mike Rees and the Wholesale Banking team to slow down to allow Consumer Banking to catch up. But we do see merit in having a balanced book. There is one of the things we've done over the last year is get the businesses working together much more than they've ever done before. And they're working together on a whole range of things be it payroll, the way they manage the balance sheet; Financial Markets is providing structured product for wealth management to sell client referrals into Private Banking and into Private Banking into Wholesale Banking. So the businesses are working together much more closely.</p>
          <p>In terms of the specific impact on operational gearing, I think it's difficult to give sort of very simple answer to that because it all depends which date of which business is changing. Actually, the operational gearing of consumer bank to an improvement in Wealth Management and Deposit income is very powerful, because essentially we've got the customers in Deposits already, we &#x2013; you simply end up making more or less money out of them. And in terms of Wealth Management the cost income ratio of Wealth Management business is actually very, very low. So there is quite a lot of operational gearing on that side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would actually attribute it below or around 20% as a cost income ratio to that Wealth Management business. So you'd see as income comes back it feeds very strongly through to the profit. More questions?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could be very simple. Why don't we just pass to one part of the room and then I promise to go to another part of the room.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Arturo de Frias from Evolution. Three questions as well, if I may. First of all, risk-weighted assets growth in Wholesale, the growth rate is 12% half on half. And I was looking at what loans are doing, and loans are pretty much flat. So it's not loans driven. I guess, most of it is PD migration or perhaps some of the risks taken in the markets operations. If you could please explain how PD migration is going, and what's your view regarding PD migration in the future, because I think that's going to be a very, very important topic for the banks?</p>
          <p>Second question on ALM profits. Given that your revenues from current accounts or deposits are down 400 million year-on-year, I'm a bit surprised by the fact that ALM profits are only growing 8% year-on-year. I mean, of course, it's a very substantial amount of contribution, but I would have expected in these very low short-term rates environment, ALM contribution going up substantially more than the 8%. So if you can comment why is that?</p>
          <p>And finally, retail impairment, I think in one of your closing remarks, Peter, you mentioned that you thought or you had impression that we have seen the worst in terms of retail impairments, which surprises me, because I mean there is a lot of leverage out there and the situation has deteriorated substantially in the next couple of years. We are coming from a massive increasing leverage in the last decade. I really would struggle to see that we have seen the worst in just 18 months, particularly on the retail side. So you can comment a bit more on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll pick up the retail impairment one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I'll give you the other view on ALM...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could firstly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On retail impairment, we actually have pretty good visibility in the loan impairment book because you see the whole flow through, right. And so as Richard said, we are anticipating at this point that Q3 loan impairment in our consumer book will be down than perhaps what we saw in Q2, i.e. about $300 million.</p>
          <p>Now, why are we comfortable talking about stabilization. And partly it's because what we actually see in our end numbers. But also you've got to look at the kind of book we've got. Over 80% of our consumer book is secured. Our mortgage &#x2013; ones book loans that are loan to value ratio of about 51%.</p>
          <p>So you've got a highly secured book, and the secured bit is highly secured. So I wouldn't disagree with your more general statements about consumers and consumer leverage. I just don't think they apply it to the kind of book that we had.</p>
          <p>And we've been very actively de-risking the consumer book since '07. And we paid a price for it, right, because the first thing that happens is you lose the good income &#x2013; the income &#x2013; not to say, good income but the income are on unsecured exposures. We lost market share in unsecured lending in India in '07 and '08 and we got a fair amount of flak for losing market share. But it would turn out to be actually quite a good thing to do in retrospect given the pressures on the unsecured market there. Richard, ALM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On ALM, first. I think the comparison you are drawing is not quite right when we clearly are seeing &#x2013; compression attachment to wealth management. But that's also a mixture of &#x2013; it's not just a positive income &#x2013; liability income, it's also a lower consumer appetite playing through two investment products, that's also a significant portion so, trying to compare the fall in wealth management income directly to the pick up in ALM isn't quite the right comparison.</p>
          <p>In ALM, what we have got has been the benefit of the ability to price steeply rising yield curves. ALM is actually up 40% on the second half number of last year, which I think gives you some sense for that opportunity. We've also flagged that clearly we're reinvesting in low yield instruments and those we are putting on in late third, early fourth quarter of last year. So your expected ALM share, it should be a broadly equivalent one that I think we're seeing in this year &#x2013; sorry, that we saw in last year in terms of first half versus second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry just to add to &#x2013; on ALM, we are not mixing anything to ALM opportunity. We could go further up the yield curve. We could invest in a different way, but part of our strategy has always been to keep the book very short, because we believe that the resilience of the balance sheet is worth sacrificing some income for. And so we won't be as aggressive on our ALM management as some might be and that's a very deliberate strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the ALM team have managed the book superbly. RWA growth in the Wholesale business, essentially what you have is RWA growth of 12%. PD migration is a substantial element of that. As set out on page 42 is a breakdown of the RWA from a Group perspective. And what you already see on credit risk RWA for the Wholesale Bank, we see increased risk-weighted assets of about $11 billion coming through the PD migration, offset by about five to $6 billion from lower EAD is essentially what's happening to the credit risk RWA.</p>
          <p>Wholesale is also seeing higher market risk RWA as we alluded to in our presentation and has also taken the &#x2013; actually it's taken pretty much all of the increase in operational risk capital and this is done on a weighted average three-year period attached into revenues. So what you'll see in Wholesale is substantial PD migration, offset by low exposure default, increased market risk RWA and higher allocation of operational risk. Going forward, you should &#x2013; so going forward, I would assume the same type of levels going forward as best as we can tell.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. It's Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities. Just a question on Consumer Bank income. Actually, I'm just trying to reconcile your comments Peter, that you've got rising quarterly trend in consumer income with one de-risking the book, which sort of suggests to me a little bit of a sort of headwind margin pressure and clearly the half on half numbers still showing income under pressure. So I just wonder if you could talk a bit more about where you're seeing that rising trend. And given the de-risking of the book just trying to get a flavor of the quarterly or at least the trends going forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A lot of de-risking of the book happened in '07, '08 in a sense. And so, you have the flow through impact of it, but we took a lot of the action as we saw the crisis unfolding rather than responding post-Lehman. The things that are providing us with a bit more momentum now would be mortgages. We're getting very good market share in new mortgage flows in markets like Hong Kong and Korea and good margins.</p>
          <p>And as I said in my remarks, we're also seeing a bit of an uptick in Wealth Management income, not to the levels that we had last year, but certainly better than the levels we've had in Q4 and in Q1 of this year. Ben, do you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take mortgage margins as an example, if you take Hong Kong, big business for us. We were doing 19% of that in new mortgages. We're HIBOR-based in terms of mortgage offering. If you look at prime-HIBOR, the spread has widened. We think that prime-HIBOR spread certainly stays through the rest of this period, and it is about 450 basis points spread at the moment, that allows us to price effectively new HIBOR mortgages and we're currently getting mortgage margins of over 100 basis points versus 46 basis points or so, six, nine months ago.</p>
          <p>We're seeing pickup in new business margins on mortgages in India over 300 basis points, in Korea over 300 basis points. And so actually in terms of the new business we're able to write, we are getting good margins on the new business and gaining share. So our share is up quite noticeably on our stock in Hong Kong, in Korea, in Singapore, and it fits strategy of moving to more secured level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, take another &#x2013; could you &#x2013; and pass it back to Robert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert Law from Nomura. Could &#x2013; I have just two areas, please. And firstly on the capital side, I'm intrigued by comments you've made about regulatory change et cetera. What I'm looking for is some kind of guidance as to the kinds of things that you can see in your pipeline on capital that perhaps we can't see at this point. So regulatory, you talked about PD migration. If these factors came in, what impact would that have on your capital base now? How much of the capital is &#x2013; that you raised will that use up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you want to get us two &#x2013; did you say -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second area is unrelated. It is on the leverage in the Consumer Bank. So you've, obviously, reduced the cost income ratio aggressively there in a period of weak revenue. Should we be thinking about that level of cost income ratio as being sustainable as revenue starts to pick up? What's your cost investment appetite? Could you explore that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the regulatory change point of view, I'm afraid to say I don't know how the whole debate about how bank capital should be regulated will play out. There is a lot of different actors in this game. And the interaction, of course, between the accountants and the regulators is also kind of intriguing. It just adds a level of uncertainty to how one manages a bank at this point.</p>
          <p>I think the bit that is very clear is that trading book capital for banks will undoubtedly increase. And if you take as a crude proxy for the drivers of trading book capital, the VaR, the banks run on their trading books that gives you a sense of how sensitive banks would be to those changes.</p>
          <p>We actually have a pretty low trading book VaR if you strip out the banking book VaR. And it isn't going to be nearly such a big issue for us as it will be for many other players. But I think that is one element of the capital debate where the direction of change is very clear. It's now the debate is much more about magnitude and mechanism. But there is a degree of uncertainty around capital and what the regulators will want around the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you raise that, can I ask you what is the size of your capital allocated to the trading book that you think might be subject to this regulatory change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's going to be a subset of the market risk capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at our market risk, RWA -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>43, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- to about 20 billion. Well, that's 17 billion, I think, is the market risk RWA. If you look at the trading graphs pickup on Peter's point, our trading largely fell in this first half period to $13.7 million. So if you took that as a comparative basis or relative basis to the other bank, you'd see that actually we carried very limited trading book risk, and that is partly reaction to &#x2013; we don't do much structured trading and that we tend to be very short tenor. So more vanilla and short tenor and that drives a low-bar trading book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, of course, the debate about capital isn't just about how much capital bank should hold for any particular activity. It's also about what type of capital. With Tier 2, obviously, somewhat falling, somewhat out of favor, and so &#x2013; and that debate has a little way to unfold as well.</p>
          <p>On the CB question, I think the way to answer the question and the trouble is with &#x2013; as with any ratio, which essentially is I am talking about cost income ratios, and as with any ratio, there are different moving parts. There is no doubt that we are taking a lot of steps to make the engine of CB much more productive than it has been in the past, and Steve and the team are driving for greater standardization and systems and processes, consolidation of call centers that Rich mentioned, standardization of products and that will deliver &#x2013; all else being equal, that will deliver greater productivity and a lower cost income ratio for any given mix of business, right.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we will continue to invest in the business. We are investing in relationship managers. We are opening new branches. We are improving our non-branch distribution channels. We are creating more these sort of bundled packages of products for customers. So we are investing in Consumer Banking. And then, of course, the other aspects of it, which will have an impact on the whole dynamics of cost income ratio is quite what happens to the wealth management and deposit side of the income stream, because as we've said that is quite partly geared to external factors essentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you cite, Peter, it isn't just about taking costs out of the existing operation. The more you move to a much more customer centric model, the ability to sell multiple products to the same customer does improve significantly your overall efficiency. So it's quite a radical change in the way that the whole Consumer Bank is being structured and that's a tremendous upside to shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-up to that, how far through this exercise in reconsidering the Consumer Bank do you think the management there is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a debate; we've discussed it before, isn't it John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a journey, and to say that we're at the beginning or in the middle or at the end, I think it's something that's going to keep evolving. But the important thing is that strategically we are moving to a much more customer centric model. The old model used to be very much a federation of different consumer banks. By putting all this together on the single platform, on a consistent platform, not only do you have greater scope for cost efficiencies and better service, but the ability by then segmenting the customers and understanding what their needs are, which is something Peter emphasized in his presentation, does give you the ability to both improve your income as well as your cost income ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But to &#x2013; I mean &#x2013; it's -- this is years not months, right. It takes time to move the entire machine in this kind of way. And certainly, our experience in the wholesale bank was that this is not something you achieve very quickly. You've got to change an awful lot of things about the way the business runs. Any more questions? So, middle and back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I just got two questions. One, just a point of detail on the numbers. On note four on page 58, on the other operating income note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's 391 million of gains on available-for-sales assets that you saw. I was just wondering if you could tell us where that fits throughout the year throughout the Group or it's been allocated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Get the second question first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have the second question first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And second question is clearly today with the placing, I think, more than most is really emphasizing the growth opportunity that you clearly see for Standard Chartered. So I was wondering if you could just share with us potentially your -- the three key areas that you're going to spend the &#xA3;1 billion on to grow the next $1 billion of revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll let you deal with the note or whatever it is and then I'll answer the question on the spending the billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was really hoping we get through one of these sessions about doing either note three or note four actually. But on note four, well, particularly note three. On note four, what's making up the $391 million is predominantly three aspects. One is it's a significant part of the $135 million of private equity realizations that are going through that line. And secondly, we have in there the benefit of realizations coming out of ALM and instruments holding treasury. So it's managing the funding profile.</p>
          <p>Peter said we hold short. I think this opportunity &#x2013; we've had opportunities to realize that a good gain here. So it's predominantly those three elements make up the 391. And the 168 comparative, there wasn't very much private &#x2013; of the private equity revenues in that period taken into that line, because they went through trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of how do we deploy the &#xA3;1 billion of equity capital we're raising today, I think, the first thing is that in a sense we'll deploy some of that in further strengthening our capital ratios. And as I said, we have &#x2013; in a sense we've been impressed by how powerful it is to have a distinctively strong balance sheet. And it's not just a banking core Tier 1 ratio. It's the combination of having a very good capital base, being extremely liquid, and having a demonstrably diversified asset portfolio and high quality asset portfolio. If you have all three of those, it's a very powerful way of attracting business. And so one deployment is simply to take our ratios up.</p>
          <p>A second way of deploying it is to enable us to support our clients, particularly in Asia, as they start moving to take advantage of the opportunities. What we are seeing is a shift in mood with Asian corporates knowing they can survive the crisis, and I am not talking about all of them, but the stronger ones knowing they can survive the crisis and turning their mind from weathering the crisis to turning it to their advantage.</p>
          <p>Now, it's not going to be smooth. There is going to be bumps along the way. We are doing this kind of in anticipation of this, but we can see it in our deal pipelines, the strength of our deal pipelines. We can see it in the conversations and having stolen, taken comparative advantage from our competitors over the last nine months or so, we don't want to give that up on the way up when the opportunities really start appearing. And so we want to have and we've got the liquidity, we want to be able to deploy capital and liquidity to support our clients as they take opportunities. And the precise balance of that will depend a little bit on having some folds in the macro economy having some folds in terms of the regulatory expectations and capital and so on, but those are the two main things.</p>

          <p>I was going to &#x2013; we may also deploy a bit of it and we've mentioned the ongoing discussions we are having in terms of small bolt-on acquisitions. But frankly, that isn't the driver of what we are doing here. These things are small enough that you wouldn't do an equity pricing to pay for these things and certainly we don't see that as the driver of the strategy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Maybe sort of slightly more presciently, I just want to ask a question on Wholesale Banking impairments and just really invite you to clarify the guidance because you said early alerts would maybe turn slightly better, but I wonder if you could tell us maybe which geographies and which areas you're seeing that, clearly, therefore it matters where we're seeing those improvements if they are coming in areas, which were already very low, impairment doesn't really matter. And my second question is on just the Principal Finance realizations. I am wondering if you could just tell us what the size of the book is there and what you would expect to be and maybe through the cycle return that we should be thinking about for that book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Richard, those two sound both like good questions for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On loan impairment, I think if you reconstruct that, but if you isolate the provisions and the gross NPLs in the Gulf for the moment, then actually supporting the comment around reducing early alert trends is actually the fact that the loan impairment in Wholesale Banking in all of our major markets has reduced in this first half over what we are seeing in the second half.</p>
          <p>If you look at the shape of the underlying provisions, there was the exposures in the Gulf. So then a very small, a handful or less than a handful of accounts where we were taking incremental provisions attaching effectively to, what I call, the echo of the KIKO issue on equivalent derivatives point. So that is a separate &#x2013; that was a separate theme.</p>
          <p>So -- and then if you think lastly about which particular geographies, look at the formation of gross NPLs, you'll see other APR has some, and that's predominantly Indonesia and Taiwan. But again, they are echoes of the previous factor.</p>
          <p>So in Indonesia, it's around predominantly derivatives and in Taiwan it's around DRAMs I think they are called on it, but microchips effectively. And we have seen relatively small increase in NPLs. India is up a little bit, so again the techstar sector and auto sector same theme as last year. But they are not moving at pace. So across the geographies, we'll not see outside the Gulf significant increased pace at all in NPL formation. We are seeing a step up to take the Gulf out, and it's a very different picture. You can't take the Gulf out, but isolate it in terms of the answer. So that was the first question.</p>
          <p>With regard to the private equity portfolio, we clearly have &#x2013; the size of portfolio now it's about 1.65 billion, and it stands somewhat above its invested costs still. So its fair value is somewhat above its invested cost. And we're certainly realizing it three times plus invested cash in to start realizations.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon Willis from NCB Stockbrokers. I've just two quick questions on the outlook for loan growth opportunities. Firstly, on the MESA region, it was one of the few regions that showed, what I would say -- what I call, noticeable loan growth compared to the end of December, and I just wonder what your frame of mind was as regards loan growth for that region over the next one to two years. And then secondly on Singapore whether loan growth was strong? I think it's up $6 billion against the end of last year, significant in the context of the Group overall, the net interest margin doubled and the impact on the revenue in that area was significant. Is it fair to characterize that is perhaps a short term, a shorter term opportunity taking advantage of little benefit in the next six to 12 months and then lessen over the subsequent year or two?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What if I give a sort of A answer, then you can add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing what I'll tell on Singapore is this is a business that has consistently grown in both consumer and in wholesale and taken market share from both international banks and local banks. If you look at the history of Singapore, we've consistently outperformed markets. It's one of our strongest franchises across the Group, whether or not we exactly replicate that amount of loan growth next year or in the next six months, I don't know. But I am very confident about the underlying momentum and strength of the franchise that we have in Singapore.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Middle East, we will be quite &#x2013; we are going to have balance two slightly conflicting objectives. We will be pretty cautious on credit because on both consumer side and the wholesale side credit quality has deteriorated in the Gulf. On the other hand, we do think that these are markets in which we have and can continue to make good money. So we will continuously -- investing and so deepening our clients &#x2013; deepening our client relationships, expanding our product capabilities, expanding our distributions, and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's good answer. What I would do in terms of the Gulf is I'd also just may emphasize where do we see growth. We are not seeing any significant growth. In fact we are seeing reduced exposures to on sectors such as commercial real estate. So if you look at our commercial real estate exposure it's about $600 million of which about 400 &#x2013; about 680 of which 400 million, I think, is in UAE at an LTV of 56% &#x2013; sorry, 59%.</p>
          <p>So we have very low exposures within that loan growth attaching to, I think, the area that sees most stress. In Singapore, the underlying factor and there is a broad spread of exposures. Because you have to remember that Singapore is a regional hub, headquarters hub for multiple businesses. So as you look down the exposures that <mark type="inaudible" /> Singapore domestic. Singapore is if you like an engine for broader Asian exposures and that's why we are seeing a very good &#x2013; where we see very good growth now.</p>
