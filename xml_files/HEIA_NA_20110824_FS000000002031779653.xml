        <plist>
          <p>I suppose I start by welcoming you, ladies and gentlemen, for our half-year results. Also for people who are following us through their webcast, a warm welcome as ever. I'm Jean with Ren&#xE9;. We're going to first present the highlights of the first half of 2011. We're going to take some time for the outlook &#x2013; I'm sure you're all interested in that &#x2013; and after the session that we will divide between Ren&#xE9; and myself, we will be glad to take your questions. Then I have to get the technical things right, and blink through to the first slide.</p>
          <p>We posted in the first half a solid performance. The good news is revenues went up 3.3% during the first half, and that is good news. And group beer volume increased in all the regions, which is quite extraordinary if we take into account that even in Western Europe, volumes were up, and that didn't happen for quite some time. Of course, these results reflect also the strength of our rebalanced portfolio towards more emerging market. The Heineken brands continued to outperform the rest of our portfolio, and our mix improved. On the other hand, our profits increased, both at EBIT level and as net profit beia level. And this went together with substantially increased planned-for marketing support. As these higher investments into marketing, we shifted the focus to accelerate our top-line growth.</p>
          <p>Of course we continue to dedicate attention to our footprint, and yet again during the first half we increased our footprint in the emerging markets, where demographic growth goes hand in hand with economic growth and political stability. We completed the Sona Breweries acquisition in Nigeria, mainly designated to increase our capacity footprint in that country. We have entered Ethiopia with the acquisitions of two state-owned breweries. We have again extended our capacities in South Africa. We added capacity in Vietnam. And finally, we opened a new brewery in Guangzhou, China, entirely dedicated to the production of Heineken beer and Tiger beer.</p>
          <p>Next to that, our cost and cash flow programs continue to deliver. As you can see from the chart, we posted again an &#x20AC;80 million TCM savings on the half year, and the free operating cash flow stands at &#x20AC;779 million, up 11% towards last year, so a very strong cash flow performance. We continued to make progress on our recently acquired breweries, and notably, we improved the profitability in Scottish &amp; Newcastle and also in FEMSA. Those are the highlights of the first half 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me now go to the next slide. As we told you in February, we would plan for higher marketing spend. The organic spend in the first half was 6%, up towards last year, and it goes into an array of initiatives. And I just want to highlight with you a few of the more important ones, where the money goes to. We have been launching a new Heineken global campaign around the theme "Open Your World." We have devoted a lot of energy, money, and time to the activation of the brand here in the UK, launching the campaign but also organizing the Heineken Cup and the Champions League, which the final was organized here in London, so we kind of painted the city in green for that weekend.</p>
          <p>We have announced a number of innovations ahead of the key summer selling period. We launched Strongbow cider in Italy. We have been launching Desperados, which is our tequila-based beer, in 10 new markets: Spain, Austria, Ireland, Croatia, Switzerland, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Bulgaria. We, typically, increased quite substantially our spendings in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Italy, and Nigeria. Those were the key markets where we concentrated on.</p>
          <p>And we continue to devote a lot of energy and spendings behind innovation, in view of what we announced already last year, that we want to double our innovation rate from 3% to 6% by 2020. Innovations in our industry are important to continue to attract and retain consumers. It targets not only the beer but also the near-beer segment, mixed drinks, and cider. It's a key driver for improving our mix, if you will. And in some cases, innovation is even reducing costs, like the introduction of the new model of Heineken bottle all across the world, code named K2. There's not only an innovation in it, per se, but it's also a cost-saving exercise.</p>
          <p>We had a lot of new innovation the first half, non-alcohol beer in Spain and Romania, just to name a few. We launched a line extension of Amstel &#x2013; Amstel Premium Pilsner in Russia and Greece. We launched a new PET soft dispensing DraughtKeg in the Netherlands with Amstel and Heineken. And we did a lot of flavor and line extensions in Central Europe, called Radler in number of countries, with high margins, high growth profile. So we developed &#x2013; just to give you a flavor of all &#x2013; where the money goes and what kind of initiatives we are taking.</p>
          <p>On the next slide is to talk to you a little bit about &#x2013; well, spending is one thing, but it's obviously the creative execution of how you spend the money that's going to make the difference. And we attached a lot of attention also &#x2013; you have to be talked about, be part of the conversation in what you do. That builds the reputation of a brand, is that you're talked about. And so in the execution, we devote a lot of, again, efforts to make sure that we stay top of the bill.</p>
          <p>We do that, of course &#x2013; and I put here some illustrations which more tie to the Heineken brand. You have to imagine we have 235 other brands to cater for, but obviously the bulk of the efforts go to the Heineken brand. We have been expanding the contract for the UEFA Champions League up to 2015. That's one important step we took in the first half of the year. As I told you earlier, our intention was to go from &#x2013; with the Heineken brand &#x2013; from a world brand to a global brand. We have been taking these steps, and we are there now.</p>
          <p>One has to realize, last year we were &#x2013; if the recipe is very much centralized and nobody can touch on the label &#x2013; that is always pretty centralized &#x2013; but the advertising in our world was pretty decentralized. Everybody could give it, around a central brief or an image, a little bit of its own tweak. But as a result, there's been lot of overspending and under-efficiency and not having the real image of being a global brand &#x2013; which we are, because we're sold in 179 countries. We were working with 27 agencies, just to give you a flavor of the cumbersomeness that it takes to drive such as brand. So we have been restructuring that quite a bit.</p>
          <p>We work now with three agencies, and we have been launching global campaigns around a theme of "Open Your World." They are expressed by two commercial. The one was "The Entrance," which you can see on YouTube, but we will share them at the end of my presentation here. Followed by another one called "The Date," which will be rolled out on classic media as from September. The "Open Your World" campaigns received five awards lately in the 2011 Cannes Lions international creativity festival. That's a testimony to the excellence of what we are doing.</p>
          <p>We invested also a lot in digital media. If you look at the Facebook page of Heineken, in the beer category, it's number one in the world by a big margin. And the good news is that number two is also brand of Heineken; that is Dos Equis. So &#x2013; and this is typical in the social media, where you're talked about and you're part of the conversation. Hence, again, the attention we devote to digital media. You have picked up that we entered into a global advertising agreement with Google relating to YouTube. So lots of initiatives also taken in the new media.</p>
          <p>At the same time, this &#x2013; our marketing excellence, brand expression excellence, exercising. At the same time, we work also on commercial capability building. I would just highlight amongst the many initiatives that we have on the ground, the one which concerns predominantly Europe and the off-trade, where we have set up a global key account management, we are perhaps the first brewer to do that in Europe. We have a global brand, Heineken, and we are in the process of setting up more global brands, like Desperados and also Strongbow cider. And it is very much to develop category leadership, which is building win-win situations and get out of the eternal vicious circle of only negotiating about the price conditions, that was in for both parties. And to do that on a pan-European basis. Now, this is up and running. We are now running for close to a year, and it starts to yield its first results.</p>
          <p>It expresses also in the supermarket in building the in-store theater. Category leadership is about being visible in the store and using the store as a display and a communication vehicle for your brands. Classically, most of the countries, if you look at the beer shelves, they are one of the most poor one you can find, as opposed to the wine shelves, which are much more &#x2013; now, if you look at that and without copying what other people are doing in cosmetics or wine, you have to find your own way originally to create a theater for your brand in the store. And that is where our people are concentrating themselves.</p>
          <p>Now this is just to give you a flavor, where is the money going, and the next page to show the results. Here, I show the results on Heineken. Every year, or every half year, we update you with what is the Heineken brand doing. Yet again, it is growing above the rest of the portfolio, making the point that despite the crisis or the muted consumer confidence, being in the premium segment and devoting a lot of attention in the premium segment is still the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>You see that in all geographies except Central and Eastern Europe, we have been living to that promise. Central and Eastern Europe, it's a little bit of a distorted view here. On the one hand, the overall portfolio volume went up 8.6%, a big increase because of the bounce-back of Russia. And on the other hand, Heineken minus 2.9%, which is entirely due to the lackluster performance of Greece, which has been very hardly hit by the unfolding economic crisis in the &#x2013; ongoing economic crisis in that country. So that gives a little bit of a distorted picture.</p>
          <p>But overall, we can say that the Heineken brand has been performing well, with stellar performance in a number of countries &#x2013; Vietnam, but also France in the mature market, Brazil, fantastic performance, Chile, Nigeria, China, Russia, UK, and Taiwan are &#x2013; certainly have been over this first half year the star performers. With lower volumes in Greece and still lower volumes in the U.S., but I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Result also is that we have been for five years in a row extending our leadership position in the international premium segment. We're twice as big as our immediate follower, being Corona, and our brand share stand at 20.6% of the segment at the end of 2010, and it's our intention to continue to gain share in that important segment, which frankly we helped to create but which we still want to lead going forward.</p>
          <p>The next slide is to show you that over the last years we have been devoting a lot of our business development activities towards creating platforms for growth in markets where economic development and demographic developments and the necessary political stability work hand in hand. Beer is a business which needs demographics. So that's a very simple statement, but you have also to invest there where it happens.</p>
          <p>Now, we have been rebalancing our portfolio quite a bit. It's a process which happened effectively over 10 years, but certainly after the acquisition of FEMSA we &#x2013; it kind of tilted the barrier over half. You see that at the end of the half 2011, 62% of our group beer volume comes from these emerging markets or growing markets, and 55% of our pro forma EBIT comes from there. Obviously, in these high-growth markets, we have a number of ventures where we consolidate only our part of the net profit, but we participate in fast-growing profit pools.</p>
          <p>So we're living up to that promise. Just to show you that the whole growth &#x2013; and 95% of the growth that we have in the first half came from this platform, just underlining the importance of our policy. Obviously, I will come back on the regional overlook, or more details about it.</p>
          <p>And the last point I'd like to highlight is the integration of FEMSA beer activities, as it is a recent acquisition &#x2013; I &#x2013; kind of go in a little bit. We are on track for delivering the cost synergies. They stand at &#x20AC;87 million out of the targeted &#x20AC;150 million over the two countries, so we are absolutely on track delivering the cost energies. If you look into where they are, in Mexico they are essentially in purchasing, administration, and head office. That is where &#x2013; not that much in brewing in Mexico, where it is well organized. And then also a big part comes from route-to-market optimization initiatives.</p>
          <p>In view to reduce the cost of distribution sales and warehousing, so we have been reviewing the whole direct-delivery system and reorganizing that and also cutting layers of command, making it a flatter organization. So a number of very key initiatives to be more cost efficient, that has led to the a personnel reduction of about 1,500 people over the last year, just to give you a glimpse of how extensive that is in that country. On the side of Brazil, the cost optimization is much more on the brewing side. Their best practices coming back from Heineken in the brewing are absolutely key to make lead way into cost synergies or improvement of our cost base.</p>
          <p>And when we talk, then, on the other side on the optimization, key initiatives which are there to boost revenues. Then, again, I split it into the two countries. In Mexico, we have been revising the price architecture. What we mean by that is to laddering the prices more in the market than they were before. Obviously the introduction of locally produced Heineken is not only what happened in the first half, and that was celebrated, and it's a new start.</p>
          <p>But also the coming of the Heineken gives the opportunity to price ladder the rest of your portfolio; brands like Indio have been slightly repositioned. Regional brands have been repositioned. It's to create more leeway in your stratification of prices. So far, the Mexican domestic portfolio was very much at the same kind of price level. So we have been extending the price levering. These effects, they play over a number of years, but it is very important to gradually do that.</p>
          <p>The essence of our brand portfolio is, on the one hand we have been retreating a number of brands out of their national positioning. Sol is clearly destined to be positioned in the south of Mexico. So we have been retreating from central or west. So that also leads to some market share losses, which are planned for, if you will. We'll redeploy &#x2013; we're not yet there, but we are in the process of redeploying a regional brand like Carta Blanca in the north. We see a high growth, and that on the back of a price repositioning of Dos Equis, which is growing quite nicely. And Dos Equis has been clearly positioned as a national brand, as well as Indio and the Heineken brand, and then finally, the Tecate brand, which has a regular variant and a light variant. You see clearly that the light variant is really taking a dominant role in that growing light segment in Mexico. It's really flying, growing double digits, coming from the north, but extending gradually, nationally on a credible basis. So that's how our portfolio is, broad line, kind of unfolding. There's still a lot of work ahead, but I feel we made a good progress over the last six months certainly.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, there we go for segment leadership. We have a distant number four or a weak number four position, if you consider our total position, with some regional strongholds. We use the Kaiser &#x2013; or Heineken do Brasil today &#x2013; production network, the strongholds, and the Coca-Cola distribution network and relationship entirely to boost the Heineken sales in the premium segment. We have been growing the brand nicely again, 50% year on year in the first half. So that policy is yielding. So that investment comes up from the profits we will make over time, but clearly our aim is to develop Heineken. And by total focus on the Heineken brand, we're getting traction on that, growing the Heineken brand in Brazil. That's where we concentrate on in Brazil.</p>
          <p>With that &#x2013; I gave you some highlights about how it's going in Mexico and Brazil, our most recent acquisition. I normally do a very extended tour across all our geographies. You have read that all in the press release; we give a lot of details country by country. You will see in the attachments of the presentation you have, in the back of it, some slides region by region. So I will only make some highlights region by region of the results, commenting on the figures you see here on the screen.</p>
          <p>As I told you earlier, Western Europe &#x2013; and we didn't witness that for quite a long time &#x2013; had a positive volume development. The off-trade performed quite well in Europe across Europe. The on-trade is still under pressure because of consumer confidence. The <mark type="ph" /> good control &#x2013; the (20:54) countries which yielded the most growth have been France, Italy, and Ireland, with some weaker performance coming out of the Netherlands. The strong profit growth obviously reflect the strong performance in the TCM programs. And Western Europe continues to be a strong cash flow generator for the Heineken Group. Obviously we benefited from a very nice start from weather conditions point of view in the first half and particularly in the first quarter. We will see it in the outlook that, of course, was eaten away again by a bad summer in July and August.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, the highlights are that the strong volume growth, two-thirds of that comes from Russia. So we bounced back quite nicely from last year, weak position. You will remember we increased the prices on the back of an excise duty increase, and we lost a lot of volume. We perhaps went too far. We had a lot of repair to do over second half of last year and first half of this year. We're coming back to a level close of where we were before; however, with a lesser mix than we were there, but at least on a scale and distribution-wise we are coming back and we are still making progress in Russia. Volumes in Poland, Romania, and Austria were also growing, and Greece was noticeably declining in the mid-teens for essentially economic reasons, and not for competitive reasons. And I would say the decline in profit in that region is entirely due to the lower price mix in Russia and Poland, and the declining sales in Greece explains the bulk of the decrease. All the others have been posting positive performance.</p>
          <p>When we turn to the Americas, I devote lot of attention to the FEMSA Group. Just to add to Mexico that if you take the sales, like for like, the first six months, so you take out all the consolidation, our sales grew by 0.8% in Mexico on a market which grew somewhere between 4% and 5%. So we lost market share in volume, a little bit less in value. And part of it was planned, and part of it is also due to intensified competitive activity, which we acknowledge. That is the performance of Mexico. Financially, the Mexican operation is performing noticeably better than the year before. So we're making, absolutely, progress in terms of margins and the financial contribution coming out of Mexico.</p>
          <p>I talked about the good performance of Brazil in terms of Heineken sales. The USA shipments were yet again under pressure, minus 4% &#x2013; where you look at the shipments over depletions is minus 4%, with the same pattern of decline in sales as the Dutch portfolio, but not totally compensated by the strong growth still essentially from Dos Equis in the United States. The other operations in the Caribbean, Central America, CCU, grew all their volumes and their profits, so they're doing fine, I would say.</p>
          <p>Then we turn to Africa and the Middle East &#x2013; a little bit less growth than you're used to see coming out of Africa. You can entirely attribute that to the performance of Egypt, which for, again, not a competitive situation, but a macro and economic and political situation, is suffering. The domestic market in Egypt is rebouncing quite well. It's still under pre-revolution level. But it's coming close to the pre-revolution level. It is essentially the tourist market which is still only driving at 50% of its old level, and that explains quite a gap in Egypt, as well as the devaluation of the naira, which explains <mark type="ph" /> in the profit via (25:13) also the difference, I would say, in the usual growth you see from Africa and Middle East and what we see now. I have to say that otherwise than these two factors, the underlying performance of our operation is extremely good.</p>
          <p>And now finally, ending with Asia Pacific. We maintained a strong growth momentum. We have three building blocks. We have our own export and licensing operations. Those are small pearls, but very profitable pearls, in Taiwan, Korea, which grew yet again. We could even halt our decline of sales of Heineken in Hong Kong. We bent that curve; that was good news. We have seen that after the catastrophe in Japan, sales of Heineken came back nicely. So out of our own operation, export, and licensing operation, we have only good news to tell. The same goes about APB, stellar performance &#x2013; or sterling performance coming from APB, with, again, good &#x2013; a particular mention to Vietnam despite the weakness of the dong. And of course, finally our position in India. UBL posted again a growth of volume of 11% over the first half, commanding a market share of 50%, growing and in great shape.</p>
          <p>As I told you earlier, we opened a new brewery in China, brand new, which is catered just to produce premium products. On the other hand, you might have noticed that APB, in a well-thought, strategic move, we have been bundling our mainstream positions and joint ventures. We sold our stake in Kingway as well as in the DaFuHao breweries recently in order to concentrate our strategy in China on segment leadership, based on brands Heineken and Tiger.</p>
          <p>Now, this closes our regional overview. I now go through the outlook that we released this morning. The outlook is basically to say that organically we expect the net profit to come out at the same level as last year. That caution on the backdrop of rather positive half-year result is motivated essentially by, first of all, weather conditions in Europe, which has dented quite the sales in Europe &#x2013; across Europe. Just have to look out of the window; July and August have not been particularly strong. That has an effect as we go into the second half.</p>
          <p>The second factor is obviously weakening consumer confidence. I think we would be stupid to ignore it. That is unfolding in parts of the world, in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the United States and in Europe. We have to reckon that it translates &#x2013; most of the time, our experience is that it translates &#x2013; or &#x2013; either in down trading or in sales in the on-trade, which are under pressure because people just go marginally less out, but that has a big effect on our industry. So we have to caution for that one.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, that we will not bend our plans sustaining the development of our brands. Those are long-haul efforts, and in view of that uncertainty that we face, and a bad summer, that is not going to be a reason to curtail in our marketing spending. We will continue the programs and roll them out because we go for market share and for additional top line on the medium and the long term.</p>
          <p>Now, these three factors together brought us to bring this guidance this morning. On the other side, we continue to say that in Sub-Saharan Africa, in Asia Pacific, and in Latin, America we will continue to benefit from a strong demand. So that stays well in place. I end by saying that we're happier to take the long view, and going over a bad summer and perhaps some weakening consumer confidence in some places, which we all have to cope with, what Heineken is building &#x2013; is working on &#x2013; it's building sustainable &#x2013; sustainable and <mark type="ph" /> the actual business (29:43) sustainable growth platforms.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to concentrate ourselves on increasing our exposure to higher-growth markets going forward, that you can expect us to do that with capital discipline, obviously. Now, our entrants in Nigeria and Ethiopia are just testimony to that. We will continue to leverage our leadership in Europe; I said it many times. Yes, Europe does not benefit from demographics, but it stays a huge profit pool for us, a huge cash flow generation, and we have to leverage that leadership top line but also on the cost-line basis, and we will continue to do that. We will roll out a new TCM planner from 2012. We have initiatives like Global Business Services going on, creating shared financial service center for the whole of Europe, the establishment of a buy-sell model for our purchasing activity, a better leverage of our IT infrastructure for the sales organizations. Those are all activities that we are deploying currently, and often the cost comes in front of the benefit. But leveraging our leadership in Europe is absolutely and continue to be high on our agenda on these two dimensions: investing in top-line growth, market share innovation, but also continuing reducing our cost base. There is still work to be done.</p>
          <p>The third pillar is obviously the Heineken brand. We will continue to dedicate a disproportionate effort to that brand, which brings us a disproportionate profitability to our company, and stay on course with that. By continue to focusing on that agenda, we remain absolutely confident that Heineken is in great shape to continue to grow in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I thank you for your attention. And before I hand over to Ren&#xE9;, who will give more details about our results, I will share with you a commercial. The commercial is one which we &#x2013; it's "The Date." It's going to be released on television, and as from September, you can see &#x2013; some of you might have seen it on YouTube. What one has to realize, the idea of global advertising came when we made in the Netherlands, the "Walking-Fridge." You remember the "Walking Fridge," which we showed you, and the thing went on YouTube, and it hit after two years, 8 million hits &#x2013; two years.</p>
          <p>When "The Entrance" was launched as a global campaign, we hit 4 million hits after four months. "The Date" has passed and crossed the 8 million hits in YouTube, just one and a half months after its release. So that's how fast it goes, but this measurement gives you also a confidence in the power of the campaigns that you are launching. Now you've got the latest one to see, so.</p>

          <p>If it was so easy like that, we would do more.</p>
          <p>But what I will do is take you as usual through the financials and give you a little bit more background. Before we go into the figures, I'd like to remind you that we made a few restatements to the 2010 figures. They have been restated as well on group level as on regional level to take into account three accounting changes. One is the new accounting policy on employee benefits regarding pensions. Secondly, we shifted &#x2013; we had the managerial transfer of the Mexican packaging business from the Americas into Head Office. And the third is the reallocation of some management costs from the regions to Head Office reflecting a different way of working, like we explained to you in February. In the press release, the financial impact of these changes and what the restatement has been, I explained in great detail.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we introduced a new metric, total consolidated volume. So next to total consolidated &#x2013; or to consolidated beer volume, we have total consolidated volume, which includes, next to beer, also cider, soft drinks, and other beverages, as long as they are produced by fully consolidated companies. But it also includes the third-party products, which we sell through our wholesale business. And finally, it includes the Heineken brands produced and sold under license by third parties. And by giving that metrics, we closed the gap between the volume development and the volume impact on revenues. As you will see, not completely, because there's a country mix in between, but we make it much better understandable.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the figures, I will dig into many of them, but let me just focus on the organic EBIT growth of 3.9%, &#x20AC;45 million, and that was driven by the growth in revenues, together with TCM savings on one hand and higher marketing costs on the other hand. But it is very much <mark type="ph" /> it starts (36:50) with the top line.</p>
          <p>If you look at that on a regional level, Western Europe and Africa were the big drivers of that organic EBIT growth. When you look here on the page later on, I will exclude that always, but when you look at the reported EBIT and net profit, they are obviously influenced by the shift in exceptional items, and they go from a net gain of &#x20AC;73 million last year, in the first half of the year, versus a net cost of &#x20AC;89 million this year. Last year, just to remind you, we had the sale of our businesses in Indonesia and New Caledonia to our joint venture partner APB, and that yielded a capital gain of &#x20AC;199 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the top line, revenues grew 11% to &#x20AC;8.4 billion. The net effect of new consolidations was &#x20AC;700 million or 9.3% of that, and that is by and large the effect of the first-time consolidation for the four months of the operations in Mexico and Brazil, which is then partly offset by sale of Waverley, our wholesale business in the UK, in the midst of last year and the deconsolidation of Multi Bintang and GBNC in the Asia Pacific regions.</p>
          <p>Currencies had an effect of &#x20AC;112 million negative on revenues; that's 1.5%. And that is mainly the Nigerian naira, which devaluated 8% in the first half of the year versus the euro. Organically, revenues increased 3.3%, benefiting from the higher volumes but also from a positive price-mix movement, and that was up 1.1% in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The effect of the higher volumes on revenues was 2.2%, and so as I said before, that doesn't compare exactly with the 2.7% growth in total consolidated volume. The difference is the strong growth we had in Russia, a market with a lower revenue per hectoliter, so that country mix has an influence on that.</p>
          <p>Looking at EBIT, as always, I focus on the beia numbers. So I take them before exceptional items and the amortization of brands and customer relations. EBIT beia increased 11% to &#x20AC;1.259 billion. And the net impact of the first-time consolidations accounted for &#x20AC;96 million or 8.4%. And again that's mostly Mexico, Brazil, a little bit offset by Indonesia and New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>The currencies had a negative impact of &#x20AC;20 million, 1.7%. And again, that was the naira, which took &#x2013; more than half of that &#x20AC;20 million was linked to the naira. So overall, 3.9% organic growth in EBIT, &#x20AC;45 million, driven by the volume growth in all regions; higher prices implemented in main or key markets like Nigeria, Mexico, the UK, France; mitigating the effect of higher input costs, although the effect in the first half was 0.5%, but still limited; increased sales of the Heineken brand and costs savings, predominately achieved in Europe, partly reinvested in higher marketing investments. Operating profits, without the associates and JVs, grew 10%, and our operating margin stayed stable at 13.8%.</p>
          <p>When we look at the EBIT from a geographical split, you see that here on the slide I would like to make a few remarks. First of all, if you would compare this table with a couple of years ago, you see very strong differences. The growth in Africa for many, many years now and the acquisitions in the Americas have significantly changed the balance between the regions and have reduced the weight of the more developed markets.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you see Asia Pacific here having a small contribution in the chart, and that's obviously the result of the fact that we accounted in the way we do joint ventures are not included in the consolidated figures, and we only take our equity share of net profit in the account. And as the biggest part of our business in Asia Pacific is exploited in JVs, APB, UB in India, you see that Asia is relatively unrepresented in this geographical chart.</p>
          <p>Second remark is that all regions generated positive organic EBIT growth. The exception is Central and Eastern Europe, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois explained. To a great extent, the effect of Greece, but also the input cost and price-mix degradation in Poland and Russia played a role there.</p>
          <p>And last thing, which is not in the geographical split but important to mention, is the EBIT at Head Office &#x2013; Head Office and elimination &#x2013; we lost a bucket. That EBIT decreased organically by &#x20AC;39 million, and that reflects the higher costs we are making on one hand on global marketing campaigns. So a big part there is invested in marketing, but it is also the cost, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois already said, behind initiatives like Global Business Services, where you have first to invest to get these things up and running before you reap the benefits.</p>
          <p>Looking at net profit, net profits grew also 11% to &#x20AC;694 million, and 5.7% of that is organic, obviously driven on one hand by the better operational performance, but also by a 30% organic decrease in interest expenses. And that was partly offset by an increase in the tax rate that has to do with a different country mix, but it has also to do with some incidental factors. Austria changed the tax law on the deductibility of interest costs, and that has yielded in an higher tax rate in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Currency fluctuations lowered the net profit by &#x20AC;9 million, and the first-time consolidations added &#x20AC;41 million or 6.5%. On an diluted basis, the EPS shows a different picture, obviously, than the net profit itself. EPS was decreasing by 1.7%, and that is due to the increased number of shares, which increased to 591 million in the first half of the year compared with the 527 million which we had in the same period last year. And I would like to elaborate a bit on the average share calculation, because there are quite some different estimates in the market <mark type="ph" /> that we have sent out in (45:19) consensus, and you see a wide range of calculations. And I think that has mainly to do with the treatment of the ASDI.</p>
          <p>So, once more, when we acquired the beer operations of FEMSA, we &#x2013; apart from issuing the 86 million shares, we committed to deliver another 29 million HNV shares, and that could be new or existing shares under the terms of the Allotted Share Delivery Instrument. Well, these shares are treated as new shares, so as of the 30th of April, 2010, these 29 million shares were increasing equity. But as we are repurchasing these shares on the market, gradually they will diminish that amount, and obviously that effect you'll have to wait according to the relative months.</p>
          <p>So if we go back to the table, you have to note two things. First of all, the additional 86 million shares which we issued are now fully incorporated in our shares. So they'll count for the full year, where last year they were only counting for eight months. And that brings the total issued shares up to 576 million. And on average in the first six months of this year, we still have to purchase 16.5 million shares under the ASDI agreement. So we delivered 12.5 million; we still had 16.5 million to be delivered. And as a result, the shares increased to 592 million in the first half of the year. Once the ASDI is gone and completed, our number of shares will be back to the 576 million. And for your information, since the end of the first half &#x2013; so after the 30th of June &#x2013; we bought another 4.5 million shares. That's &#x2013; so far for the EPS.</p>
          <p>Now go back to the two corporate programs. First of all, TCM, being in its last year, generated &#x20AC;82 million of cost savings in the first half of this year, and that brings the cumulative amount to &#x20AC;517 million, which is already ahead of the three-year contribution which we had in the Fit 2 Fight program, which yielded &#x20AC;459 million. You have to bear in mind, this &#x20AC;82 million is excluding the cost savings we make in the previous FEMSA businesses, so in Mexico and Brazil the &#x20AC;45 million cost savings are excluded from this TCM saving amount.</p>
          <p>On a functional level, you see that supply chain remains the largest contributor, &#x20AC;45 million coming from them, 55%. Less this time from brewery closures. We said we are ending the brewery closures. We have closed 47 breweries and maltries in the last 10 years. We are pretty close to the ideal footprint. But we still work on productivity, and we have savings there. And we work also increasingly on the logistic cost impact of these savings were made on that side. And for those who were in Zoeterwoude at the supply chain seminar or Investor Day around supply chain, probably this is not a surprise for you.</p>
          <p>When you look at the geographical split, Western Europe accounted for more than half, 56%, of the savings, and the lion's share was taken by Spain and the UK. In the category other, it's mainly the non-product related spend project. We started that in Western Europe. It has now been rolled out to Central and Eastern Europe, and that is continuing to create benefits for us.</p>
          <p>And also in the second half, we will generate additional savings. However, as we said in February, the total savings for this year will be below what we achieved last year, because that was an extraordinary spike with the &#x20AC;280 million. And as already, earlier also announced, we won't stop after this program. Cost savings &#x2013; working on cost efficiency is something which is ingrained in the company, but we keep the pressure on, and we will launch a new three-year program at the beginning of next year. We are now in the full preparation of that, but we will treat it in a similar way as this year. So we won't give you a target, but we will update you every half year.</p>
          <p>The other corporate program, Hunt for Cash, continues to deliver. Free operating cash flow was strong, with &#x20AC;779 million, up 11% compared with last year, almost double what it has been in 2009. The growth versus 2010 was driven by obviously the better operating result, the lower interest, partly offset by higher investments in CapEx &#x2013; we had the &#x20AC;63 million increase there &#x2013; and higher taxes.</p>
          <p>The good cash flow helped us to reduce further debt. Net debt is now below the &#x20AC;8 billion, and we have a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 times. That is certainly lower where we were a year ago at 2.6, but also where we were at year-end at 2.2 times. The cash conversion's slightly above 100%, and you know for the full year we are aiming at cash conversion around this 100%.</p>
          <p>We have also been busy renewing our financing facilities. We have renewed the five-year revolving credit facility of &#x20AC;2 billion with a syndicate of 17 banks, and that increases our flexibility in a big way. The capital structure is sound, and we have currently a headroom of &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize overall first half year &#x2013; solid results. Group volume increasing across all geographies. That is good news after two years of declining volumes. The Heineken brand shows very good development; continues to outperform the market, continues to outperform our overall portfolio. The top line grew organically, based on higher volumes but also price-mix development and is benefiting from the higher marketing spend.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver on our corporate programs, TCM and Hunt for Cash. In addition, we take important steps to leverage our skill, and we invest in the creation of a Global Business Services unit. We put money in that, and we are absolutely convinced that over time that will yield benefits, but clearly you have to put upfront the costs in. We gave as an expectation for the year that the organic net profit would be in line with last year. And probably the most important message is what Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was saying: We take the longer-term view. We continue to invest in brands in higher-margin categories and in innovation, because we think that is beneficial for our business.</p>
          <p>That is what I wanted to share with you. Before we go into Q&amp;A, you get of course a nice commercial. We will show you the commercial which supports our sponsorship of the Rugby World Cup, which will start in two weeks' time from now. And we obviously exploit that in many markets around the world. And this one of the commercials, which will underline or support it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Chris Pitcher from Redburn. Two questions, both relating to costs, really. It was well flagged that marketing expenditure was going to go up. It was well flagged that input costs were going to go up. But I suppose what surprised myself was within your cost disclosure was containment of other items, specifically items like other costs, which didn't fall as a percentage of sales. Also within that, it appears to be a &#x20AC;70 million incremental benefit from what looks to be a write-off of inventory. Could we get a bit more color on that?</p>
          <p>And then I suppose following on from the general cost containment, you've mentioned a new three-year cost savings program. You didn't give targets for TCM. Is it worth us even estimating the targets for this one? Because it feels like we're back to the old European model, where cost savings are absorbed by pricing, not recouping cost of inflation, particularly COGS, incremental marketing, and just more competition. It feels like we're back into remedial cost savings to protect profit rather than cost savings to actually create shareholder value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be very clear. The best way to create shareholder value is to grow your business. And so, yes, we have in a number of years been very much focused on cost and cash given the economic situation in the world, but also the situation and the leverage situation of the company. But ultimately you have to win in the marketplace. You have to invest in your brands, you have to invest behind higher-margin categories, you have to invest in innovation. But you are facilitated by doing that because cost savings &#x2013; so that doesn't mean that you don't have to work on the costs. On the contrary, you have to work very hard on the costs to enable you to do that and grow ultimately your top line. That is, longer term, the strategy you will do. And you see that when you look at the cost savings in this first half. They're bigger than what you reinvest in the market, but a part of it is reinvested in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the best way to think about &#x2013; and specifically your three European region, so Western, Central Europe, as effectively flat margin as reinvestment &#x2013; any cost savings is fully reinvested? And until we get a return to volume growth, proper volume growth, that it's unrealistic to expect any sort of expansion in the margin beyond here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a bit speculative to say where it ultimately will end up. But what you will see in Western Europe, if you focus on that, is that you will still have that margin improvement in the sense that you sell more higher-priced products, more higher-priced packages, and more higher-priced propositions. The fact that we expand our premium portfolio with offerings like Desperados and Strongbow, that is clearly a sign that we see that within markets which are volume-wise pretty stable, to say it at best, that on a value basis you can still create value, and that will ultimately also reflect in the margins you are making.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a pretty dynamic &#x2013; I think it's a pretty dynamic model. You cannot look at &#x2013; it's clear &#x2013; certainly with Fit 2 Fight and part of TCM, we had the period in Europe where we were kind of having commercial practices increasing slightly our prices, being able to do pricing, and then improving the margins by cost cutting. That worked quite well for us, right?</p>
          <p>At a certain point in time, you will notice that your market share is at best stable and even eroding. There is a limit to what you can do. You cannot stay put in the competitive game. You have to &#x2013; and that means that you have also to invest in your brands. And that is the dynamic component of it. You cannot model-ize it exactly; let alone that we exactly know that. So it's a thing that you plant your seed, and then you will &#x2013; that is how it works. And therefore, it is difficult to model-ize. So every initiative has its business model. You know where you want to go. You know where the milestones are when you make top-line investments. But the outcome is not as secure as the ones when you do a cost-cutting program.</p>
          <p>Now, that having been said, for Europe remains top, left, and center, the cost improvement programs. We think that if you take your attention from that, you will go indeed backwards again. So it is very important that our organization stay tuned on further improvements, as as Ren&#xE9; said, it's perhaps a bit less <mark type="ph" /> in very spectacular (1:00:57) footprint of our brewery network, but we still have a lot to do. The way IT and infrastructure is used in the group financial shared services, the purchasing organization. You have a lot of areas to do the further restructuring of our wholesale division. We still have a lot of things to work with and which will feed the next program in order to make sure that we have the ammunition to develop our top-line growth. What tangentially we're saying is if we want to leverage further our leadership in Europe, you will have in the coming period to invest eventually a little bit more in the top line, and that means if you always have these costs in advance of the revenues, that's what you have to accept. And it's not entirely sure that you will get there, but that risk is worthwhile taking.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And could I just clarify on the inventory movements within your cost disclosure, it was a, from memory, about a &#x20AC;30 million benefit in the previous half and about a &#x20AC;100 million benefit this half. Could you just explain what's going on within that inventory movement, which benefited your cost item by more than your organic EBIT growth?</p>

          <p>Yeah, hello. It's Andrew Holland here from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Just a question on your definition of organic net profit growth. I think I'm right in thinking that you're going to include eight months of FEMSA in that comparison, comparing it with the same eight months in the prior year. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that include currency movements? How are you handling those? Is that a constant currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so what &#x2013; it excludes first-time consolidations, so in 2011 that will be the four months of FEMSA, that will be the Sona, that will be the Ethiopian breweries, and it excludes the effect of currencies. And it excludes exceptional items, obviously.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrea Pistacchi from Citigroup. Couple of question on Mexico, please. On your intended sort of market share losses, and let's say where you're retrenching regionally with some of your brands, so how long should we expect that to last for? And then on your non-intentional market share losses, could you give a bit more color on that, where it's occurring and what you're doing to fight back, if you are? And then finally, on the pricing environment in Mexico, is it &#x2013; your sales on Modelo at Q1 pointed to an improving pricing environment. Is that still the case even in the light of probably slightly intensified competition that you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's difficult &#x2013; this is a very tricky question, the first one, of the unintended and the intended market share retreat, because it's also &#x2013; I mean, competitive questions, okay? Let alone, to be honest, you cannot exactly say what is the part of intentional. You can approach it, obviously, and you can &#x2013; there are two phenomenons. There is &#x2013; one, where we retreat is in central western Mexico with Sol brand, right? And we try also to reprice a number of our propositions in that region. The second thing &#x2013; and that is the competitive &#x2013; it's the intensification of the competition in northern Mexico, with Modelo and introducing Pac&#xED;fico Light. That is kind of public knowledge. And what will our response be to that when we will give it an appropriate response.</p>
          <p>I will say that the second part is the competitive game, if you will. And you observe that indeed there has been a price increase, and competition is dealing back a little bit more than we do. That has a &#x2013; and it's always a price-value equation. We have to balance that, all right? That is what we try to do. And I would leave it at that, because the rest starts to be a &#x2013; I would guess a little bit of the competitive game between the two of us, as you can imagine.</p>
          <p>Your second question was a &#x2013; yeah, I know. That profited both.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Matthew Webb from JPMorgan. Three questions, please. Firstly, on your marketing plans, my understanding when you talked about your intention to spend more on marketing this year was that Europe was quite a big part of that. But looking at the market, you've identified in the first half it doesn't looks as if Europe's been a big part of that. And then looking at your plans to spend more in the second half, it's obviously a much more modest step up. So has there been any change in how you see the opportunities in Europe, I guess particularly given the weak trading in July and August? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then the second question, on the UK cider market, obviously your volumes are down quite sharply. Is that all about market share loss, or has there been a deterioration in the category there as well?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I just wonder whether you're willing to disclose a <mark type="ph" /> Dutch (1:07:29) volumes number for the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the regional marketing spend, yes, we give some kind of &#x2013; it's more coloring than we can explain what exactly we're doing in which market. We gave you 10 markets in which we introduced Desperados. There, clearly, you are in the investment mode. The encouraging news is that that is growing double digits. So that is yielding quite well.</p>
          <p>We launched cider in Italy, second initiative. We're not going to tell you how much we spend behind the cider. Early takeoff is good, but we know that that's going to be a long-haul thing. Those are all initiatives in Europe. I alluded to all the Radler line extensions. This is very popular beer and soft drinks kind of mix, if you will, that is popular in Austria. We're exporting that concept to countries like Poland, like Slovakia, like Hungary, and Croatia &#x2013; out of my head. And those are line extension, premium-price positioned, with existing brands. Those are not spectacularly big volumes, but they are nice additional volumes that you build up at higher margins.</p>
          <p>Again, you have to sustain that innovation by introducing it, of course at some cost. So we have a number of these initiatives, which we deploy in Europe. I've spoken about the renewed efforts behind the Heineken brand here in the UK or the rejuvenation of the Foster brand. If you have seen, we have launched Foster Gold. We've done a new range of glasswork, of bottle design, of a lot of things. That is what I mean by marketing investment.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I've mentioned that there are a number of key emerging countries, where we also step up in our marketing spend. And I mentioned Brazil, I mentioned Mexico, I mentioned Nigeria, and we mentioned the U.S., because now in the U.S. we have the global campaigns. Remember, in the U.S. we were lacking having the right campaign. Campaigns you saw there on the screen up there are the right campaigns, so we put also money behind campaign. Thing &#x2013; very simple, campaigns you're launching on YouTube, you see what they do, and if they're good, you can measure that. That is giving you the early sign.</p>
          <p>The number of people you reach is of course by far less than when you go on classic media. Classic media and new media, they work hand in hand together. And then when you feel that there is traction in a geography, you start to step up your classic media, which is kind of a multiplication of what you have done online. Then you go, if you will, offline and you multiply. And the U.S. is in need of continuing investing behind the Heineken brand.</p>
          <p>So it is &#x2013; we operate 70 countries with brand portfolios. So we do more in some countries than other, but eventually the organization has been geared much more towards building its top line growth. There is no one single country you can come back home to Amsterdam and saying, "I'm doing nothing," all right? To fund it, it's not only because you're going to fund additional, the 6% organic growth, it's also how you are going to use the money that you were already. This is additional, but it's also to revise what do I do with the money I've spent, because those are huge amounts, when you spent 15% of your revenue in A&amp;P. You can do a lot with that. So it's not only the additional spending, but also how you spend.</p>
          <p>So that is a little bit what's going on in our company. But on net, we spent a bit more than we were spending because we think it is the moment now to drive our top line. I hope that is clarifying on the marketing spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. And it's right &#x2013; it looks like a lot of the work you're doing on marketing in Europe is not particularly around the Heineken brand. So when you talk about Heineken brand, the emphasis is on ex Europe, but actually there's a lot of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:27)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're correct. You're absolutely correct. The Heineken brand is Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria. That's more about the Heineken brand. Here it's more about our national portfolios &#x2013; also Heineken brand, but typically more the other brands. Absolutely correct.</p>
          <p>Your second question was about the cider. It's essentially market share. The &#x2013; I think, Ren&#xE9;, we have the exact number somewhere on the little table, but I don't know if you share them.</p>

          <p>It's influenced by the discontinuation of Strongbow Black, which is 7.5% cider, which we have taken off the market based on responsibility.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one. Secondly, we have the difficult comparison with last year, where we were in the activation around the World Cup by the retailers. Obviously Strongbow was the cider to do it with, so that is a difficult comparison, but as Jean is saying, we have lost some share because of this, but also -</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; because of increased competitive activities. Artois is launched. On one hand, it costs you some volume. On the other hand, that shows that cider is an active and attractive market. And ultimately we believe that all these activities will keep the cider market healthy and growing. So, yes, we lost some shares, but we are still very optimistic and then strong on our position in the cider market, because we are by far the market leader in that market.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>I'm sure that's right, but right at the moment, do you think that Artois's entrance is actually growing the market right now, or not?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This &#x2013; given activity in the market, you see that the cider market is not growing at the moment, like the total UK beer market is. First half was 7.5% or 7% down. Cider market is behaving quite well, but not growing. But we think that all these activities and what companies put in the market will keep the segment very healthy.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thinking back even to Fit 2 Fight, the personnel expense line has been one where you've been very successful at containing costs, really since '05, '06, that period. It's risen at a CAGR that's been slower, really, than your overall cost base. But at the same time, you've been shutting a lot of breweries. You said that you're done shutting breweries, at least for a while. Can this &#x2013; looking forward to the next cost saving program, if you aren't shutting breweries any longer, can you have cost savings programs that are at the same kind of scale that you've had in the past, if you're not shutting down facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are pointing out, of course, to <mark type="ph" /> having a guidance of (1:15:22) a number of people, and that &#x2013; again, we cannot give that. But think about it this way. When you establish a shared service center somewhere, for serving the European Union, you will of course in principle first build your tower with additional people in a location, and after that you will start to gradually dismantle country by country. A big part of your administration in these countries. Well, net, after a program of three to four years, you will have yielded quite substantial savings. Those are people savings, obviously.</p>
          <p>That is yet to come. When we reorganize our distribution by shutting down fixed warehouses and going more to cross-stocking practices, et cetera, this entails productivity &#x2013; i.e., again, people, right? When we go into IT system automation of sales process, it's again about people.</p>
          <p>So I think you have to think that, yes, what comes further is perhaps less easy to grab than counting a number of breweries on the map, but still will entail some personnel reduction, I'm afraid. That is part of the program, but it's not only that. You have a lot of costs which are not directly related to people but to what the people use doing their job. And on that one we want to concentrate a lot of energy also. And that is how we look at the cost savings programs going forward.</p>
          <p>Productivity improvement remains high on the agenda. That also entails people, but it is less brutal and more gradual, if you will, than what we have done in Europe in the past with the brewery footprint, but there are other areas where we have yet to go.</p>

          <p>Just on the share count issue, thinking ahead to 2012, what number should we be thinking of? Should we be thinking of the &#x2013; I'm sorry, 576 million, was it, or -</p>

          <p>Hi. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, a question about the capital spending that you referred to of &#x20AC;800 million for 2011. Can you apportion it to developed markets for new capacity, new builds, versus the maintenance capital spending, and then possibly whether there's some component going to the Global Business Services?</p>

          <p>&#x2013; in Africa. There is a part in the Americas, but it is certainly going into expanding capacity <mark type="ph" /> and use. (1:19:10) It's not only capacity, it's also, for instance, returnable packaging materials. So if you look at the development of the market in Nigeria, and there we invest in a big time in returnable packaging. And so we are constraining very much in the developed markets, and you will see that you have a cash conversion in these markets far above the 100%. And obviously in the developing markets or the emerging markets, you have a cash conversion lower than 100%, and that is because they are the investing markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful. And Ren&#xE9;, any efforts to refinance the debt, which now as of the six months has an interest rate at 5.5%? Are you able to bring that down at all through refinancing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will bring that down over time. We have locked in &#x2013; we have always 75% of the rates fixed. When they move out or the swaps end, you renew them. Obviously you do that at much lower rates. And if you have seen already during the last 1.5 years, you see every half year that the rate is going down. And obviously looking at today's rates, you could go much further. But we are locked in for certain periods. But over time, that gets better and better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Last question, excise tax around the world, any particularly disruptive, Russian-like movements? And in India, do you have any <mark type="ph" /> reach for (1:20:54) regulatory reform that might help grow that volume faster than the 13% that you reported? Off of such a low per-cap base, it might grow quite sharply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would be very cautious about India, as I'm not familiar to Indian Parliament and the politics going on in Indian Parliament. It's a long way, and I think we will see for still a long way some discrepancies between states. That is an issue that gradually will improve. But it will take quite a number of years, I'm afraid.</p>
          <p>On the other parts of the world, I think it's always something which is hanging above us. And so, we dedicate a lot of attention or efforts as Heineken being, but also in the framework of, here in Europe, the Brewers of Europe association to point out to governments that raising the excise duty has the limit of killing the goose that lays the golden egg. So we are very mindful of that.</p>
          <p>But of course you can never avoid situations like Russia. And Russia still plans to go ahead with its excise duty increase in the future, though we dedicate a lot of attention to try to contain it. Here in Europe, you have in a number of countries also such a pressure. It is unavoidable with government budgets, and the pressure, it is of course unavoidable.</p>
          <p>So we once more dedicate our efforts explaining, Thomas, that you might come into a negative spiral also for the state treasury. Some governments hear it. We have had a deal leading to an excise duty decrease with Ireland, which is quite amazing, and it worked quite well. And for the budget of Ireland and also for the pub industry and the brewing industry. It is the reverse situation, I'm afraid, in Greece. And to no avail we tried to limit it. So that's at both ends of the spectrum, but I would say that broadly in Europe the situation remains okay, if I can use that word.</p>

          <p>Hi, there, Jamie Norman from SocGen [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale]. Firstly, you're probably going to say it's too early to say, but I'll have a go, on thoughts on input costs looking out to next year, with the harvest in Western Europe perhaps informing your view?</p>
          <p>Second, related to that, do you think &#x2013; looking out to next year &#x2013; that you will be able to rely less on price as a way of mitigating the input cost pressures?</p>
          <p>The third question is rather longer term is, again, I think, applying to Western Europe, you're talking about a channel shift away from the on-trade into the off-trade. Just to give us a sense of what sort of drag that might act on margin, because clearly you're talking about selling prices and more powerful buying groups, but on the other hand you've got sort of bigger drops and perhaps less expensive customers to service. So how does that kind of net out?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll leave the on and off-trade to my Commercial Director, and as the Finance Director, I will take the input -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> It's the margins &#x2013; (1:28:30)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:24:37) Come on. I think we're on the same page here. The input costs, it's a bit early days to say. Of course we have an idea of where it could land, but typically we are speaking now about the end of harvest and putting into the silos and people forming their ideas about expectations into grain markets. And you have seen quite some spikes.</p>
          <p>So, it's a little bit &#x2013; you have a long-term perspective, long-term pressure on the prices of the agricultural commodities; you all know about that. And so resorting to the pricing is something that we have to continue to be disciplined about, because we expect that the inflationary pressure on agricultural commodities remains present. Then you have all the blips, which are due to speculation and harvest, which is a big part of that, and that you don't have in your hands.</p>
          <p>So it's a bit early days to depict what the effect on 2012 will be from harvest 2011. I can tell you it will be a higher increase than harvest 2010, that's for sure. To what extent it will be &#x2013; early days to say. I think everybody abstains to give such a comment. And our ability to price it in is going depend from commercial relations, and that is also depending from country to country, from the price level you start with, your negotiation, power, the power of your brands, all these kind of things.</p>
          <p>If we look back in our own kind of history, we are faced with commodity price increases now for a number of years. And I would dare to say that we have so far succeeded in pricing that in gradually. The timing is not always something which is happy. Short timing leads to volume decline. Long timing leads to margin pressure. But <mark type="ph" /> eventually (1:26:19) one has to be disciplined about pricing it in. That is how far I can go about the input cost. And then I'll leave it to Ren&#xE9; for the on- and the off-trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you see the shift from on to off. That has two effects for us. One is on market share. In most markets, we have a higher market share in the on-trade than in the off-trade. Has to do that there are no private labels, et cetera, in the on-trade, obviously. So that shift hits you in your market share. Hence, all the activities we do to exploit our position in the off-trade better and getting central customer management &#x2013; customer management, account management on a European level, these kinds of activities to increase your share to make up for that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, your question was on the financials. That differs a bit country by country. But overall when you look at ABC costing, the profitability of a hectoliter in on-premise and off-premise, it's pretty similar. But the buildup is completely different, and you see that in the on-premise; you have much higher gross margin, but much higher fixed cost.</p>
          <p>So when that markets decline you need to adjust your fixed costs to make sure that you keep with the same margin. And that is what we are &#x2013; ongoing are doing in the restructuring, as well in our wholesale business as in the on-premise parts of our business, to look at the cost. But you have to adjust your fixed cost base to make sure that you keep the same margins as you would make in the off-premise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the cost of doing business in the on-trade is obviously much higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a huge investment base that you have to &#x2013; and contrary to brewing, the productivity is not in your hands. It's in the hands of the consumers. So that makes it difficult. And in that equation, it's very difficult to stay ahead of the curve of the investment. These invest from a declining on-trade in advance of the decline &#x2013; it's not going to work. So you're always working behind the facts. So it's very, very difficult. So you have to stay really close to the wind when you do that. And that is the challenge we have in Europe. And as these on-trade sales have never stopped declining for now a number of years, we have a number of people which are on these ships and really sailing very close to the wind. It's hard work. But it's still worthwhile doing it, obviously, because you can do a lot more brand-building in the on-trade than you can do in the off-trade.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian Shackleton, Nomura. When we think about the second half, I mean, your guidance obviously leads us to think about your net profit organic beia being down 5% or more, so a dramatic reversal on the first half. First question, are there other factors we need to bear in mind other than the weak July and August that you flagged?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if there isn't, clearly July and August were very weak. I don't know whether you can help us as to how weak. And then within that, are you able at this stage to segment out the weather effect from the consumer confidence effect you talked about? And presumably there still is a bit of World Cup in the July comp as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit of all three. It's rather difficult to figure out. We &#x2013; with talking to our operation that the weather effect for July has been a very big one, and a bit of one day sales less and then you have the comparison with the World Cup last year and these kind of things. But the weather effect has certainly being the big shortfall here. One has to realize, our European business has a high cost base obviously, but these summer hectoliters have a very high yield. That is what you also have to see.</p>
          <p>So they bring in a lot of profits when you have regular and even a better summer. So this is what we have to cope with. And going on in August, at least the first half of August was not very <mark type="ph" /> brilliant either. (1:30:41) So that is where we come from. Difficult to quantify what consumer confidence is, except that you measure the on-trade frequentation, how the on-trade is developing, and you'll see signs &#x2013; a little bit what happened back in the crisis with 2008 people reacting or not.</p>
          <p>You know, this is not dramatic. People stay away, shy away from going out one time, and they go out one time instead of two times, these kinds of things. In one's life it's not a big change, but for an industry, it starts to be annoying. See what I mean? That is what you see going on. So we'd like, kind of, to be cautious on that. We're in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:31:20) kind of period, so that is what motivates us going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, when you talk about Europe, that is Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe &#x2013; it's the two together we're talking about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my first question &#x2013; are there any other major factors we need to bear in mind for the second half that changed really from the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly higher input costs also play a role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly higher input costs play also a role in the second half. That also plays a role into the margin development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And slightly higher investments. We are ramping up for this Global Business Services; was already a part in the first half, but you will get that much bigger in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost comes in front of the benefit, but abandoning that project does not make a lot of sense, so we continue.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, on the contrary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have to take that hurdle, and therefore we go in &#x2013; the same goes with all these new product launches. You cannot shy away halfway. I mean, starting to do profit protection now in the second half would be absolutely the wrong thing to do. Now, if you put all that together, that is justifying our outlook.</p>
          <p>We have one here and then one from the, you want first one from the &#x2013; no from the floor? Still one from the floor and then one from the Net.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Adam Spielman [Citigroup] here. Can I come back to FEMSA, please? And relative to your original projections, can you say in Mexico whether both in terms of EBIT beia and in terms of a top line, where we are relative to your projections you had as you acquired it? And also [indiscernible] (1:33:10) to say the same thing for Brazil as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Normally we wouldn't disclose where our model was and where the reality is; that you well understand. I would say the &#x2013; we're &#x2013; in our costs savings, I think we're well on track. We are rather in the fast gear than in the low gear. Pricing has been in the &#x2013; Mexico so far good. So that had a good and positive impact on the revenues, if you will. The volumes, they are what they are. We reckon that the market is still, as a total market, in the ballpark growth rate of where our business model &#x2013; original business model was. So there we don't have on the Mexican market, and despite the whole security problems that we encounter in the north, and which are really serious problems. But overall the market is at growth rates which were expecting in our business model.</p>
          <p>So overall, I would say that the acquisition in Mexico is responding pretty well to our plans, all right? It never pans out exactly as you plan, but overall it goes pretty well. In Brazil, I would say the same thing. We have to invest a little bit more, but the growth of the Heineken brand is well ahead of our expectation. So it's worthwhile continuing doing that, so it's going in the right way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I ask a follow-up question? You said that there were signs in the European Union of consumer confidence just affecting the on-off split. Is there anywhere else in the world where demand might be weakening, or perhaps even strengthening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The U.S., I think. It is the developed world, it's the U.S., is there where you have high public indebtment and &#x2013; leading to uncertainties as to where unemployment and taxation levels and what have you is going. There is where you have risk, obviously. We see that in large parts of the so-called emerging world. Things are going still &#x2013; India is still going ahead. The large part of Asia or the developing part of Asia, where we are, read Indochinese Peninsula and Indonesia, and this is all going well. Sub-Saharan Africa is still thriving. So this is all going really well, and we don't see signs of their lack of consumer confidence, if you will.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from the web.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have two questions from the conference. The first question comes from Gerard Rijk from ING.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. First on the business servicing costs, I understand that they will continue to be on a high level in second half. What is the cost of the whole program, and for how many years will it continue on this level? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the Americas, on the operating profit beia. There was an increase of &#x20AC;60 million from first half of '10 to first half '11. If I look to the synergies, which were &#x20AC;45 million, the consolidation around &#x20AC;80 million, currencies minus, <mark type="ph" /> let's say, &#x20AC;5 million. Then if qdet increased by &#x20AC;124 million (1:36:40) there is a gap of around &#x20AC;60 million. Can you quantify or specify what happens in which countries we see this negative.</p>
          <p>Then final question on the personnel costs. They were up around 16%, while the sales were up by around 11%. Can you elaborate what's happening here, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to start with the last one, personnel costs, that is very much the first-time consolidation of FEMSA. As you can see in the press release, organically personnel costs were down. FEMSA is heavy on personnel costs, not because they're inefficient, but they have indirect routes to market. They deliver 300,000 outlets themselves. So there's a huge component of personnel cost in that business, and so that makes the personnel cost as a percentage of revenue pushes that upwards when you look at the new consolidated business.</p>
          <p>I couldn't follow your reasoning on the Americas. I would suggest that you take that offline with the IR department to work that out.</p>
          <p>And if you look, then, at the Global Business Services in the first half, Head Office was up &#x20AC;39 million. That is partly marketing; that is partly infrastructure, Global Business Services almost a half-half split. But you will see that the ramp-up of Global Business Services will be more prominent in the second half. We don't disclose the total budget for the full program. It's also difficult to make clear exactly what is the program and what is renewal from existing IT system, which anyway you'll have to do. But it is a big program. The idea is that mid next year, the first op costs are rolled in first in the financial shared services, later on in the <mark type="ph" /> GPCo (1:39:18) company. That is an ambitious target, but that is where we are working on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Concerning the Americas, profitability in U.S. was down. Was it only due to marketing costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in the U.S., we had also a decline in volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you have -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Declining volumes, increasing marketing costs, we have in the region. So Mexico doing very well, and Brazil investments in marketing, CCU slightly down. So I don't know exactly where your calculation was coming from, but once more I suggest that you take that offline after the conference.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Carlos Laboy at Credit Suisse.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carlos.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It looks to us like you may have lost about 200 basis points of market share in Mexico in the first half. Is this consistent with your insights? And someone asked earlier &#x2013; I'm not sure I understood the answer &#x2013; when do you expect this share slippage in Mexico to come to an end or even reverse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 200 basis points in volume are more or less in line with our observation, so you have good informations. In terms of value, I would, though, say that it corresponds to 100 basis points, which frankly for now we can live with. Now, for our response, Carlos, you will understand that I will not start to go in details of how we &#x2013; going to do that. The thing is, market share comes at a price, and we want to have market share with value and not just market share for the sake of the market share. So that is important in how are we going to do that, but certainly it is top of our agenda down there in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just with reference to Russia, could you give us some insight how you're rebuilding your business there? And are you gaining market share there at a price, as you just mentioned? And at what price would that be, potentially, to the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a double yes. We are regaining share. We are not at the level where we left it last year. We're close to that level. It came at a cost, and the cost is that our mix has deteriorated, obviously. It is a bit blurred, because we were already, before the whole tax and price increases mix-up, we were reducing our brand portfolio. We are not in a leadership position. So you cannot maintain an infrastructure and also a system with so many brands to support. So we were already &#x2013; in kind of ourselves in &#x2013; given in, in market share in the sense of there is only a certain amount of market share that you can support in a sustainable way. So those two have crossed each other. Just came back from Russia last week, so it's fresh in my mind. I think we're making progress on the right way.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, we're not enough indexed in the higher end of the market. Obviously in the premium end of the market, we are not heavy enough. And so our attention goes there, and our investments goes there, with flagship brand Heineken Zlat&#xFD; Ba&#x17E;ant. They are developing quite nicely and gaining share in that segment. Obviously that takes some time. And on the other side is we are under-indexed in the &#x2013; index under thing in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:27), in the mainstream. We are typically under that mainstream. So &#x2013; and we do that with two national brands, Okhota and Three Bears, and then we have a number of regional brands.</p>
          <p>Now, we are in the midst of a restructuring over there to make our regional brands more profitable in some of the regions. And our strategic brands, Okhota and Three Bears, are making really nice progress. Obviously the pricing is still a little bit at the lower side. But also, we take a gradual approach there because we learned from past mistakes that if you go too brutally, you're not going to retain your volume. So in that exercise we are making progress definitely, but that takes time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, your price points are falling below the competitor's price points, and is it possible to indicate if the &#x2013; you said that EBIT declined. But is the business currently loss-making or is it &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it isn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have to say that ever since we started, we never had a loss-making year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not loss-making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we never had losses, since the beginning. It has been a roller coaster &#x2013; some very good years, some very bad years, but we never crossed the zero point. We always stayed above. Obviously, it doesn't make the return on the invested capital. That is the big issue. I mean it is not a business what we are pleased with and happy with, if you ask me. It is not dragging Heineken down, but because it's a big business, a big market &#x2013; the market gives a lot of opportunities, in the first place, also for the Heineken brand. It's worthwhile continue working on that, but never we made losses. So I would say it's worthwhile continuing there and not to pull out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, one &#x2013; just last one. There's a lot of moving parts on your margins in the first half. There's the Egypt impact in Africa; there's the scope consolidation in Americas, et cetera. But your organic margins are up in Americas, if you look at it. Should we expect for the second half, if Egypt's not there, again that one-off, but you've got higher marketing, higher input costs, that the organic or like-for-like margins could potentially be flat or marginally up in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you remove all the one-offs and all the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you will have &#x2013; Egypt will not be out of the equation in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will take more time. The margin decline of our African group is related to Egypt, okay? But that will come back, we hope, but still you have some uncertainties. We don't know if the new parliament is going to reduce our business scope, yes or no. We hope not, but we have to be cautious there. The business in itself is healthy, well organized, the people cope there very well. The moment at which it could return to its previous level is uncertain so &#x2013; and that's not going to necessarily happen in the second half. So therefore so we remain &#x2013; it's an open issue.</p>
          <p>Still it remains a very good business, but it is at a lower &#x2013; yeah, a significant lower rate than it was before. That is for the margins in Africa, the margins in Central, Eastern Europe. If you allow me to put up on a regional level, it's essentially due to the fall-off of Russia, the rebalance of Russia, and also the impact of Greece; that has an impact on the average. Whereas in Europe, the margins are good. It's also because we're continuing to improve the margins big time here in the UK. And it's &#x2013; you have the effect of the deconsolidation of the Waverly, obviously. So, that no-margin business taken out, but also the improvement of the margins that we make in Europe. So there I would say we're a bit stronger, just to give you a flavor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Because they are not consolidated. So this is the margins of our own business. And so the leftover, those are the export business, the license business, these are the pearls I was referring to in my presentation. Those are rather small business with very low fixed assets, high return on investment, and very high margins, and growing quite nicely. But in its scope it's quite reduced, and then you've got to look at the margins of APB and UB separately, the operating <mark type="ph" /> margin system. (1:48:10) It's our own operating margins.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Chris (1:48:20) is asking for -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on the Russia point. Can I just clarify &#x2013; I mean, a couple years ago you closed &#x2013; well, converted &#x2013; two breweries into warehouse &#x2013; distribution centers in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, say it again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Russia, you said that you're neither scaled, nor you sort of positioned in premium niche. Yet two years ago, you converted two breweries into distribution centers and took capacity out; you increased pricing. And it looked like you were going for the premium niche position, and that obviously hit your volumes very hard. It's been announced that you're expanding capacity now in one of your breweries, and it looks like you're going all out for scale again. Have you now made your mind up in Russia? Is the answer to go for scale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; I can't make the recollection of closing breweries and opening warehouses. No, breweries have been closed in Novotroitsk, and one that we have been closed in the &#x2013; Petersburg &#x2013; the one in Petersburg, we use as a warehouse, that's true.</p>
          <p>But basically we closed production facilities which were old, in need of investment, and which we didn't need. And certainly also because of the view that the market was kind of flattening out. We have had always a strategy in Russia based on volumes. You cannot take out volumes in Russia. The whole thing is when you have a portfolio you want to be disproportionately overweight in the premium end, that is where we try to invest. Now, we've started with arguably some delay towards all our other competitors in the market, and you still have to build scale in that upper market. But without a scale business giving you distribution muscle and production muscle in Russia, you could not have a business. So it's definitely a case at the scale basis.</p>
          <p>And the last part you were referring to, that we now currently invest. No, we have been renovating and building out the brewery in Nizhny Novgorod, and the one in Yekaterinburg. But those plans are now completed. I would say that now the investments in Russia are very much geared towards the necessary replacement left in there, but the big capital spending is done in Russia.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Would you be able to share what your utilization rate, then, is in Russia, and how much sort of volume headroom do you? It looks -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say &#x2013; I know that but I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can make &#x2013; effect &#x2013; with our current capacities, we can make 15 million hectoliter. So we're pretty comfortable in capacity. Bear in mind that overcapacity costs always money. It's suboptimal at the moment in time. On the other hand, you have to look at the manned overcapacity. That's important. It's manned overcapacity which is killing. It's having too much bottling lines with crews manning it, and having no volume to &#x2013; and that also, within your system, you can optimize.</p>
          <p>We don't hold &#x2013; Heineken has a philosophy not to hold too much overcapacity, but we have some buffer capacities. If you look in Europe, our buffer capacity is The Netherlands. But we are very good in manning and unmanning that buffer capacity when we need it. Yeah, you will remember when we stepped in South Africa, taking over the license from SAB, we had to make close to 2 million hectoliters of beer as from day one, shipped out of Europe. We could only do that because we have a flexible capacity organized in The Netherlands.</p>
          <p>So overcapacity is not necessarily yielding to very high fixed costs if you very well organize your manning. In the same way, this is how we reorganized our business in Russia not to suffer too much from that. But theoretically, we can build up capacity pretty soon again to 15 million.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's <mark type="ph" /> Adrian (1:52:19). On the FT article this morning, which I thought was quite interesting, was on Asia Pacific Breweries. And you look <mark type="ph" /> with insight (1:52:26) the sale of Indonesia. Do you think you sold it on the cheap to Asia Pacific Breweries, one? And two, if we look at the Polish subsidiary and we look at what they do, we do get an indication what you can generate in margins and returns. Is that going to be a benchmark for the rest of Europe, the Polish?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The Polish subsidiary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; I mean the Polish subsidiary, you can view the annual counts, and you can see what margins they make and returns they make. So my question is, is maybe Poland going to be the benchmark for the rest of Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you are the Polish specialist. You made it the benchmark for Europe, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on how you look at it. If you look at it the &#x2013; certainly in terms of fixed costs and production yields and all these things, Poland is now the champion in Europe. They are one of the top bill. I would say the Italians, the Polish, and The Netherlands are top of the bill into productivity.</p>
          <p>Commercial margins altogether, that &#x2013; I will not <mark type="ph" /> dwell into that world, (1:53:39) because you have some differences across Europe. We operate with an average, but you have some countries with higher and some countries with lower. So this is a competitive issue, and even if you can read our Polish results because its <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:53:50) company, I will not start to make tables and comparisons within Europe. Most of the operations we have are not singled out because they're all consolidated. So if you allow me to leave it at that. But the Polish operation is very productive on that side.</p>
          <p>And the second question was...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>It was about if we have sold Indonesia too cheap.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, of course. But &#x2013; no, you have to see that it was not an isolated deal. Probably if you would have sold Indonesia in isolation, you could have had a better price, but it was in combination with buying the Indian assets and get the freedom in India, and in that balance, we thought that we did a good and acceptable deal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One has to realize, we didn't sell &#x2013; yeah, formally you sell the absolute control, but it is a kind of a mix in that case. We didn't sell in a competitive auction the controlling stake of the brewery. We transferred it into a joint venture of ours, and frankly we still provide for the bulk of the management of the company. So it's kind of a mixed bag, and as Ren&#xE9;'s indicated it was also a strategic deal.</p>

          <p>I feel you read the Financial Times this morning. That's an entirely different issue. It is that Kirin engaged as a shareholder with Fraser and Neave, which is our partner in APB. It is not in APB. It is in Fraser and Neave. And that is quite remarkable, insofar that Kirin is a competitor of ours, and in other parts of the world we collaborate with Kirin. We have a Heineken license with Kirin Japan. We have an agreement with Lion Nathan, which is Kirin owned in Australia. But on the other hand, we compete fiercely in Indonesia or in other parts of the world. So Kirin is a competitor of ours that have 15% shareholding in Fraser and Neave, participating indirectly in the profit pool of APB.</p>
          <p>But in no way in the management. That has been totally isolated. Everything which concerns APB might not be discussed in the presence of the director of Kirin. We have made very strict arrangements around that because we found it very inappropriate that Kirin would sit on the table of our partner when discussing the affairs of the joint venture with Heineken. So that this is how we have organized it. I will leave it at that.</p>
          <p>Further questions? No?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If not, perhaps I will &#x2013; you're cordially invited to a little drink with our samples of beer, but I'd like to take this opportunity to say that this is the last year's result that Jan is attending in his capacity as the Chief of the Investor Relations. Jan will not take a leave from Heineken, because he doesn't want to leave such a good company. But after many, many years &#x2013; and we don't even count them because he was doing that job long before I was the Chief Executive of this company and, I suppose, I was walking in short trousers when you were already IR Director &#x2013; but you have been, I think, a great person to serve this community and serve the company. So also in your presence, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jan of his dedication to the company and also his dedication to you. And I would suggest that we have this little drink together in the honor and to the good health and thanking Jan for this contribution.</p>
          <p>So Jan stand up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to say that we will change the telephone number of Jan because otherwise it will be unfair, and then perhaps the occasion to introduce George Toulantas, who is taking over from Jan. And George comes from Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, as it was called in the old days. George is Australian, so you can talk Australian with him. And it's a difficult act &#x2013; we recognize it is a very difficult act to follow up on Jan, but I'm sure that George will do in his own ways continue to do the great Investor Relations job that Heineken is trying and servicing you as an analyst community going forward. So, George, if you can stand up that everybody sees you, here is George, and when you will take a leave, you will receive applause, but we wish you a long, long service in IR.</p>
