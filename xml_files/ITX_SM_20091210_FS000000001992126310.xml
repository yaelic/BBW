          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Inditex Conference Call for the Interim Nine Months 2009 Results. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex's Deputy Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex's results for the interim nine months of 2009. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>I would like to cover a few of the highlights in relation to our results. First, the results for the interim nine months of 2009 show that Inditex continues its ongoing international multi-concept growth. Net sales in local currencies have grown 8%. In line with the strategic priorities presented to you last March, operating expenses are tightly under control. Let me also highlight that we have kept our strict focus on capital efficiency, resulting in a strong cash flow generation over the period.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the first nine months of 2009, Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;7.8 billion. Sales in local currencies have grown 8%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro have deducted 2.5 percentage points from reported sales growth, due to lower exchange rate versus our reporting currency. Still currency remain at the current levels, the negative translation effect will start to annualize over the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2009, we have achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;1.6 billion and net income of &#x20AC;831 million. In terms of gross profit, this line has increased 5% to &#x20AC;4.4 billion, resulting in a gross margin on sales of 57.1%.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 7% in the period, mainly due to the addition of new retail space. Regarding the plan to attain operating efficiencies of &#x20AC;75 million for 2009 that we announced to you last March, we are on track to reach the target by fiscal year-end. All the lines of working capital keep showing tight control.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will provide some of the detail behind the performance on Inditex concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first nine months, we have added 266 net stores to our retail park, reaching a total of 4,530. As you know, a significant part of our space addition in fiscal 2009 is to take place in the second half. This is especially relevant in the case of Zara.</p>
          <p>Examining the performance per concept, Zara and the younger concepts grouped together have performed at a similar pace over the interim nine months. Among the concepts, Bershka and Oysho have performed above the average while Pull and Bear has performed below the average.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the rate of 2009, store sales in local currencies have increased 9% from the 1st of August to the 6th of December. However, as you all know, the autumn/winter season is influenced significantly by the performance over the Christmas period and after-Christmas sales due to the important sales volumes.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to highlight two aspects of our expansion. First, our plans to launch Zara online sales for the autumn/winter period 2010 are on track. Second, the opening of additional flagship stores in Asia. As you know, we have a strong presence in the region and significant expansion plans for the future.</p>
          <p>These openings show the strategic importance that Asia markets hold for the Group and cap idea of a strong growth in China, Japan, South Korea, and other countries in the area. Additionally, we plan to open our first stores in India in early 2010.</p>
          <p>The opening of two new flagship stores in Tokyo and Beijing has strengthened our presence in the most important retail markets in Asia. We will continue to grow throughout the area over the coming years. Our new flagship Zara store has opened in the heart of Tokyo at Shibuya, one of the world's leading fashion destinations. With this opening, Zara consolidates a strong presence in all the key retail districts of Tokyo. We now have two flagship stores each in Shibuya, Ginza and Shinjuku, and one in Harajuku. The flagship at Shibuya brings a number of Zara stores in Japan to 50.</p>
          <p>Zara has also opened a new flagship store in Wangfujing, the busiest pedestrian area of Beijing's City Center. This store further enhances our position in the Chinese market where we operate such prominent flagships at Zara at West Nanjing Road, and People's Square in Shanghai. Zara at Wangfujing is our store number 65 in China and reflects our commitment to growth in this market. As you know, we have strong expansion plans for the Chinese market in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding our corporate calendar, the full year results for 2009 will be released on the 17th of March 2010. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer your questions regarding these results and other subjects.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Richard Edwards of Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hi. Just a quick question on the gross margin, for the third quarter, looks as though the gross was up. Could you sort of break down the major drivers of that between markdown, better buying, and currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what I would like to say is that, as you know, we'd prefer not to talk very much about the gross margin evolution on a quarterly basis. We always prefer to analyze it considering the full season. And what we can say is that as we anticipated in the first half results presentation where there was a drop in the gross margin, we already anticipated that we were expecting a stable gross margin for the full year, because this drop in the first half had a lot to do with the evolution loss of currency, particularly with the evolution of the dollar.</p>
          <p>And we were anticipating that this currency effect was going to be reversed over the second half, so that is what we can say. But in any case, we prefer to talk about the gross margin, considering full season and not considering a quarter, but it's very much in line with our expectation of a stable gross margin for the full year, always considering what we always say, that stable means 50 basis points above or below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can ask one other question just on costs, do you know what local currency cost growth was in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, currency, regarding costs, the impact is more or less half of the impact on sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Chamberlain of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, gents. Just a question on prices please, can you talk about what happened to average selling prices in the quarter and maybe give some color in terms of women's and men's and kids' wear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very stable in the different markets. So our like-for-like evolution is mainly volume driven. No significant change regarding our prices in any of the sections, very stable in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My impression is, it's gone up more in &#x2013; the prices have moved up a little bit in some markets like the U.K. in areas like kids' wear. Is that fair or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing, in our case, very stable prices globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks and just second, on the depreciation charges trending up a little bit as a percentage of sales and yet obviously now space growth is slowing somewhat, I just wondered why depreciation is going up as a percentage of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no link between depreciation and sales. What you have to look is at depreciation in relationship with CapEx and as CapEx this year is weighed to the second half, you must expect a slight increase in the second half, but not material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but obviously CapEx is falling isn't it, quite &#x2013; year-on-year, quite dramatically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are talking about the evolution of CapEx year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>More depreciation, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but again, as CapEx is second half weighted, you should see a pickup, if you look at it on a quarterly basis, but we believe the right way to look at it is on yearly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Luca Solca of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a couple of questions for you this morning. The first one is whether you confirm your 10% space growth for the year and what you see as space growth guidance for 2010? And specifically on the quarter, I was wondering what specific sales trends you've been experiencing across geographies and whether there was any relevant impact that you had in terms of sales headwinds coming from the higher temperatures that we experienced at the start of the full winter season?</p>
          <p>And a third question having to do with your Asian expansion, which is I think receiving more emphasis at this point, would this bring you to anticipate the build-up of a product development platform in Asia to serve this market down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, answering your questions, first of all regarding a space growth, what we are expecting for this year is 10%, the space growth, on a time-weighted basis. And regarding the year 2010, I think probably it's too early, but we continue seeing a strong space growth in the year 2010 and in the coming years.</p>
          <p>About what you were saying regarding the weather, well, of course the weather could have a short-term impact, but we think that &#x2013; that is why we always prefer to talk about the whole season and not to talk about a particular quarter. Now, I think what is relevant in our case and regarding these results publication is that, from the 1st of August to the 6th of December, as store sales in local currencies are growing 9% and any particular impact in one particular month having to do with the weather or with whatever region, tends to be compensated during the full season.</p>
          <p>And third, regarding the Asian expansion, of course it's extremely strategic for us. As you know, we're growing very significantly. We have opened, in the first nine months of the year, 90 stores in Asia, which is quite a relevant figure. We're mainly focused in China, Japan, and Korea, but not only, we're also opening in the different Asia markets. But we're not planning to change our searching policy or our product development policy. So we're not planning any change from that point of view. We prefer to manage our searching globally. That makes a lot of sense regarding our business model.</p>
          <p>And regarding logistics, what we always try is to be more efficient, but we're not thinking right now about building any significant logistic capacity in Asia, but we're permanently, of course, trying to improve our efficiency regarding the logistics. But from the point of view of searching or from the point of view of product development design, we are not planning any relevant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I've two questions. The first one is, can you give us an idea, out of the 100 stores that you opened in third quarter, how many were in Asia and how many were in Spain? And the second question would be regarding the dividend. You have now a net cash position of &#x20AC;1.6 billion, should that trigger an increase in dividend going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the first part of your question, it has a lot to do with what I was saying before and what we were anticipating at the beginning of the year in the full year, in 2008 results presentation. Asia, in the first nine months of the year, we have opened 90 stores in Asia. So it is a relevant figure. We're talking about one-third of our total openings in Asia and that is more related to the average in each quarter. Now but in fact, is more than one-third of our openings in Asia in the nine-month period.</p>
          <p>This is particularly relevant regarding Zara, regarding Zara openings, because regarding Zara openings, as far as in Korea and Japan currently, we're only present with Zara. Regarding Zara openings during the year, around 50% of total Zara openings during the year are going to take place in Asia and this is going to be the case next year and in the coming years.</p>
          <p>And regarding the net cash position, what we can say is that well, first of all, the cash position is better to &#x2013; it's better to analyze the cash position on a full year basis much better than to analyze it in one particular quarter, no but in fact, we are generating significant cash flow and you know what is our policy regarding the use of cash.</p>
          <p>First of all, to &#x2013; of course, we want to have a high level of flexibility; we want to have a strong financial position. Our first priority is to invest profitably in the long-term growth of our business, but at the same time, we are always taking care of the return on capital employed. We want to have an attractive and predictable shareholders' remuneration policy and you know what is our, as stated, dividend policy. So this remains the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Ken [sic] (Karen) Howland of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's actually Karen Howland. Looking at the vendor financing, it obviously continues to improve as you look at payables versus inventories. So just wondering if you thought there is a lot of additional opportunity there on the working capital side of things, or if kind of that 200% area is reasonable going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the working capital very specially, in the year 2009 is very difficult to compare with the previous year, because you know that there are two factors which make this comparison not exactly the same as the previous year. The first one is that CapEx this year is biased towards the second half and this has an effect on both the cas-- the cash and the payables to suppliers of fixed assets. And the second one is that, as we have gone into a biannual dividend payment, there are some alterations.</p>
          <p>What you must expect, the Group will hold a negative working capital position that is a consequence of the business model, given the fact that we source in proximity a very significant part of our sourcing, and obviously, we collect cash at the stores, so that we are going to hold a negative working capital position that should reverse to normal in the year 2010, is what you should expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; I'm sorry, you said that it'll be reversing more towards the flat working capital position in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, to a more negative working capital position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the inventory levels, obviously very tight controls over there. It looks like it's up about 1% and on a per-square footage basis, down about 3%. Do you feel like you've got a good control of the inventory that &#x2013; are there more improvements to come, or is that kind of the optimal level for you right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would answer to your question is <mark type="inaudible" /> you have already heard from us, not that the inventory does not reflect properly the evolution of the company. We take a lot of care about our commitment regarding purchases. What we can transmit to you is that we feel comfortable with the inventory position, one with &#x2013; what is much more relevant for us is the level of commitment that we have at this stage of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Robert Miller at Redburn Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can I just ask you a question regarding Asia? Is there anything that you have experienced so far in your expansion that would lead you to suggest that the achievable operating margin from the Asian region will be materially different to the current group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. What we can say is that in &#x2013; when we analyze our operating margin in the different regions, you know the split. We always talk about Spain, Europe, Asia and America. When we analyze the operating margin in the different regions, it tends to be very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So not a big difference to the average of the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could I just be very specific on one working capital point, the trade creditor number in the balance sheet, which hasn't increased materially year-on-year, are there any timing issues around the end of the quarter, which has flatted that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, couple of questions for you. Firstly, just going back to what you've said earlier about the space numbers and you talked about time-weighted space growth being up 10% over the year. Given your &#x2013; the fact obviously in the first half of the year, you were well ahead of that, does that mean your year-on-year number is actually going to be below 10%?</p>
          <p>And the second point, I just wanted your thoughts on South America, obviously, retail sales there are growing very rapidly to business where you have &#x2013; you were in very early and yet its growth rates have slowed in recent years. I was just wondering what your thoughts are about that as a marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, regarding your first question, what we can say is that as I was saying before, the time-weighted space growth will be 10% and space growth during the year will be a slightly below that figure, as you were saying during your question.</p>
          <p>And regarding South America, nothing really very relevant to comment, as you know &#x2013; as you were saying in your question, we are present in South America since many years ago. We have a strong presence in some South American countries. We are having good performance there. We plan to continue growing in the different markets, but not as a very strategic priority for us. Our two key areas of growth this year and in the coming years will continue being Asia and Europe, and inside Europe, a good balance between Western and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Of course in South America, we will continue adding stores in the different markets, in Mexico, in Columbia, in Brazil, of course where we already have building a strong presence. We have more than 25 Zara stores in Brazil, very well received by our customers there and we are every year adding a certain number of stores. But not a big change regarding what we are doing right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Peter Farren of Bryan Garnier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions left. So the first one is regarding logistics investment, you said not long ago that your current infrastructure cases for growth until 2012, assuming that volumes growth is probably lower than you'd anticipated at the time. Does that mean we shouldn't be seeing a pick up in CapEx related to logistics until 2013 or 2014? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on currencies and I was wondering you never actually done this before, but I was wondering if you could us some hedge rates to increase visibility for us on the gross margin in 2010, given that you do hedge roughly 12 months in advance I believe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding our logistics, I think you should continue assuming that we do not need significant investment in logistics until the year 2012, it is very difficult to precise now if it's going to be 2012 or 2013. In any case, the big effort was made as you know during the years 2006, 2007 and 2008, increasing our logistics capacity. And so this means that in the years 2010, 2011, we will not need significant logistic investments. So you should continue assuming what you were assuming there before.</p>
          <p>And regarding your question about the gross margin, what we can say is that if currencies remain at the current levels, the impact in the year 2010 coming from currencies should not be very relevant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Just one more question, sorry I forgot, on costs. Beyond the 75 million of cost saving program this year, I was wondering if you are &#x2013; what you're seeing at the moment in your expansion markets regarding rental costs. I mean do you expect to generate any more savings in next year or should we &#x2013; is there no significant change on that front at the moment versus the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you should consider, because this year with this &#x20AC;75 million efficiency plan, it has been a big effort. We have deducted two points from the cost base. And thinking about the next year, you should assume cost growth in line with the space growth. This year, it's below because of this efficiency plan. We have obtained savings regarding rental expenses, regarding head count, regarding procurement. And in the future, you should assume a cost growth in line with the space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Flora Trindade at BPI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Just two questions remaining. The first one on FX rates, you have a strong impact this quarter. So I was wondering if you could give us an idea of where do you see the impact of the FX rates in sales and consequently also in cost?</p>
          <p>And the other question is that looking at these numbers, it seems that you're witnessing a slight recovery in terms of like-for-like sales growth, which comparing with what your competitors are doing, should mean that you are grabbing some market share. Could you comment on this, if you have any data to provide us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the &#x2013; if I have understood well, your first question had to do with the foreign exchange impact that we are expecting for the full year, regarding sales and costs that was your question, your first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, you could assume something similar to what you have seen in the nine-month period, so 250 basis points on sales and half of that on costs. That could be what you could assume for the full year.</p>
          <p>And regarding our evolution in the different markets and about market share, as we always say, we prefer to wait until the end of the season to talk about the performance in the different markets, how is it going and so that is what we prefer to do instead of talking. What we can say is that from August 1, as I was saying before, to December 6, store sales in local currencies are growing 9% and that will continue working. Of course, we have the Christmas period in front of us and the sales period, which are extremely relevant. And we continue working and we continue with our target of having better like-for-like sales growth in the second half than in the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wondered if I could have your view please on your view of consumer confidence and how that's progressing in Spain and how you think Inditex's formats are performing compared to the local market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Spain, what we can say is that, as you know, Spain is a market that we know very well. We have been operating in Spain for many years and we feel very comfortable operating in Spain. Our evolution in the market is much better than the official figures for the &#x2013; globally for consumption. And what we can say is that we are not seeing any additional, any further deterioration in the Spanish market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think that consumer confidence is improving as you go towards Christmas in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we prefer to wait until the end of the season to talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I repeat to you what I was saying that we feel very comfortable operating in the Spanish market. It's a market we know quite well and we are not seeing any additional deterioration of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Daniel Ovin at Cheuvreux Nordics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I would like to ask a question. I'm not sure if you're going to answer, but you prudently report here that in the period here, we had a nine months growth in local currency and then we only had 8% in the Q3 quarter. So that's a indicator of pickup here. Can you help us a little bit with how that's distributed between like-for-like and expansion and also if you could comment on if there is any particular format that's now doing better than what we see previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Daniel, as you know, we prefer not to discuss like-for-likes on a quarterly basis but on the seasonal basis, and I believe that in this matter, what is relevant is the fact that from the 1st of August to the 6th of December, our sales growth in local currencies is 9%, which is similar to the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding space growth, what we have mentioned is that we are expecting average space growth for the year around 10%. So with this information, I believe and having Christmas in front of us, we will prefer to analyze the performance over the whole autumn/winter season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just one second question as well. Your closest peer, H&amp;M, has been talking a lot about the huge unemployment hurting their sales. And I just wanted to have your view on that and if this is something you potentially could see as a problem for some of your formats.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding what we are seeing in the market, we're seeing not a different performance for each group. What we are seeing very clearly is that what we are selling, what is really hot are the fashionable products. And it's true that they &#x2013; product with a lower fashion component is more difficult to sell in the current environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what I would like to add is we knew from the very beginning that 2009 was going to be a challenging year and we anticipated that to you in our 2008 results presentation, and this continues being the case. And in this challenging environment, we are having this performance, which we consider, if you allow me, satisfactory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question, and that question comes from Tony Shiret at Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen, just a couple of questions on the sales, both of them in fact. First of all, you've given us the store sales figure for the &#x2013; that period up to December the 6. Can you tell us what the net sales in the currencies were for that period, because there is clearly a bit of difference between those two figures historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat your question, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You've &#x2013; the period you've given for current trade, 1st of August to 6th of December, the sales figure is in store sales. I wonder what that figure was for net sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It won't be very different. No, it won't be very different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about two points different in Q3. I mean, is that what you call not very different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there was not a two point difference in Q3, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it looks like &#x2013; it looks like you said that the store sales in Q3 were 8% ahead and at the half year, net sales were 9% ahead in &#x2013; over the nine-month, so 8% ahead. So it looks like they were more like 6% in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is your calculation, but there is not such a difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've provided. Okay. So &#x2013; okay, we don't get out to there. So in terms of the actual Q3 figures, I mean can you confirm that there was a deterioration in the sales growth rate in Q3 in the like-for-like sales growth rate from the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again Tony, we prefer to discuss the sales figures for the whole season, because we believe that quarters are less relevant. On that sense, we believe we have provided figure from the 1st of August to the 6th of December, which a &#x2013; given the longer period, we are providing is of better quality, and we have mentioned that in this period sales growth is in local currencies is 9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Now we are going to address the question we have just received through the internet. Most of them have already been proven as, I mean, some of them are trying to bring some further detail regarding the gross margin performance or further initiatives on the operating expenses evolution of the company. Well, there is a question, which is pretty specific, which is about the performance in Spain that I think that we have already addressed. So, I would say the &#x2013; there is one question we have received regarding our plans for expanding in India. If &#x2013; well, we have quantify &#x2013; we can quantify and if we may consider any acquisition to grow in the country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In principle, we are not considering any acquisition as you know. Our expansion is always based on organic growth, and our plans in India are to begin in the first year. So its year 2010 with more or less five stores, and later on to continue growing in the coming years. We will begin in Delhi and Mumbai, and we will move progressively to other cities inside the country.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another &#x2013; and a couple of questions trying to address the like-for-like performance on the third quarter. But most of the questions have already being addressed over the call.</p>
