        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jane, and good morning everyone. Thank you very much for joining us this morning.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss PepsiCo's first quarter performance and our outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>Before we begin let me just refer back to this morning's release where we are reiterating our full year guidance of 3 to 5% volume growth, high single digit revenue growth and earnings per share of at least $3.70 for the year.  In the quarter the strength of our portfolio, together with the breadth of our global footprint enabled to us manage the challenges of a slowing U.S. economy and rising commodity inflation, yet deliver solid overall business results.  Worldwide snacks volumes grew up 4%.  Worldwide beverages grew 4%.  Net revenue was up 13%, division operating profit grew 10%, and EPS grew 7%.</p>
          <p>Before Mike, Massimo and John talk in more detail about their businesses, let me share my thoughts on the environment in which we are operating and how we are managing our businesses to deliver results.  The first factor is the rapidly changing macroeconomic picture across the globe.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the U.S. where the economy has significantly slowed and consumer confidence is low.  And this is not news to any of you.  The good news, however, is that in past U.S. slowdowns, our categories have done quite well, in part, due to the relative affordability of our products and in part due to consumers economizing during hard times and shifting towards at-home eating occasions.  Indeed we have seen that shift taking place over the past few months where traffic has declined in two channels, foodservice and to a certain extent C&amp;G [Convenience and Gas stations] causing volumes in the highly penetrated beverage business to slow in these two channels.  Interestingly our snacks volume in these channels has held up very nicely.  On the other hand, volume across large format channels is pretty good as consumers shift to food and beverages consumed at home.</p>
          <p>In market outsides the United States, the global macros are still very good, particularly in the developing economies where robust economic growth coupled with low per capita consumption levels of our products creates vibrant growth opportunities.  The geographically diverse portfolio that we have built over the past decade allows us to take full advantage of this international growth.</p>
          <p>You see this in our strong Q1 results where our businesses outside the United States both in beverages and snacks posted very healthy results.  In addition, the currency diversification from our international businesses has provided some counterbalance to the falling dollar's impact on commodity prices, which brings me to the second factor: commodity inflation.</p>
          <p>We see commodity prices going up in almost every country in the world, particularly in grains, cooking oil and energy and this trend accelerated through Q1 of this year.  In the U.S., we have the somewhat unusual circumstance of both an economic slowdown and significant commodity inflation.  And to be honest, we are dusting off long forgotten lessons on operating in the stagflation environment.  Our commodity inflation estimate for the year is 9 to 10% worldwide versus the 6% we had indicated on the Q4 call.  The good news is that at this point we are largely covered for the full year on key commodities.  But to address this cost spike, we are taking additional pricing and tightening our belt.</p>
          <p>We have been pacing our pricing execution in the marketplace, including both weight-outs and visual pricing to minimize the impact on consumers.  Importantly, our early reads on the pricing we have taken in a number of markets suggests that elasticities are better than anticipated and show our brand's pricing power in the marketplace.  Now, as consumer outlay on food is going up we are working very carefully to see how that expenditure is going to be allotted across categories so that we can take the appropriate actions to drive growth of our categories.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole our focus remains on managing our portfolio to achieve our full year performance objectives.  John, Mike and Richard will cover the specific actions planned and placed to address this higher level of input inflation.  But before I hand it off to them, I want to reinforce PepsiCo's considerable capability advantages.</p>
          <p>First, our culture of innovation: we have a robust innovation pipeline that enables us to sustain consumer momentum while also achieving the price utilization required to help offset significant input cost inflation.  We intend to fully leverage this pipeline for growth throughout the year, and to continue to transform our portfolio with health and wellness options.</p>
          <p>Second, we have a productivity culture and passion for execution, both critical to ensure that we derive all the benefits possible across our businesses.  Our teams are focused on both cost initiatives and targeted price pack management so that we can provide strong, relative value across all our brands.</p>
          <p>Third, our tuck-in acquisition strategy continues to advance.  Importantly this quarter we announced a deal to acquire the largest juice company in Russia, Lebedyansky, which builds our portfolio and infrastructure across the growing Russian market and complements the strong position we already have in juices in Europe including Tropicana in the U.K., France and Benelux and the recently acquired Sandora in the Ukraine.  We also announced a chilled dips joint venture with Sabra adding yet another new platform for growth and we'll continue to take advantage of tuck-in acquisitions to expand our reach and enhance our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we'll continue our important investments in our business transformation initiatives and stepping up our research and Development capability, both so critical to help us maintain and enhance our long-term performance.</p>
          <p>Lastly and most importantly, we have a terrific management team with local savvy and tremendous commitment, giving us the skills and experience to navigate the changing dynamics of the marketplace.  Our goal is to manage the portfolio of businesses that constitutes PepsiCo prudently and to deliver our full year guidance: 3 to 5% volume growth, high single digit revenue growth and earnings per share of at least $3.72 in 2008.</p>
          <p>So with that let me turn the call over to John Compton.  John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Indra, and good morning to everyone.  This morning I would like to review the Q1 results of PepsiCo Americas Foods which as you know encompasses our food businesses across North America and Latin America.</p>
          <p>As you saw in the press release, on a reported basis we generated 3% volume growth, 13% revenue growth and 8% operating profit growth; solid results in the face of considerable commodity headwinds.</p>
          <p>So let me take you through each of our divisions and I'll start first with Frito-Lay North America which generated 2% volume growth, 7% revenue growth and 4% operating profit growth.  Let me first focus on the strong top line performance and then I'll address profitability.  On the volume side I'm very encouraged by our 2% growth especially in light of the impact on pounds of the weight-outs we took this quarter.  Weight-outs impacted volume growth by a couple of points.</p>
          <p>Across the portfolio we saw strength across our core products with mid single digit volume growth in our Lay's and Ruffles trademarks and high single digit growth in Cheetos and dips.  Now, at the same time, we did see declines in our Quaker rice cake business and modest decline in trademark Doritos but remember Doritos was lapping double-digit growth from the prior year.  Overall Frito-Lay continued to drive both volume and value share gains in measured channels.  So I'll look at the 2% volume growth and 7% revenue growth coupled with our strong share gains and it reflects to me the ongoing strength of our brands.</p>
          <p>Now on the profit side our 4% growth was about 3 points below our historical average and there was one primary factor.  At Frito-Lay, we plan pricing 4 to five months ahead of end market timing.  In the first quarter based on the commodity forecasts we had in September of '07 we executed the first phase of pricing, primarily as you know through weight-outs but we did take some visual pricing.  The net effect was to realize about 4 points of positive price per pound.  However, with the run-up of commodity cost we saw at the end of Q4, and the beginning of Q1 we experienced a gap between our Phase I pricing actions and our actual commodity cost which did impact profit growth in the quarter.  The second phase of our planned pricing will address this issue for the balance of the year and effective April 20th we have taken visual price increases, primarily on our larger take home sizes.  Now, we will maintain our promotional frequency and depth, but at higher price points.</p>
          <p>Once fully implemented in Q3, total pricing actions, the combination of the weight-outs and visual pricing will be in the high single digit range for Frito-Lay North America.  And as you might imagine these pricing actions will likely lead to volume growth below our historical levels.  Based on our full year coverage of key ingredients, materials and energy, we believe we now have the appropriate level of pricing in the marketplace to cover our costs.</p>
          <p>Importantly we feel that our innovation calendar is strong over the balance of the year, to keep our revenue growth strong, as an example during March we introduced TrueNorth nut brand, in key customers and held sampling events in over 1300 Target and Sam's Clubs.  We'll complete our full rollout during the second quarter and TrueNorth is off to a very good start.</p>
          <p>We launched two new baked snacks:  Lay's Cracker Crisps and Cheetos Cracker Trax, both Smart Spot qualified and targeting incremental cracker occasions.</p>
          <p>Responding to our number one consumer request for lower sodium versions of our core brands is our new Pinch of Salt line it has 30 to 50% less sodium than the original products with all the great taste that you have known to love behind Lay's, Ruffles, Tostitos and Fritos brands.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we completed the formation of the joint venture we announced earlier with the Strauss Group, makers of the fast growing Sabra hummus and dips.  Under the new JV, Frito-Lay and Strauss will each own 50% of the Sabra dip business.  Sabra expands Frito-Lay's role in providing healthier snack options and aligns with this fresh trend that's taking place in the marketplace.  We are delighted to add Sabra's Mediterranean dips to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now the final element of our operating profit story is always our continued progress on productivity at Frito-Lay.  Frito expects to cover about a quarter of its commodity cost inflation with productivity.  One example is our pre-packed weekender merchandising initiative in small format.  It is a standalone pre-stocked merchandising unit that reduces merchandising costs and drives display execution.  The success of this initiative is, in combination with our broader up and down the street growth plan, helped to drive our C&amp;G sales up over 3% in the quarter.  That's despite traffic declines in this channel.  So in total, our productivity plans are on track across the supply chain, both to mitigate cost, and more importantly to help drive sales.</p>
          <p>So to sum up Frito-Lay North America, while the challenges and commodity costs require incremental pricing and productivity, the entire Frito-Lay team is working to continue our share gains, to maintain our relative value, to minimize the pricing impact to pound growth and return the profitability to more typical levels for Frito-Lay.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to Quaker foods North America.  Our Quaker foods division reported about flat volume for the first quarter but strong top line growth of 7%.  Quaker's top line was driven by volume growth in Quaker oats and ready to eat cereals.  Net price realization and positive mix resulted in 7% revenue growth and helped offset commodity inflation.  All-in-all Quaker Foods North America delivered a strong 7% operating profit growth.  Like Frito-Lay, Quaker foods will be executing additional pricing through Q2 to keep pace with inflation pressures.</p>
          <p>Turning to Latin America, our Latin American food businesses had an excellent first quarter.  Each of its segments: Sabritas, Gamesa and South American foods contributed to strong and balanced results.  Latin American foods reported growth was 8% volume, 37% revenue and 27% profit growth.  Now excluding the impact of M&amp;A with the consolidation of a JV and the ForEx tailwind Latin Americas foods growth was 5% volume, 11% revenue and 15% profit growth.</p>
          <p>Sabritas delivered strong performance during the quarter driven by an effective weight-out and pricing actions coupled with successful promotions that delivered unit volume and revenue growth.  Gamesa also posted strong performance with high single digit volume growth and continued top line momentum especially in its high end cookies and its expanding line of healthy Quaker cookies, bars and snacks.</p>
          <p>And turning to South America, South America contributed significantly to growth in the quarter, especially in the light of the capacity constraints in Brazil as a result of a fire in one of our major production facilities at the very end of last year.  Brazil has been executing very successfully on its contingency plan which included SKU rationalization and leveraging the newly acquired Lucky production capability to its maximum level.  The Brazil snack business will continue to benefit from the integration of the Lucky snack business and the launch of its new Twistos platform which is a healthy bread snack.</p>
          <p>So in summary for PepsiCo Americas Foods, there will continue to be lots of moving parts in the business equation over the next couple of quarters, however, I am pleased with PepsiCo Americas Foods' overall performance in Q1 as well as with the initiatives we have in place to manage commodity inflation while maintaining strong consumer momentum and delivering appropriate profit growth for the year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now turn the call over to my friend, Massimo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John, and good morning.  I'll provide an overview of PepsiCo Americas Beverages Q1 performance including specific reviews of both North American and Latin America markets.</p>
          <p>In Q1 total PAB volume growth decreased slightly versus prior year, however, every market contributed to the 6% revenue growth and total operating profit increased 7%.  Although I'm pleased by the profit performance of this seasonal small quarter in our beverage business, volume growth in North America was below our long-term objectives driven by category softness.</p>
          <p>So let me try to put our North American performance in context.  Clearly the economic slowdown has pressured the LRB [Liquid Refreshment Beverage] category.  In quarter one, LRB declined almost two points in measured channels and we see continued pressure on the category, with all channel growth for the full year probably only flat to up slightly.  This in part reflects a significant slowdown in the unflavored water category which has helped fuel overall category growth over the past several years and a softness in the foodservice and C&amp;G channels.</p>
          <p>Turning to our own performance for quarter one, we were pleased to hold total LRB share in the measured channels.  But profitable top line growth for us and our bottlers continues to be a priority as we move forward. For Q1, in CSD [Carbonated Soft Drink] we held overall volume share in the face of a challenging consumer and competitive environment, in part reflecting our strong performance over the Easter holiday.</p>
          <p>Our Mountain Dew trademark continued to deliver growth and heading into the summer, we are further strengthening the trademark with our distinctive "Dewmocracy" promotion, as it engages Mountain Dew's loyal user base to create and choose the next flavor innovation.</p>
          <p>Although we experienced mid single digit declines on brand Pepsi, we did begin to see the new connection and engagement in consumers via our "Pepsi Stuff" loyalty program and the continued growth of Diet Pepsi max.  This year's iteration of "Pepsi Stuff" is on track to be our biggest consumer promotion ever.  We already have more than 1 million registrants spending about 10 minutes each on the pepsistuff.com website.  Consumers have redeemed over 400,000 prizes to date.</p>
          <p>Diet Pepsi Max growth has accelerated on the heels of the hugely successful communication campaign we kicked off during the Super Bowl.  Max repeat rate is very high.  So we continue to invest in driving trial.  Beginning its user base and expanding its footprint.  Accordingly, we expect Max to continue to win market share.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased with our total Gatorade performance which grew almost 6% in quarter one.  Our line expansions G2 and Tiger are performing very well in the market.  G2's trial progression is the steepest we have ever achieved for a Gatorade innovation.  Even more encouraging is G2's level of repeat purchase which is a good indicator of the sustainability of our innovation.  After 16 weeks in market, it continues to grow from a very solid base.</p>
          <p>Now it is also important to note that for both G2 and Tiger we quickly gained distribution, achieving our 90% target in just eight weeks.  However, we know that the speed did not allow us to get all the incremental space we will ultimately obtain.  And this, combined with aggressive G2 pre-launch inventory build in quarter 4 restricted Gatorade's overall volume growth for this quarter.  We are planned aggressive shelf resets to capture incremental shelf and cold vault space gains for the entire Gatorade trademark and we are working with key customers to complete this ahead of the summer consumption peak.  Therefore I remain confident that volume growth will continue to improve as we approach the warmer peak season and that Gatorade will generate high single digit growth for full year 2008.</p>
          <p>In the water category unflavored base Aquafina declined mid single digits.  We continued a rational approach to managing this lower margin segment which saw some aggressive pricing in the unmeasured channels.  However, we remain highly focused on the enhanced water segment.  SoBe Life Water is generating strong consumer enthusiasm which has translated into triple digit growth and share gains in quarter 1.  We are seeing all this momentum continuing to drive trial and distribution for the brand and launching take home four packs in large formats in Q2.  Looking to the second half of the year I can assure you that our SoBe lizards will be dancing with more curvaceous muses for Life Water.</p>
          <p>Our Lipton Tea business continued to drive our non-carb growth and build our leading share position in the ready-to-drink tea category.  To better capture new consumption occasions we are continuing to add the new packaging to appeal to a broader range of consumers.  For example we are rolling our jug package in selected geographies targeted at heavy tea drinkers.</p>
          <p>On the energy front we are focusing on the AMP brand which grew more than 60% in the quarter and drove overall volume growth of 14% in our energy portfolio.  The AMP brand gives us better in store shelf presence and a more targeted execution focus.  We recently introduced three new AMP flavors, each with specifically targeted energy benefits to meet the unique needs of energy consumers as the segment deals in such occasions.</p>
          <p>Our Tropicana juice volume declined consistent with our expectations in the quarter.  Our innovation pipeline began to hit the market in March.  First we started national distribution of our premium pure Valencia juice line and expect full distribution before Memorial Day.  Second our easy pour Tropicana Pure Premium Pitcher will also roll out nationally during Q2 adding functional convenience to our core brand.  We'll continue to realize supply chain productivity and invest to drive fast awareness of our news.</p>
          <p>I also would like to note that Naked Juice posted 10% volume growth and had an important foodservice win. You can now enjoy a Naked Juice at Starbucks across the country, a new prestige outlet for the brand that will increase trial and drive growth.</p>
          <p>Clearly the dynamics are changing in the North American liquid refreshment beverage category, however, we have some clear advantages that give us confidence going forward.  We have the leading non-carbs portfolio in North America.  Our Mountain Dew brand continues its growth.  Our innovation like G2 and Max are all doing well in the marketplace.  Our exposure to the foodservice channel is limited.  We have a strong calendar of programs with our customers.  And very importantly we have a constructive relationship with our bottling companies.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to south of the border, I continue to be encouraged by the positive returns of our beverage business in Latin America.  Volume in the region grew mid single digits during quarter one.  Trademark Pepsi grew well, and we enjoyed CSD market share gains across many of our key markets.  H2O our winning product line and intersection of CSDs and flavored water continues to grow and is broadening its appeal with new flavors like apple and citrus.</p>
          <p>Non-carbs set the pace in Latin America with strength across virtually all our brands, particularly, Lipton, Delight, flavored water and Tropicana.  Gatorade grew mid single digits and continues to lead the sports drink category in Latin America by far.</p>
          <p>So in summary I expect 2008 to be a year of growth and rebuilding for PAB beverages.  I'm convinced we are making the right bets and we'll continue to show progress especially in our hydration, tea, energy and Latin America chambers.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Massimo.  Good morning everyone.  Let me start by saying that I'm particularly pleased with PI's first quarter results from three perspectives.  We had strong double-digit volume growth and strong profit growth as well.  The growth was very broad-based across all of our markets, both developed and emerging and both of our categories, snacks and beverages.  And we made some strategic progress with our major acquisition of Lebedyansky and several important product launches under the Tropicana brand globally.</p>
          <p>As a reminder PI includes all of our snacks and beverage businesses outside of the Americas.  The strong momentum from 2007 has continued into 2008 with our businesses delivering double-digit volume growth in both snacks and beverages as I mentioned, 27% revenue growth, and 26% operating profit growth.  Now, on an organic basis excluding the benefits of the positive foreign currency translation and acquisitions which we completed, PI still delivered very robust and balanced Q1 growth: 10% snack and beverage volume growth, 12% revenue growth, and 14% operating profit.  The comparable operating margin, excluding ForEx, acquisitions and consolidations was 13.9%, up almost 30 basis points versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Now, before I give you an overview of our two key regions let me make a couple of broader comments about PI in total.  First, PI showed great top line strength in the quarter.  Our volume growth in both beverages and snacks was broad-based, but was especially robust in our emerging markets.  And as I mentioned even without the tailwind of acquisitions, snacks and beverages each grew 10%.</p>
          <p>Second, innovation as Indra mentioned continues to be a significant driver of our growth in both volume and in revenue.  Our focus on innovation has been in PI in three broad areas.  First, adding local relevance and food authenticity to our core brands.  For instance our new barbecue Doritos flavor in Saudi Arabia is growing and Doritos is becoming a significant new platform for growth all across the Middle East.  Our Chinese New Year campaign which featured our new Lay's warm winter flavors like lychee and mango also had sensational results.  On the beverage side Pepsi Raw in the U.K. is seeing success in our foodservice accounts as a more natural, all natural premium Pepsi option.</p>
          <p>Our secondary focus is the regional expansion of successful new products across several markets.  We expanded the geographic footprint of Pepsi Max in China and will be launching Max in India, Vietnam and Pakistan in Q2.  Also in Q2 we'll be launching H2O in China, Lebanon, Finland and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>And third and perhaps most strategic we are extending our 'Better for You' platforms in both snacks and beverages.  Our bread snacks in Turkey and our baked Lay's product in Belgium and in the Netherlands are off to a strong start.  Importantly we have jump shifted our juice and juice drink business on the beverage side both organically as well as through acquisition.</p>
          <p>Our Tropicana juice platform expanded meaningfully in the quarter. We launched Tropicana Twister in India supported by extensive sampling and national media to build awareness and trial.  And we'll be expanding our current P.E.T. package offering by adding returnable glass in Q2.  And in China, Tropicana juice drinks with their unique fruit and flavor blends has proved to be a big hit with consumers.  Our Tropicana Smoothies innovation in the U.K. is off to a terrific start on top of solid growth on the base Tropicana business as well.</p>
          <p>Finally as Indra mentioned the pending acquisition of the Lebedyansky juice business in Russia which we bought in partnership with PBG [Pepsi Bottling Group] complements our beverage portfolio providing greater scale, additional distribution muscle, a strong and entrepreneurial group of managers in Russia, as well as a juice portfolio of leading brands in the health and wellness space in that critically important emerging market.  We are very excited about our progress particularly in juice, and adding this exciting business, Lebedyansky, to PI.</p>
          <p>Finally although it is early days in our pricing journey I would say in many markets our Q1 volume trends were very good as we matched commodity dollar cost increases with price realization.  However, we are as always vigilant and need to keep in mind that costs have continued to rise past our estimates earlier in the year particularly in our expectations for the second half of the year with a new crop.  And we have more pricing planned for the end of Q2 and Q3. We are encouraged by the success of our pricing so far and we are doing better than our elasticity models would have suggested but we will of course remain alert to the consumer affordability issues that may arise as well as the relative value in the marketplace that we have in the consumers food basket as we move forward with our pricing actions.</p>
          <p>So with that let me review each of the two major geographic areas in our reported segments.  In Q1 our U.K. Europe segment delivered strong top and bottom line results.  Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions our U.K. Europe businesses grew snack volume by 7%, beverage volume by 8%, net revenue by 8% and operating profit by 11%.  In snacks, the most notable drivers of our volume growth with were Russia, with over 30% growth, and even a developed country, Spain, had growth in the high single digits.  In the U.K., our Walkers business had a slight volume decline but very solid revenue growth right in line with our plan and expectations reflecting the success of our "Great British Potato" campaign as well as the growth of our Baked Walkers line and our SunBites whole grain product which is similar to the U.S. SunChips product.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., Europe, beverage volumes were fueled by double-digit growth in Russia and other Eastern European markets. We also of course benefited from last year's acquisition of Sandora in the Ukraine with our beverage partner, PAS, as well as the Phase II of the PepsiCo Lipton joint venture which we announced last fall.  In the U.K., Tropicana delivered terrific volume growth driven by both core, not from concentrate, as well as from the newly introduced Tropicana Smoothies product.  Our bottom line in the U.K. Europe grew 18% in spite of commodity cost headwinds and excluding ForEx and acquisitions operating profit margins grew by about 30 basis points.  In total I think we made very, very good progress in our U.K., Europe sector.</p>
          <p>Moving across the globe to our developing Middle East, Africa, Asia segment, I'm very pleased to record that we had another terrific quarter.  On a reported basis our snacks volume grew 15% and beverages grew 11%.  Net revenue was up 30 and operating profit expanded 32%.  Our volume growth was not impacted significantly by acquisitions or consolidations.  Revenue increased 16% and operating profit 17% net of the combination of ForEx benefits and some M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In China, we had an outstanding performance during the Chinese New Year celebration.  The result was strong double-digit growth in both of our snacks and beverage businesses during January and February.  We continue to make aggressive investments in China as we expand our footprint as we nationally launched our Tropicana juice drink.  Consumer engagement continues to be high on our list of marketing priorities in China, through our Go China campaign, and our distinctive Pepsi icon of two thumbs up.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia also turned in a double-digit volume growth performance in both snacks and beverages.  On the snacks side, volume was bolstered by the strength of Doritos and beverage top line momentum benefited from the expansion of H2O and was further accelerated by a positive mix shift towards juices.</p>
          <p>And in India I'm very encouraged by our ongoing double-digit snacks volume growth driven by growth in the northern regions and some successful promotional activities.  And in beverages as well, our Tropicana Twister launch in India provided incremental growth as a whole new non-carb platform.</p>
          <p>In summary Q1 was a solid start to the year for PI with strong top line volume momentum continuing as we had in 2007.  Volume momentum is broad-based across the portfolio and I'm encouraged by the continued vibrancy of all of our markets.  As I look to the balance of the year, commodity cost inflation will certainly continue to be a significant factor to manage, however, we in the PI team are confident in our revenue management and productivity measures to help offset those headwinds and allow us to continue to deliver the profit growth rates I've spoken about in the past of mid teen profit growth.</p>
          <p>So with that let me turn it to Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike.  Good morning everyone.  We had strong operating results in Q1 with revenues up 13% and division operating profit up 10%.  However, as we discussed in our fourth quarter call, we experienced a few points of de-leverage below the line primarily as a result of mark to market accounting, and a higher Q1 tax rate.</p>
          <p>In Q1, the overlap on certain mark to market commodities for which we don't get hedge accounting produced a significant year-over-year delta.  We had a gain last year of 17 million, and a loss this year of 4 million.  Keep in mind that over the duration of the contracts, the mark to market impact on corporate cost is zero, with the hedge itself ultimately being reflected in division operating profit.</p>
          <p>In addition, our tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, which was up 110 basis points versus last year.  Yes, this quarter's rate was still below our full year guidance of 27.5%, but the benefit didn't impact our EPS of 70 cents.</p>
          <p>Finally our weighted average diluted share count declined by 2.5%, which reflected the impact of share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, we are on pace to achieve our full year cash flow and CapEx targets.  We expect 7.6 billion in cash from operating activities and $2.7 billion in capital spending.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders; 610 million in dividends and 1.5 billion in share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to our balance of year outlook.  As Indra mentioned our full year outlook for commodity cost inflation is 9 to 10% for total PepsiCo in 2008.  The gap versus the 6% guidance we had provided on the Q4 call largely reflects the continued run-up in prices for cooking oil, grains and energy over the course of Q1.  Importantly we now have forward purchases or hedges in place for a very high percentage of our requirements through the balance of the year with open positions largely reflecting the limited number of areas where coverage is not feasible.  As Mike and John have indicated, we've taken additional pricing and have tightened expenses in order to offset these higher commodity costs and those costs are impacting our competitors as well.</p>
          <p>I want to note that part of the increase in commodity prices is obviously a reflection of the continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, but we are seeing the benefit of that in foreign currency &#x2013; ForEx translation upsides from our international businesses.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to Q2 and the balance of the year we are expecting that the additional pricing, both in the form of visual pricing and weight-outs will result in slightly lower volume growth in our snacks business than we have seen in the past several quarters.  In Q2 there will be some puts and takes below the division operating profit line, primarily the lapping of mark to market gains we had the prior year, offset by the lower share count.  Tax rates for the quarter are expected to be relatively consistent with last year's.  With solid overall results in the first quarter with we are reiterating our guidance for the full year, volume of 3 to 5%, high single digit revenue growth, and EPS growth of at least $3.72 a share.  Which represents 10% growth off our core 2007 EPS of $3.38.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the commodity pressure you are seeing.  I guess my question relates to the fact that in years past you have had a great ability with procurement and supply chain to mitigate some of these pressures.  I wonder if you or Richard could talk about what's different now if it is harder to hedge or lock-up on key inputs as you become more global and what kind of factors we should consider as we look at ongoing inflation risks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, you know, I think what you are really seeing is, you know, we had come out with a 6% forecast for commodities and now we are at 9 to 10.  And really the issue is around, not fundamental procurement but around what's happening in the commodity markets.  And it's really related to what's happening in grains and in cooking oil and energy.  You know, we were largely covered in the first half of the year on those commodities as we normally would be, and we would, but we were largely open in the second half of the year particularly on grains and to some degree on energy.  And that was in keeping with where we would normally be based on crop cycles.</p>
          <p>It also reflected our view when you saw at the end of 2004 that there were huge spikes in grains and that, and at the beginning of 2008, and we were assuming that some of that would reverse as we went into 2008.  Not to prior historical levels, but to certainly to levels below the peaks that we had been seeing and clearly that didn't happen.  You know oil prices rose dramatically, vegetable oil, corn have also increased substantially above it.  So right now we have taken, as we said in the prepared remarks, we have taken significant coverage where we have forward purchases or hedges are available and that encompasses a large percentage of our requirements.  On an ongoing basis I think what you will see is us beginning to work a little bit harder and a little bit more diligently at trying to take more forward cover to the extent that we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc let me just add to what Richard just said.  The fact of the matter is, for many years now we have been operating in a deflationary environment.  So in the last 12 months or so, inflation is coming back to commodities.  In the last quarter, it has accelerated.  The unfortunate part is that all the pundits in the market who follow commodities and on whose opinion forward curves are set have all said that commodities prices are actually going to come down, and that's why you have seen forward curves actually lower than current spot prices.</p>
          <p>What we are doing now is rebuilding our commodity assessment capability in an inflationary environment which almost bucks the trend which the forward curves indicate.  So it's taken us a quarter or two to catch up and I think we have rebuilt that capability inside and that's why we have gone out and largely hedged for the balance of the year.  So it was just a question of catch-up.  And going forward, we are watching the commodity markets very, very carefully and we will start locking-up positions as and when we feel comfortable that we should protect the P&amp;L.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on Frito-Lay North America and again on the commodity outlook, you mentioned four points of rate in the first quarter moving toward high single digit balance of the year, and what kind of volume moderation are you building in, do you expect from that?  Because it is a significant change, as the consumer sees more of that visual price increase to deliver what you, what John had termed as appropriate operating profit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it is a great question, Bill.  John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.  This is John.  As you know our approach has been a combination of both weight-outs which as you know has zero elasticity because we don't see any unit fall off with the weight-outs although you do see volume fall off, and visual pricing, and as Indra said, we have taken some visual pricing in the first quarter and we are encouraged by the elasticity that we have seen so far on that.  The actions that we took on April 20th were on our &#x2013; primarily on our XXL sizes but did take some on our smaller sizes, the XL size. Those products are sold at full revenue in some cases and they are dealt on promotion in others.  We look at the relative value that we have relative to other salty snacks and to other macro snacks and right now everyone is pricing up.  We are very mindful of our gap to competition.  We are encouraged with what we have seen so far on the elasticity on the visual prices that we have taken.  And we would be honest to say that we do expect some volume fall-off.  We won't know until we get further into the quarter but we do see volume mitigating somewhat.  We reported 2% in Q1.  I think it will fall below that as we go forward.  But it will cover the cost and therefore return us back to the profitability levels that we expect to achieve and we watch market share as you know, every week, by channel by customer.  So we are mindful of our share position in the marketplace at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Bill, as you know, we also talked about price architecture, the fact that we are looking at it very, very carefully.  We'll start looking at what should be the right price pack architecture going forward and our expectation is that unit growth will still continue, even though pound growth will moderate quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up on the commodities.  I know '09 is a bit off but given that you had that coverage in place in the first half, if the spot prices don't back off we would assume some significant increases at least in the first half '09 that would be moving through the P&amp;L as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's what we are working through right now.  Again if you listen to the pundits, not the analysts, if you listen to the pundits the forward curves are still looking like they're going to be lower than current spot prices but trust me, everybody is focused on not just locking up 2008 which we have done but it is really focused on 2009 at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you very much.  So a question for Mike here.  We are seeing news about food riots related to rice and issues like that so can you talk a little bit about the overall food inflation environment in your markets, particularly more the emerging markets? What you are seeing on the staple side and how that impacts how you are going to be able to price to consumers over the next 12 months or so.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John. First of all again, so far literally to the day I have not seen a fall-off in any of our emerging market growth rates.  Keep in mind we have got a very diversified emerging market portfolio, so it is pretty broad-based.  I'm not really worried about one country or another.  A lot of what I think you are referring to John has been literally in the last two weeks.  So prior to that I would say, we were pricing mid single digits in developed countries and high single digits in emerging markets.  Also keep in mind the overall inflation rate in these emerging markets has been recently &#x2013; been in high single digits or low double-digits.  So it is not frankly that unusual or that different.</p>
          <p>Now in the last couple of weeks you are seeing some increases on staples as you mentioned.  But I would say, more than anything, that's impacting probably the bottom end of the consumer.  That is, those that are kind of on the margin from an affordability standpoint for our products to begin with.  So you know, at least so far, our volumes continue to be very solid.  You know, I keep a very close eye on it.  We have got some additional commodity costs issues to deal with and therefore some incremental pricing in Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>But again, at least so far, the economic activity in all these markets continues very strong and they are also, the other thing you have got to keep in mind if you take a look at the price of a barrel of oil in euros instead of in dollars you will see a quite different curve.  I mean the weakness in the dollar has exacerbated this for the United States.  In a lot of these emerging markets like Russia and India and China the currencies have been very strong and therefore the commodity cost impact has not been quite as severe.  We've had no supply issues in terms of our contracts and our expectations for the balance of the year and our innovation pipeline continues to be very strong.</p>
          <p>So, you know, I can only say so far, so good.  I'm on my way tonight to China, be in another emerging market over the weekend and next week.  But the markets I've been to and all of the words I hear so far are solid, but you know, you are seeing significant commodity cost inflation in the food basket.  There is no doubt about it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to add, John, in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia Venezuela, even Mexico, we've had to take pricing in those markets as well to cover inflation and today we really haven't seen much of a fall-off.  Our businesses, as we've reported, are very strong.  I just had a call on how we were doing so far in April and it's continuing to do well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Historically PepsiCo has been really effective in managing through cost inflation through a combination of pricing, mix management and productivity.  I'm sensing that maybe you are being a bit more reliant on pricing at this point and I'm just wondering first of all whether my assessment is indeed correct and secondly whether there are enough, you know, productivity buckets out there that you could continue to get savings to offset cost inflation and that being also part of, you know, the driver of offsetting the cost inflation in addition to pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we are talking about pricing for the first time.  It's been a while since we talked about pricing.  We've always talked to you about productivity.  That's why you never heard about pricing, Judy, because we have been in a deflationary environment.  Productivity is still going to be 25 to 30% of how we cover the commodity cost inflation.  But I don't believe anybody who is seeing 9 to 10% commodity cost inflation will cover everything with productivity especially in such a short time.  Productivity programs take &#x2013; major productivity programs take a while to implement and get the benefits from the system.  Yes, we have productivity programs, as we talked about, John talked about it in Frito-Lay.  All of that is going through the system.  It is giving us very robust savings.  And we are adding additional productivity programs as we go along.  But when you have run away commodity inflation, we have to cover some of that with pricing and that's what we are doing.  The good news is the elasticities are looking pretty good at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just a follow-up question to John, in terms of Frito-Lay North America margin progression going forward, it sounds like you are going to get all of the pricing in place in the third quarter so should we think about second quarter margin being down again and then that going up in the second part of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

And we see growth potential for the two combined which really represent the opportunity we have going forward, both from consumer appeal at some point as well as from a competitive advantage.  And the other innovation that we are bringing to the market is going to help had us significantly because new jug will have a much better functionality especially with our heavy consumers.</p>

          <p>Christine the Tropicana trademark is still awesome.  It is the strongest brand equity in the orange juice business.  All our brand equity studies show it is still the strongest.  It still has the leading share.  So if you took Tropicana, Naked and if you look at that whole business and the new Tropicana Pure that's going in, the innovation is all kicking in Q2.  Yes, last year, early part of last year we had a tremendous shortage of NFC [Not From Concentrate] orange juice so we couldn't really execute too much innovation but going into this year, Q2 and beyond you will start seeing the trends improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds like innovation timing. And then with respect to my broader question, Indra, on elasticity; given Frito-Lay and trends in beverages could you maybe explain the greater resiliency in snacks versus beverages for example in C-stores when the economy is softer?  Is there a way to kind of look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point we made, and John and Massimo will want to chip in, too.  Beverages are highly penetrated in C-stores there is a proliferation of beverages and a tremendous variety of them so you cannot get incremental space and incremental growth for beverages.  A lot of new products came in that cannibalized our existing products.</p>
          <p>Snacks on the other hand, our DST system takes snacks into the C-stores and snacks are more food-like, and so people actually when they switch from food away from home to food at home, actually buy snacks because they are food-like and there's a lot of opportunity to increase penetration of snacks in C-stores.  So that's why we are continuing to see snacks growth in C-stores.  And I think C-stores and foodservice are the only two areas where you are seeing channel softness which has actually contributed to overall category softness in Liquid Refreshment Beverages.</p>
          <p>John did you want to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christine, I would just add that that's the one channel, in the C-store, where the primary bulk of our business is the 99 cent line and we have not taken any visual price there, we took weight-out.  It is still a great value when you walk in the door. You couple that with good innovation with like Doritos Collisions that we launched plus the pre-packed weekenders that we put in the marketplace that helped us offset the decline in traffic by having more inventory in the store and that's why our growth was up around 3.5% I think as I reported.</p>

          <p>In the quarter you mentioned that you made a substantial increase, I think it is in your advertising and marketing investment at Pepsi International.  I was just hoping you could talk a bit about how you're thinking about the investment spend or your investment spend for the remainder of the year and just give us a sense of both your plans in the U.S. and out of the U.S.?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was up but so was our revenue.  Keep in mind our revenue was up over 20% I think.  And so our marketing kind of really goes proportionately with revenue.  I would say certainly from our standpoint we are making some important investments.  We launched Tropicana Smoothies in the U.K.  We launched Tropicana juice drinks nationally in China.  We had Chinese New Year, very aggressive marketing campaign there.  But you know, I would say our marketing approach overall is pretty consistent with prior years as we advertised around innovation particularly in the first part of the year and I don't know that there is anything else that would be unusual or extraordinary that I would comment on.  I think it was kind of driven by our new product launches.  But I mean it's pretty much growing in line with revenues.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. What are your top priorities with Lebedyansky I was hoping you could expand on the upside that you see for this business over the next couple of years and is this a business that you would expect to integrate further with PBG over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, thank you, Carlos.  I think that Lebedyansky is a strategic home-run for PepsiCo and for PBG as well.  It is the sixth largest juice company in the world and the largest juice company in Russia.  It is a group that has, I think both powerful brands, it has a tremendous infrastructure and capability in Russia as well as a terrific management team that is very entrepreneurial and very talented.</p>
          <p>In terms of the upside opportunities, we certainly have in our business plans some plans for aggressive procurement synergies.  We certainly think that between Sandora and Lebedyansky and our juice businesses there are significant opportunities on both packaging and on concentrate for some synergies.</p>
          <p>We also second of all believe on the cost front that there are synergy opportunities as the Siberia plant that they are building comes on-line at the end of the year.  And that will reduce transportation costs.</p>
          <p>Third, we certainly believe there are opportunities for top line growth in the area of juice drinks which is really quite nascent in Russia as a whole.  They have a new product called Frustyle.  It is off to a terrific start and I think juice drinks is a whole arena.  Smoothies, there are not any smoothies in Russia.  If I look at kind of our whole global kind of juice portfolio of products I've got enough new products to launch for the next 10 years in Russia from a top line standpoint.</p>
          <p>And lastly in terms of integration we certainly think that there will be selective opportunities particularly probably first in the more rural areas.  Let's say in Siberia, areas where drop sizes are lower will go faster in working with PBG on either integrating, distributors, warehouses or the go to market side.  But frankly, it is a large scale, very complex business in its own right.  So our intent is, at this point, is to look selectively for those integration opportunities.  I have no doubt at that we'll both benefit from best practice sharing and then I'm sure we'll find some opportunities as we go.  But really our business case has really been made more on the juice business in its own right and the juice drink business.  And I have no doubt both PBG will bring great expertise from their local talent on the ground and together this is going to be a great acquisition for us.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First a quick one for Richard.  In the past there was a no input that was more than 10% of your COGS.  I just wanted to see if that was still true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is still true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great.  And then the other thing, Massimo, to follow up you talked about AMP and that it was up about 60% or so.  Can you talk about your plan to either portfolio manage between SoBe Adrenaline Rush and AMP or is the plan to slowly phase out SoBe?</p>
          <p>And then just to expand on that; where do you see the incremental shelf space coming from for AMP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead, Massimo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as AMP is concerned it is our number one priority as I said, but we have absolutely no plans to phase out the SoBe Energy line extensions because they have a very specific benefit to consumers and they have a loyal user base.  So what you have seen is that we have launched first AMP and then we just recently added three more flavors.  And we are having the incremental shelf space because actually the whole category continues to grow and we have been growing shelf space.  Now as the new resets take place especially in the cold vault, we aim to increase our shelf space.  But we're managing the portfolio across the three &#x2013; out of three key offerings and multiple flavors and we'll continue to do so going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Bryan how are you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good thanks Indra can you talk a little bit about how the company is adjusting its approach to planning?  I guess thinking about '09 in the medium term you know, obviously the environment has been very volatile and very difficult to predict. Your long-term growth rates were set at a time when cost inflation was not really, you know, much of an issue.  So you know, is there something you are doing differently now in your planning cycle to try to get a better handle on it first?  And then second, does it make sense to chase long-term growth goals that at least in the medium that were set when inflation was so much lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bryan, I tell you we are in the middle of strat. [strategic] planning cycles right now and if we believed that the long-term goals that we have don't make sense we would be the first to come and tell you.  At this point, based on everything we are seeing, including our outlook for what's likely to happen in 2009 and 2010, we don't see any reason to back off our long-term goals.</p>
          <p>Why am I saying that?  We are pretty good at productivity initiatives and we have got lots of work going on, on how with we can take additional productivity.  We are very good at innovation, and premium innovation, definitely helps drive the top line and the bottom line.  Third, it's been a while since we have done a lot of price pack work especially in North America, because that's another area where you can drive top line and bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>And lastly, you know one of the things we all have to watch out for is not to write-off the commodity market and say everything is going to keep going up for the next five or 10 years.  Let's watch and see how it shapes up.  With grains in particular, these are not five year realization markets. In six months you can have the market turn in fairly interesting ways and as laws of supply and demand work with this sort of price inflation you should see more supply coming to the market and we are already beginning to hear of additional plantings around the world.  All that it takes is one action by the government on biofuels for 25% more crop to come into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So trust this management team to look at each of these issues carefully.  We'll look at innovation, visual pricing, price pack architecture, productivity, all of it very carefully and at this point we don't see any reason to back off the long-term guidance we have given you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bryan, this is Mike.  One other comment I would make though, and Indra mentioned it in her early comments, maybe it was not quite as clear.  But clearly in, for the procurement function we are clean-sheeting all of our practices, all of the advisors that we look to.  And there is no doubt that we are fine tuning our approach to what I call risk management kind of in the way we look at it in this kind of an environment.  So there are certainly some changes that we are driving.  I would say more on a tactical basis in terms of how we are doing our planning and that, to be honest with you nobody's crystal ball is perfect.  As Indra said, you know, there are a lot of factors at play here right now.  But I wouldn't want to you think that we are also not kind of re-looking at how we are looking at the commodity markets as Indra mentioned at the beginning.  Actually we've had a fairly extensive piece of work over the last 60 days going on in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bryan, one other thing I would add is, what we talked about in our international markets.  Our categories are so under-penetrated in almost all markets outside the United States excluding perhaps Mexico and the United Kingdom but our opportunities are tremendous.  Remember, we are not going after the CD and E consumer.  We are really talking about penetration with the A and B consumer who has the income to buy treats, to healthy &#x2013; the entire portfolio of products.  So we have a lot more growth in those international markets and we are just getting started.  So put it all together, our growth still looks pretty good.</p>

          <p>All of our go lives in both the U.S. and international have been absolutely flawless. We had teams doing tremendous work in, particularly in the first quarter we had a number of go lives at several of our Gatorade and Quaker plants.  They have all gone flawlessly.  Some normal bumps in the road that you would get in the first week or two but I must say the teams worked tirelessly on that.  We have had successful go lives by the way in two snacks plants.  The first two snacks plants in the world in Mexico with our project evolved down with Sabritas and that actually went very, very well.  In fact they had a review on that earlier this week.  We have had go lives in China and also in the Middle East with our non-carb business and they have all gone flawlessly.</p>
          <p>So far, in terms of the, any kind of operating disruption or whatever, these &#x2013; there really has been very little to report.  A couple of challenges in a couple of areas that we worked our way through, as you might expect.  Particularly in our foodservice business but to be honest it was fairly short-lived and really, the teams have worked tirelessly and have done a terrific job.</p>
