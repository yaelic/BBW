          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this Presentation of the Results for the First Quarter here in the BBVA Group. Today's order is going to be the usual one. First of all, we're going to be presenting the results. &#xC1;ngel Cano, our Chief Operating Officer will be doing then Manuel Gonz&#xE1;lez Cid, our CFO, and then we'll take questions.</p>
          <p>And again, the sequence will be what we usually do, first of all taking the questions from the room here, after which we'll take the questions that come in over the conference call and then at the end we will go through the questions that come over the webcast.</p>
          <p>For those of you that are here in Madrid we've got a coffee for you afterwards. So without further ado, I'll give the floor to &#xC1;ngel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome, as Carmen said, to this presentation of the BBVA Group first quarter results. First of all though, after 2009 when we hit a record level of in our net operating income I can now confirm what's been happening in our operating income in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Once again, we've confirmed that we are generating recurrent, sustainable operating earnings in the Group. And that makes it possible for us to go on shoring up all the quality and risk indices that we have in the Group. And once again in this quarter we are confirming that out performance is sound.</p>
          <p>So once we've got good operating results when your quality and your risk ratio has continued to improve, the third important point is to be able to confirm that the solvency and the soundness of your balance sheet are being confirmed. And once again, that is the case here in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Net interest income for the Group quarter-on-quarter has grown 3.5%. And we are talking about a quarter in which we still aren't being positively impacted by the kind of recovery we expect in most of the economies where we operate. As you can see, we're talking about economies such as Mexico. At the end of the year we're reckoning that the growth rate there will be significant, probably close to 5% in Mexico.</p>
          <p>We're talking economies like the United States, where probably the year-end growth should hit 3%, and the economies like Spain, where, although if you already know in our opinion, the growth will be probably flat or slightly negative in terms of GDP. We are seeing indications that there is a recovery of activity in Spain and here I'd like to stop just a minute to talk a little bit about a couple of things that I think are important at the moment for this quarter.</p>
          <p>If we look at what's happening in mortgages in the first quarter, the figure we have is &#x20AC;2 billion and that's the turnover we have, which is 25% more on these mortgages than it was a year ago. And it's also interesting to look at what's happening to consumer loans. Once again they've gone up 10%, over 10%. So we're seeing the first indications that some data, the data showing items on the balance sheet that are highly profitable and not so risky as some other items, and they're growing very fast.</p>
          <p>South America, once again is showing growth in lending activity. And to March, that's the first quarter, we see that the volume of lending is the same as it was last year because you remember it dropped off slightly towards the end of the year, 5%.</p>
          <p>So in general, our franchises are beginning to show indications of improvement in lending volumes, especially in consumer lending. And we'll have to see what's happening to lending to businesses. And so we've got that 3.5% and that is based on lending volumes that haven't yet been impacted by the positive growth we're expecting in most of the economies where we operate.</p>
          <p>It's very favorably impacted by the mix of our funds, especially the liquid funds that we have at the end of the quarter, which means that the cost of the liabilities in the growth, that's our cost of funding, has been going down quarter-by-quarter, which means that net interest income over ATAs will be growing again compared to what we've been seeing in the last 2 years.</p>
          <p>Another positive sign of recovery can be seen in fee income. Over several quarters, over several years, we've been seeing fee income dropping off but this quarter it's grown again. And above all, it's grown in fee income which isn't so much on funds, because funds have been hit by the general crisis. So once again, in all of our franchises we are showing a positive evolution.</p>
          <p>And now we can net trading income. Here for the quarter, as you can see, we've got more than &#x20AC;600 million of revenues here. 237 million of them have to do with 2 very specific things. First of all, the long exposure we have because of the devaluation in Venezuela, and then the second thing is the effect of the rotation of our ALCO portfolios.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2009 we had unrealized capital gains of slightly over 600 million. And we've closed the first quarter of 2010, after having generated these capital gains for 150 million, once again with 600 million of unrealized capital gains, which means that the impact of the rotation of the ALCO portfolios has been able to maintain the capital gains we had at the end of the year and generate 150 million more, reduce the volume of the ALCO portfolio against December by 10 billion. And we've been able to maintain the contribution of the net trading income from these portfolios for the whole of the year.</p>
          <p>We've been able to take advantage of these additional revenues generated this quarter in order to reinforce our generic provisions in Spain. And that gives us gross income which has grown by 8.4% over the quarter and it's not only relevant that it's grown 8.4%, it's also important to see the components. What are the contributions of all the different units that make up this gross income for the Group? And here the contribution could be repeated when we look at the net income later.</p>
          <p>Here we're talking about Spain bringing in about one third, South America bringing in 18%, despite the impact of the devaluation in the Venezuela, which has halved all the margins, Mexico bringing 26%, United States is already bringing 12% and Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management 10%. So we can see the large volume of gross income but we can also see that it's being contributed to by all the different businesses that the Group has.</p>
          <p>Our operating costs once again have performed very well, grown 2.3%. And here we shouldn't forget that they've been impacted by &#x20AC;60 million, which we have in this quarter but we didn't have last year, because of the sale of offices under the Argo project that we had last year and the incorporation of costs coming from guarantee. Otherwise this would probably be slightly negative or flat.</p>
          <p>That's been made possible because over the 12 months we've reduced our staff by 1.5%. And our network of branches, as we've been doing for some time, has gone down another 2.3%. As you can imagine, the excellent performance of gross income plus the performance that we have in costs mean that we've improved our cost-income ratio again and we've reached 40.0% at the end of the quarter. That's 2.4 percentage points better than it was one year earlier, which means that our operating income, having added to the gross income what's happened to costs, has grown in current terms 12.9%. And in constant terms that figure would be slightly more, probably 13.5%.</p>
          <p>It's not only important to see this growth in operating income but also to look at how the income and how the expenses have been performing, because we've been opening up the differences by 9 percentage points since the first quarter of 2008. So that confirms the quality of our revenues and our excellent cost performance.</p>
          <p>There are 4 points that I wanted to highlight here about our credit quality in this first quarter. The first relevant thing is that in this quarter there's been a sharp drop in gross additions to NPAs. And we've not only seen a sharp drop in gross additions, but also the management of recoveries has continued to improve so that net additions have continued to go down. Indeed they've gone down faster and faster. And that means that the NPA ratio is probably going to be stable from now on and it's stable at the moment against what we had at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Another thing that I wanted to confirm, as I said at the beginning of the presentation, is the quarter-on-quarter performance of the cost of our risk. It's not just the cost of the risk for the Group, it's also the cost of risk for the main businesses that the Group has. As you can imagine, and as I said before, taking advantage of these additional revenues that we've generated in net trading income and the generic provisions that we've increased, all of that has to mean at the end of the quarter an improvement in our coverage ratios.</p>
          <p>So the net additions to NPA have not only gone down, practically halved against the last quarter, and here in the last quarter we're not taking into account the incorporations which we considered to be subjective, what &#x2013; the extraordinary or one-off ones that we made. But we also have the gross additions which, if we compare them with the average of gross additions in the 4 quarters of 2009, we'd see a drop of about 12%. And more important still, the absolute balance for NPAs for the quarter has gone down &#x20AC;40 million, of which the main item was the drop of over 100 million in Spain.</p>
          <p>The NPA ratio after this behavior that we've seen, taking into account what's been happening to lending volumes, which have gone down slightly against the previous year, means that our NPA ratio is the same as what it was at the end of the year. And that was when we said that we thought that we had probably gone as high as were going to go.</p>
          <p>And it's true. Spain once again has got a 5.1% NPA ratio, despite the fact that there's drop of over 100 million in the NPA balances. Mexico's gone down from 4.3 to 4.1. In the U.S. we've gone up 2 decimal points but we think that probably this is going to flatten out from now on.</p>
          <p>And then the third point that I said I wanted to talk about is that the cost of risk has improved. And above all, it's improved in those economies such as Mexico and the United States where they had high volumes &#x2013; higher volumes last year. And as you can imagine, coverage has improved 2 percentage points from 57% such that it's possible to look at the year as a whole and feel quite comfortable about our capacity to keep on covering things with generic provisions.</p>
          <p>And that means that we can now present an attributable profit of 1.2 billion, which is slightly greater than the figure that we presented a year ago in the first quarter of 2009. And once again our returns in ROE and ROA, return on equity and on assets, it's looking very good, especially if we compare them against our peer group. As you can see, going from the net interest income down to the net attributable profit, a lot of the net trading income that we've generated and part of the net operating income is really shoring &#x2013; is being used to shore up the provisions for the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, once again we've been able to confirm that quarter-on-quarter we've been able to generate once again 20 basis points of organic capital which offsets the impact of the Venezuela devaluation at 7 basis points. And we there get 8.1% core capital at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>And so it's not just for the Group, it's also in all the different franchises in countries like Mexico that we've been able to issue 1 billion in Tier 1 capital, which will be Tier 2 for the Group. But anyway it's quality capital and quality issues, and that's very relevant.</p>
          <p>And apart from that, when we talk about one of the mainstays of the crisis and we confirm our liquidity position and look at what's happening to our peers and compare our performance against our own and theirs, if we look at our liquidity requirement or our maturities with all the peers and we compare it with our peers, we've got the lowest volume of maturities, not just in 2010 but also in 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>And we pretty well covered our main issues in 2010 in the first quarter. We were planning to make issues for the whole of the year and we've already made most of them and placed them. And we've got collateral available, probably over &#x20AC;66 billion which we can call upon whenever we need them. That's due to the kind of balance sheet we have, the kind of retail banking business model that we have in the Group.</p>
          <p>As a point of reference, one of the ratios that we're looking at by way of recommendations in the market to look at the stability of liquidity over the next 12 months, well we are over that. We're at 102%, which is way ahead of our European peers in NSFR. So we're very well positioned in order to continue to weather any storms that come, which is what we've been doing so far any way.</p>
          <p>So the conclusion is that once again we can confirm an excellent quarter. Here is says a good quarter but I think it was an excellent quarter in terms of revenues, in terms of our operating income. And that means that we go on shoring up provisions, it's been possible to go on improving all of the indices of our risk quality and go on increasing the soundness of our balance sheet in terms of capital and coverage and capital adequacy.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I think I'll give the floor to our CFO, Manuel Gonz&#xE1;lez Cid, and he'll give us the main data on our different businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll briefly or quickly go over each of our business areas in the bank and their performance in this quarter. Instead of doing a systematic review of each line of the income statement for the quarter, what we'll try to do is to show you the high points, both from our point of view and your point of view, in each of these areas of business within the results which, as the COO's just said, have been excellent results, both from an operational point of view and also from the point of view of the quality of our assets.</p>
          <p>In Spain and Portugal, starting here, what I would like to highlight are 2 issues. I think it's the performance of the trading income which is way ahead of our peers here in Spain, the net interest income. And then on the other hand, there's been excellent performance from the risk indices.</p>
          <p>These are the 2 issues that we would like to highlight here, so let's start with the first one, this positive performance from our net interest income. So we're increasing our lending share, especially with regard to purchases and mortgages. This has been going on for some months now but right now this increase in our market share is accelerating. It's really taking off which is showing that the bank is lending money and operating normally.</p>
          <p>And then on the other hand we're totally focused on the return. We're not focused on the volume of our resources but rather we're focusing on <mark type="inaudible" /> on the liability sides that are going to give us the greatest <mark type="inaudible" /> deposits and investment for mutual funds. And in both of these headings we're growing significantly and we're outperforming the market.</p>
          <p>This enables &#x2013; means that our net interest income over average total assets is 26%, which improves our performance in the third and fourth quarters of last year. So this clearly shows the difference between ourselves and our peers and how our net trading income is based on this mix of resources, means we still have positive margins in the area of resources, despite the financial crisis. And at the same time, we're gaining market share on the asset side.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to insist on what the COO said, March was the first time when we saw some positive signs of recovery in our business, especially in private customers. In mortgages, the COO talked about 2.464 billion in mortgages growth, in the turnover in consumer credit at 10%. So we're starting to see these signs and the feelings we get in April are very apt feelings, so obviously we'll have to wait and see what happens in the rest of the year to see if these are confirmed.</p>
          <p>With regard to the net interest income, here we have the performance of our net interest incomes in the final quarter of 2009 compared with the first quarter of 2010. And if we look at this, our net interest income grew by 0.5% if we talk only about Spain and Portugal. We're not talking about the whole Group, or even all the business in Spain. And we're not talking asset and liability management or the wholesale banking we're doing here, but we see that our peers don't have falls in the margin in this single quarter that have been quite significant, which indicates falls in the net interest income in Spain of around 10% for 2010 or even higher than 10%.</p>
          <p>Well in comparison with them, we've got a year-on-year difference in the net interest income in the first quarter of 2010 of 1.6. And if we were talking about our euro balance, including all the activities, these are our wholesale business, and all the asset and liability management, we're talking about a growth of 7.2%.</p>
          <p>So you can see there's an enormous difference in our net interest income with regard to our peers, which is in line with what we were saying at the end of 2009. And point by point, this is &#x2013; what we were promising, we are delivering on. And this is in line with all the data that we have with the performance of the margin &#x2013; the net interest income of other banks.</p>
          <p>Another important element on the expenses side, we've got a 1.1 fall in expenses in the year in which we reduced expenses by 6%, so it's not just 1.1% that hasn't been affected by cost cutting. It's 1.1 on top of something that we'd already cut by 6%. And I think this is worthy of mention and it shows the improvement in our business activities.</p>
          <p>And finally, the final point I'd like to highlight for you is the performance of Spain and Portugal has to do with all the risk &#x2013; the credit quality indicators. There's the gross additions to NPAs on the Group level. We have the data here for Spain and Portugal, which are significantly lower than &#x2013; we haven't included the fourth quarter &#x2013; what we had forecasted for that fourth quarter. We've showed the performance without anticipating results and for the first time we're seeing balances in NPAs that are falling in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>It's not an enormous difference, but for the first time we are seeing a drop in the NPA balances after 2 years of systematic growth in these balances.  And what is also important when we make comparisons, because the reporting system that we have has an NPA rate of 5.14 in Spain and Portugal, but if we normalize this or standardize this for all the data we have for our businesses in Spain for other banks, and if we include in this NPA ratio the properties in the homogenous perimeter, i.e., that includes the adjudication of properties, then we're talking about an NPA ratio, or a risk quality or problematic asset rate, if you like, because we're talking about all these damaged assets or impaired assets, including adjudicated properties, then we're talking about an NPA ratio that is much better than our peers, which shows the better asset quality that we have in the bank.</p>
          <p>We haven't made any preventative purchases of purchases &#x20AC;2 million, which is almost nothing in this quarter. And all the property that's been purchased is already associated with adjudications in the normal recovery of our NPA with record recoveries over more than the gross additions to NPAs in fact. And 60% of these, 60%, I repeat, were cash recoveries.</p>
          <p>So I think this is excellent news with regard to the performance of our business here in Spain and Portugal, and more specifically, the issues that could concern the market. We're talking about deterioration in the quality of assets and the net trading income &#x2013; net interest income. And in net interest income this is growing. And asset quality, unlike what's happening in the Spanish financial system, the assets are improving. And provisioning, unlike what's happening in the general system, we are increasing our capacity to provision.</p>
          <p>Mexico now. I think the most important thing in Mexico, there are 2 of these that I have to mention. As we heard from the COO, the expectations of strong growth, strong economic growth in the environment, these have been doubled since last we last spoke at the end of the final quarter, in comparison with the current situation when our research department are revising this up, their growth figures up. And the same is true with other multi-lateral agencies and other research departments that are doing exactly the same, they're raising their forecast for growth in Mexico.</p>
          <p>It's true that this still hasn't translated in a radical change in the dynamics of growth in lending, but as I said at the end of the year, this will happen in the second half of this year and we'll end up with growth in the lending activity of around 2-digit growth. So I think the second major piece of news with regard to Mexico is the improvement in the cost of risk and the NPA ratio, which is an excellent news from your point of view. So the first issue.</p>
          <p>Even in an activity with growing lending, even though this is relatively modest, we're still gaining market share in all areas &#x2013; in SMEs, in consumer spending and credit cards. If we look at the models that &#x2013; we're using the same model in mutual funds and return. Return, return, return. This is what we're focused on at the moment, in Mexico.</p>
          <p>So in this context of a general improvement of expected growth, and if we now look at the quality of our assets, we can see a reduction in the NPA ratio which isn't &#x2013; you can't see here, but it's true. All the information is in the leaflets. Then the additions to NPA are falling this quarter, recoveries are improving in the quarter and the cost of risk, which is falling significantly over the quarter, in line with what we had suggested, because we ended up with a cost of risk of 580 basis points.</p>
          <p>The average last year was 540, approximately, and we're starting this year with a cost of risk of 403 basis points, which is a significant improvement. So all the trends that we've mentioned with you at the end of the year with regard to the expectations of improvements in the indicators for the quality of risk, with a deterioration in consumer and credit card portfolio, is all actually coming true, as you can see, exactly as we had forecast.</p>
          <p>South America now. The important issue in South America is the excellent pool performance in growth and everything. The business activity's increasing. The income statement continues to show something that you never see, such as growth rates of over 20% in all lines. And maybe this is the headline that we'd like to highlight and leave with you, with regard to South America.</p>
          <p>This was an excellent year. Apart from the excellent growth rates, this was an excellent year. We're talking about growth in the operating income of 26%, attributed profits of 21%, with improvement in the cost-to-income ratios of over 3 points. So we've got cost-income ratios of under 40% and a cost of risks that are quite stable, without any kind of significant deterioration in the indicators of risk quality. And the expectations are going to improve in many of the countries of South America. There is also the changes in expectations in interest rates over the year. So all of this makes us optimistic with regard to the performance of our business in &#x2013; throughout the year. So South America's performed very well, significant growth in all lines in the income statement and clear signs of improvement in volumes in many of the markets.</p>
          <p>United States now. What we'd like to highlight here are 3 issues. First of all, the progress that is occurring with regard to rolling out the BBVA model in our U.S. unit, where we've made major progress in this quarter with regard to the integration process and the process of normalizing all our management in the United States within our Global group.</p>
          <p>And the second piece of good news is the improvement in the expectations for growth that are occurring in the United States. The indicators are being revised upwards. Multinational agencies are reviewing their forecasts and our research department is doing exactly the same thing with regard to economic growth, where Texas, moreover, has been reinforced in relative terms in the recovery process for the American economy.</p>
          <p>And finally, what we'd like to highlight is that the bank's results are improving significantly from an operative point of view and we're still talking about a context of moderate growth in volumes, especially on the lending side, which makes all of this even better.</p>
          <p>So we were talking about the integration of the U.S. within the BBVA model and this has taken its final step, if you like. So here we have the integration of guarantee in February. In just 6 months after taking it over, we're talking about an integration, for the sizes we're considering, is a significant  714,000 customers, 164 branches in different states.</p>
          <p>So a major effort has been made. All of this is strengthening our position in growth markets where all the guarantee branches are operating with the &#x2013; under the Compass brand and all of this is working in all the distribution channels, ATMs, Internet, et cetera. So this is a done deal.</p>
          <p>And with regard to developing the new technological platform that has to be rolled out in the United States in order to promote our business model, with regard to the BBVA model, we're also starting to see the signs of things working out. The cross-selling of new customers has grown by 25%, commercial productiveness is 7% growth, customer spreads of 7 points above, which is improving our operating results.</p>
          <p>And finally, another important issue is the incorporation of the New York branch to our U.S. management model, depending &#x2013; it's dependent now on the country manager. And within the matrix dependency of Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management globally, which is another major milestone with regard to bringing everything on line in the U.S. in line with our operation model all over and here we have the results.</p>
          <p>So we've here the net interest income, although economic growth is still weak because it hasn't translated into growth yet, but there is a 9.7% growth in net interest income. Fee income has increased by 5.4%, despite absorbing all the measures that we're taking about reducing some kinds of fees and commissions in the U.S. in order to support our business model and an operating income that's grown by 6.4%. And this would have been double-digit growth if it hadn't have been for the New York branch, which is slowing down the operating income.</p>
          <p>The cost-income ratio is 58.7, which is 20 basis points better than last year. And once again, this is in line with regards to bringing Compass in line with our cost-income standards here in Europe. And then we have the cost of risk in the United States. We started with the first quarter with a cost of risk of 1.52, which is even lower than our forecast for the cost of risk for the year as a whole. We were expecting cost of risk of around 200 basis points for the year as a whole. So this cost of risk is another sign of improvement.</p>
          <p>Now the performance of the NPA ratio, which is exactly the same as we've seen in December with a slight slip in commercial real estates from the construction side, because as you can see in the details of the different NPA ratios, this is where we really find the NPA in Compass with SMEs, retail, behaving or performing fantastically with regard to NPA ratios. And what's important is 57% of all this NPA is in construction, has been provisioned or charged off through impairments and charge-offs.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; all these improvements we've seen in the different units. And we've sold $270 million in properties in the United States for the first time, a sizeable operation with capital gains of $6 million, which makes us feel very comfortable with the charge-off process for the impaired assets. Things are coming back to market value, which enable us to mobilize our balance again, which is another important point.</p>
          <p>And finally just to round up, there are 2 brief views I'd like to give you, Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management. Here we have the recurrency and high quality of our revenues, the recurrent revenues and high quality, which together with all the other business areas shows the diversification of our businesses and geographies the Group has at the moment.</p>
          <p>In corporate and investment banking, aimed at major corporate customers and providing services for them, the net interest income in a context of falling lending rates, in a context of very few investment projects in CapEx in companies and companies improving their capacity of generating liquidity and cash, we're using re-pricing to see a 17.4% increase in the net interest income, or a 61.7% increase in fee income from this world of customers.</p>
          <p>With an operating income that's grown 35.2% and the weight of fees in the gross income is 41%, which will be difficult to improve on. And in the context we're sort of seeing with corporate clients, these figures speak for themselves. And then Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management, I think the most important thing here is that it's been an excellent quarter with an operating income of 140 million when the average for operating income in 2009 was 95.</p>
          <p>So this is &#x2013; it doesn't compare very well with the same quarter last year because that was a very strong quarter but it is just showing a major improvement of the average for 2009. It's certainly outperformed our forecast for the quarter. And furthermore, we need to bear in mind that these results are more quality than the results we saw last year in that 67% of the results are totally associated with the customer franchise, whereas last year the first &#x2013; in the first quarter only 45% of the results were associated with the customer franchise.</p>
          <p>So the weight of the leverage or the results from trading or the market situation were far more important last year than this year. And this also highlights how our Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management is really focused on customers.</p>
          <p>Looking to &#x2013; giving an overall picture now, the headlines would be, as our COO said at the beginning, to reinforce the messages that he gave us from a Group point of view, we see the improvement in operating results and greater quality in each business unit. We can see these &#x2013; we can clearly see these signals that suggest an improvement in volumes. Obviously this remains to be confirmed but we are starting to see signs of this. And of course there also been a general improvements in all the indicators for credit risk such as NPA rates, net additions and recoveries.</p>
          <p>So I will now handover to the COO again.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't get up, if you don't mind. But I did want to look at the final screen conclusions. Myself and Manolo have both been talking about the main aspects that characterized this quarter. And perhaps we should go back to the previous quarter or the previous year when we were looking at the market and there was a lot of pressure because of the environment, the crisis, the effects of certain countries in very difficult positions.</p>
          <p>And at that time, we thought that it would be timely to carry out an exercise of prudence and responsibility by looking towards the future and trying to clear things up and to tackle the most difficult lending problems before the year ended, which is precisely what we did. So now what's important is to confirm how the Group's been doing.</p>
          <p>We're still in an environment, as you all know, which has been badly hit in financial terms &#x2013; well the financial sector has been badly hit by the effects of widespread problems. But the Group is able to separate itself out from what's happening in the environment as a whole. Perhaps the main characteristic, thanks to the diversification that we have in the Group, is that we have a well-distributed business.</p>
          <p>You've seen one third of the revenues come from Spain and Manolo said that about 45% comes from emerging economies. Well emerging economies not emerging in the way we're used to understanding because emerging means that they have passed the test of the crisis. Maybe half of the economies in the emerging economies haven't seen any drop in growth rates to the end of 2009 even.</p>
          <p>And that diversification has been supported in 2010. If we look at the average growth that we're expecting for all the countries where we're operating, we're expecting an average growth of the economies of 2.1%. Consequently this characteristic, which means that we really stand out, leads us to the main conclusion which is that, even in this kind of environment, we can stand out and stand away from what's happening everywhere in the &#x2013; else in the environment.</p>
          <p>So that means we can look forward to the future with optimism as we get through the different quarters. We still haven't received the positive impact that Manolo was talking about of the important growth that we're expecting to see for all of the economies that we're operating in for the year as a whole. So we look to the future with optimism and we can continue to be prudent or maybe cautious, call it what you will, in the way that we do an active management of all the critical items that we have in all the different franchises quarter-by-quarter and month-by-month.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, strong, sustainable, recurrent earnings that guarantee a future which we will be able to feel comfortable and optimistic without yet having received this positive impact, which we know will be coming because we've already seen indications that it is coming in nearly all of the franchises where we are operating, so you can be absolutely sure that they will arrive.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I'd like to invite you to put forward your questions. As Carmen said, let's start off with the questions here in the room and then we'll move on to the conference call and the webcast.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let's open the Q&amp;A session here in the room then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Irma Garrido from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n. Thank you and congratulations for that exercise of anticipation at the end of last year. We know it was anticipation and not anything else. I have 4 questions. The first one has to do with the Group's exposure to public debt in Greece and Portugal and how have you classified it? The second question has to do with the maturities of the Group's debt in 2011 and 2012. I think that in 2010 you've already given us the information. And then the third question has to do with the U.K. It seems that at the beginning of May we might be hearing the results of the sale of the Royal Bank of Scotland's branches, so I wanted to know what your attitude is to that. What are your plans in that geographical area? And what could we expect if you manage to get this deal, or if you don't, in fact? What should we expect BBVA to be doing? Do you have a plan B, an alternative way of getting into the U.K.? And what would the implications be for the returns for the Group as a whole? And then the last question is, what would costs in Spain and Portugal look like without the sale in leaseback operation? So what does that mean in terms of the increases in the costs of the branch network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Public debt, Portugal and Greece. As we said in December, the balance that we have in Greece and Portugal is almost immaterial. We have very little exposure to it at all and it will have no impact on our income statement whatsoever. Because don't forget that in any event we have a portfolio of 27 billion in the euro zone with 600 million in capital gains at the end of quarter. Two thirds of these capital gains are covered. So they're not going to affected by whatever happens in the market. And apart from that, we have another 400 million in capital gains in the ALCO portfolio in the U.S. and Mexico which makes us very comfortable with the management of our ALCO portfolio.</p>
          <p>Maturities. Maturities for 2011 and '12 for Wholesale Banking are about 10 billion on average. It's 12 billion in 2011 and 8 billion in 2012, so the average maturity would be about 10 billion over the 2 years. But these figures are well below the figure that we've seen in previous years. The effect of the cost of sale and leaseback before taxes would bail out 30 million per quarter because in Spain and Portugal we want these to accept the cost of equivalent to renting or leasing their branches. Whether it's they own it or rent it, they have to assume a market cost for their branches in their planning.</p>
          <p>And with regard to your question, Irma, about the U.K., issues that affect market rumors, because all of these market rumors. Nothing definite has been said. We never talk about these things but what we do, do is analyze existing opportunities and it's true that in 2009 and in 2010, of course, there are far more opportunities in the market but we really can't say anything about whether we're going to take advantage of any of these opportunities. But when we talk about opportunities of this kind, it's always a question of being able to buy sufficient critical mass to get &#x2013; that will generate strength right from the beginning and basically it would be retail. That would be what we were interested in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions from the floor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Eva Hernandez from Morgan Stanley. I have several questions for you. And the first one deals with your net trading &#x2013; no, your net interest income. We've seen they deposit war that's become even fiercer in recent weeks. The fact that you haven't taken part in this war, does this mean you've lost out in the deposit balance in the first quarter? And does &#x2013; has this led you to change your view? Are you willing to compete more in this context? Have you changed your view with regard to the growth or the fall in the net interest income in Spain in 2010? And my second question concerns bonds. As you told us the figures on Greece and Portugal, maybe you could tell us something a bit more about the balances in Spain. Have these increased in September? And then looking at the income statement, you said that some of the trading gains have been allocated to generic provisionings but other gains have been quite high. Are there any special charge that you haven't mentioned? And finally, maybe you can give us the details about the property developer's portfolio and what's the NPA ratios? And also the assets that you bought and the percentage of provisions. Maybe you could give us some details on those 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's coverage basically, right. Okay. Should we start with Spain then. Okay then, Spain. And when I say Spain I'm answering what you asked about the net interest income and this war to raise deposits. We have made it very clear that getting involved in a battle for deposits, paying prices which are approximately 2.75% above the market rate, clearly it's really attacking your net interest income quite directly. So there are a couple of things. It is bad for your deposits really, it's bad for your balance sheet, it's bad for the net interest income for the Spain and Portugal area but Spain specifically here. It's what we're talking about. And this isn't an item if you look at term that in our experience of the market really generates customers. Okay, it brings in some money and that money normally, on the basis of our experience, isn't difficult to get. It's not difficult to get money, not customers, when prices go up. But then if that price increase goes then you don't have a customer.</p>
          <p>So what we think is important is to establish loyal customers doing cross-selling, segmenting our customers, which is what we do in Spain, such that our commercial policy for each customer is different, depending on what products they have and what each of the products they have is contributing to the balance sheet in Spain. And there might be amounts sold product-by-product that would look different, but what we look at is the overall picture for each customer. So we've don't think that it's positive policy to go out and undermine your own net interest income in the bank by raising deposits at any price. And we don't need to do that because we never have being using wholesale markets to fund our bank instead of customer deposits. So this is irrelevant to us really in general, not only for the first quarter but for the whole year as well.</p>
          <p>What about bonds in Spain, Manolo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You're asking about the figure for the portfolio for the interest rate management, that 27 million figure that &#xC1;ngel just gave. Well one third is sovereign debt here in Spain, Spanish bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then provisions in general, you asked about. If we look at the provisions, we've got 125 million in generic provisions and about 40 million additional provisions, adding to generic provisions in Mexico and another 30 million, once again, generic provisions or not allocated yet in South America, plus 75 for early retirement and plus 18 for other pension funds. So our provisioning has been pretty intense. And then the developers' portfolio, that loan book closed 7 billion at the end of last year and now we're at 17.4. The NPA ratio, which was 17.6, is now going to go down to 16.1. And that's basically the changes against the final quarter of last year. And then maybe you can talk about property and real estate, Manolo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yes, we've got 2 million in purchases of property which we can consider to be preventive purchases. And we've got 510 purchases coming from foreclosures, so those are adjudications we got either through the courts or directly through foreclosure procedures which we consider to be normal. In the quarter in Spain we've sold 60 million in property. That was in real estate from our foreclosed properties and coverage is 33%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jerners from Goldman Sachs. I have a question that starts on Page 6 of your presentation. And I think in Q4 you've very nicely laid out the contribution of your ALCO book to your net interest income and to your total revenues as well. And can I just ask you what that number is for Q1, i.e., the total contribution? And then the second question on the same page, how do you define rotation of your ALCO book? Am I interpreting this correctly that this is just selling a bond on which you've got an unrealized gain and then reinvesting it? But I assume that, that reinvestment then is done at a market yield which, by definition, would be somewhat lower. Is that correct or not?</p>
          <p>On page &#x2013; my third question relates to Page 26. When you talked about the net NPA balance going down for the first time, and I agree, I think it's a very encouraging development, I just continue to wonder why we haven't seen the pace or the volume of write-offs pick up as well? So if I look at the write-off number in Q4, I think it was roughly 1.15 billion and the write-off volume in Q1 is down sharply &#x2013; well, sharply, it's down to roughly 900 million. So as this NPA portfolio ages one would expect the write-offs to pick up as well and that would be the major driver of falling NPA balances, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Just wondering why that is?</p>
          <p>And then just finally, and I guess you won't be able to get away from that question now for a while, Greece, Portugal, to a lesser extent Spain, do you expect the rating agencies to take similar actions on Spanish sovereign debt, i.e., a downgrade in the near future as you've seen with some of the countries mentioned previously, obviously ending up at the higher level, but still. Then the second question, I think you very nicely highlighted that there is no direct exposure to Greece through sovereign &#x2013; holding sovereign paper. What's the second round exposure? Do you have &#x2013; does BBVA have bilateral interbank exposure to Greece banks or to Portuguese banks? What the volumes is there?</p>
          <p>And I think finally, what is the impact of downgrading Spain or widening spread for Spanish paper and hence the funding cost of BBVA, if you're able to size that? I guess a relatively philosophical question at this point, but still. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's worth coming for Madrid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anyway, we thank you very much to come to Madrid.  We are very grateful for that. The ALCO portfolio to the net interest income &#x2013; [Spanish language]. Sorry, I am going to answer in Spanish. Sorry for that. Okay. I'm going to answer in Spanish. The contribution to the net interest income of the interest risk management portfolio in this quarter has been fully in line with the fourth quarter of last year. We're talking about contributions of between 8 and 9%. 8, 9%. So it is important, but it's not the fundamental driver of the net interest income, either in the case of the euro or in the balance of consumer as a whole. For the year as a whole, this contribution will be very similar, by the end of the year, to what we saw in 2009. So it's not going to be highly positive or highly negative. It's going to be highly stable.</p>
          <p>With regard to our rotations of financial management portfolios in the euro balance, basically the reason for this is not to generate capital gains and to support the income statement, but rather to give an active management to the portfolio in a highly volatile scenario in sovereign risk and protect the economic value of the portfolio for the bank as a whole.</p>
          <p>So this portfolio will continue to protect the economic value and the net interest income of the Group in a context of such low interest rates and with very small increases in our volumes, as we're seeing at the moment. And we've acted strongly. We've sold 20 billion in bonds and we've bought back, in different formats, about 10 billion. A significant part of these sales, the 20 billion, have been forward sales, i.e., these are done over time, so what we're trying to do here is to protect the economic value of the portfolio without damaging the performance of the net interest income in the short term.</p>
          <p>And because of this rotation, we've increased the duration by one year so it's now 4 years, the duration. And this means that with a very &#x2013; a worse portfolio, we're generating the same kind of margin that was generating before, having gone through the 150 million in capital gains, having gone through the income statement and having 600 million additional in capital gains in the portfolio. And two thirds of the 600 million are protected, i.e., they're sold forward.</p>
          <p>So these are not affected by the volatility in sovereign risk that we're seeing. So quite honestly, we're proud and comfortable with that management and I think we've done the right thing. This is a not a portfolio that is supposed to be rotated, but in scenarios such as the ones we're seeing at the moment, I think this is the right way to manage it.</p>
          <p>Managing NPAs in Spain. We said at the end of 2009, the end of the year, with regard to Spain. First of all, in our opinion, if you analyze the capacity of payment, and especially in the world of developers or companies if you like, what we wanted to do first of all was to &#x2013; all the bad side that we're going to see on the table, unclassified and out in the open. From there, we've seen in the 3 -first 3 months and not just the first 3 months, but also the fourth month as well, in April, almost at the end of the April, we're seeing trends that the net additions, month by month, are falling. I think that this confirms the fact that the peak that we saw when we closed the 2009 we can continue to confirm, with as far as Spain is concerned.</p>
          <p>A second important piece of information is the NPA is not affected by any kind of management, as Manolo said in his presentation, any kind of special additional management, in order to give it a makeover in presentation with regard to default ratios and stuff. The important thing is, if we look at this 1.8 billion that we've classified as subjective doubtfuls at the end of last year and if we analyze what would have happened by March if we hadn't classified them as such, the NPA figure, apart from the 1.8, this would have included 360 to the NPA balance.</p>
          <p>So as Irma said before, clearly we've anticipated this, which doesn't mean that we've misclassified 1.5 billion in December, but rather in the coming quarter part of this, a small part of this, we're seeing some of this in March. So what you will see in the financial sector in Spain, the peaks in NPAs, we're going to see them in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. We think we've seen them at the end of 2009. So we're ahead of the game.</p>
          <p>Now your question about a possible downgrading, S&amp;Ps or any other rating agencies, with regard to Spanish sovereign debt. As you know, Spain has a AAA rating in Fitch, in Moody's and we're in AA+ with some negative in Standard &amp; Poor's. This some negative means that in x month's time, the rating agency could downgrade the rating or eliminate their negative outlook and could &#x2013; they could be a AA more stable. So we're waiting for this rating. But the market knows about this and they've known this since the last Standard &amp; Poor's review, so it's not really a problem. I think the important thing is the &#x2013; and this is where your question's going, in my understanding, is what's the impact will this have on funding costs or with regard for our assets held for sale, or available for sales.</p>
          <p>From the point of view of funding cost, we were talking with Irma before, we have maturities, wholesale maturities for the coming years because this year is all done. But what we're looking forward to is an average of 10 billion, so we're talking about an increase in costs of 1%, will be 100 million, so we're talking about an impact of the net interest income on the Group of about 0.8% for 2011. So I don't think it's very important. If we were talking about the impact that this could have at the moment, part of our portfolios are mature and some are available for sale. So a radical impact from the risk point of view would raise the risk curve by an entire point constantly, not just over a single day or something, but constantly.</p>
          <p>This would have an impact of reducing our capital gains, where we're not factoring in the ones that have been covered because, obviously, if it's hedged or covered the impact would be less, but just to show you the sensitivity, you were talking about 400 million. There would be sensitivity to this. So the impact on our capital ratios, our capital requirement ratios in Tier 2, would be about 12 basis points. So in the worst-case scenario, neither the cost of funding or the impact on underlying capital gains of our portfolios, especially with the hedges we have, we're not going to see an impact that we can't deal with. It's unimportant, quite honestly. There's going to be a very slight impact, if any.</p>
          <p>And then balances exposed to Portugal and Greece, this is the same as the balances that we have with banks in Portuguese or Greek banks. There's nothing very important that's going to have an impact &#x2013; very, very small impact. Material &#x2013; it's not material impact. Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm from JB Capital and I have several questions for you. And the first one comes from what Irma was saying, taking over the branches in the U.K. Forgetting about operations that you're not going to talk about, I think the market is a little bit disoriented with the news, whether you're interested in U.K. Some say that you're interested in banks in the U.K., some that you're interested in a bank in Turkey, so maybe you could give us a bit more color. You said that you're not going to tell us &#x2013; you're not going to buy anything that won't give you a critical mass, which would seem to rule out an operation in the U.K. Maybe you can reiterate your strategy, BBVA strategy, at the moment and what kind of markets are you looking at, if any?</p>
          <p>So that's my first question. The second question concerns your dividend policy. The message that you put across was quite a strong message, with good results looking forward. I don't know whether the Group feels sufficiently confident to increase cash peer ratio, or maybe things aren't quite so good &#x2013; the cash payout ratio. And then the third question is about the tax rates. In the Mexican newsletter, you said there'd been an increase in 2 points. It was 27 for the whole Group and it was 22 in over &#x2013; in recent years. So what can we expect for this year?</p>
          <p>And the final question is the movements in generic provisionings. You seem to have allotted 200. The total balance, in comparison with last quarter, is a drop in the 100s, so you've got a release of 300. So could you tell us what's happened in Spain? Maybe you can confirm whether my view is correct or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe the last is the most simple. Yes, yes, you have sum &#x2013; you have added and subtracted correctly. Non-organic growth, as Irma said before, we really can't talk about these things. We can't talk about rumors in the market. But, just as I said about the critical mass, we had an experience in Brazil, for example. We had 10% market share and you just can't really generate shareholder return with that kind of mass. So when we talk about critical mass, we mean enough mass to be able to generate value as soon as possible for our shareholders. So it would have to be that kind of transaction.</p>
          <p>So the second thing, markets. There are some markets which are obvious, like the United States, where we're constructing a business model that Manolo has already described. And you've seen the consolidation of this model with the data we gave. So once we've got the full integration of the latest incorporation, which is the guarantee bank, into the Group, we will be working with that platform. And as Manolo said, without that kind of platform, it would be hard to grow fast in the U.S. And we know exactly what the timing will be for the deliveries from June, September this year and throughout the year, taking advantage not just of the construction of the platform in the U.S.A., but also constructing complete modules for the platform in Spain.</p>
          <p>It doesn't make sense to reinvent things, so you're not going to start from scratch if you've recently done things in Spain that you can take advantage of in the U.S. So we can take those modules and use them in the U.S.A. and it helps us to roll out our business module. We're talking about modules which are very oriented towards the front end of the business. So we do segmentation, cross-selling with our customers and immediately react to their needs and avoid this excessive focus on product, which we might have seen before. I really can't say much more than that.</p>
          <p>When we talk about growing markets, we're talking about growing markets in the next few years that are going to be outgrowing the markets in the developed world. In China, for example, we've been talking a lot about China in the last few years. And we've already signed up joint ventures with CITIC, as you well know. And we've also got the new vehicle that we've signed up for, for car financing.</p>
          <p>So there are opportunities in markets that are going to outgrow other countries, but on a permanent basis, not just on a one-off peak. So that's basically our position &#x2013; but anyway, we're in no hurry. We shouldn't forget the Spanish market either, Luis. With all the volatility in the financial sector in Spain, we will be on the lookout for any opportunities that may arise, but we're not in a hurry. We're always going to be prudent, as we always are with everything we do. We're going to study things properly.</p>
          <p>Now dividends. We said at the end of last year that we'd probably touched rock bottom in our payout and that's a clear indication that we're not going to go any lower. And as you said so correctly, we are looking at the sustainability of our revenues and our profits, which is what we've been reporting on. But talking about increasing them, it's not the time now. Until the end of the first half the year, we won't even start to analyze the first interim dividend. But when the time comes, we definitely will explain what we're doing to you and how we took the different factors that we took into account.</p>
          <p>Yes. And then you asked about the tax rate. The tax rate in the quarter, as you said, was 27%. That is higher than what we were reporting in other quarters, but you should take into account that the profits for the quarter don't have dividends or any substantial charges because of booking special items under the equity method, so there are no big one-offs. And that actually puts up the average rate because of the quality and the recurrency of our revenues. And it's important to say that the tax rate in Mexico, under the new regulations with respect to income tax, is between 28 and 30% now. And that doesn't impact this quarter, but that explains why that's gone up &#x2013; sorry, that does impact on this quarter, which explains why it's gone up. So that probably, I think, clarifies the situation as a whole, doesn't it?</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. Javier Bernat from Caja Madrid Bolsa.  I'm going to try and keep it quick...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I forgot there was another part of the question which Luis wanted to know about. I'm sorry, I forgot something. The tax rate, in terms of what we're expecting for the year as a whole, we think it will be about 25%. That's probably reasonable average for the year as a whole. I'm sorry, I forgot about it. Javier, go ahead. Yes, sorry.</p>

          <p>The first question has to do with customer spread. It's gone from 280 to 273 in this quarter and it's been going down last year for all the banking industry. Do you think the tend over the next few quarters will continue? Or do you think that it will flatten out? Second question, CITIC, what will your capital consumption be on the investment in CITIC going up from 10 to 15% stake? And what has the quarterly contribution been to these earnings? And then your exposure to Portugal. Could you be more specific about its impact on your earnings, either in Spain and Portugal or in the Group as a whole?</p>
          <p>Then Mexico. I read in your booklet that you're talking about an expansion plan for the next 3 years. Could you perhaps give us an idea about the growth in operating costs? Will they grow in line with inflation? Or will they be a little bit higher than inflation? And how long will the plan last? Chile, have you had any extraordinary charge because of the earthquake? I'd imagine that there will be something, if there hasn't been.</p>
          <p>And then more generic matters. If the 1.7 billion in net income that you've got in Spain and Portugal, that coincides &#x2013; does that coincide with the same amount that the Group has set aside for provisioning its loan book? I mean, is that just pure chance, or is it intentional? And will it continue to happen for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And now this question, you said if the operating income for the Group, I didn't understand &#x2013; no, for Spain and Portugal, that was &#x20AC;1.76 billion. And it pretty well coincides with the 1.78 that's been earmarked for provisioning in the consolidated accounts, so I'd like to know if that's on purpose and will continue.</p>
          <p>And then in general, I noticed that the CFO said that the bank is, in a way, going countercurrent to what the competitors are doing. So today's results are excellent. Would you say &#x2013; well the impression I got perhaps, could you add color to this, is this wishful thinking when you talk about what's going to happen in the next few months?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Customer spreads, first of all. And the fall in customer spreads is closely associated with the type of mix in the growth in lending and also customer funds. So with regard to the growth in lending in domestic business, the growth in lending these days is built on purchase mortgages and institutional businesses, buyer mortgages, home buyers, small businesses. These are the ones that are falling in the growth in lending and this is what we've been seeing for some time now, for several quarters. And this means that the spread in the investment is smaller with regard to the investment mix.</p>
          <p>And on the side of the customer funds, the environment is there are many institutions &#x2013; this was the final question that you did &#x2013; and these institutions are currently working with negative or liability margins. But the yearly rate, to give you the best possible comparison with regard to the liability margin, is about 1.12. And we're seeing liability campaigns that seem to be remitting. Our people in the branch networks are telling us that they had &#x2013; this is remitting. So we're talking about negative margins of about 300 points or 280 points. So the cost of deposits is above any kind of margin that would generate any kind of lending. And that really explains the reduction in the customer spreads.</p>
          <p>In our case, the situation is significantly better because we're offsetting the mix effect by a major re-pricing and active management of the balance, especially in institutional area, which is one of the areas which is growing. And given the spreads demanded by the market, we can do this and we're using that and, moreover, given our focus on growth on site deposits, we're also generating positive margins in &#x2013; on liabilities. In fact our margins on the liability side are not deteriorating. In fact in this quarter they've improved slightly. This has cost in terms of growth but what we're trying do is to protect this margin. I think what we're going to see as the volumes increase and we see &#x2013; if the signs of improvements are confirmed then we'll see recoveries in the customer spreads. But this will not happen in the banks that &#x2013; with aggressive campaigns in the cost of liabilities because this will deteriorate, which will means that their customer spreads will continue to reduce.</p>
          <p>The message that we're trying to get across for the results that we're presenting now is that Spain is not the same for everybody. Spain's performance &#x2013; Spain is not performing in the same way for everybody. So I think it's important to make a difference between the strategies that each bank is using and the results of these strategies. It's not a question of what we're trying to do, these are just facts. Our net interest income has increased in the first quarter of 2010 and that is very different from the reports that we've seen so far. It's not just wishful thinking. These are facts. And our expectations for the year as a whole, as we've suggested since the end of last year, is that our net interest income can be maintained. It can stay flat throughout the year in Spain and Portugal. We're slightly more optimistic now, especially if the situation with regard to this liability will remit a bit and the market starts to react, then I think the situation can improve. But it's not wishful thinking, these are facts.</p>
          <p>This differs us from &#x2013; distinguishes us from our peers. Our strategy is better. We have access to wholesale financing in the market at very competitive prices and the cost of funding has improved substantially over last year. Others don't have access to this wholesale funding. We also have asset masses that we can re-price that others can't. And our structures for protecting our portfolios against portfolio risk is &#x2013; we have things there that others don't have. And that's why our net interest income is improving rather than deteriorating like our peers.</p>
          <p>And the importance of Portugal is pretty limited, I can't remember the figures off the top of my head but I don't think it's more than 10, &#x20AC;15 million maximum. That's in that order of magnitude. We have quite a low profile in Portugal, as you know. We don't have a big operation there. It's really more accompanying our business in Spain more than anything else. Yes. Then the contribution of CITIC would be 50 million under the equity method. That's on the 10% because the other 5% isn't going to be incorporated until the 1st of April so that extra 5% will begin to kick in as of then. And then capital consumption was 12 basis points, was it, Manolo? 20 basis points approximately. So that's the impact which will come in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And you talked about Chile, if there's any special charge there. No. There's no special charge because of the earthquake. It did have an impact on some of the offices. But we're talking about material damage and it wasn't especially relevant in terms of materiality. And the country as a whole, well there there's been a slowdown in the expected economic growth for the first half. It's going to go down 0.5 point. But they will probably offset in the second half. And in the first half of the following year it's probably going to take off even more. Our research department say that if you add up '10 and '11, it goes up 0.5 point more after the earthquake because one of the issues there, and I was there the next day, is that the country and the government decided to reconstruct and to take advantage of the problems in order to modernize the country, especially in the worst parts of the country that were worst hit. And what you said about the coincidence, yes, it was pure coincidence. We don't need to say anything more about that.</p>
          <p>And then you asked about costs as well in Mexico, didn't you. That's the final part of your question. Mexico, as you know, in 2009 we made an enormous effort to reduce our expenses. And at the moment we are seeing signs with expecting improvements in business volumes in the environment. So there is a 2-pronged strategy. We want to maintain exhaustive control on maintenance costs. That's for maintaining the franchise as it is at the moment. And then we also want to have additional costs to provide possibilities for the franchise to be able to take up any growth opportunities that occur.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, the expenses in Mexico, talking from memory, I might be wrong, are growing about 6%. When the ongoing costs &#x2013; we're not talking about the growth of the franchise but more the recurrent part of the franchise, they would be growing just at 2%. So if we maintain growth, if we look at the recurrent part of the growth of the bank, that's going below inflation. Those expenses are growing less than inflation and any additional costs are to get ready to take advantage of the expectations of growth that we have in the Mexican economy. In the short term, Javier, that is. Well in the medium term that's what we're expecting, to take advantage of this growth which isn't part of ongoing growth. And any short-term increases have to be financed with the increases, opening branch offices, working more with businesses and in consumer lending. And then the following year, the second year, it will get to the cost-income ratio in the country and it has to be funded with the income that we're generating from those openings and taking up these opportunities in Mexico.</p>
          <p>I think we can finish here. I don't think there are any more questions in the room, are there? Are there any questions over the conference call? I would think we've already run out of time there. Any questions on the conference call?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a couple of questions but I can sum them up in one because of time pressure. Mexico, it's clear that in general the numbers are quite a bit better. It's not raining as hard inside as it is outside. My question has to do with revenues in Mexico. You say in your quarterly report that the 6% impact that you talk about and net income &#x2013; the net operating income &#x2013; net trading income is still down and total revenues are going up 5% year-on-year. If you take the way the currency impact it's minus one. Taking into account what you said, that Mexico is clearly recovering and that you're gaining market share, et cetera, quite honestly I would have expected the numbers to look better. Is there any special reason why revenues in Mexico haven't yet taken off? Are you expecting them to take off in the second half of the year maybe? Do you think the volumes will pick up then or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why aren't we seeing higher revenues from Mexico still, et cetera? You'll have to excuse me but the sound was not very good and it's difficult to understand exactly what you're saying. So in my understanding you were talking about the performance in revenues in Mexico and you expected greater growth at this quarter. At the end of 2009 &#x2013; I'd just like to remember you some of the trends that we saw in 2009. We saw that lending activity in the first half of the year was falling off and at the end of the year it had started to pick up again in parts. So we said that for 2010 our forecasts were that volumes were going to &#x2013; lending volumes were going to grow, which would be in line with the growth of the Mexican economy, because we're talking about an economy that was going to grow at just under 4%. That was at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now we've revised our forecast and we think that it's going to be grow clearly more than 4%. And this means that the impact of the economy last year, in the end there was a fall in 6.8% in the economy. And this had an impact on our revenues so the recovery to get back on track, as we said, this would take &#x2013; we would see more in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. But this is fully in line with our expectations at this time of year, including all the tax issues. We'd budgeted this in. We knew that this was going to happen so we factored it in for 2010. But the contribution from Mexico, the increasing contribution is what we'd forecast and this has come as no surprise to us. The positive surprise to us is the greater growth at the end of the year than what we forecast at the beginning.</p>
          <p>So in Mexico we're continuing to see &#x2013; we get the same sort of feelings from Mexico. And I think the upside here is that, right from the first quarter, we're confirming the cost of risk which has improved which is even a bit lower, including with the generic provisions of &#x20AC;30 million. It's still slightly lower than we expected for the year as a whole. So I would say that everything is in line with our expectations. The cost of risk is slightly lower than expected. Mexico for the year as a whole is better, our forecasts are better than what we forecast at the end of last year.</p>
