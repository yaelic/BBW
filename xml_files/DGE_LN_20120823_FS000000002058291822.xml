          <p>Thanks for joining our webcast. Today, Diageo is stronger than it was a year ago and the results we released this morning show that very clearly. We've increased our presence in the fastest growing markets, with acquisitions in Turkey and Ethiopia, further investments in China and Vietnam and 15% organic net sales growth. We've continued to invest in powerful and engaging marketing, our spend was up 8%, and was focused on our strategic brands and the growing number of middle class consumers worldwide.</p>
          <p>We've strengthened our routes to market, from bringing greater focus to our distributor relationships in the U.S, to implementing a new distributor model in Brazil and our acquisitions bring root to market synergies. We've announced investments which can deliver the major growth opportunities of the future. In the next five years, we're going to spend &#xA3;1 billion to support the growth of our scotch brands, especially in Latin America, Africa and Asia. We've agreed the acquisition of Ypi&#xF3;ca, the leading premium cacha&#xE7;a brand in Brazil and we've delivered efficient growth. Top line growth of 6% drove 9% operating profit growth and led to operating margin expansion of 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>A year ago, I set out our expectations for the medium term based on the fundamental strength of this business, the increased returns we were driving from our investments and our sharper focus as a result of the organizational changes we made in 2011. In fiscal 2012, we've continued to invest to make sure this business is well positioned for the future. We have strengthened the business and that gives us the confidence to increase our final dividend by 8%. I will return to these things in more detail during this morning's presentation. But first, I'll hand over to Deirdre.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 performance reflects an improved growth trajectory as our emerging market business delivered double-digit growth and North America and Europe both reported a better rate of growth versus 2011. Importantly, we delivered that growth efficiently with increases in both gross margin and operating margin. As expected, our performance in the emerging markets was key, delivering three quarters of our growth. In Western Europe, we managed the challenges of Southern Europe and drove good growth in Northern Europe.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have delivered a steadily improving trajectory driven by U.S. spirits and beer. By category, scotch grew double-digit led by Johnnie Walker. Excellent growth of C&#xEE;roc and Smirnoff drove a similarly strong performance in vodka where we delivered double digit growth in North America, Latin America and Caribbean and Africa. The return to form of Captain Morgan in North America combined with growth of nearly 20% in the rest of the world drove 8% net sales growth in rum.</p>
          <p>In beer, strong growth in Africa, double digit growth in Southeast Asia and a successful launch of Guinness Black Lager in the United States drove 5% net sales growth. Price increases, together with over 20% volume growth of our Reserve brands, delivered four percentage points of price mix. We've also sharpened our focus on cost even further and delivered the cost savings we had identified. Together with our increased scale in the developing markets, our attention to cost has delivered operating margin expansion.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have increased our investment in brands and our route to market. Our free cash flow was &#xA3;1.6 billion. This allowed us to fund our acquisitions and increase our dividend while maintaining our balance sheet strength. Operating profit growth and our acquisitions produced EPS growth of 13%. These results demonstrate the underlying resilience of our business. We have leveraged the growth of the emerging markets and capitalized on the improved market conditions in North America. At the same time, we have successfully navigated challenges in Europe and in the developed markets in Asia.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to take you through our fiscal 2012 performance in more detail. Let's start with net sales, where growth has been driven by our focus on strategic brands and emerging markets. Overall volume growth was driven by the strategic brands, led by our biggest brands with Johnnie Walker up 7% and Smirnoff up 5%. In developed markets, excellent performance by C&#xEE;roc, Captain Morgan, Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker drove 2% volume growth of our strategic brands and that meant we held volume in these markets.</p>
          <p>Much stronger volume growth in the emerging markets was again driven by the strategic brands, but we also delivered growth from popular value brands such as Senator Keg as we expanded geographic and consumer reach. Innovation is a key contributor to Diageo's growth. This year, innovation had the biggest impact in the developed markets, C&#xEE;roc Peach, the new Smirnoff flavors and Captain Morgan Black Spiced in North America and Baileys Biscotti and Captain Morgan Spiced in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific all delivered positive price mix during the year, while Europe was flat. Price increases on Johnnie Walker in a number of markets including WestLAC, Venezuela and the Middle East fueled gearing in scotch which delivered almost half of our total price mix.</p>
          <p>Our emerging markets delivered eight percentage points of price mix. This was driven by scotch, mainly Buchanan's, Old Parr and Johnnie Walker Black, price increases on our beer brands and also by 20% growth of spirits in Africa as we diversified our business there.</p>
          <p>Our premium plus brands delivered half of our net sales growth, driven by our premiumization strategy. In North America, broadly half of our business is now at premium plus price points. And that was key to the four percentage points of price mix we delivered in North America. Diageo's successful innovation agenda played an important role in delivering this gearing because a lot of the years' launches were introduced at higher prices than the parent brand.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific, our focus has been on driving super premium scotch. Johnnie Walker Black Label and Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe brands drove price mix. And that demonstrates our increasing ability in the luxury arena.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, price increases on Buchanan's in both Andean and Mexico, and growth of super deluxe scotch in our free trade zone customers drove premium plus performance in the region.</p>
          <p>Even in the challenging economic environment in Western Europe, we achieved double-digit growth from our Reserve brands across the region. Our 6% organic net sales growth was boosted by the acquisitions we made during the year, principally Mey &#x130;&#xE7;ki. We are very pleased with the performance of Mey &#x130;&#xE7;ki. The business delivered &#xA3;291 million net sales, and Yeni Raki and Istanblue Vodka both grew share in their respective categories.</p>
          <p>Diageo brands are now fully integrated into the Mey sales organization and we believe this will give us a great platform for both local and international spirits growth.</p>
          <p>Following our very strong 7% growth in the first half, our second half performance continued to deliver on the same underlying trends. In the first half, we had benefited from better market access in Venezuela and Turkey which flattered performance in Latin America and in Europe.</p>
          <p>In North America, the U.S. spirits category improved in the second half and our performance was strong. In Western Europe, the second half performance was broadly in line with H1. Weakness in Italy and Ireland continued. Spain remained tough and Greece was weaker in the second half as we destocked about a month's sales. We'll continue to monitor stock levels in both these markets.</p>
          <p>In France, the excise tax increase reduced net sales in the second half, but net sales in Germany, Benelux and the Nordic accelerated in the second half.</p>
          <p>It's really tough to predict individual market trends for Western Europe, but I do expect that fiscal 2013 could be more difficult than fiscal 2012. In Africa, the first half benefited from 25% growth in East Africa, as Senator was rolled out to new markets. In the second half, we have delivered double digit growth in all markets except Nigeria.</p>
          <p>Also in the second half, the Korean whisky market was weaker as was the consumer environment in Australia. That did impact our second half performance in Asia Pacific. In emerging Asia, shipments were negatively impacted by route to market changes in a couple of Southeast Asian markets, but overall trends in emerging Asia remained strong.</p>
          <p>Strong brand equities are the platform for our future growth and we continued to invest significantly behind our brands, re-balancing investment to our strategic brands and to the emerging markets. 90% of our incremental spend was on our 14 strategic brands, primarily Johnnie Walker, C&#xEE;roc, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Guinness. Johnnie Walker investment focused on Johnnie Walker Red Label's largest market, Brazil. There we launched a bespoke Giants campaign.</p>
          <p>Support behind deluxe and super deluxe scotch in Asia Pacific was in line with our strategy to drive recruitment and premiumization. Increased spend behind Smirnoff centered on Smirnoff Nightlife Exchange in North America and Western Europe. We directed Guinness investment towards the launch of Guinness Black Lager in North America and to Guinness in Africa and Asia.</p>
          <p>70% of the incremental marketing spend was in emerging markets. We increased spend on strategic brands by 15% and we invested behind our strong local brands, for example, upweighting investment behind Harp in Nigeria and the launch of Tusker Light in East Africa. This gave us 9% growth in beer in Africa. In Latin America and Caribbean, the spend reflected our breadth in scotch. We put investment behind a range of brands from Haig Supreme and Old Parr in Colombia to White Horse in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In developed markets, we maintained spend in North America and focused it on the priority brands in line with our strategy. The new operating model in Western Europe has allowed us to improve the effectiveness of our marketing spend. We create campaigns at a Western Europe level and focus investment behind long-term growth opportunities. And while we have reduced marketing spend in Southern Europe, our strategic brands have the right support. We demonstrated that support by continued investment in Greece with the Johnnie Walker Keep Walking Greece campaign. Overall, Diageo marketing spend increased by 30 basis points to 15.8%.</p>
          <p>As you saw, we drove strong net sales growth and significant price mix. Through cost efficiencies, we held our unit cost increases to around 3% which was half of the underlying inflation we experienced. Asset rationalization and footprint changes we have made as part of our reorganization reduced costs in Scotland, Ireland and North America. And efficient sourcing delivered a significant savings this year of around &#xA3;50 million.</p>
          <p>For fiscal 2013, I estimate the input cost inflation will average around 4%. We will again look to halve the impact on unit cost increases to about 2%.</p>
          <p>In developed markets, the move to a single market approach in Western Europe and our changes in North America to further align our business with our distributors drove operating margin improvement. In many emerging markets, we have reached scale so our net sales grew faster than our investments in infrastructure. Consequently, the margin of our emerging markets business grew, with improvement in two-thirds of the individual markets.</p>
          <p>That efficient growth delivered 60 basis points of organic operating margin improvement, while at the same time we continued to grow marketing investment and improve our emerging market footprint. Our reported operating margin increased 70 basis points, reflecting the higher margin of Mey &#x130;&#xE7;ki.</p>
          <p>We again delivered a high level of free cash flow, funding our investments and supporting our strong balance sheet. Working capital increased broadly in line with business growth. But finished goods stock levels were higher in North America and Scotland at the year-end in order to manage temporary stock disruption from the supply footprint changes we are making. Some of that will unwind in F 2013.</p>
          <p>Debtors were up as a result of the increase in excise duty payable in Europe. Higher interest payments were driven by the year-on-year impact of renegotiating certain interest rate swaps. Higher tax payments reflected settlements we reached in the year. The increase in capital expenditure is a result of our continued investment in capacity in Africa and Scotland and of supply footprint changes in North America to drive efficiencies. For fiscal 2013, I expect the level of increase to be about the same.</p>
          <p>Moving now to exceptional items, business restructuring costs were &#xA3;96 million and the cash outflow was &#xA3;158 million. I expect a further charge of about &#xA3;50 million in fiscal 2013 with a corresponding &#xA3;80 million cash impact.</p>
          <p>In China, we now have majority control of the Quanxing Holding Company. That triggered a change in accounting from associate to subsidiary. This was the main component of the &#xA3;147 million gain we recorded on sale of businesses. It is the gain on the re-valuation to market value of shares purchased prior to 2012 when our Shui Jing Fang investment was held as an associate.</p>
          <p>As we said in our half-year results in February, tax authority negotiations during the year concluded, resulting in a favorable change to the taxation basis of certain intangible assets. This resulted in an exceptional non-cash write-off of the related deferred tax assets of &#xA3;524 million. That write-off was partly offset by the tax on other exceptional items.</p>
          <p>And finally, other exceptionals was mainly a pension credit on our UK pension scheme as we moved from RPI to CPI-based increases, offset by a brand impairment charge on Cacique, mainly due to the tough environment in Spain.</p>
          <p>Closing net debt increased to &#xA3;7.6 billion. That was mainly down to the acquisition of Mey &#x130;&#xE7;ki. Despite that increase in our debt, our finance charge was flat year-on-year. Let me take you through that. Total finance charges were flat year-on-year at &#xA3;397 million. Net interest charges increased slightly. Our effective interest rate reduced to 4.7% but that was offset by the impact of higher debt levels.</p>
          <p>During the year, we issued fixed rate bonds totaling $2.5 billion. They replaced three bonds maturing in the year and about $600 million of commercial paper. Next year, we expect our effective interest rate to be 4.9%, as this refinancing secured favorable fixed rates into the longer term but reduced our need for commercial paper, which is currently at very low rates.</p>
          <p>Other finance charges fell from &#xA3;28 million to &#xA3;15 million mainly due to a &#xA3;10 million reduction in the IAS19 charges in the year. For fiscal 2013, I expect other finance charges, excluding the impact of IAS21 and 39, will be about &#xA3;45 million, as the IAS19 charge will increase this year.</p>
          <p>And finally, moving down the income statement to EPS. EPS, excluding exceptional items, was up 12.7%, driven by organic operating profit growth and our acquisitions. Here is the route map we showed you last year. As these results show, we are right about where we want to be on the journey we've mapped out. Our 6% top-line growth was driven by the very real momentum we have in our emerging markets, by the strength of our North American business, and by the way we have managed the challenges in Southern Europe and developed Asia. 60 basis points of operating margin improvement demonstrates the delivery of efficient growth, which is key to the achievement of our guidance, improving operating margin as we drive efficiency and fund our growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are also well positioned to deliver our EPS guidance with 13% EPS growth in the year. Taken together, you can see that we're on track to deliver our medium-term goals. As Paul said, this is a stronger business as we enter the new fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll hand you back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Deirdre. I'd like to return to the theme I began with, that Diageo is a strong business which is getting even stronger. Our strength comes directly from the combination of our global and local brands across categories and our depth within these categories with leading brands at each price tier.</p>
          <p>Our strength also comes from our global reach of the business. Our strong position in the developed markets is built on both our leading position in the U.S., the world's most profitable drinks market, and on our integrated business in Western Europe, which gives us a very strong route to market in a challenging region.</p>
          <p>Our investments are building comparable strength in the faster growth markets. In F 2012, we increased net sales by nearly &#xA3;1 billion and 85% of that &#xA3;1 billion was from sales made in these markets. In 2011, we made changes to the organization to improve our agility. Those changes sharpened our focus and quickened the speed with which we identified, invested in and delivered on individual growth opportunities, and that's driving faster growth.</p>
          <p>I'll use our performance in scotch as an example. Scotch is our biggest category and Diageo is the world's largest scotch company. Scotch accounts for almost 30% of our sales and this year it drove more than 50% of our organic growth. Our performance in Latin America was the biggest contributor to that growth. The Latin American team have succeeded because they drew on the strength of the global business that they are part of. They're agile. They're alert to each and every consumer and customer opportunity.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, for example, Diageo is the category leader. This year, we activated our whole scotch portfolio in one Whisky Festival campaign, with global brands such as Johnnie Walker and J&amp;B alongside local brands such as White Horse. Our Whisky Festival was launched in 2,000 on-trade outlets and 4,000 off-trade outlets. It was the number two trending topic in Brazil on Twitter. It had over 5 million Facebook impressions, generated 15% increase in off-trade depletions.</p>
          <p>The brands' strength, global reach and the agility I'm talking about have driven our F 2012 performance. But in addition to delivering this strong performance, we've also invested and made this business even stronger. Again this year, we were focused on these three areas and I'll take each in turn.</p>
          <p>First, increasing our business in the faster growing markets. We've made a number of important acquisitions that are firmly in line with our strategy. We bought brands which gave us access to premiumizing local spirits categories. And we bought businesses which will improve our route to market.</p>
          <p>In Vietnam, we increased our stake in Halico in the year to over 45% through a public offer. We also increased our stake in Shui Jing Fang and we can now consolidate the business. This year, we've also expanded the brands' route to market outside China and our premium baiju is now even available in the UK.</p>
          <p>In Ethiopia, where we see high potential, we acquired Meta Abo. Meta Abo is a premium beer brand and the second largest in the country. So we also gained a strong route to market for our international spirits brands. In addition to our acquisitions, we've also strengthened our existing business in these faster growing markets. We've invested another &#xA3;100 million in beer capacity in Africa and we're launching brands such as Tusker in new markets.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we've applied the model of our Asian supply finishing center, creating one for Latin America based in Panama. In Brazil, we've used our North American distributor-led business as a model. And we are moving to dedicated distributors to improve our service levels to small and medium-sized retailers. This will allow us to expand the number of on-trade activations we do and get our innovations to market much quicker.</p>
          <p>These investments drove our organic growth in these markets with net sales up 15% and operating profit up 23%. It is the strength of our brands across the categories which has delivered our growth. Gin is having a renaissance, up 3% on the back of strong performances of Tanqueray and Gordon's in Europe. We think this is a category to watch in F 2013.</p>
          <p>Rum was up 8%. Captain Morgan delivered a stronger performance in North America and we continue to build its footprint in other geographies. Over half of Captain Morgan's net sales growth came from outside the U.S. Super premium rum is a great category and Zacapa is leading that performance, up 35% in developed markets and 78% in the rest of the world, led by Latin America.</p>
          <p>In beer, Senator led the way in Africa, followed by Guinness, Harp and Tusker. Guinness also performed well in North America and in Asia Pacific. Vodka was up 13% with a return-to-growth in developed markets and footprint expansion in other markets. And scotch was up 12%, 18% in those markets where we see increasing prosperity. And we had a fantastic performance in North America with 15% growth.</p>
          <p>We build leading brands through industry-leading marketing and I've spoken to you before about our approach to marketing. We invest in the four areas that we believe will deliver the highest long-term returns. Marketing innovation, changing the way we engage with consumers through pioneering marketing in the digital and entertainment space; reaching out to new consumer groups; tailoring our messages to recognize a broader range of consumers such as the 50-plus, multi-cultural populations and women; broadening our range of price points from the value to the super premium end; and, tailoring our marketing and our product offering to connect more effectively with the growing number and rising incomes of emerging middle class consumers around the world.</p>
          <p>Let me start with another example of our innovation in marketing. We've taken a new approach to our very successful Formula 1 Step Inside the Circuit campaign. Working with a specialist agency, we gave Formula 1 broadcasters access to our branded, behind-the-scenes video content which they then used in their TV and digital coverage of the races. The result was a TV audience of over 170 million across 150 countries, with a media value of &#xA3;17 million, all for an investment of &#xA3;80,000.</p>
          <p>As I'll come back to when we talk about innovation, female consumers are underserved by the range of beverage alcohol products that are available. As a result, marketing in our industry has traditionally had a male voice. As you know, Diageo has done a lot to change that and this year, we stepped up our activations even more.</p>
          <p>A great example is our Johnnie Walker campaigns. In the Lebanon, a big market for Johnnie Walker and one which is a trend setter for the region, we have featured a female Lebanese film director, Nadine Labaki. She tells her story. And we're working with Christina Hendricks, the star of Mad Men and a Johnnie Walker fan, in a campaign that works for both men and women.</p>
          <p>More than ever, our marketing is reflecting the different price points we offer. In markets like South Africa, we have achieved arms reach pricing, making status brands such as Johnnie Walker available in smaller measures at an affordable price and communicating this in marketing such as the Step Up campaign. At the super premium price point, advertising which reflects the super-premium credentials of new launches, such as Johnnie Walker Platinum, and cross marketing initiatives with equally iconic brands, such as Porsche, all target the world's most affluent consumers.</p>
          <p>The fourth pillar of our marketing is reaching out to the new middle-class consumer. Here, I'm talking about advertising which resonates with their lifestyle and ambitions. This example from Brazil is one of the best. It's true to our Keep Walking campaign, but it's truly and uniquely about Brazil. We launched on Facebook and it became an Internet success before it went live on TV. A top ten, most watched, best rated video in the first week. It achieved double the consumer awareness of other Brazilian spirits advertising to drive high-teens growth of Johnnie Walker and make Johnnie Walker the strongest beverage alcohol brand in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to innovation, our four priorities for innovation are shown here and they continue to drive our success. Innovation is key to premiumizing our brands, Captain Morgan Black Spiced is a great example. Made with molasses and spices, it is a darker Captain Morgan and it's a tribute to Captain Henry Morgan with an inner label which reveals the story behind the captain's death as the liquid leaves the bottle. We launched Captain Morgan Black in North America at a 35% price premium to the core brand and the brand is now enjoyed in a more masculine, whisky-type occasion.</p>
          <p>Innovation can spur growth in developed markets at a range of price points. The launch of Guinness Black Lager for example, has improved our performance in beer in the U.S. and Parrot Bay and Smirnoff Frozen Pouches have been a very successful first step towards creating a substantial new frozen category.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the new middle class consumer aspires to brands but may not yet have the money to afford them. Innovation which provides premium products at affordable prices is therefore a key growth driver. Rowson's Reserve is our newest launch in prestige Indian-made foreign liquor. And in Latin America, Haig Supreme is an affordable scotch, but with all the premium cues of an international brand.</p>
          <p>As I said a minute ago, we need to offer more choices to female consumers. In North America, we've had great success with recent launches of Authentic Cuervo Light Margaritas, and zero-calorie Margarita mix. And the same growth drivers apply equally well in the world's faster growing markets with the emerging middle class consumer.</p>
          <p>In Kenya, for example, women told us they didn't like drinking beer in the entr&#xE9;e. The packaging and the liquid were viewed as too masculine. So we launched Snapp. Snapp is a premium crisp apple tasting drink that provides women with a more stylish and sophisticated alternative to beer.</p>
          <p>I'd like to show you a clip of one of our recent Snapp ads.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation] (34:45-35:15)</p>
          <p>Moving now to our routes to market. We look at routes to market by brand and by market. At a brand level, for example, we're expanding C&#xEE;roc's route to market by positioning the brand in the top 250 high-end accounts worldwide. And on this slide you can see a C&#xEE;roc bar actually in H&#x1ED3; Ch&#xED; Minh City.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe following last year's reorganization, we operate as an integrated market. That has improved our focus and given us better leverage of marketing and customer spend. It led to the creation of our customer collaboration center. We've hosted over 100 meetings with customers and we've experimented with in-store and in-bar activations which will unlock growth. We're now expanding the collaboration center based on customer feedback to include a future lab specifically designed to facilitate collaboration with our customers earlier in the innovation process.</p>
          <p>In North America, the next stage of NGG is now in place. We have national leadership in our strategic distributors and a 10% increase in the number of dedicated sales people. A strong sales team of nearly 3,000 focused on our growth drivers: on-premise: multi-cultural; and innovation.</p>
          <p>From January through May, we've already seen distribution increase by 30% for some of our key brands in those accounts which we identified as having an opportunity for greater focus. By increasing our share of menus, our share of volume in the top 5,000 accounts is three times the share of our nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>Our stronger route to market was also reflected in the success of our innovations. Smirnoff Whipped Cream Vodka was the most distributed new brand and Diageo had three of the top five most widely-distributed innovation brands as measured by IRI.</p>
          <p>Strengthening our routes to market includes working more closely with our customers to create new sales opportunities. As part of this initiative, we're using events to drive in-store sales. Take Father's Day. Now Father's Day is celebrated in many markets, but consumers spend 30% more on Mother's Day, a clear opportunity to redress the balance and make whisky a thoughtful gift for dads. We scaled this insight quickly over 20 markets in Africa, Western Europe and Latin America with point-of-sale material tailored by brand, by market and by customer.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we went a step further. Using +More smartphone technology, we gave consumers the ability to personalize their Father's Day whisky gift. By scanning the +More code on the bottle, consumers can create a custom-made film with their own photos and messages. When dad receives the bottle, he scans the +More code to see the film and both can share the gift with their friends on Facebook.</p>
          <p>We've loaded a video of how it works on our website. Do have a look at it later. Our acquisitions brought us great brands. But they've also improved our route to market because the broad distribution of these fantastic brands expands our footprint. Our biggest acquisition this year is our best example. Mey &#x130;&#xE7;ki gave us not only Yeni Raki, the clear category leader in the largest spirits category in Turkey, but we also get a distribution system that covers more than 80% of all outlets, 80%. This will significantly improve access for our international brands over the next few years.</p>
          <p>And in Latin America, we've now completed the acquisition of Ypi&#xF3;ca, a premium cacha&#xE7;a brand with a distribution network of nearly 250,000 outlets. That will expand our presence in the Northeast of Brazil, complementing our international spirits footprint in the South.</p>
          <p>Now before I finish, I'd like to talk about Diageo's commitment to the communities where we operate. We have a strong track record and I'm sure you're familiar with our long standing Water of Life program in Africa, our Learning for Life program in Latin America and our commitment to responsible consumption campaigns.</p>
          <p>This year, we've taken some of these initiatives a step further by involving our consumers in these initiatives, for example, Buchanan's Share Yourself campaign. After giving four hours of their time towards selected community projects, 6,500 consumers were invited to exclusive concerts in Caracas and Bogota. You couldn't buy a ticket, you had to do the volunteering project to get one.</p>
          <p>So our results this year again demonstrate that Diageo is a strong business getting stronger. We've increased our presence in the fast-growing markets of the world through both acquisitions and through strong organic growth. We've enhanced our leading brand positions through effective marketing and industry-leading innovation.</p>
          <p>We've strengthened our routes to market, working with our distributors and customers to expand our footprint. Our organic growth this year of 6% top line, 9% operating profit growth and 60 basis points of margin expansion is a strong performance. Taking all this together, we have confidence in our business and in our medium term guidance.</p>
          <p>The economic environment is likely to remain challenging in many parts of the world. But as we move into F 2013, we are a better business than we were a year ago. That will give us real resilience in this new fiscal year. And it's that resilience that gives us the confidence to increase the final dividend by 8% this year. Thank you.</p>
