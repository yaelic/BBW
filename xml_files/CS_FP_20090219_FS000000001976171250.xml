          <p>So good afternoon, everybody. We are very pleased to welcome you at AXA U.K. for the earnings release for the Full Year '08 Earnings release. Presenting today will be Henri de Castries, CEO; Denis Duverne, CFO; and G&#xE9;rald Harlin, Deputy CFO. Henri, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric, and good afternoon, everybody. We know these are challenging times. We know you all have a lot of questions, but I think we should be respectful for the ones who are listening to this conference through the web and we will go through the presentation extensively, but crisply, to make sure that we leave as much room as possible for your questions afterwards.</p>
          <p>So, where do we stand and what are today's key messages? And I fully understand that in these very turbulent times, sometimes it's difficult to get the messages listened to, but we will try, with Denis and G&#xE9;rald to, let's say, help you find the answers you are looking for.</p>
          <p>Two things &#x2013; two things little more than two things on 2008. First, it's absolutely clear to all of us that this was a year of extreme pressure and in this year of extreme pressure, of course, we have not been immune. There are parts of the Company where we have suffered. But overall, if you look at the earnings performance, I think we have existed quite well through the turmoil and the earnings which are coming out today are very much aligned with what we had told you in November.</p>
          <p>Four billion of underlying earnings, it's less than what we had hoped for, of course, at the beginning of the year, but if you step back and look at what the historic sequence has been, it's back to the level of 2006, which was the second best year ever for AXA. So it's a resilient performance, even as the structure of these earnings is different from what it was before and you should not ignore the fact that in property-casualty this was an absolute record year for the Group. This business is very profitable. This business is a sort of ballast for the Group and we think it's in good perspective.</p>
          <p>Second important point. Yes, the Life and Savings and the Asset Management business have suffered but, if you look at the cash flow, they are still very strongly positive, which I think is a very important element in these markets. The net income is very significantly down, approximately 80%, but the net income was impacted by what we see as being non-economic mark-to-market accounting rules, especially the fact that we had to take a sort of 1.6 billion hit just because of the widening of the corporate spread.</p>
          <p>You know that the accounting rules of the insurance sector are slightly different from what they are in the banking sector. There has been, I would say, more reclassification in the insurance sector. Looking at this corporate portfolio, we think that this is going to be largely an accounting of the past year economic things.</p>
          <p>Third key message. We are taking all the necessary actions to preserve the profitability and the development of the Group in the long run. I mean, as the management, there are things we can influence and there are things we cannot influence. And complaining from morning to night on things you cannot control is useless. We are there to act and to manage and we are acting and managing to mitigate the risks, to create productivity, to change the pricing of the products when they are inappropriate, to deal with the balance sheet. And, believe me, we are quite active there. Which, and this is the third message, makes us confident that the model is going to resist in 2009, even if 2009 is starting as a challenging year.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing in the world is very disturbing for a lot of people, but the world will not come to an end. So the key point for us is to make sure that the operating model is the right one, that even if impacted by the current turmoil, it's going to exist, that the balance sheet is safe and that whenever things are going to calm down, we are going to be well positioned to benefit from the rebound. That's what we are doing and we are going to try to convince you about that in the course of this presentation.</p>
          <p>Very briefly, I don't think you need to be convinced that 2008 was a perfect storm. How have we been affected? Clearly, we've been affected through the extreme equity market volatility. This is visible on all the variable annuities side of the business, the increasing cost of the hedges was high for us in 2008, it has led us to some corrective actions and we will discuss that, having said that we do not think that the concept of variable annuities with guarantees is a bad concept. This product has been extremely profitable over the last 13.5 years; there has been half a year of really bad performance for the hedging. It's an extreme stress test for the model, we think we can correct it and we are not going to see 13 years of bad experience going forward.</p>
          <p>Second point, falling equity markets, this is impacting us. It will continue to impact us because, as you know, we are living from commissions extracted from asset bases. This has been a negative element and we've also been affected by the lower level of unrealized capital gains in shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Third point, the very strong widening of the savings spread, as I said, this has been impacting the net income. In front of that, do we have some good achievements? I think we are not going to apologize for some of the good achievements, we've had some. The first one which is important is, we still have a growing number of clients. The revenues have been quite resilient. Yes, the new business is more difficult in Life and in Asset Management, but the business is growing in property-casualty, growing sometimes strongly, and even in Life and Asset Management, the preservation of the market share has been quite significant.</p>
          <p>Second point, as I said, Underlying Earnings have been solid.</p>
          <p>Third point, the balance sheet is strong. I know this is something which is a source of concern for you but it's precisely in these times that balance sheets are, I would say, stressed, put under pressure.</p>
          <p>We have a Solvency I ratio of 127, we have a Solvency II ratio of 145. Solvency is a sort of driving license response. To avoid any questions from the regulators you need to be at 100, we are at 127. We have 27 points of, I would say, overcapacity on our driving license. It's less than what we used to have. I do not think we are in a sort of can't drive situation. What we need to do is to manage it very carefully because it's certainly not the comfort margin we used to have. We need to be prepared if the macroeconomic environment gets worse and we will discuss what we are doing to add some tools to the tool kit we have, but I don't think this should frighten neither us nor you.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we are paying a dividend. It's a conservative one, it's $0.40, it's one-third of what it was last year. We want to show the sign that we have confidence in the future. On the other hand, as I said just before, we think we have to be cautious in the capital management. Revenues very clearly, what do they show? Life and Savings, they are going down by approximately 4%. This is mainly due to what we've seen in the U.S., but also in some other countries. You know that the clients are scared. They don't want to do long-term investments in the current environment and for a long period of 2008, now it's less the case, it was not very expensive for them not to make any choice because short-term deposits were decently remunerated, certainly in Europe, maybe less in the U.S. Now, and things are probably slightly changing, it's more difficult to make long-term investment decisions which explains probably part of the thing.</p>
          <p>Seven points, Property/Casualty. Property/Casualty is doing well. I do not insist on that, Denis will come back to that. Asset Management, the decline in revenues is due to the fact that asset bases are lower. This is impacting the fees. It's a very mechanical effect. There is going to be there, too, one day or the other a turnaround. Nobody, at this stage, knows when. But we think that the franchises we have are still very solid and very strong franchise.</p>
          <p>If you look at the geographical diversification of the Group, and this is an important point, it's true as well in earnings as in revenues. The diversified model we have is helping us with this better than others. Yes, we had a very tough year in the U.S., but other than that, I would say the operations have performed decently or sometimes well. If you look at where it dips, there has been a decline in the U.S. in revenues. Continental Europe has been stable. The emerging countries and the Mediterranean region have done quite well.</p>
          <p>Underlying Earnings, I think I've already mentioned the key elements. If you look at the detail of the Underlying Earnings, a big negative factor this year is the fact that the U.S. has moved from a situation where they were contributing for something which was between 800 [million] and &#x20AC;1 billion a year to the Group earnings. This year it's negative by around &#x20AC;200 million, so it's a big swing due to the cost of hedging. On the other hand, this has been mitigated by some very good performances, especially in France and in the Mediterranean region where we've seen very good Property/Casualty growth, but also very good Property/Casualty earnings and very decent Life and Savings earnings. There too, I really insist on that, the geographical diversification of the Group is good from a risk management standpoint, from an earnings standpoint.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Adjusted Earnings, so Underlying Earnings plus or minus capital gains realized, and impairments, it's a decline, when compared with last year. Last year we had realized 1.2 billion approximately of capital gain. This year, it's a loss of little more of 340 million. Why so? We have realized some gains, but we had the cost of the impairments, mitigated by the hedging of the equity portfolio. And Denis will come back to that in more detail.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, the net income. Net income is down, as I said, around 80% at 923 million. Why so much? What went wrong? If you look at the economic view, moving from the Adjusted Earnings, we think there are additional hits which have been taken, which can be justified from an economic standpoint for approximately 900 million on ABS, on some of the alternative assets. Other than that, what we see because of the IFRS is a 1.5 billion reserve on the change in the fair value due to the corporate spread. And we think this is going to be largely an accounting issue only. And remember, we do not have the recertification possibilities the banks have, so it's impacting the net income.</p>
          <p>Two other elements, changing revenue balance sheet hedging items and changing fair value of other assets and derivatives, Denis will come back to that also because these are elements which are very mechanical, sometimes have their counterpart in the other direction on the balance sheet and we see them as non-economic. So if you were to adjust the net income for what we see as being these non-economic factors, the net income would have been at 2.8 billion, which is of course way lower than last year but not in the same proportion.</p>
          <p>Dividend, I've discussed that. It's less than the usual guidance we had been giving between 40 and 50% of the Adjusted Earnings. But we think at this stage in a very uncertain world, it's prudent balance sheet management.</p>
          <p>Solvency ratio, 127 Solvency I, as I said, 145 Solvency II. We'll come back to that. It means that we have a &#x20AC;6 billion surplus at this stage. Remember also that the underlying profitability of the Group is rebuilding the solvency. And remember that a significant portion of the decline in 2008 was also due to the fact that we have paid for some of the very recent acquisitions. So, they are buffered there and we are adding additional flexibility with some capital management initiatives which we will describe later.</p>
          <p>Next point, liquidity position. Well, I mean, the cash flows over all the businesses have stayed very solid. In the Life business, if we have seen less new business, we've also seen less redemption. And the net cash flows have been positive by more than 8 billion. And the cash flows have been positive by around 3 billion on the property-casualty side. So, the cash flow position of the Group is strong.</p>
          <p>If you look at the balance sheet, and Denis will describe that, the cash position has increased massively over the last year. If you look at the debt, we have a significant amount of undrawn credit line. We do not have significant debt maturities in 2009. So, overall if you look at it, we think it's a very safe position.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, because even if everybody these days is focused on the balance sheet, nobody should miss the point that the businesses we are going to survive are the businesses who are going to keep their clients and their employees and keep them happy. If we look at the measures we use every year, one of the signs of confidence I think is the fact that looking at customer satisfaction and looking at employee engagement, both of them have very significantly increased in 2008, despite all this negative turmoil, which means that the sales forces, the employees, they are dedicated at winning business, at growing the company, at resisting through the storm and spending time with the clients to help them understand what's going on.</p>
          <p>So, at the end of the day, even if these are difficult times and even if we do not pretend to be immune, we think that we are well positioned to make the difference in the long run.</p>
          <p>Denis, it's yours.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, good afternoon, sorry, everyone. So, I don't think I need to go for a long time on the summary because on earnings Henri has said everything.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, our shareholders equity stands at 37 billion euros at year-end, impacted essentially by a five billion decrease in unrealized capital gains, mainly on equities. We believe that we continue to have sound debt gearing and additional financing capacity.</p>
          <p>Going back to the earnings and starting with the underlying earnings. Our underlying earnings were down 17% on a comparable basis. And this is made of 43% negative on Life and Savings, 31% positive on P&amp;C, 6% positive on asset management. I will come back to that later. This is essentially due to a tax runoff, otherwise it should have been slightly negative, 21% negative on international insurance because of the runoff and substantially negative on holdings because of additional financing costs.</p>
          <p>On the Life and Savings underlying earnings, we've slightly modified the presentation that we were doing before. But we are still looking at the gross margins on one hand and expenses on the other hand. So, we've split the margins between margin on revenues, margin on assets and technical margins. You see that margins on revenues was plus 3%, margins on assets down six and the big swing was coming from the technical margin, which went from 1.4 billion positive to 51 million negative and I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Expenses were roughly flat, acquisition expenses slightly down as new business was down. Admin expenses slightly up, as the cash flows were up and we were managing more contracts. VBI amortization slightly up as well, leading to pre-tax underlying earnings of minus 50%. Tax was still positive. One offset by a tax bounce of 70%, minority interests another 31, leading to 43% negative on the underlying earnings. And I will now describe in more detail the various components.</p>
          <p>Margin on revenues, we made an average margin on our revenues of 7.4%, up 7% with revenues down 4% so the margin on revenues is up 3%. On the assets, starting with the unit-link management fees, those fees were down 10% as our average unit-link reserves were down 8% and average management fees were slightly down, down 3%, 2% coming from business mix, 1% from country mix. The variations around the figure are quite small year-on-year. What you can see on the unit-link reserves is that the average reserves are only down 8% but we are starting the year 2009 with reserves that are significantly down at 132 billion versus 183 at the beginning of the year. We have a negative impact of the markets of 49 billion, eight billion net inflows and 11 billion negative on Forex. So, margin on assets is slightly down, down six.</p>
          <p>General account, investment margin is stable, as our reserves on general account are stable plus 1% at 318 billion on average, 323 closing reserves against 309 opening reserves. This is positive FX and positive market impact. No net inflows, all our net inflows have continued to be on the separate account on unit-link side. Average management fees on general account have been stable.</p>
          <p>Now moving to technical margin. The mortality, morbidity margin has been relatively stable, it's down 12%. What's effectively hitting us in the technical margin, as we said, is the exceptionally high cost of hedging the variable annuity guarantees. We've discussed that extensively during our November meeting. We were hit by basis risk, i.e., the difference between the performance of our funds and the performance &#x2013; and the hedges that we have used against the indices for 655 million euros. Volatility, which was exceptionally high in the fourth quarter of '08, costing us 596 billion million and other factors for &#x20AC;72 million. So, this &#x20AC;1.3 billion gross impact is consistent with the 0.6 billion net P&amp;L impact that we had described in our November meeting and call.</p>
          <p>Moving now to P&amp;C, again, using the same breakdown between net technical results and net investment income, we had revenues up 2.9% at &#x20AC;26 billion, the combined ratio improving by 1.9 points, and obviously there is a big leverage coming here because the net technical results as of this notification is an improvement of 97% at &#x20AC;1.1 billion. On the investment income side, our average assets were up 4% at &#x20AC;54 billion. Our average asset yield was up 8% at 4.2%, leading to a net investment income of &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up plus 13%. This leads to pre-tax underlying earnings growing by 32% at 3.4 billion. Tax is roughly proportional and we have underlying earnings up 31% at &#x20AC;2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>You can see that we have a good story here, both on revenues and combined ratios across the board. Slower revenue growth in Northern Europe, higher revenue growth in France, Mediterranean region and the rest of the world. I should have said slow revenue growth in Northern Europe, U.K. and Ireland. Combined ratio, a good story across the board with the exception of Belgium and the rest of the world, but still a good story everywhere with no combined ratio above 99%. Extremely strong combined ratio in France at 93% and Mediterranean region at 93.3, but good combined ratio overall.</p>
          <p>How did we achieve that combined ratio? It's a combination of the non-recurrence of the natural events that we had suffered from &#x2013; in '07, the floods in the U.K., the storms in Northern Europe, which &#x2013; giving us an improvement of 1.7 points. We have a slight deterioration of the current accident year of 1.3 points and better prior year reserves development, giving us an improvement of 2.2 points. I should say here, positive reserve development giving us 2.2 points and slightly better than last year. The expense ratio is slightly deteriorating, but I would say that almost the totality of that deterioration, or 0.4 out of the 0.5 is due to a one-timer in Germany, an exceptional adjustment of pension expenses. So, I should say that all in all, our expense ratio is broadly flat.</p>
          <p>Looking more in detail at what happened on the reserves, when you look since 2000 our reserving ratio meaning net technical reserves divided by net earned premium are situated between 186 and 196%. And there are many reasons for these variations which are the scope of the business, the country mix, exceptional events in terms of natural events and the variation of prior reserve development. When you look at the decline of seven points for AXA in '08, there is a scope change of one point meaning that we are adding countries which have faster reserve development.</p>
          <p>There is a country mix impact of one point meaning that countries which have a faster reserve development are going faster than a country that have bigger reserves. We have a non-recurrence of net cap which is two points, and we have increasing prior reserve developments that represent two points. And you see here the development over the last ten years, you see that we had one negative year in 2004, 0.2%, and you see that we have more strongly positive developments in the last two years which I believe is consistent with the point in the cycle where we are. We believe that we were in 2008 at the bottom of the cycle in Europe which is the bulk of our business. And it's not a surprise that we have better prior year reserve developments as we approach the trough of the cycle.</p>
          <p>Moving now to asset management, we have benefited from, as I said before, from non-recurring items. Without those non-recurring items, our asset management revenues were down 11%, distribution revenues down 32, investment results is a small number. On the expense side, asset management expenses were down 10%, almost in line with revenues. And distribution expenses were down 23%, slightly less than distribution revenues.</p>
          <p>Our pre-tax underlying earnings were down 15% and tax was down a lot more because we had a &#x20AC;62 million one-off in the U.S. So, underlying earnings, on a comparable currency, are up 6% but this is entirely related to this tax item.</p>
          <p>Going into more detail, the asset management revenues are a function of the lower assets and average assets under management, down 8%, but you see that the decline has been sharper between the beginning of the year and the end of the year, essentially due to a market impact of minus &#x20AC;245 million, so this can clearly have a knock-on impact on our 2009 asset management earnings.</p>
          <p>The asset management fees have declined by 3%, 36 basis points. This is entirely a function of the reduction of the weights of equities, because the asset class that has declined the most is obviously the equity asset class. The equities only represent 39% of the total instead of 53% a year earlier.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the adjusted earnings. Extracting from the four billion of underlying earnings, as Henri explained earlier, we had half as much realized capital gains. We realized most of our capital gains in the first half of the year, 792 million. We had very significant impairments of close to &#x20AC;2.8 billion, essentially equities, 1.8 billion, but also &#x20AC;500 million of fixed income. This was partly mitigated by the equity hedging for 1.6 billion &#x2013; 1.3 coming from the equity hedging &#x2013; what we call the global macro hedging, done at the Group level of &#x20AC;14 billion, 200 million coming from the hedges done locally, essentially in France and Germany, in the life companies. The hedging didn't fully mitigate the equity impairments because of tax effects; we had some equity impairments that do not give rise to a tax credit. That's the case, for example, in Belgium, where equity capital gains are not taxed, equity capital losses are not deductible either. So, that's what explains the 3.7 billion earnings.</p>
          <p>The other &#x2013; the two other things I want to mention here are that we put here the totality of the value of the equity hedges, whereas at the half year, we had put the declined value in net income, here because we crystallized all the &#x2013; we reversed the hedges basically in January '09 for the most part. We decided that it was more relevant to put declined value in adjusted and not to decline value in net income. The second comment I want to make is the &#x2013; our impairment rules. On equities we have quite mechanical impairment rules. Any stock that is down for more than six months or down more than 20% is impaired. I believe that this is one of the most stringent rules that is applied in Europe. On fixed income we are impair on credit events, and only on credit events.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the net income, starting from the adjusted earnings of &#x20AC;3.7 billion, we suffered from a change in fair value of a number of positions in our balance sheets. 1.5 billion is coming from the increasing spreads on the corporate bond portfolio, a substantial portion of our corporate bond portfolio is in AFS P&amp;L, available for placement with P&amp;L, the so-called fair value option. So it's a mark-to-market that we have to do. We had also mark-to-market from alternative equities for &#x20AC;447 million, on asset-backed securities of &#x20AC;412 million and other balance sheet items, 222 million and 144. So this is &#x2013; a substantial portion of that is non-economic, Henri described that earlier, but we have to take those mark-to-market hits even if they are not economic.</p>
          <p>We usually show you, and we are doing it once again, our cash flow, shareholder cash flow statements starting from the adjusted earnings of last year of 6.1 billion. We adjust to by two billion to reflect the difference between the adjusted earnings for the statutory results of last year. We have an increase in statutory, sorry, in consolidated solvency requirements of 1.3 billion. We have capital optimization for 600 million that gives us the cash flows from our operating companies available for investment and dividend of 3.5 billion. We pay the dividend in the rate of 2.5 million, and we made acquisitions for a net of 3.3 million, the biggest ones being Russia, Mexico and the buyouts of our minorities in Turkey. So that represents our needs of financing of &#x20AC;5.7 billion, so higher than 3.5, and we've had capital increases with our employee Shareplan, essentially on the fewer exercise of stock options for &#x20AC;500 million, and an increase in our net debt of 1.7 billion to offset the difference between the 3.5 and the 5.7.</p>
          <p>Moving to the shareholders' equity, the shareholders' equity moved from 45.6 billion to 37.4. It was positively impacted by net income of 923, the dividend of last year of 2.4 billion, a Shareplan of stock option for 700 million. We have the negative variance, and this is the biggest item, of &#x20AC;5 billion of our unrealized capital gains, which I will comment on further. And then other negative impacts are Forex for one billion, our pension, an increase in our pension gap, we used the salary option of &#x20AC;700 million, and a decrease in our perpetual debt coming from both FX and the payment of interest. So that leads to 37.4.</p>
          <p>Commenting on capital gains, we have two movements in capital gains, the off-balance sheet capital gains on the left-hand side, on real estate, that has moved from 2.1 billion to 3.4 billion, there is a little bit of scope change, and there are two other changes which are more important, which are related to the reduction in the tax rates, and the reduction in the policyholder participation assumption. I believe those are the two main changes.</p>
          <p>On the unrealized capital gains, we've moved from 4.8 billion positive to 0.4 negative. We still have &#x20AC;500 million of unrealized capital gains on equities. This is clearly a big number. On the other hand, we end the year without a big item of unrealized capital gains on the total balance sheet of AXA which is &#x20AC;670 billion, we have 0.4 billion of unrealized capital loss, which is quite a small number compared to a number of insurance companies around the world.</p>
          <p>Our net debt has moved from 15.8 to &#x20AC;17.7 billion. I already mentioned that to finance the acquisitions that we did in 2008. There was no significant movement in the subordinated debt. There was a slight increase in the senior debt, which moved from 2.3 to 4.2 billion. You can notice that we have no significant maturity coming up until 2013. So we are quite safe from that standpoint. We still have six billion of undrawn credit lines. And on the consolidated balance sheet, we have &#x20AC;32 billion of cash.</p>
          <p>Looking at the general account portfolio and the quality of assets there, the total general account has not moved much, moving from &#x20AC;394 billion to 390. Fixed income is relatively flat, representing 77% and &#x20AC;20 billion. In the fixed income, it's about half and half Govies and corporate bonds. We have 11 billion of asset-backed securities, representing 3% of the assets, which have been marked down from 89% of par to 69% of par at year end. Of those 11 billion at year-end, 7.5 billion have been marked down using mark-to-model and mark-to-market for lack of credible market information. If we compare this mark-to-model and the mark-to-market, the difference is 2.1 billion gross, which would have been translated on a net basis into 700 million of OCI impact, the balance sheet impact of 200 million of P&amp;L impact which we truly believe that the mark-to-model is more realistic than the mark-to-market for those assets where there's very scant trades that we can find and not really credible.</p>
          <p>On the cash side, the cash moved significantly up from 19 to &#x20AC;32 billion, coming both from prudent security management at the time of unprecedented market turmoil but also from the cash held in relation to our derivatives program where we are getting, as markets came down, the derivatives that we had on the balance sheet gave us a lot of cash that we keep as cash on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our equity portfolio moved from 37 to &#x20AC;17 billion representing 4% of our portfolio. And the rest didn't move much. I will come back to the equity portfolio slide sheet later.</p>
          <p>I'd like to go through the risk review, what we call registering at the half share, to update you on the, I hope, the various concerns that you've expressed during the last six months. So I want to cover actions taken to mitigate the balance sheet risks in terms of assets, liabilities and AUM, and address any question that we have heard from the investor community in the last six months. So we are going to abet you on the equity hedging, DAC, VA risk managements, Solvency capital, double leverage, low interest rates, and financial hybrids.</p>
          <p>First the equity portfolio; we had an equity portfolio at year-end '08 of 16 billion. We have kept four billion of local equity hedges in the Life companies, in the participating Life companies. There is differentiated to a net seven billion of outstanding equity exposure of the shareholders. We have not re-established the global macro-hedging program at the root because we believe that the outstanding exposure is small and the price of hedging has become uneconomic, and that we don't believe that we need to pay that insurance policy, and as I said we've monetized the majority, almost 80% of the hedges of the macro-hedging program. We have now fairly low sensitivity to equity market movements up or down, and which is described at the bottom, the top right of the slide, and we may come back to that in the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>On DAC, we have taken significant DAC impairments in 2008 for a total of &#x20AC;569 million before tax. Resetting the corridor with the central assumption of 9% separate account return going forward, which means that we would need a 30% market decline to have another DAC impairment going forward in the U.S., allowing for the normal return to the mean assumptions that the Group has been using since &#x2013; I mean for the last decade. Clearly the big hits in 2008 had been U.S. VA hedging. We have said at the half year that we are putting in place an action plan to mitigate this and we have completed I would say Phase I of this plan.</p>
          <p>On the new business side, we've launched Accumulator 8.0 in November '08, Accumulator 8.2 in February '09, both lowering, I mean reducing some of the features of the program and also narrowing the options in terms of investments for the funds. But the bulk of the impact that &#x2013; the more important impact that we have had has been on the inforce, which is obviously the most impactful from an earnings standpoint, where we have completely changed the structure of the separate account assets by restructuring the allocation funds, reallocating assets to index plus or index like funds.</p>
          <p>So this is clearly a major &#x2013; this is clearly a major exercise which required the approval of the fund boards for significant parts of what took place; but this is now behind us. This plan was implemented &#x2013; it started to have impact at the end of October, but was not really in place. It's now fully in place for two thirds of the separate account assets. We have a Phase II in 2009, which is the launch of new version Accumulator 9.0, in July '09 where we will again revise the features to improve the profitability. And we will continue to adjust the separate accounts funds so that we continue to reduce the basic risk for the remaining volatile separate account funds.</p>
          <p>This action plan has started to bear fruit. We don't give you the breakdown of the results but we can tell you that the results of hedging are positive in January, and this is quite comforting because January was not a year of normal relativity &#x2013; month of normal relativity, neither was it a month of positive market. It was a month where markets have come down probably nine or 10% and it was quite reassuring to see that the plan was indeed effective.</p>
          <p>Solvency now is clearly a big concern for you. Solvency I ratio comes out at 127%. Solvency II using the same parameters as the QIS4, the Quantitative Impact Study number four of the European Commission, puts us above 145%. I remind you that we were at 170% at year end '07, 175 at mid year. We end the year at 145, which shows again the resilience of Solvency II, which is more economic than Solvency I.</p>
          <p>Where do we go from here? You can see two things. First, at the current level of underlying earnings of &#x20AC;4 billion, we would build 18 points of solvency before paying the dividends. The other side of the coin is that when we look at sensitivities, we still have sensitivities to our market movements and our balance sheet. A decline of 10% in equity markets were given three points and increasing the Forex on fixed income three points' decline of real estate by 10% and six points and product equity two points.</p>
          <p>We believe that we are at a comfortable level and that we don't need to raise equity but we decided to take advantage of a new provision of the French law which has allowed us since November of '08 to create preference shares. And in the same way as we have in our list of resolutions to be approved by the shareholder meeting resolutions regarding issuance of equity and other instruments, we are adding resolutions that would allow us to issue preference shares if necessary. We have four resolutions in our list of resolutions, one which modifies the statutes and describes what the preference shares are and three that allow us to issue preference shares to the AXA mutuals to &#x2013; are you listening, shareholders or to invest this without preferential rights. And we believe that we have with this full arsenal. The total amount that we would be able to issue is &#x20AC;2 billion and we are aware that the AXA mutuals would have the capacity, if required, to subscribe to preference shares because they happen to have the cash available to issue up to &#x2013; buy up to &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>How do preference shares work? First, they are senior to the capital, to ordinary shares and they are assimilated to all debt. They give rise to a dividend which has been calibrated in these resolutions between 1.2 times and 1.8 times the dividend, with a floor of six to 8% and a cap of 10 to 14%. Those brackets are quite broad, but that would give the Management Board the flexibility to define the conditions at issue determining on market conditions at the time. These preference shares are redeemable at par. They are not redeemable before five years, and to be redeemed, we need to get the approval of the insurance supervisor and we would need to be above 100% of solvency margin after redemption. The dilution of preference shares, obviously, is roughly three times less than the dilution of ordinary shares, and this is just an additional weapon to our arsenal.</p>
          <p>The next topic is related to so-called double leverage. We thought it was useful to go into some detail on that because there is a lot of confusion around. First, let me remind you that AXA is an insurance group, not a fashion conglomerate. We &#x2013; our capital &#x2013; the small quantity of capital that we have in banks, asset management and brokerage is deducted from the Solvency I calculation, and under Solvency I we get no diversification benefits.</p>
          <p>Though when you look at it from a statutory standpoint, which is the left side of the slide, we have imagined a holding company with a capital of 200 and debt of 100. With this holding company, it's supposed to have three subsidiaries with capital of 100. So, that means that the debt at the holding company level has been used to create capital in the subsidiaries. And there may be &#x2013; depending on the local regulations, there may be intra-group loans which are limited by the local solvency rules which vary by territory. So, at the holding company, we have not defined what the solvency was, but at the local entity level the local solvency can be 200%, in the requirement is 50 and the capital is 100. So, in this statutory view, clearly double leverage is not captured.</p>
          <p>At the consolidated level it's different. The solvency ratio is defined as the admissible assets minus the debt divided by the capital requirements. The intra-group loans are eliminated. So, when the Solvency I ratio is, say, 133%, that means that the addition of the solvency requirements of the three subsidiaries of 300 is reduced by the debt of 100 and the solvency numerator is 300 minus the debt. So, it's 200. And the requirement's at 150, so you get to 150% of Solvency I ratio. So, there are no diversification benefits. Intra-group loans have been eliminated and the debts have been deducted, so in the Solvency I ratio the double leverage has been fully captured.</p>
          <p>Another concern &#x2013; concerning the impact of low interest rates on the Life and Savings business: we are protecting our earnings and our investment margin. Our guaranteed rates have declined steadily since we are publishing that information. In 2004, when we gave our asset liability management presentation, we showed an average guaranteed rate of &#x2013; on our portfolio, of 3%. It's now 2.6%, because we are issuing less products with guaranteed rates, and 2.1% in '012. We have a seven year duration of assets, which is mitigating the dropping interest rates. And right now the corporate bonds spreads are offsetting the declining interest rates because basically the spreads are offsetting the difference between the risk free rate as it was a year ago and the risk free rate where it is now.</p>
          <p>Finally, exposure to our financial hybrid debts. In a nutshell we have a substantial portion of our debts &#x2013; of our corporate debts, which is with financials, 55%. This is just a reflection that the bond universe is such in the AA and single A category that there are lots of financials. Of that, we have for the shareholder part, &#x20AC;600 million of exposure to Tier 1 hybrid debt of financial issuers. So, a very small portion of our corporate bond exposure.</p>
          <p>I believe this ends my presentation. I thank you for your attention and give back the floor to Henri. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. I'm not going to be long, because I'm sure there are going to be a lot of questions. But I just want to make a short conclusion. As you've seen, we are not pretending that we are immune to what has happened out there. Yes, we are affected in the Life and Savings business. Yes, the solvency margin has been reduced by the market impact. Having said that, the Group is resilient as showed by the underlying earnings, and the Group is still strongly capitalized.</p>
          <p>And having been in this business for 20 years now, I'd like to make one thing extremely clear. It's not the first crisis. Maybe it's the most severe, but the ones who are going to emerge as winners in this crisis are the ones who are going to keep their nerves. It's true as well for the management as for the indexes. What we see as our duty as a management team is to be fully transparent with you and to give you all the information we have, what we've been doing this afternoon.</p>
          <p>The second thing we need to do is to tell you how we feel and where we stand. What we are telling you is yes, it's difficult. We've seen better and more enjoyable times. But we think these are also the times where we can make the difference. We are solid in our balance sheet. And we are very determined to continue to do what we've done over the last 30 years with AXA and over the last 10 years since I took over as the CEO.</p>
          <p>This Group is convincing more clients every morning. The margins in the business long-term are good. There is nothing changed to the fundamental needs of the clients. And at the end of the crisis, we are going to have probably less competition than before.</p>
          <p>So the key point is how do you navigate through the storm &#x2013; significantly navigate through the storm? Especially when you have slightly less choices. But you can navigate through the storm. And we will navigate through the storm. That's it. And let's go for the questions.</p>
          <p>Sorry, Embedded Value. G&#xE9;rald here we have another speaker that we want to cover because we know you have questions there. So, G&#xE9;rald?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In fact there are a lot of questions connected to Embedded Value. Okay. Let's start by this one. So I know that you have been troubled by this restatement, and in fact it's been said this restatement is simple, so that in fact we have replaced, in order to be compliant with the CFO Forum guidelines, we have been replacing the Other than Life, tangible net asset value by the shareholders equity. So where does it <mark type="inaudible" /> restatement here? That means that instead of Group EV of 34.8 billion, we end up with a Group EV in '07, that's a restatement for '07 at 50.6. So that means that we increased by 15.8 billion the last year EV.</p>
          <p>For the sake of clarity and consistency I give you information on the following slide of this, this restatement will not pay things down.</p>
          <p>So next one, here you have the other rates of the Group EV. So Group EV starts at the 50.6 billion, ends up at 31.1 billion. That's the new CFO Forum EV. So that means that we have a decrease of 19.5 billion. We have an operating return, and I have a slide to explain our EPS, but the operating return is in line with expectations. We have an investment experience of minus 22.08. So that's the main element that explains this drop of 19.5. In case we would have been in line with last year's presentation, we would move from 34.8, which was last year's Group EV to 18.6 billion. So that means that it would have been a decrease of 16.2. 16.2 decrease compared with the 19.5 that we are presenting here. The difference corresponds roughly to the mark-to-market of debt, since debts now and the subordinated debt are part of the shareholders' equity because we replaced, again, the Other than Life business the tangible net asset value by the IFRS shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the operating return. Two elements there, let's start first with the Life and Savings operating returns, expected return 2.7 billion corresponding to 5% of Group EV. That's in line with last year implied discount rate roughly slightly below 8%. Operational experience is zero &#x2013; 0%, it's negligible. And then with the NBV, as you can now see the NBV is down this year from 1.8 billion to almost one billion, and this represents a contribution to the Group EV return of 2% instead of four. Then for other business operating returns, we have a 2.7 billion contribution corresponding to 5%. What does it correspond to? Mainly to the underlying earnings, which are at 2.5 billion minus the interest rates on super subordinated notes, roughly 300bn, and a normalized equity capital return at 4.5 &#x2013; a capital gain return at 4.5% corresponding to 400 million. And that's exactly the same &#x2013; where we did last time. So as a whole operating return is 12%.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the investment experience, so on the second line you have a 12% operating return, and as a whole total return on Group EV is minus 31%, explained mostly by this negative investment experience at minus 44%. And here at the bottom of the slide you have the explanation in billion euros, of this 22 billion decline and negative contribution of investment experience starting first with impact from equity market drop minus 12 billion, plus we are normal in capital gains as you notice, and we have lower fees expected unique.</p>
          <p>Impact from spread widening, it has been explained already by Denis. We have a minus seven billion contribution corporate bond spread widening. Just to keep you &#x2013; it's important for you to keep in mind that on our corporate bond portfolio we started the year with an average spread of 140 basis points and we ended the year at 360 bps So that explains the minus seven. So that means that everything equal for next year, for '09, assuming that we would have, we would be in line with the expected return, that means that our return would be 20%. I.e. 6.2 billion divided by 31 billion which is the Group EV. Going back to the old methodology then the return would be exactly the same, 6.2, but divided by an EV that would be lower, i.e. 18.6 billion as I told you before and going, ending up with a return of 34%.</p>
          <p>Last, let's have a focus on the new business value. So new business value last year amounted to 1.8 &#x2013; &#x20AC;1,772 million and at the end of '08, for '08 we are 985. So that's a drop of 44% and you have all the different elements. First of all, it starts with the APE. Annual Premium Equivalent dropped by 10% explaining a 10% drop. Then another important element is the expense. Expense contributes to minus 7% to this 45% drop. Why? Because as you know in line with the methodology we are not allowed to take into account any kind of positivity gains. At the same time, market conditions; minus 30%. Explains that &#x2013; the last line explains as an NBV margin. NBV margin moved down from 23% to 14.5%, mostly explained by the market conditions at minus 7.3%.</p>
          <p>What is interesting is to have a look at the bottom figures here because you can notice that what are the most important elements that explain this minus 7.3% decrease in the NBV margin. The most important one is higher volatility; 3.5%. Then we have the lower interest rates at 1.9, we see with the hit on the VA business, then we have equity markets minus 1.2 and spread widening minus one.</p>
          <p>Concretely what does it mean? That means that assuming that the volatility would go back to previous levels and that the spread widening would go back to previous levels that explains 4.5%. 4.5% compared with the 14.5% NBV margin at the end of the period, that's back to 19% and I believe that that's something that we should keep in mind. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. The first one is could you talk a little bit about the available capital you have under Solvency I? I think it's 28 billion, just to get an idea of the quality of that capital and what the risks to that number would be in future. So, ideally a breakdown of how that capital sits.</p>
          <p>And second question is the impact on earnings from spread widening. I think most of the impact goes to the earnings, 1.5 billion. It looks quite a small number relative to the size of your book and G&#xE9;rald's comments of a 200 basis points spread widening over the year. I think you've got a book shareholder's participation of about 60 billion roughly. So, 1.5 over 60 doesn't look like a high number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who wants to take that? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on spread widening, the cost of the spread widening, as you noticed, was quite important in the P&amp;L account in the net income roughly 1.5 billion. That's what Denis explained but this has also a significant impact on the shareholder equity in OCI. Why?  Because of course, when you look at the OCI in term of unrealized capital gains on loans because you have lasting effect on the T-Bonds and a negative effect on the top line bonds. Roughly speaking, a very rough figure, we could say that it should be something around five billion. So, plus five, minus five. Something of this magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, G&#xE9;rald, there was also willing to know if the 1.5 in the net income had been mitigated by any <mark type="inaudible" /> participations if I understood you. No? So currently we have the <mark type="inaudible" />. On the second point which is the available capital under Solvency I, who wants to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the available capital in the Solvency I, which is &#x20AC;28 billion, the requirement is 22 and the available capital is 28. We have written off all intangibles, so it's high quantity, high quantity capital. I don't know what more to say than that. I mean there is no intangible assets included in that capital other than a small portion of the value of the business in force for France and I believe Belgium. So, that's the only intangible that there is which is still available for 2008 and 2009 according to the E.U. regulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> that there is no magic in these figures so that means that when comparing the evolution of available capital for Solvency I between '07 and '08, we moved from 31 to 28 billion. So, that means that it's a drop of three billion. And so we have positive contribution from the earnings, from the net income at 0.1 and we have also the retreat of OCI  OCI dropped by roughly five billion. So, that's the main element there. Other elements that you can explain by this four billion drop and then you have other remaining moves.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc Thiele from UBS. First question, on &#x2013; if I add the two billion of preferred capital, that's roughly nine percentage points of solvency to your 127 and I arrived at 136 let's say. It's still a low number against your international peers, and I wonder if you just rely on stable markets from here, retained earnings coming through to get back into the old corridor that we used have of 150 to 170 as the target?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the cost side, do you feel that there is more need to cut into the cost base other than the 200 million of the program I think is going on in life insurance business with considerable pressure on the revenues?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly and finally, I missed your slide on M&amp;A that you presented in November. Is that something we should write off all together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. First, well, I mean I don't that nine points are "negligible." Second point, we don't think we need to do it now. As I said, what we are saying is we want to add the tool to the toolkit; first point.</p>
          <p>Second point, I think you should take some distance with only the pure solvency margins because you have to look also at is the capital really available? And, as Denis and G&#xE9;rald pointed out, the capital in our case is really available which is, I think, an important factor.</p>
          <p>Second (sic) [Third] point, I think you have &#x2013; and there too it is a pure question of common sense. Who is asking you to have regulatory capital? The regulators. Our job is not, and I'm sorry for saying that, but our true job to preserve the wealth of the shareholders. It's not to make the journalists or the analysts more comfortable by diluting the shareholders unnecessarily. Our job is to fight for the preservation of the wealth of the shareholders. And therefore the way we have to look at the solvency is to see if the regulators are asking us for more capital at a certain point in time. And that's what's going to drive us, nothing else. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One Insurance and other banking. So, there is apparently a flight in banking to get to a high Tier I capital ratio. In insurance, I mean clearly, this is not the topic. We don't have &#x2013; I mean we are not key participants in financing of credit to the economy, not to new credit to the economy.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have prudent reserves and the reason for capital insurance is to offset a deficiency in reserves. And we have no deficiency in reserves so we are showing year after year that our P&amp;C reserves are quite conservative. So, capital is on top of that. Our supervisor doesn't ask us more than 100%. It happens that we have a cushion above 100% but we are not forced to have a higher cushion.</p>
          <p>And last point, I'd like to guard you again against international comparisons on solvency and ratios because the calculation, according to one ratio, is across the EU. Unfortunately, it's quite diverse. The rules are very different, apply in a different fashion and that's one of the reasons why we've been very much in favor of Solvency II because it was both economic and we expect it to have the same rules applied everywhere in the same way. That's absolutely not the case in Solvency I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you use Solvency II even if Solvency II has not been approved, in the excess level vis-&#xE0;-vis the minimum regulatory level which is quite large. So, next one from the cost side, we are referring to 200 million. In fact, I mean what we are doing is going to be more, yes, we are stopping, we are not stopping. Yes, we have been addressing the productivity issues. It's clear as an example, then in the asset management, there are actions going on because both <mark type="inaudible" /> the decline in the asset base is compressing the margins and they need to react to preserve their earnings capability. It is clear then on the Life side we are doing the same. It is clear also that on the property-casualty side, we remain with a quite significant margin of productivity.</p>
          <p>We still have a claims management improvement program on the property-casualty side which we expect to give us approximately &#x20AC;700 million between now and 2012. So, it's a constant exercise for us to try to find productivity in the operation. The environment is if anything forcing us to accelerate that.</p>
          <p>On M&amp;A, I liked your question. Let's be totally clear about it. The first thing we want to do is to manage through the storm, okay? and this should be the priority number one for the Management. Having said that, we know we are a consolidator in this business. If there are absolutely unique opportunities available and these opportunities are accretive to the shareholders through appropriate financing, we should not refuse to look at them. But it's exactly like two ships in a very difficult sea. If you want to bring them together, maybe you have to wait a little bit to see the sea being a little bit more calm, okay? but I don't think it's something we should, I would say, drop like a shoe because once more the companies who are going to be winners in this turmoil are the ones who are going to keep their nerves and preserve their margins to be in a position to be the first to react the day where there is going to be some blue sky. Okay?</p>

          <p>Nick Holmes at Nomura. First question is if the macroenvironment really does tank further and the rating agencies start to look to downgrade to a single A not because of anything you are doing but because of the macroenvironment, and obviously, you're clearly AA at the moment. How would you respond to that? I mean does it worry you being, say, a straight single A?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is the off-balance sheet items rose in value a lot to 3.4 billion. I wondered if you could just go through what is happening there, and sort of related to that on real estate, I wondered, I was interested in the sensitivity that you showed to real estate for solvency and I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more on where this real estate is? What sort of geographies and what you think of it as a potential threat? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick, for these questions. On the first one, on the rating agencies, as you all know, it's a relative game or it's a relative position which is important. If the world tanks further, being a, sorry, being a single A company, is going to be being in a still very strong position. So what would worry me in such a case is not our own situation, it will be the world's situation. But I think there too, I mean you have to stand back and look calmly at things. How many corporates have AA? Very few. How many corporates are single A? Few of them. Insurance companies, because of the strength of the balance sheet, in the previous decade have had strong ratings. Some of these ratings have improved by the way over the last year. It's not that long ago that we are a double A minus company.</p>
          <p>In times, which economically were better than today, so the worst thing is how do you stand on a relative basis when compared to peers, and does this prevent you from doing some profitable business. If the world tanks and if everybody is single A, I don't think it's a real issue for one of the players. The other point is all things equal today, if you are not a AA, what type of business are you losing? The business you would be losing today, not tomorrow. I mean if everybody is single A, the business will have to find a place to go. But today, the only point where the rating would have an impact is the U.S. Group business, which is not the most important and is not the most profitable.</p>
          <p>So I think we should look at it in a relaxed way, not that we should not be concerned by the view concerned, I mean, interested and take seriously the view the rating agencies have on us. But once more, it's at the end of the day, a relative game which is reflecting not only your own shape but your shape relative to the others. If the world goes for a sort of prolonged slow growth, depression, recession, I don't know what, being a single A is going be being in a very strong position. And once more, the worst is never certain.</p>
          <p>Yes, we are seeing the microeconomic numbers being very bad because all the corporations are reacting very proactively, and therefore this is leading to a big drop in their investments, sorry, and in their production. But so far, consumer spending has been holding better than expected. So there is a point, I don't know when, but there is a point where the floor is going to be found, so the worst is never certain.</p>
          <p>On the off balance sheet item, and on the real estate, Denis, do you want to come back to what you said before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really the same question, Nick, because the off balance sheets on real capital gains, are relating to real estate. We don't have annualized capital gains on loans and to anything &#x2013; any significant degree. And as Ken has been telling us to put on the screen Slide number 76, which covers real estate. So, as I said before, the increase in the annualized capital gains has been not a function of a re-appreciation of real estate in '08, but a reduction in tax rate and political participation assumptions.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio is made of 42% French real estate, 26% Swiss real estate, 11% Belgian, 8% Germany, 8% the U.S. It's, in France, it's 80% commercial. In Switzerland, it's 60% commercial. We have seen prices slightly decrease in '08. We believe that our values are conservative in Switzerland, so the portfolio has, really has defensive characteristics. Belgium and Germany are markets which have not appreciated a lot in the last several years, so we don't expect them to decrease. In reality, when you look at Belgium, for instance, most of our portfolio is lent to the E.U. and government-related institutions. And Germany has seen a slight appreciation of real estate in the past year, so we don't expect depreciation. So really, probably where we can expect some depreciation in '09 is on the French portfolio, but to a fairly limited extent because of the, it's the way it's been built and its defensive characteristics. So that's the view which we have on the real estate side. And the U.S. is two buildings fully leased in midtown Manhattan, which have a significant annualized capital gains at this stage, which might come down, but we are not concerned with our real estate portfolio.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. I was just wondering about the rating agency view of your company right now. Firstly so they give some allowance a double leverage? Can you talk about that and how important that is in your rating? Secondly, how would they treat these press if you took them? Second question is when the markets drop, and your equity gets squeezed, clearly the amount of hybrid you can take into account also reduces, have you taken that into account in the sensitivity that you've shown us, and is that a worry on your rating agency side? And last point, is when you show us the market sensitivities, let's say to attempts in drop in equities on earnings, and, does that include the impairments too, or is that just the fees and direct impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the rating agency view, I mean this is a clearly a developing subject, because rating agencies have had industry views that have changed over time, and we've seen more and more rating actions more recently. As Henri said earlier we are double A with S&amp;P and Fitch, and I mean, as the market cycle develops it may be that we would go back to where we were two or three years ago. So it's something that may happen at some point. They each have different ways to look at rating and in the rating of capital, they have their own models. The indicators of S&amp;P, for example, the, I think the tracks would be capped out because of the amount of  subordinated debt that we have, Moody's would give us some credit. So we have a different treatment with each one.</p>
          <p>And double leverage, they look at it but they, I mean, it's not something that is a particular issue for them because they both rate the Group on one hand and the local entities at the other hand, they give us a benefit in the local rating from the group support of a limited number of notches. So each rating agency has its own views. And I cannot comment on their behalf, you could ask them. But clearly, we are in a trend where the view of the rating agencies seems to be that we are in a more profound recession than was originally anticipated. And while a year ago, they were quite comfortable with the rating of insurance companies, their view is probably slightly more negative now and we'll see how it develops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think one important point is that it's clear that for the regulator the preferred are part of the solvency, which is what makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the way we dealt with the sensitivities, the, because we take into account fully the annualized capital gain or loss in the calculation of solvency, and impairments is a net positive from the solvency standpoint. Because when we impair, we have some tax benefits; whereas when we have not impaired, we have not taken any tax credits or debits. So those calculations take everything into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you raised also a question relative to the haircut on the subordinated  debt. What we can say about this is that the haircut as calculated is limited to 50% so the availability of the subordinated debt, is limited to 50% of the requirement. So that means that and if you go back to the presentation and to the slide number 39 that was presented by Denis, you will notice that halfway peaking with the less than two billion, which is not available for Solvency I due to this haircut. So means that the haircut is not calculated on the reserves, but on the requirements. So that means that when it mostly depends on the premium in P&amp;C on the reserves in Life, so that means it has nothing to do except on the marginal basis for the reserves for the unit being reserved but for the most important part of our requirements it's independent from the markets.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>It's another point where the insurance holes are tighter than the banking holes, which means that there is more conservative. Because, of course we're not a bank, but if we were a bank, the worth debt would be it admitted. It's not the case.</p>

          <p>Hi. Ralph Hebgen with KBW. What, one, two questions please. One is on your P&amp;C reserve release. I mean clearly, you show some willingness to use discretionary powers here and release some of the positive prior year development. But in the context of solvency, let's just say equity markets deteriorate materially from here. Can you elaborate on your philosophy? Would you use some of the let's say cushion which you hold in reserves in the P&amp;C book deliberately to support solvency? Is that something that you would contemplate and I can see the smiles already, and if so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the question is not politically correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Yes, okay. That's fair enough. But &#x2013; and if it was correct, what sort of level of reserves would you be happy with? I know that's not easily quantifiable.</p>
          <p>And the second one is just to clarify, on the off balance sheet unrealized capital gains on property, this number is presumably not included in the available assets for the purpose of Solvency I calculation. Question mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is included in the solvency calculation. On the P&amp;C reserves release, you give us slightly more discretion than we have. This is &#x2013; I mean, the solvency reserve releases are a function of decisions that are taken locally by the actuaries and they are not something that we can pull the trigger on at our discretion. But as I said, there is a pattern here where we need &#x2013; I mean, it's normal to have a high cushion at the peak of the cycle and to reduce this cushion as the cycle deteriorates. And when the cycle improves again, there is a period where you will build the reserves and a period where you release some of the excess reserves. And we believe that at this stage we are still very conservatively reserved; that's all I can say at this stage.</p>

          <p>Hi, Duncan Russell from JPMorgan. First question, could you just talk &#x2013; I haven't seen anywhere in the presentation what you're carrying corporate bond portfolio at in aggregate at the gross level before policyholder/shareholder split. So could you just give me how much unrealized losses you have on the corporate bond portfolio as of the full year '08, please?</p>
          <p>Second question is the private equity and hedge funds, you haven't given anywhere how much of that is the shareholders, how much of that is the policyholders, or at least I couldn't see it. Could you give me that please?</p>
          <p>And then third question is just to confirm on the Solvency I calculation. I was having some trouble reconciling it with '07 numbers. So could you just confirm again that you haven't changed anything in terms of how you calculate that in either what's allowable, what's not allowable or how much of certain things are allowable or not allowable, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the corporate bonds that's what I said, just answering to Blair at the beginning. So that means that we have unrealized capital losses that are in OCI. And if we take the impact of the spreads, it's roughly speaking five billion, but this is offset roughly by five billion of capital gains. So that's why in the end we are close to zero in the unrealized capital gains on the whole 280 billion fixed income portfolio, including roughly 50% of corporate bonds and 50% of Treasury bonds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few questions. How's the portfolios moved so far this year? Because obviously you're down, the spreads are in. Some of those bank hybrids can be <mark type="inaudible" /> so I was wondering how that's looking?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you put $3 billion or euros or &#x2013; virtually the same, whatever, out to the States. Where did that come from? And are there now, having done that, fungibility constraints within your operation in terms of cycling capital, particularly to a U.S. operation where the regulator is slightly more stringent?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, there's some indication that the French regulator may cut you some slack in terms of allowing reserve redundancies to be calculated within the IGD. Is that something that you'd contemplate and would that have a material impact on you?</p>
          <p>Just going back to that question, what I was wondering, what is the corporate bond relative to par? Corporate bond portfolio as opposed to the whole of the fixed interest? That I think was what Duncan was trying to get to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I'll make comments on the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the movement, on U.S. three billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the movement from the portfolio in generally we don't do &#x2013; we don't have a daily view on this. So I can give you only qualitative indications. We have both decline in the equity portfolio, which declined by close to 10% in January. The share of the tax is seven billion. So I would say it's 10% of that ,700 million pre-policy of the participation. We have on the other hand spreads that have compressed by an amount which could probably be slightly bigger in total. So I don't think this is something that has a big impact overall on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The second question is related to fungibility. Yes, we've sent $3 billion, it was dollars, to the U.S. in '08. We have a commitment to send another 500 million in '09 if the RBC ratio was to go below 300%. And we clearly have the means to do that with the cash that is available at the holding company. We have less fungibility available with the various local insurance companies than we had in '08. We still have some. And we have a significant amount of cash at hand at the holding company, that gives us significant flexibility.</p>
          <p>Last question, on the flexibility that the French supervisor ACAM [Autorite de Controle des Assurances et des Mutuelles] would give on various aspects. This is something that I understand you've heard from one of our French competitors. We have an anticipation of this, which is &#x2013; that it is soft. You understand that on the prospective basis, looking at the solvency prospectively, the French supervisor would take into account elements like non-admissible subordinated debt in excess of the maximum, excessive redundant reserves and other factors of that nature but we &#x2013; it's not taken into account in the amount that we can publish. So that's our interpretation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if they were to do so, only the point on subordinated debt would represent a significant amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I should have mentioned two billion, so two billion is 10 points. But that's  not our interpretation of the current rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your last question related to the price, to the average market price of our corporate bond portfolio. So roughly speaking, we are around 95% on average. It goes &#x2013; it's quite concentrated, because most of our loans are senior loans, and if we take the senior loans, we are at roughly 97. And we have only a few subordinated loans, so that explains why we have achieved around that 95.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Rob Haines from JPMorgan. Sorry, I haven't had a chance to go through the entirety of this, so if there is an answer in the book, I apologize. But G&#xE9;rald gave us the number for like-for-like EV for the Group of 18.6 billion. Is this on the same assumption set of last year of just using the swaps curves without the addition of liquidity and year-end volatility? Or have we adjusted that 18.6 for those two items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's quite clear. So that means that the 18.6 billions that I've mentioned instead of 31.1 that we established, it's calculated exactly on a consistent methodology with the 34.8 that we have been publishing one year ago. So that means that in term of volatility, in term of all the different parameters, that's something absolutely consistent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the cost of &#x2013; the impact of the liquidity premium that we took, i.e., 50 basis points for Europe, zero for Japan and 100 basis points for the U.S., it brought a bit more than four billion in term of EV.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. If I took say 10.6, I'd have to knock 4 billion to get it to exactly the same basis as last year..</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you should take also into consideration the fact that this has been calculated at an extremely low point in term of interest rate and since then in the U.S., for example, we recovered something like 60 or 70 basis points. In Europe, we recovered something like 30 basis points. So that's why it's quite relevant with this type of illiquidity premium.</p>

          <p>And the average volatility seems higher than the September 30 volatility.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think my questions have actually been &#x2013; one of them has just been answered. If I could just &#x2013; actually, it's Tony Silverman at Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. On the volatility, what volatility does that mean you are using? Was there some assumption that it would return to a normal level over a period of time? One of your peer groups yesterday did that. Or was it an average over the past year?</p>
          <p>And the second question was on the off-balance sheet property, which was 3.4 billion on the slide that was helpfully put up. I was wondering how that compares, how that relates to the 1.8 billion on page 7 of the EV report, which is again, is off-balance sheet capital gains. I don't know if one's before <mark type="inaudible" /> holding tax and the other is after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start up with your question on volatilities. If you take the EV report on page 38, so you have all the explanation of what we take in term of volatility. So, as I tell you &#x2013; as I told you it's implied volatility of market prices. It's on 5, 10, and 20 years for both equities and swaptions. Just as a matter of explanation of what I said before, if you take for example, the U.S., equity volatilities are 28.32%. Last year we were at 22.4. On the Euro zone at 10 years we are at 29.19, 1 year ago we are 24.6. And roughly speaking it's same for swaptions, it's even worse, because taking the U.S. 10 years we're at 16.12, whereas one year ago we were at 12.7.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning. Sorry, good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I may three questions. First on slide 47, you mention your sensitivities and you talk about 1% default on fixed income. Could you remind us where it is, which level, this 1%? The second question, sorry to come back on the U.S., but we understand that to offshore the U.S. is going to get some capital relief from the current regulator. Did you ask yourself for some capital relief? And more generally speaking is there any risk that the French regulator could change the view on capital needs for the U.S.? And the last question I see, Denis Duverne mentioned that on price for the shares they potentially would be one-third dilutive versus the ordinary shares, maybe I missed something there. Could you elaborate a little bit there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the 1% default assumption it's a straight assumption. We have assumed that 1% of our corporate bond portfolio would default. So that's &#x2013; there's no benchmark against that, just an expectation. That's a demonstration the sensitivity if 1% of our corporate bonds was to default. Second question in the U.S we happen to be in the state of New York, which is the most conservative, prudent, protective of policyholders of all the 50 states and we do not expect any particular capital relief. It is true that some of our U.S. competitors have obtained in some other states capital relief under conditions which have not been made public, and so we don't &#x2013; there has been some numbers that have been mentioned, but clearly there is not a level playing field in the U.S. because we have different supervisors in each state, but we are regulated by New York.</p>
          <p>As far as the French regulators are concerned in relation to the U.S, I don't know what you're talking about because the U.S. is applying the U.S. regulation. The French regulators, French supervisors are applying both the French supervisory rules and the European solvency rules from a conservative basis. They could potentially not allow us to transfer funds to the U.S., but this is not the case at this stage. So, I don't have any particular concern on this.</p>
          <p>On the preference shares, we have just made a calculation of what the dilution would be if we were to issue equity versus preference shares. And our calculation tell us that equity would be three times as dilutive of preference shares. Or rather that preference shares would be three times less dilutive than equity. Because the &#x2013; once we set the &#x2013; because the preference shares are not convertible into straight equity and once we set the rate of a preference share it is set to us and there are limits to the amounts of dividend that we would pay which, in the last resolution, is 14%, a maximum of 14% of the nominal as an equivalent of interest. Whereas if you issue equity, you issue equity first with a discount. And then the dividends will grow with the earnings. So, that's the reason why the dilution is much less serious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question from...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Ritchie from Citadel. Just three very quick questions. First of all, could you just clarify in the 18.6 billion of EV as it would be on the old basis this year, what was the impact of the fair value of your own debt? And second question, in your capital structure, please remind us what bit is your capital structure loss absorbing? In other words, the perpetuals, and if you would issue preferreds, would they be loss-absorbing capital as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To answer your first question on the fair value of debt, so the fair value of debt and the <mark type="inaudible" /> end of the year. Assuming that we would take the <mark type="inaudible" /> the old methodology, the mark-to-market of that would be 2.9 billion. Where does it come from? You get the answer on page 43 of the specific appendix on this. It comes from the fact that we have super subordinated debt and most of these debts have been issued with a spread of 1.5%. Now we are far above this level, and so they are all &#x2013; they all have a market price, which is close to 50%. So, that explains why we had a surge in the unrealized gain on this debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would preferred be loss-absorbing was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our debt, our existing debt is not loss-absorbing, and the preferred would be loss-absorbing. They would be loss-absorbing in proportion of the issuance premium.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Crean at Citi again. I just want to follow up on a question asked earlier. What is the U.S. RBC at December? And then a more general question on your investment philosophy currently. When, as corporate bonds mature and as net flows come in, are you reinvesting in corporate bonds at the same sort of grossing rates? Or have you been moving into govies in the fourth quarter to sort of protect yourself? Is that still the case? How are you viewing the current spreads? Are you running shy of them or taking a big benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the RBC in the U.S. it was 329% at year end. And on the re-investments, G&#xE9;rald, you want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been extremely cautious in the fourth quarter last year. So that means that we were mostly cash. As you can see in the presentation, Denis mentioned to you that we had a cash position about 40 billion. Nevertheless we are investing in corporate bonds, not exclusively. We are roughly speaking, as I said, 50% in the bonds, 50% in corporate bonds. We will slightly increase the corporate bonds and at least we reinvest in high-grade corporate bonds like senior debts from banks and from large corporate.</p>
          <p>About the spread, you can see that in January there were some attractive new issues from the utilities. And for example, you have spreads. The spread was at 20 basis points. That's the kind of risk that we can take, and that keeps some significance off side in terms of interest rate. In the end what does it mean? That means that when you reinvest money, you can reinvest, you can offset and even be better off than you can offset most of the decline of the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly I would say that we are flat in terms of our reinvestment rate, it's very close to our existing rate right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. <mark type="inaudible" />, couple of very quick questions, I hope. I think G&#xE9;rald said without liquidity premier the EV would have been four billion lower. Is there any kind of, I'm looking at page, what page am I looking at where the embedded value report &#x2013; page 10, the sensitivities on page 10 the embedded value report. Is there any kind of rough rule of thumb how you get from base incentives there to the four billion number you mentioned? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, again, just to clarify on page, where's it gone, page 39 of the embedded value report, second paragraph there you talk about volatilities, swaptions and implied volatilities, et cetera, et cetera. You seem to imply you take an average number for the whole year 2008? I know I'm taking long here, but I vaguely remember last year that was the average for the last two weeks, wasn't it, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Okay. I start with your last question. So, last year it was absolutely consistent with the other decision that we took. We'd have done exactly the same. So the volatility level would have been the same last year. So your question, to be sure I understood your question on Page 10, your question is to see if the illiquidity premium has an impact on sensitivities in EV and NBV, is it right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As stated, I was earlier trying to get some insights about the illiquidity premium.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Earlier I was trying to get at what estimate that four billion number, playing around with some of the sensitivities on Page 10? And came to a number a bit over two billion rather than four billion. So I'm just wondering if going forward is there kind of a rough rule of thumb how you can use the sensitivities on Page 10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Can we get the mike here in front? Technically it's not the same as the sensitivities on the interest rate, because what we do is we add 50 dilutes here, or 50 of undiluted on the curve that we use to project all the flow without changing the value of the assets, which means that it's hard to consequent that productivity at a higher range than less than 12% of sale. We have been out of the middle on the front options, this currency. But actually technically that's not the same as the interest rate you're <mark type="inaudible" />. So there is no way you can reveal that using the sensitivities as they stand. So there is no way you can reveal that using the sensitivities as they stand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. We stopped to see some of your competitors during some goodwill impairments on their most recent acquisitions. Do you see any reason to follow this trend in the coming quarters? And my second question is related to the view you have on your competitive position regarding the credited rates on live products, especially in Continental Europe? Do you think that the rates you're bearing they currently are effective enough to keep the commercial momentum? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On goodwill impairments, and we are as you have seen we have not incurred any goodwill at the end of '08 because we didn't feel it was appropriate to do that. We will review the situation in each of the coming periods and the question is going to be a judgment as to whether the change in market conditions is something that is going to continue for quite a long time or is temporary.</p>
          <p>When I look at our most recent acquisitions in the face of Mexico, I don't see any reason to have any particular concern because this company was not making money when we bought it. It made a little bit of money in the first six months and we expect it to be improving its profitability quite rapidly in the next several years. In the case of Russia, it's a bit different because there was an expectation of high quotes of the motor markets in Russia. And even though we have a very profitable business, which is in line with the assumptions, if growth doesn't come back in Russia because IFRC would be permanently depressed. We would have to review the situation but it's too early to say anything more than that at this stage.</p>
          <p>In terms of the complication on crediting rates, I suppose that you are asking the question in relation to France. We have &#x2013; had a policy this year in France which is very consistent with the one of the previous years, which is that we are not the most competitive and never try to be the most competitive. We are among the companies that offer an attractive, I mean a different rate, which takes into account our financial strength, the investment income that we have earned with a quite good financial [management policy and the level of profitability that we want to give to the shareholders and we are in front in individual life in 2008. We have gained market share because the bank-insurers were losing market share. We believe that we have maintained our competitive position overall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important point today is, I mean, for the clients there is a slight equality. So I don't think we need to overpay. Is there another question on the phone. No? Thank you. In the room? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's Tony Silverman, Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Just to follow-up on an earlier question. How is the U.S. built into your &#x2013; how does the French regulator build the U.S. into your Solvency I required capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The U.S. is built exactly the same way as any other business. It's treated as if it was a French business or as if it was an E.U. business. So the solvency requirement is based on the reserves and the solvency available is determined at the Group liquidity level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How &#x2013; the follow-up question would be how those, what you actually use doing that relate to the NAIC minimum? Is it something like one time? Or something like two times that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the addition of resource and capital in the U.S. system and resource and capital as determined in our European Solvency regime, they are about the same with a gap of something like 500 million. So it's quite close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, final question for me. I am just a bit confused on what the trigger point for, during this <mark type="inaudible" />, on the one hand you said rating agencies may downgrade but it's only not by much and you wouldn't spend anyway. You said your Solvency margin is pretty well above the hundred. Sounds like the regulator is allowing for soft factors which could amount to 2, 3, 4 billion. So under what circumstances are you going to raise capital, equity, or non-equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Remember Greenspan's answer when asked a total similar question? I think the &#x2013; don't expect us to give a precise trigger point. There is no reason. We will do it when we feel it's appropriate if there is a need. If there is a need. At this stage we don't think there is a need. Okay? So the way we, the way you have to look at it is I think quite simple, what we are telling you is we are adding an instrument to the toolkit, which is an instrument which can be used in case of necessity and which is less diluted than ordinary shares.</p>
          <p>We also tell you that the mutuals have significant resources and we'd be ready to go and underwrite that if needed but that other people could also underwrite them, I mean the market, therefore we have this fair resolution. When would we use it? I'm not going to go beyond the answer but we'll use it if we think we need it, the day when we will use it. Points. What are the driving elements? The regulators can ask us for more capital if they become uncomfortable in a sort of cushy world. It's not the case today. So that's it. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just to follow-up on that then. How concerned or unconcerned are you about the tangibility of your capital? Something that's often talked about it's gone, it's roughly gone down by 50% and you're talking about adding potentially further non-equity capital to the base, which would potentially increase, increase the leverage for ordinary shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what we've been telling you is also very simple. It's clear that the margins there are not what they used to be in normal market circumstances, but we are also going through very difficult times. What are the key driving forces? The key driving forces are what are the regulators asking you to have to underwrite your business? That's it. And preferred shares would be admissible to satisfy the regulatory requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This whole discussion about tangibility is a red herring frankly because we've been a company that hasn't made acquisitions over the last 20 years, we have significant amounts of DBI which is a real asset and DBO, which is a real asset if we continue to write new business. And frankly, you cannot buy a life company without paying dividend, unless you buy a run off, essentially. So this is, I mean, I don't think it's really a serious point. Yes.</p>
