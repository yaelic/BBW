      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for coming today for the first half earnings report of Glencore. Today I'm accompanied by my &#x2013; with my colleagues. And on the right-hand side, you have Gary Fegel, Head of Alumina, Aluminium. We have next to him Telis Mistakidis, the Head of Zinc, Copper. Next to him Chris Mahoney, the Head of Grain division; Steve Kalmin, our CFO; Tor Peterson on the left, the Head of our Coal division; Alex Beard, the Head of the Oil division and Paul Smith, the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>So, starting off today representing the first half results. As you've seen we have a strong profit growth highlighting the diversity of Glencore's business model. The EBIT during the first half of 2011 as opposed to the &#x2013; $3.3 billion is up 50% from the previous half 2010. Net income is up 57%, up to $2.5 billion. And as you can see, this represents strong operating cash flow of around about $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>We have a robust balance sheet as you can imagine since the IPO. We have available committed facilities, $10.4 billion. And this provides securities and opportunities for us going into the future if we &#x2013; in respect of any acquisitions or any growth, which will come or we envisage us to do in the future.</p>
          <p>Our gearing is down at 22%, down from 43%. And S&amp;P and both Moody's investment grade ratings have strengthened in July since the IPO and we're pleased to announce during the first half we will be making our maiden dividend of $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>The growth projects are all on track and we will talk about that when we look at the industrial assets. But turning to the next slide, looking at the Marketing division of the business and as you well know we split out the marketing from the industrial assets. We also breakdown within the Marketing division, the Metals division, the Grain division, and the Energy division, and if you're looking at first half 2010 as opposed to first half 2011, the marketing side of the business has grown 45%.</p>
          <p>Strong growth on the oil part of the trading business, the Marketing division and as you can see the Metals division has been fairly stable, $635 million to $633 million, and the Grain is slightly down due to the vagrancies in the market during the first half, which should be strong in the second half.</p>
          <p>During the Metals division &#x2013; was very strong during the second quarter, and comparing first half 2010 to the first half 2011, first half 2010 was strong in the Metals division because of the restocking in China, which took place, which was strong in zinc and copper during first half of 2010, not as strong in 2011, but starting to pick up during second quarter 2011. We had strong growth in Alumina and Aluminum division.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the Oil has been very strong during first half 2011 and especially strong during first quarter of 2011, backing off during second quarter due to the overcharge opportunities not existing during that period.</p>
          <p>The Agricultural suffered several markets, specific factors which affected it, the Russian grain export ban during the first half, which should be &#x2013; which has now been released and second half should be more positive with this having changed. So, therefore, looking quarter-per-quarter also it gives you an idea how we increased on the Metals side, and the Oil done, as mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, basically breaking up the different divisions and most of these items are covered in the previous slide, but it just gives you an idea in the Energy Products, and the Metals division, the exact profit made. Energy Products increasing 200%, up to $552 million, and giving you an idea of the growth which occurred in the Metals division, where it existed during those periods.</p>
          <p>Agricultural was somewhat disappointing, as I said, because of the overall strength in the grains, which were strong and oilseed during the first half of the year was offset by cotton, which Chris will give a little bit more description later on when we delve into the questions on that issue.</p>
          <p>Looking at the industrial side of the division, as you can imagine, with volumes growing on the industrial side of the business. As you well know, we are expanding most of our productions, especially our production bases in the Congo in respect to copper, in Kazakhstan in respect of the gold production, and the growth in our coal operations in Prodeco. So, with volumes higher, higher prices during the first half of 2011, as opposed to first half of 2010, we've increased the profits on the industrial side of the business from $1.3 billion, up 54% to $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Very strong performance in most of these assets, and the good thing about it, if you turn to the next page, which is very important, that we have grown the assets, the development of most of these industrial assets has grown considerably, and we have delivered most of these projects. We are delivering them on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>If you look at most of the production, looking at the metal side, Kazzinc's own gold production is up 62%, Katanga copper production, up 72%, Mopani copper production, up 58%, and Mutanda copper production at 25,000 tonnes. The coal production is up to &#x2013; 12%, including both our South African and our Colombian operations. We're up to 11.1 million tonnes and Prodeco production up 32% to 7.1 million tonnes, and the Aseng oil field is expected to come on-stream during fourth quarter 2011, and this is ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>So most of our industrial assets, as opposed to what we're seeing with the other mining companies, we are delivering them on budget, on time. Some of them a little bit delayed. Katanga has a few delays. The gold production in Kazakhstan has delays; however, this is well-compensated by the Mutanda expansion, which is ahead of schedule, and even the Katanga operation, even though it's behind on schedule on copper produced, it's not behind on schedule on copper mined in the ore. There we're up to &#x2013; right up to budget our expectations and slightly ahead, but few problems on the concentrate, and the smelter has affected this, but that backlog will be picked up well in 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, once again, talking about the organic growth of Glencore, and the production expansions, which we're having at our operations, it gives you an idea between 2011 and 2014. With the approved expansions, I think we have the highest pipeline percentage-wise of growth as against the other mining companies, and we have 72% growth. That is excluding the growth at Kansuki, and the agricultural production, whereby we're getting 20% growth annually over the next three years. And if you include Kansuki, and the agricultural assets, we're growing around about 27% growth per year, which really is a industry leader.</p>
          <p>Looking at the continued ramp-up of the assets that I mentioned earlier, Kazzinc, we remain on track, once again, very much on track on-line and budget. We do not see cost overruns as we expand these, as we proved up-to-date, we haven't had cost overruns. And we are not expecting cost overruns going into the future to get all these assets up to stream. As I've said earlier, Kazzinc, the gold processing will come fully up to stream. We will be producing around about 750,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and if you include the zinc units equivalent to gold, it will be round about 850,000 ounces, and operations and CapEx are below budget in fact.</p>
          <p>Katanga, as Katanga announced recently, they intend speeding up their ramp-up phase of production, whereby the 310 &#x2013; 320,000 metric tonnes of copper production is expected to be ahead of the planned budget which we had, and therefore, we're speeding that up to hit that rate quicker in a quicker timeframe, and we could even increase that around about six to nine months. But Telis will give further detail on the expansions at Katanga, the reserves at Katanga, including Mutanda and Kansuki, and how we intend merging those &#x2013; Mutanda and Kansuki together, where we believe we'll have one of the lowest cost producer in the world, with very low capital expenditure and definitely a world leader in the amount of capital expenditure there to produce the amount of gold, which we will be producing.</p>
          <p>On the oil side, turning to the next slide, I mentioned about Mutanda, how we intend growing Mutanda, which is very important. Mutanda will produce 60,000 tonnes of copper this year. However, by the end of the year, it will be annualized at around about 110,000 tonnes. And we are now developing a feasibility expansion of Mutanda to merge it together with Kansuki and look at an operation of around 210,000 tonnes at that site.</p>
          <p>The oil, as I said, the Aseng field, well, is already covered earlier, but the Alen field commenced development drilling earlier this month and first production there is expected in 2013, once again, ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>Prodeco, we've mentioned, and we're fully on track to reach our 20 million tonnes by 2013, including the port expansion, and the capital expenditure of the port expansion and another project well in line on budget and on time.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll leave it to Steve to take you through the financial numbers.</p>
          <p>[07FQSM-E Steven Kalmin]</p>
          <p>Thank you, Ivan. Page 11 is the one we're on. Just a few slides on the financial metrics and a little bit of a waterfall bridge on the Industrial side of Glencore in a format that many of you would be very familiar with as we move through the slides.</p>
          <p>I think Ivan covered the themes, and the trends both in the Marketing, and the Industrial side, good, strong year-over-year performances in both those that delivered a EBIT improvement in Glencore from $2.2 billion up to $3.3 billion, a 50% improvement there over the period split; 45% on the Marketing and 54% on the Industrial side.</p>
          <p>Within Glencore's business that does tend to translate very strongly into cash flow generation, pre-working capital, which we show some of the metrics down there, a 37% improvement there. And a key metric, our funds from operation was up to 56% to $1.4 billion to $2.15 billion. That's a key number also for some of you that may look towards Glencore's credit metrics, its cash flow metrics, some of the things that the &#x2013; and the targets at the rating agencies where you may look at amongst their many ratios, FFO, net debt for our business as other &#x2013; as I look at other industrial mining companies, as well as other marketing companies, seems to get the highest weighting, it's your ongoing cash flow generated, including dividends from associates after interest, after tax, reflects your proper capital structure, and how you fund it in terms of that coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>The fact that our net debt, and we'll talk about that on the next few slides as well, reduced significantly from the end of 2010 to $8.3 billion, during 2011 at $8.3 billion, translated into an FFO to net debt ratio of 50%, which is amongst the strongest that's been in Glencore's history.</p>
          <p>To give some perspective of where a BBB-type credit would be, in terms of expectations and target levels, that's more in the mid-20s and we are very strong in terms of cash flow debt coverage, and the improvements, obviously in our net debt as we have reduced that down.</p>
          <p>It hasn't been operating cash induced. Of course, the main reason for the reduction in net debt was the IPO proceeds that came in in May 2011. But we haven't seen some other big increase in our debt levels within the normal cycle. Our CapEx, in terms of the growth that Ivan spoke about, and the capital efficiencies of what we are spending to make, to deliver that 72% growth over the next two or three years, is very competitive against many other projects that you'd be following out there in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So our normal operating cash flow pre-working capital. Our interest costs are relatively low at the moment. We'll talk about that. Our tax base at least in cash terms is very low. We can talk about that as well. And our CapEx is very manageable so we should have very strong free cash flow generation, which will allow this business to reduce leverage and support growth within the business as well.</p>
          <p>If we move into Page 12, what we provided and this is just on the Industrial side, a bridge of the EBIT 2010, $1.3 billion up to the $2.1 billion for the first half of 2011. It doesn't make as much sense to do it on the marketing part, you can quite easily &#x2013; we've provided the EBIT, obviously. of the marketing between those two periods and you can see it between the various segments that showed improvements, of course, in Energy, Metals flat, and a little bit down in the Agri business.</p>
          <p>But on the Industrial side, the shape of this graph would look very familiar with others that you would have seen in many of the commodities. We do have good volume growth as we have experienced so there's a nice green line that is contributing there of the $241 million, which has come from growth particularly in Metals and Mining, gold, copper, zinc and also, Energy as we're ramping up production over at the Prodeco operation. The pricing benefits, again spread, weighted mostly towards Metals and Mining in our Gold, Copper, Zinc businesses as well there, that's $557 million in fact, is Metals and Mining and $107 million relates to coal within the price variance.</p>
          <p>These variances would even be &#x2013; they're even somewhat distorted by the fact that we do have quite a lot of inventory that hasn't been sold. So, our production is even higher than some of our sales volume, some of the points that when Ivan's first slides, there's at around $100 million of EBITDA tied up at Kazzinc and Katanga on copper concentrates that's only a timing as they are &#x2013; as they work through the processing systems within both those organizations, that should reverse back in second half 2011. That is creating even worse effects on some of these graphs than would have otherwise be the case both in cost, as well as volume variances as well.</p>
          <p>The cost variance of $325 million, we're not immune to cost creep as any other company within the mining industry, not least at which we're operating in jurisdictions that have good stronger local currencies. The $325 million is around 7.2% of our Industrial cost base. We think that's a credible overall increase in cost base and unit cost over that period, particularly taken into account the strengthening of local currencies. The Australian dollar, of course, affects us not as much as other companies. We're more diversified across many currencies than some of the other companies that you would cover as well.</p>
          <p>So the $325 million split roughly a third between FX and a third then between normal CPI-related activities and another bigger portion would relate to just general increases that we've seen also in consumable explosives at the surface operations, diesel, power cost, and in Zambia, we've seen tariff increases down there as well. But in real terms, we are seeing some unit cost reductions as we're transforming many of these assets into more efficient and low-cost operations. You'll see that in Katanga as we move forward, we'll see that in Prodeco as that expands.</p>
          <p>The depreciation amortization just reflects the extra production sales, and the associate income, primarily Xstrata, in that as well, but we also have some associate accounting coming through of assets that are starting to produce some healthy earnings off a lower base as well like Mutanda, at the moment, even our 40% holding comes through there and Kazzinc has a 50% stake in the gold mine, an overture at Kansuki, which also comes through the associate line in terms of gold earnings.</p>
          <p>If we move on to Page 13 and a few, a few balance sheet liquidity snapshots, I would emphasize that this is an area we feel extremely comfortable on and extremely puts us in a very, very strong position. Robust is an understatement in terms of where we are with balance sheets and funding and metrics at the moment.</p>
          <p>We provided the three layers gross funding in the overall facilities, drawn facilities across the banking asset-backed and bond markets in which we're operating. Net funding, we've got some cash so that's just brings it down to that. And the net debt is with the offset of our readily marketable inventories, which was essentially flat during the six-month period, $14.3 billion to $14.2 billion. That translates into a very low gearing ratio of 22%, debt to debt plus equity.</p>
          <p>That looks at a historical basis, it's based on book ratios, sort of the gearing ratios, which can create some distortions when comparing companies against, one against the other, but what never lies in terms of these ratios and is fully comparable is FFO to net debt. That is your cash flow, that is your serviceability and your coverage, which as I said, was 50% and a net debt EBITDA moving towards 1:1 and interest coverage in excess of eight, a very strong coverage ratio there.</p>
          <p>As Ivan mentioned we did see strengthening on both sides of the two major rating houses where S&amp;P upgraded us to BBB in July. With stable outlook at Moody's stabilized what was a negative outlook, which had been there since 2008 or so and improved their short-term rating up to P2. I encourage you to have a look at some of their publications and releases that they've put out, again explaining their methodology.</p>
          <p>Very strong metrics in going into second half, $10.4 billion as Ivan mentioned of cash and committed undrawn, unsecured credit lines. These are available to us for the medium term. These are not facilities that need to be refinanced in any shape in the next three years. Essentially, the main tranche of our committed banking facilities, the $8.4 billion runs until May 2014 and we have some other facilities that run until May 2013 as well.</p>
          <p>There was an additional $2 billion that we also have available. It really is in the same category. So, we can almost talk about $12.4 billion. We have another $2 billion available under committed, but 364-day borrowing base facilities against some of our receivables and some by inventory. As part of the IPO proceeds, these facilities used to be more heavily drawn. Part of the IPO process that we got in just in terms of efficiencies and cash management. We did pay down some of those facilities during Q2 as well.</p>
          <p>The second quarter saw $1.3 billion working capital released. In the second quarter something you would expect in an environment where you did see some moderation in commodity prices. There's a very high correlation between Glencore's working capital and commodity prices. We saw zinc, copper, nickel across the Metals, oil prices generally lower, Q2 over Q1.</p>
          <p>Our VaR level was pretty consistent from 2011 to 2010, well within our group-wide aggregate tolerance level if you like of $100 million. And on funding cost within the business that's going to see some improvements in net interest as we move forward is we have seen an improvement in our variable cost of funding since IPO of around 50 basis points. That reflects some refinancings that we've done. It affects some reductions that we had by rating grids within our long-term facilities. The higher your rating is, you pay less. There's a little bit of variation there.</p>
          <p>We refinanced the Xstrata secured loans. We had $2.3 billion outstanding. Earlier in the year, we refinanced that with a new $2.7-billion facility, and the funding cost, the spread levels came in quite significantly. That should translate again into lower net interest and funding cost second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We've also, at a marginal level, have looked to take out some of the highest cost fixed rate debt that we've had within Glencore's capital structure and maybe served us better as a private company than it does as a public company today. You would have seen we redeemed $400 million of 8% perpetual bonds in August this year as well. Again, it's going to help in lowering our funding cost as well.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand back to Ivan for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just talking about the outlook and we see the balance for the performance of the company during the second half. Looking at the Marketing side of the business, there's still continued market volatility and tight supply conditions exist in many commodities. As you've seen, most of the mining companies are struggling to ramp up their supply. BHP mentioned yesterday in their results announcements how they are struggling, and how other mining companies are struggling to increase their supply.</p>
          <p>So we continue to see volatility and tightness in the markets due to supply constraints and continued demand occurring in both China, and the new growth occurring in India. So, with China, which consumes 50% of the world's commodities continuing to grow, continuing to demand commodities, we still see tight supply &#x2013; tight conditions in the markets for a while.</p>
          <p>The diversified model of Glencore, having both the marketing and within the market, and the industrial side of the business, but having within the marketing the various different commodities. And as you've seen, if you look quarter per quarter, or first half against first half results having the Energy together with the Minerals, together with the Grains, the diversity continues to ensure we have a good results on the Marketing side of the business.</p>
          <p>We do see continued recovery in certain of the commodities during the second half of 2011. And as we've mentioned earlier, the Coal, we expect better performance in the second half, with the flooding, which occurred in Australia, disrupted the amount of supply and volume, which we traded, marketed during first half of 2011. That is expected to increase in the second half. And the same in the Grain side of the business with the restrictions on the export from Russia opening up, that should also increase that part of the business.</p>
          <p>As we ramp up our industrial assets, as we've always said, the marketing having our own production feeding into the Glencore system allows us to increase the marketing activity. It gives us more opportunities to blend our own product in with third-party product. It also gives us better opportunities as we increase our own production to be able to arbitrage the pricings, which occur around the world and swap our tonnes with third-party tonnes and take advantage of that situation, which increases the Marketing side of the business.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Industrial side of the business, as Steve said, during the second half of the year, we will release about $100 million of EBITDA, which is due to the buildup of inventory before the concentrate at Katanga and Kazzinc before the &#x2013; with the copper smelter is coming online in the next &#x2013; it's already being commissioned now. That will be online in the next month. The buildup of concentrates before the smelter will be released through the smelter and that should generate that income.</p>
          <p>Recovery of the production due to delay of equipment as we saw on Prodeco with the delay of equipment coming from Japan with the tsunami effect and we will be &#x2013; the production will pick up during the second half and we should &#x2013; we expect to have production at Prodeco around about 14.8 million tonnes, 14.9 million tonnes of export there as opposed, which is slightly behind the budget on that side, which was meant to be around about 15.5 million tonnes.</p>
          <p>We are totally focused on achieving these overall production targets with a long life, and what is very important to us and we proved during the first half to deliver these projects on time and on budget and not to have the cost overruns and because the budgets were done in a fairly high-priced environment during 2007, we do not foresee a problem in meeting the capital budgets, which we have set for them.</p>
          <p>We will continue looking for opportunities on the asset side of the business and as you saw, we recently announced the &#x2013; our intention to buy back the balance of our shares, which we do not own in Minara in Australia, the 27%, which we don't own. We have now, for a cost of around about $285 million, clean up the Minara piece, which we don't own. And we will continue looking for underlying opportunities, which exist in this sector today.</p>
          <p>The decline in commodity in prices of &#x2013; on the equity side, whether private or public companies, we do not have the balance sheet. One of the reasons we did take this company public, we said so that we could continue looking for these opportunities. We are in the enviable position as Glencore being a company that deals with all third-party suppliers.</p>
          <p>So we are talking to third-party suppliers regularly. We see opportunities more frequently than our competitors do, I believe, because we do have these relationships with third-party suppliers, so we see opportunities with the current equity markets as they are today, and we'll continue looking for opportunities across the board.</p>
          <p>So the management team sitting here with me today is excited about these opportunities, and therefore, this company will intending to grow both the Marketing business, the Industrial growing, the Industrial business, but definitely looking for new acquisitions along the way.</p>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; thank you for that. And we're open for any questions, which Paul will handle.</p>

          <p>Jason Fairclough, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Guys, since the volatility that we've seen in the market over the past few months, we've seen a big pullback in mining and commodity-related equity. And yet the commodity prices themselves don't seem to come off that much. I just wondering if you have any comment on that dislocation between the commodities, and the equities?</p>

          <p>I mean, I'm not an economist, and the way the commodity &#x2013; the equity markets work. But I think you know the fear factor because of sovereign debt, people have taken money out of the equity markets and are putting it into safe haven investments, where sitting on the sidelines. You've seen that you guys know the equity markets better than me. What I do know in the commodity markets, which we followed and my team around me, we look at the month's supply, we look at volumes and that's what we focused on.</p>
          <p>It seems clear and as we mentioned earlier, we still see strong demand in Asia, we see the tightness in the supply side, with producers struggling to meet &#x2013; to increase their production. So, therefore, the underlying fundamentals on the commodity side are the true fundamentals and that's what's guiding the commodity price and that's why you haven't seen a falloff on the commodity price and equity markets is for a different reason.</p>

          <p>Good morning, it's Heath Jansen here from Citi. I just wanted to know your thoughts behind just buying out the minorities of Minara. Clearly, you've done it at Minara and also, at Kazzinc now. Are you looking to do more of that? And I guess Katanga springs to mind? And just on that, I mean, if you're looking to sort of incorporate Mutanda and Kansuki together, I mean, are you looking to streamline the shareholder structure there? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's clear, we naturally cannot comment on which public companies we would look to buy out minorities, but as we've said, we'll always act opportunistically so we cannot comment on Katanga being a public company. But we'll look for opportunities that exist.</p>
          <p>Regarding Kansuki, Mutanda, yes, we do intend putting those two assets together. It's a synergistic effect, but Telis can comment more on that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I think, it was stated before, we are, as we speak, in the process of negotiating the merger of the two companies, Mutanda and Kansuki to make one asset and ramp that up to 210,000 tonnes. And we are negotiating to increase our shareholding to about 50%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason behind Minara, it was a complicated structure. As you know, we own 40% of the Murrin Murrin joint venture. Minara owns 60% of the Murrin Murrin joint venture. Of the 60%, we own 74% of it previously so it was a complicated joint venture structure. We believe the pricing is favorable at these levels so therefore, it made good sense to clean up the structure to put it all under the control of Glencore that we did not have to bother with this joint venture tough structure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Liam Fitzpatrick from Credit Suisse. Just a question around the marketing side in Energy and in Ag, it's clearly been quite lumpy if we look at 2010, and then at Q1 and Q2. If we're looking out over the next 18 months, what do you think is a reasonable sort of run rate we should be thinking in each of those businesses with preference to what's been delivered over the last 6 months to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, you want to talk about the Energy side of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, I mean, on the Oil side, I mean, I think it is correct to say it's been lumpy. I think you look at the volatility we've had in the oil price, and the oil market structure, and it has been fairly challenging. Certainly, this year, the first quarter was a very good trading conditions with the dislocation between WTI and Brent. We've had a lot of dislocations in the market with Japan, and then of course, the conflict in Libya, it certainly gave trading opportunities resulting from supply chain dislocations.</p>
          <p>Second quarter is definitely less interesting from a trading perspective. There's a number of difficult things to navigate and not least IAA release, which was very unexpected for a large part of the Oil market. So, I think trading conditions have been very choppy.</p>
          <p>It's very difficult to forecast the run rate, or very difficult to forecast those kind of events. I mean, I think what you can say is sort of the underlying improvement in supply and demand, it is there. I mean, it is going forward. There is no doubt that demand in the East is continuing to grow strongly. The West is clearly struggling economically and I think and until the western economy has sort of really pick up properly, you won't get a full bull market in oil, which will be strong trading conditions.</p>
          <p>So I think, in general, you'll see an improvement in genuine marketing and trading conditions over the next 18 months, specific sort of results and some of those are really going to depend on whether you have incidents like Libya, like the tsunami in Japan for providing specific good trading opportunities there.</p>

          <p>Talking, comment a bit on the Coal side, are you actually talking the Energy sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not quite sure what do you mean by lumpy and in that sense, but from a coal perspective, we see continued strong demand worldwide. Certainly in the growing economies, China. India remains key drivers for that from the seaborne perspective.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, with the nukes, being the moratorium on nuclear power in Germany, Europe actually is somewhat of a growth market in that perspective. With the indigenous production of the European market continuing to go down. I think you will see consistent and relatively strong demand worldwide. We continue to see that growth from a supply side. We think we still have over and above labor issues, geopolitical issues and weather issues, it's still supply constraint commodity from a logistical perspective in terms of rail and port capacity worldwide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that as well, in terms of our own volumes, obviously we are producing gradually more on our industrial business, which will flow through to the marking business. In addition, we're signing contracts on the agency side. Perhaps you could say something about that, Tor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We look at it from a growth perspective from our third party business. We continue to &#x2013; recently increased some of our agency businesses, which will actually outpace what we see as the world growth market in the seaborne market, and those are long-term businesses moving out three, five, eight years in that sense. Some of those, we've been working on for the past several years.</p>
          <p>One thing I think it's important to look at, we don't necessarily look at it from a quarterly basis. Coal, a little bit like from the Ag side is a seasonal business. And we take potentially the longer-term view, when we take certain &#x2013; our strategies, our strategic alliances with various producers and non-equity-based tonnages. So, I'm not quite sure &#x2013; I appreciate what you say with respect to looking at it from the last couple of quarters. But I think from a coal perspective, certainly, you have to take a little bit of a longer term view, an annual, if not 18 months and 36-month periods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, an important aspect to which Tor sort of indicated, what we do try to do as a company, and I know when we went public, and the analysts were trying to envisage our future growth and we took GDP growth, and therefore, you could look at what the growth of the commodity side of the business was in, if Glencore maintained market share, what would our volumes be?</p>
          <p>What we do as a company and we said at the time, we're continuing to push to make sure we exceed &#x2013; we increase our market share, and we exceed just GDP growth on the volume side of the business and I think that's what Tor is talking about.</p>
          <p>He has picked up a lot of new business, a lot of new agency business, which will ensure in the long term in the future, we will exceed &#x2013; gain market share. The same, which Telis can talk about, he has agreed the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:09) agency business on the Metals side of the business where we, once again, have tied up the agency agreement there until 2018. Am I correct, Telis?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A critical mass in the bulk commodities is certainly key. We're not necessarily volume-driven in that respect, but volume is obviously a major factor in the business, and you want to be there. Certainly, in the developing markets, obviously, from a customer performance risk, from a credit risk exposure, et cetera, et cetera, but you do want to make sure that you are outgrowing potentially the market overall in certain sectors.</p>
          <p>The China, the India has remained the key focus from the demand side. From a production side, you look at your traditional Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Russia, United States.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Sylvain Brunet with Exane BNP Paribas. The first question was on Peru. If you could share your views on the political situation there.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, I think we have a proven expert here, but I mean, we have &#x2013; our assets in Peru are Iscaycruz and Yauliyacu. We've been running those mines now for some time. From our point of view, what's happened was obviously &#x2013; you saw what happened in the elections. There was &#x2013; certain people have stated and Humala became the President and on a more populist approach. But what it looks like is that things will not be as drastic as what people may have feared at the time when the elections were won. I mean, at least the cabinet is there, and I now people are getting a feel of who the ministers are. And already people are talking about coming to some sort of agreement if taxes were to be raised, they will be based on profits rather than some sort of turnover tax. So, it will come from the bottom line, not from the top line, which was what people had feared initially. So, I would say things appear to be going on a moderate direction rather than not.</p>

          <p>CDS, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On CDS, I would say that it is certainly something that gets more brought to my attention from this forum than it does through any, sort of, internal thing that either, of course, we monitor these parts of our own sort of capital structure, but I can &#x2013; it'll be fair to say the last three months that I've not had one single call from the credit side, either through banking or capital markets to say question CDS, and what's been &#x2013; we &#x2013; we're also looking to sort of understand the market itself, as we do in any market, just to understand the plumbing behind these markets.</p>
          <p>It's a market that doesn't &#x2013; in terms of liquidity and functioning, there's been a huge evaporation from earlier years. We had the natural sellers of CDS, which would have been banks, insurance companies, and the like that have largely, largely stepped out of those particular markets in terms of any specific blank or reasons. I know others are also elevated, Mittal and others are certainly in that sort of level as well. And there's been a general creed to just reflect a somewhat of a re-pricing of risk generally in the marketplace, but more just the nature of CDS in very little liquidity, very little market that can move things 20, 30, 40 basis points with a couple of billion euro.</p>
          <p>CDS is not something in any of our financing drawdowns, facilities that drives Glencore's cost of funds. So, in &#x2013; either in banking or asset-backed markets, it would be more reflecting the kind of BBB-type spreads of normal strong corporates of which we're one and even in bond markets, if we were to go back into those markets, it's more about relative value against other secondary market, which is a slightly &#x2013; which also doesn't have a lot of liquidity at the moment, I guess, there's a little bit of testing as to what pricing there is out there, but it's not affecting us at all day to day, and I don't get any question marks on it, and it looks to be the buy of the century, apart from our equity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="ph" /> Manik at Morgan Stanley, just Ivan, in terms of the iron ore market, you did highlight at IPO that that was a market that you wanted to become more active in, at least from a marketing perspective. We saw the Mount Gibson off-take agreement. Is that something that's &#x2013; can you maybe comment as to how it's progressing beyond that, and how you see it maybe a year or two out in terms of getting further off-take agreements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the iron ore &#x2013; you will see we are growing that. We've signed that, besides Mount Gibson, we signed two other agency agreements, which have been announced. We continue to want to grow those &#x2013; that part of our trading business and any of these new iron ore mines, which are being developed, we're trying to get the agency agreement or equity-type positions with them. So, we continue to look at that.</p>
          <p>So we are growing our iron ore trading division. Unfortunately, the first half, we didn't increase our volumes as much as we would have liked to, but as you know, the major suppliers who have supplied us in the past, they were tight during their first half of the year because they were struggling to meet their existing commitments, so there wasn't enough free trade at iron ore.</p>
          <p>It's looking better during the second half of 2011, new increased production occurring around the world. Some of these new operations starting to open up. We will be getting their tonnes. So, that is a business we're definitely looking at from both the trading side of the business, marketing side of the business, increasing the tonnage on that side, and also, looking at investment opportunities, which may occur.</p>

          <p>Hi, This is <mark type="ph" /> Alan from Morgan Stanley. My question is on the freight rates, you guys had mentioned that you had a sluggish H1 in terms of the freight markets. What's your outlook for the second half, and do you see any pick-up, because as I understand, this is a main driver of your marketing business as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the freight rates on the dry side we don't have, we don't have much exposure to the freight market in respect of outright positions, long term target orders, ownership of vehicles, et cetera. How it affects the trading side, it's really on the dry side, mainly iron ore and coal, which Tor could maybe give a quick comment on.</p>
          <p>But the real exposure on the freight side where we have time charter positions, and we own 42 vessels. And it's the mainly on the wet side of the business, and Alex can talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in the beginning of the year, the freight market, obviously, the freight market's been very weak for the last 18 months. But in the beginning of the year, first quarter, there was a little bit of a pick-up, some strength resulting from the winter, strong cold winter in Northwest Europe and other areas.</p>
          <p>Coming into the second quarter, I think the market has sort of regressed back to the really bumping along the bottom there. And so the outlook for the second half of the year, I would say, is pretty much more of the same. And I think, you know, we have probably put in a bottom on the wet freight market. And you certainly see renewed investor interest in buying into wet tankers.</p>
          <p>I think the one encouraging thing to say is that you do see more spikes in the wet freight market these days, they tend to &#x2013; whereas previously we had a complete glut of ships, and no chance for the market spiking, from time to time now we are seeing spikes in particular markets, in particular segments. So, I think we've probably seen the worst of the wet freight market, but I think for the balance of this year, that conditions would still be fairly challenging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say from a dry side, we continue to see vessel supply outstripping the seaborne cargo trade growth, which obviously keeps sort of a flat line going forward, into the second half. That does limit your volatility, and some of your arbitrage opportunities, I wouldn't say it's a main driver, as you put it, of our business, it's certainly an important factor of that with respect to the arbitrage opportunities from country to country. I think we've seen the freight markets appear to have stabilized recently, continued demand from the Brazil, China route, which obviously pretty much controls part of that pricing power, but I think for the remainder of the year, it will be tough to see any material improvement for the second half of 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think similar comments to Tor. We don't run outright positions in the freight market. We have maybe 30 or 40 vessels on the medium term time charter. The grain market is mainly the Panamax fleet. The outlook is fairly flat lined, with big supply &#x2013; supply for the moment outstripping demand. There are some opportunities, arbitrage opportunities between different geographies and different vessel types. But freight is not a &#x2013; is not really a significant factor in our business either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Nick Hatch at RBS. Can you give an update for the second half of the year, and ongoing periods on how you see the tax charge evolving and particularly, the deferred tax credits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick. On tax, very much unchanged from the guidance we gave at the time of the IPO where we guided towards a marketing group tax rate of around 10%, certainly no more than that. We would hope to bring in less than that, but that's roughly the cutoff threshold on the Swiss, but we do do some other things globally as well.</p>
          <p>On Industrial side, it's going to be a function of the relative contribution from the jurisdictions in which we operate in Kazakhstan, having 20%, 25% tax rates there, South Africa, 30%, Australia, 30%, Zambia, Congo, Colombia, et cetera.</p>
          <p>That deferred tax asset that you're referring to, that's the tax asset that we raised to $427 million in respect of the half year. That was triggered as part of the restructuring of Glencore from its old partnership structure into the new public structure, which happens simultaneous upon the IPO.</p>
          <p>So the company had previous commitments that as and when the partners which had left had had a structure whereby was to pay back that equity. That collapsed, but the tax deductibility of collapsing that, which is what we historically had, was preserved, and the whole collapse of those old obligations, and converting them into normal equity triggered about a $5 billion tax deduction within the Swiss group. We'll have that available for seven years to shelter against taxable income that would otherwise occur within our Swiss corporate structure, which is essentially the marketing part of the business.</p>
          <p>So that $427 million is a real asset. That's some tax, which we would otherwise have had to pay in the near term. So, our cash taxes will still be lower than would otherwise be the case until we eat into that $427 million.</p>

          <p>Yes, the corporate, we &#x2013; as you know, we're going to purchase the asset up to 93% of Kazzinc. That will take place. We're still waiting for regulation and approvals during fourth quarter 2011. Then we will own 93% of Kazzinc, as was the Vasilkovskoje Gold. We will structure Vasilkovskoje Gold. That will give us optionality, what we wish to finally do with that company. And we have no commitment what we'll do with it; we will look at opportunities in 2012. There's been &#x2013; whether we IPO the company, noting that the gold companies get higher multiples, et cetera, whether we can do a merger with that. But we have no commitment with that. We'll just put it in place to see which way we'll go with that in the future.</p>

So, it's going to be a unit of Kazzinc, which is Vasilkovskoje and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:13), Rita which has got gold, it's all the gold, which is going to be in that vehicle.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's <mark type="ph" /> Johann <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:23) from Barclays Capital. Just one question quickly on your note 15 borrowings, I just picked up that you've secured a bank loan with Xstrata of around $2.7 billion, against which you've pledged securities to the value of around $5.5 billion. Can you just explore that nature of that agreement? I mean, it's obviously a long term borrowing, so there's not a certain duration to this. But is there any kind of pre-emptives for them to sell this, and can you quantify the portion of Xstrata shares that is pledged to secure this loan, and how exactly that will work? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, the $2.7 billion loan is long term in that it was a two-year duration. So, that was done and financing was put in place in June 2011, so that will run until June 2013. So, that maturity goes along, so it's not the long, long term, it's the sort of intermediate-type term. It is secured against some portion of Xstrata shares under a fairly normal industry standard loan to value ratio. So, there would be a &#x2013; it's not sort of everyday, but every now and again, once you're within certain thresholds, you're either releasing collateral or you're putting up more collateral.</p>
          <p>But of course, against our stake in Xstrata that &#x2013; I don't know what it's worth today, $18 billion, $19 billion, or whatever the case may be, to borrow $2.7 billion against that is obviously extremely comfortable there. The notes would have &#x2013; without being able, because it is a private agreement, but you can see the disclosure of what the value of that collateral was at 30 June, so you can work out roughly what the loan to value ratio is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, it's not a loan from Xstrata, it's a loan from banks secured against part of our Xstrata stake, it's a new facility. It's a rollover of an existing loan effectively. That's what the note is indicating.</p>

          <p>Grant Sporre from Deutsche Bank. Just on your target structure in terms of your FFO to net debt and gearing structures, where do you feel comfortable? Let's say, the volatility gave you an opportunity, how far would you like to push that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's obviously &#x2013; it is a good question. I mean, we now feel that we wouldn't &#x2013; we'd want to be at least &#x2013; we want to be at the rating levels where we're at now. So, don't &#x2013; I think we'd want to certainly protect against going down to a BBB minus or so. So, we want to be at the levels that we are in the mid, at least, the mid-BBB. I think given our &#x2013; where our ratios are, where our projections of that growth that we've got coming through, so our CapEx is sort of peaking, and then we start seeing the benefits of good cash flow generation of the oil portfolio, what we're doing in Central Africa, Prodeco. We're quite confident on some very good cash flow generation and some deleveraging that could otherwise occur in the normal course of the business. Where you are in sort of investment cycle, I think we're in a good place within our investment cycle at the moment.</p>
          <p>So, I think we have good headroom now. We've got some good visibility on cash flow generation going forward. If there is smaller acquisitions like the Minara, and these things, that just gets bolt on sort of stuff, if there's anything bigger, we would need to structure in such a way that we at least get those sort of ratings, which is going to be liquidity driven and it's going to be cash flow debt driven and it's going to be just absolute debt is obviously another thing that rating agencies tend to look at. So, these will be some of the drivers.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks. It's <mark type="ph" /> Campbell <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:21) at Deutsche Bank. Just a quick one on your expansion programs in the Industrial side. You're obviously quite positive on your timings, and the ability to deliver on these projects. Can you give us any sort of reassurance on ordering a long lead time items in terms of delivering those projects on time, on budget, in particular, just so that we can feel a bit more secure about them, particularly in the context of Katanga and else ware, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important one is for Telis to give you an update how it's looking on Katanga, and how you see the expansion taking place with the items you've ordered, and how you're bringing forward the projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You saw that Katanga made a press release just a couple of days ago where the company announced that we're bringing forward the project what &#x2013; which is called Phase 4, which is basically putting in place a new SXEW for 200,000 tonnes. That is the bit that we'll take the production capacity of copper and metal to 310,000 tonnes. Also, in that press release, it says that Glencore is also making some short-term advances and those short-term advances are in order to order the long lead items, which we are ordering right now. We have built in Mutanda. We're up in SXEW, which is right now, running at around 70,000 tonnes annualized per year and we'll be at 110,000 tonnes at &#x2013; by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So we have an understanding of which are the critical items to order. It's essentially the same team that is running that and I think they've build up some good knowledge of what the critical items are and we have ordered the critical items already.</p>
          <p>So, essentially, what we're doing is we're bringing forward the metallurgical part, the expansion of the SX, the Solvent Extraction Plant, and the Electrowinning Plant by approximately 12 months to 18 months. And this is because what we've seen is that &#x2013; on the mining site, we don't have a problem. I mean, if you see &#x2013; on Katanga people say, well, you guys are behind budget. Well, but if you see on copper and ore mines, I mean, we mined 104,000 tonnes of copper versus the budget of 90,000 tonnes in the first half of this year. So, we've realized that the bottleneck, if you will, is in the metallurgical plants, the old metallurgical plants that we inherited, which were the Japanese plants.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, we've been very conscious of that and we think that we have moved in time in order to meet that, to meet the timeline that we put down. I mean, it hasn't exactly been announced by Katanga, which is in the company, but I mean, it's going to speed it up and we're confident of meeting that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the important part about this projects, I think, Telis, you mention in line of capital expenditure we're going to spend at Mutanda and Katanga to reach these tight production levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And this is, I mean, it is something that we're going to feel quite proud of. If you look at the capital expenditure, the amount of money to bring up these assets, I mean, they're very low, compared to what other people have done. I mean, to &#x2013; greenfield, if you take Mutanda by itself to go to 110,000 tonnes of copper, we've spent $650 million.</p>
          <p>And to double that, we think we will need to spend another $400 million. So, I mean, you're doing 200,000 tonnes of copper for about $1 billion. I don't think anybody can beat that. I mean, I don't know what the &#x2013; the company hasn't really announced the Phase 4 in Katanga, but again, we will increase that 200,000 tonnes on a similar amount per ton of copper. So, if you look at what other projects are costing, I mean, we're way, way below in terms of capital expenditure.</p>

          <p>Henri Alexaline with BNP Paribas. Just a question on Pacorini and your warehousing business, just wanted to know how warehousing complements your marketing activities in general. And if you continue to grow in that business, how easy it is, and how it could affect your working capital, in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Best to answer that, Gary can talk on that using mainly a big amount of the aluminum side of the business and being the driver of the storage facilities</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The warehousing business in aluminum for example, but the increasing mills in zinc and other metals of course, is a very important part of what we do, right? The storage part is important part of our business, so I think for us we're very glad we made that acquisition. I mean, Pacorini runs independently in a way, but we know we have the facilities that we'll need to grow our business and are independent on other banks and other market participants who also went into that space and bought the warehouses, so we know we will always be able to have this space that we need.</p>
          <p>So that's one perspective. But then also the storage in aluminum today because the market is so big, and because there is so much stock and because aluminum becomes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:35) financial instrument where storage is an important angle to do business as we see at the moment. Pacorini of course, is also trying to acquire third-party business and provides a service to the market participants out of which we are one, probably their largest customer today, but that might change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if there's no more questions, I think we'll move on to &#x2013; I've got one more question here, and then we'll move on to <mark type="inaudible" /> (60:07)</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Myles Allsop, UBS. Just a quick question on M&amp;A given your current balance sheets, given the macro environment, given your CapEx plans, how much cash do you have available currently for further M&amp;A? And where do you see the best opportunities with commodities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the cap side of the business, as you know, we've got $10.5 billion of committed lines available, but naturally to maintain the ratings as Steve mentioned earlier, we're restricted and we would have to look at the balance sheet, and whatever we buying, what is the generation of earnings from the asset you buy, and how heavily we could gear up the balance sheet and to what level to maintain the ratings, which we wish to maintain. So, it does definitely gives us a lot of firepower even if we're just using cash and not using equity, gives us a lot of firepower to buy cash assets. And as I said earlier, we will look opportunistically there. There are assets around today. There are opportunities around. We talked to the numerous suppliers and we look at those opportunistically to see what's around, and what to buy and noting the amount of cash we have available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there certain areas where there are more interesting opportunities than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always taken the view. We noted again saying we love copper and Telis is bullish on copper or something like that, let's go and look for copper assets and buy copper assets. We run it across all the departments, always dealing with various suppliers. We may not be over-bullish on a particular commodity for which &#x2013; let's just use as an example, purchase nickel maybe I'm just using a example, I'm not saying. But suddenly an opportunity presents itself in nickel. Suddenly, another company wants to dispose of their nickel assets or another company wants to dispose of some of their assets or there's a producer in a private company who wants to &#x2013; may have a pre-financing facility with us, which we'll want to convert it into equity.</p>
          <p>So we're not a company that says we want to go in that direction and buy &#x2013; it's more opportunistic. Today, all the departments are well aware of the financial muscle, which we have. All the departments besides the day-to-day marketing, which they are doing, growing business on the marketing side of the business, they are trying to expand the production side of the business.</p>
          <p>Grain is doing a lot growth mainly on the &#x2013; on building their own silos and building their own crushing facilities around the world, and they're looking to grow in that division. But they're also looking at various acquisitions. So, let's see, which ones come. You will see announcements coming in the future. You will see us growing as a company. We've told you before, one of the reasons we did want to go public, we believe we've got a great set of managers who can grow this company on the industrial side. And if opportunities do present itself to us, and we didn't want to be restricted if, and when those opportunities present themselves. We didn't have the balance sheet to do it.</p>
          <p>Today we do have the balance sheet across the board yet these guys are looking at many, many assets around the world. And those will come into fruition and we will be buying assets going into the future.</p>
          <p>Where they are, I don't know, yet.</p>

We don't, as such, have exposure to sovereign debt, other than through, I guess, through the credit management side of what we do, if we're dealing with counterparts in countries. I'm not going to name those countries, but ones that are under more pressure than others. Of course, we're going to focus more on those, whether they're sovereign or whether they're corporate, or whether it's linked to a sovereign situation, it's just part and parcel of the credit management, which is the main feature of Glencore over many, many years.</p>
