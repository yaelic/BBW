        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the CIBC Analyst Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Ferren. Please go ahead, Mr. Ferren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome, everybody. It came to our attention, following our morning call that some analysts had, in fact, queued for questions and that a service provider error had occurred.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have reassembled our team here this afternoon for the Q&amp;A session based on the remarks we provided this morning on our Q4 and 2009 results. We do apologize for any inconvenience and confusion this may have caused.</p>
          <p>With that, let me remind you, once again, that any individuals speaking today on behalf of CIBC may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn this call over to the operator and ask you to be patient, while we wait for the queues to be registered.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question is from Robert Sedran at National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones, actually, and I guess they're both for Tom. Tom, you provided some of your initial expectations on 2010 this morning. And what I have written down here is, is wholesale better and personal better.</p>
          <p>Now, I couldn't tell if that was from the Q4 level or if that was full year over full year and so by implication whether you're suggesting that provisions could be flat to down in 2010 versus 2009. Can you help me clarify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Rob. And let me just be very clear to everyone. Typically, we and other banks do not give guidance on loan losses. We recognize there is a lot of tension and curiosity in this regard. And we &#x2013; as every bank has done a fair bit of bottom-up analysis here. So in an attempt to be helpful, but with the caveat the things can change, particularly in the economy, we did give some guidance. So on your question on wholesale and personal, that's an '010 estimate versus full year '09. My comments on cards was that it would be relatively stable year-on-year. But relative to the Q3, Q4 run rates which were much higher in '09 than Q1, Q2, we feel better and that's premised on the delinquency data we're seeing in our &#x2013; feeling for that overall business in terms of bankruptcies and flow. So cards stable year-on-year, personal and corporate feels better year-on-year, but cards a little better than we saw in Q3, Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if &#x2013; thanks, Tom. If I can just follow-up on the credit card losses. We've been told repeatedly that unemployment was the key indicator here on the way up. So for the provisioning level to decline, do we need job creation or is a stable unemployment level good enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I can give a really scientific explanation there. Certainly, the correlations in the past have been very much to the unemployment level itself. Now obviously for unemployment to go down, you're going to need some job creation. But I don't know whether Sonia wants to get into this topic. But I think anything I could say would really not be scientifically based. So it's a correlation with unemployment is the basic metric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sonia here. I'll said just add a couple of comments to that. I think there are two key components. And it absolutely is correlated closely with unemployment, but there are two distinct factors, one, is bankruptcies and one is delinquencies. I think what I would say is that we still see a fair bit of volatility although stabilized somewhat on bankruptcy and so that is still a very uncertain factor moving forward.</p>
          <p>The second component; delinquency, I would say that we have seen a leveling off and that has been fairly consistent, gradual improvement over a number of months. So that's where I think it's a little more predictable in terms of what we can anticipate moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from John Reucassel at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to clarify the outlook on the earnings, you said five to 10% earnings growth. I'm not sure if it's for Gerry or David, but when we look at that, what is the base of earnings we should be looking at? Is it kind of your cash EPS for 2009 adding back the one- thing which I think is about $5.88, is that kind of base we should look at for the medium term to judge whether you're getting the five to 10% EPS growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Gerry here. Since well going back to at least 2005 we have had a target in place, and we actually over time on a cumulative basis believe that we can achieve the target going back to the base line that we had then, adding on what our targets were in those years, which at the time I think was a higher target, and then taking us to the five to 10% now.</p>
          <p>So what I think you should be looking at is the most recent and I don't have it handy with me here, the most recent numbers when we did shift down to 5%. I think were at the end of '07. And so we would be looking to get eventually back on track to that five to 10% from what our analyst view items were the analyst view earnings in 2007. Obviously, that's not going to happen overnight but it is intended to be a through the cycle number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Gerry, I think I'm looking at that number. It's about $9.20. You'd still stick with that over a cycle at the end of '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would first of all, say that this is &#x2013; is not intended to constitute a forecast. So &#x2013; because we don't give a forecast but what we do give is our objectives in terms of long-term earnings growth and I do believe that the analyst view item that the analyst view that we have for 2007 is somewhere in the 8.88 level. I would then dilute for the equity issue and that would take you down. I think by 13 or 14% and that would be the number that I would be looking at as our steady state existing business number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the payout ratio, should we be looking at as a percentage of as you call it, the analyst view number or should that be on GAAP, the payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, whenever it comes to GAAP, I always like to let our Chief Financial Officer handle it.  I will turn it over to him but when we set our earnings, excuse me, when we set our dividend payout ratio which is 40 to 50%, we do have -- we do try to set it on what we believe is the sustainable earnings. So that would tend to be moreso the analyst view, but I'll turn it over to David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Gerry. You question John was just whether you use the base of analysts view earnings, when you're looking at the five to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the 40 to 50% payout ratio on the dividend. Should we look at that on analysts view earnings or is that GAAP earnings that we do that on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You would be looking as Gerry said really on the sustainable earnings base which is usually adjusted for the items of note. You'd be looking to the analyst view earnings as a base of knowledge to jump from. Obviously that range is a through the cycle range it's like the five to 10%. So it's not a -- in the moment kind of range.</p>
          <p>Another thing to keep in mind too, when you are looking at the dividend payout levels are that currently with our dividend reinvestment program and it's running with at &#x2013; about 20% flow back through the DRIP program. So the upshot is -- at 20% of our dividend payments are equity-based as a source.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Cheryl Pate at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions on the wholesale business on the trading book. I wonder if you can give me some sort of sense on the trading trajectory through the quarter and particularly in the fixed income business. Was it relatively evenly spread throughout the quarter or did we see significantly lower volumes in October. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard. Now through the quarter, I'd say our fixed income business was very steady throughout the quarter. I think also of course we saw I think more towards the back half of the quarter, a significant acceleration in the new issues we've seen corporates and provincial borrowers coming into the market. My impression &#x2013; my feeling is that was accelerated during the back half of the quarter. But otherwise I think it was pretty constant throughout the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And then my second question would just be on your acquisition appetite and if there were particular business segments or geographic areas that are more compelling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is on the acquisition appetite and if there is any particular geographies or business lines that are more interesting than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe our primary opportunity at this time is in Canada and that's our core strategy because there are areas where we believe that we have very, very strong businesses that are going to get stronger as the cycle recovers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we also believe that there are some of our businesses where we are below where we think we should be positioned in the marketplace and we think all our business should be minimum top three, targeting one or two. And we have several large businesses that in recent years have fallen below number three.</p>
          <p>And when we do the math in terms of our business planning and look at maintaining our strong positions where we have strength and bringing the businesses that were under strength back up to at least a third position. We can achieve those growth targets that we talked about two questions ago, driven off of our Canadian business, so that's our first objective.</p>
          <p>Having said that, banking is a competitive business and we think that from a view point of the potential for a competition strengthening during the cycle plus for purposes of diversification of our earnings base and of our risk base, we do need to look outside of Canada.</p>
          <p>We have been doing so for the last well, since I have been the CEO and the transactions that we have found that we liked were in our core areas and that was primarily the FirstCaribbean transaction.</p>
          <p>The reason I wanted to talk about FirstCaribbean for a second, was because of the way the transaction occurred which is critical to understanding our thought process around any acquisitions outside of Canada.</p>
          <p>FirstCaribbean is an area we were familiar with; we had our West Indies business. We believe that it was below the scale that we needed to be strong in that area. Barclays was in a similar situation, we put the two businesses together, that took five years and we operated them as 44% owners each in a public company. And then eventually through discussions with ourselves and Barclays, we became the 93 some odd percent strategic owner.</p>
          <p>We like that very much because we already understood the area then we had an opportunity to become more familiar with the asset and then when the time came to purchase their share we weren't subject to an auction process in the market, so we got a fair price. They also did not have to sell to us so that further enhanced the fact that it was a fair price rather than a frothy price.</p>
          <p>So when I talk about that in terms of FirstCaribbean that really is a microcosm of how we look at other acquisitions outside of Canada. We would like first and foremost to gain familiarity with the area. We would like access to new pools of management talent. We would like access to opportunities to invest where the cycle is different than Canada's. And where there is potentially a different demographic than Canada's. Having said all that even if we found those conditions, which we have not yet, we would seek to enter any new opportunities on a partnership basis such as we did in FirstCaribbean, so that we would have an opportunity to familiarize our self with the situation and gradually increase ownership.</p>
          <p>So on that basis if you think about investing in that fashion the major geographies in the world are available to us. The one that's a bit crowded we think still is the U.S. and I don't want to get into that in detail here. But it's somewhere that we're always interested in looking at. We've looked at it the most of any jurisdiction and we're still not there in terms of having found the right type of opportunity. We are looking elsewhere.</p>
          <p>To date, we have not found acquisitions that hit the criteria that I just laid out for you. But we continue to look and I would say that that's important in terms of prudently managing the bank's future risk profile, out over the next two to three years out. Does that answer the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no.   Thank you. That's very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca at Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a very quick question. Could you help me think through what's going on in the NII line, the net interest income line in retail specifically over the last couple of quarters. Fairly strong growth there. Is there anything you can offer us in terms of treasury allocations. Is that what's driving the better NII and the margin in retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll speak to the treasury side and then from a business side Sonia can jump in and add additional comments. So treasury if I look quarter-over-quarter I'll start with I guess, Mario. So quarter-over-quarter treasury has not helped retail. I spoke in my prepared remarks earlier today that treasury quarter-over-quarter is &#x2013; revenues are better in treasury. That's true. It happened though in securitization and securitization as you know and we've discussed before stays in the center. So the good news in treasury this quarter stayed in corporate and other.</p>
          <p>The offset to the securitization success for want of a better word, that was partially offset in the quarter by our positioning revenue being lowered and that does affect retail. So that had a slight adverse effect on retail.</p>
          <p>So obviously, retail fighting a bit of a headwind there from treasury, so it was really the efforts on the business front that acted to offset that. Obviously, NIM for treasury as would have seen in my slides this morning just up a point, quarter-over-quarter little bit of a treasury headwind. So I think the upside is really product pricing and other factors. Maybe I should hand over to Sonia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that there had been two factors that have contributed to the improvement. It's a combination of both increased volume across all of our deposit and lending businesses and also the positives in terms of spreads on our lending portfolio which have been somewhat offset by spread compression in deposits. But it's those combination of factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can offer anything on a go forward basis on where you think spreads go in retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think they are likely to stay in the same range. We're forecasting at least the first half of 2010 being fairly similar to what you've seen in the back half of '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick question to start with, how much in risk-weighted assets do you have backing the run-off structured finance book? And then secondly for Richard Nesbit, you've been in your role for over year now, and the world has changed and when you joined the place you talked about 300 to 500 million of through the cycle earnings for capital markets. Has your view changed in any way since the last year has gone by?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andr&#xE9;, it's Richard. I'll take that first. The 300 to 500 was an objective. It really &#x2013; coming out of the difficult section of '08, really try to tell people where we were headed over a full business cycle. Clearly, 2009 was a better part of the business cycle for investment banking and we over-achieved that at about 640 million for 2009, so that's feeling pretty good about that.</p>
          <p>I think the question is where do we see growth? And we see growth in two areas particularly and we've talked about these in the past. Corporate lending, we are bank that has a good track record in lending, and we want to lend more to our large corporate clients, and so we've created a separate corporate lending group, brought in Laura Dottori to run that and she is busily getting out there, meeting a lot more clients. We're lending today even since we started that which was in January, we're lending today to a lot more clients than we used to in the past. And so we're very optimistic that that will grow our business. We've seen the fruits of that already and it's going to continue to.</p>
          <p>I think securitization is another area that we've started to re-grow the business again after having reduced a lot of the legacy assets that were very low margin. We're starting to add assets that are at much better margins and that providing I think a valuable alternative financing client for our clients.</p>
          <p>So as we add resources, I think my view does start to change. And I guess, we have &#x2013; we have downplayed, removed from the &#x2013; from some of our discussions the 300 to 500 because as we add resources I do think my view changes and I do think that the potential for our franchise can be greater than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, presumably you'd expect some of the trading spreads to decline, but what you're telling us is there are offsets from other areas that are growing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To some degree, I would &#x2013; I think we have actually operated the business over the past year at very, very low VAR levels, very low funding levels, very low aggregate levels. So we haven't actually seen within the, our wholesale banking results a lot of the benefits of, you know the carry trade or of the &#x2013; of a variety of strategies of just riding the curve that you might see if we had had large aggregates and larger risk on.</p>
          <p>So I actually &#x2013; I am not expecting declining trading alongside these other opportunities. So I guess, I'm a little more optimistic than your comment would indicate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for being candid. And on the question on risk weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First question is on expenses, Gerry touched on &#x2013; since he's been CEO some of the things he's worked on. Obviously the expense mandate has been a big one. And if I look at the efficiency of the bank on this operating basis relative to the peer group, it looks like you're in that range of at least being at the midpoint so couple of questions on expenses. Two parter, number one, do you think the bank will generate positive operating leverage in 2010 given the costs that have already come out of the system?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I look at your comp ratio on the same operating basis across the bank, I see the comp ratio at 31.4%, down more than 200 basis points. Is this a sustainable number or is this something that maybe with the write down still being a factor has been lower and will normalize to levels we saw previously.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, the &#x2013; so as you mentioned, we have had a strategic objective since 2005 to move to the median of the banks in terms of our mix ratio and don't know about this quarter, because we don't have everybody else's results, but for the first three quarters of this year, we had achieved that median level and right now our expenses are as a result of all the actions that we have taken including divestures, they're actually lower than they were in 1997.</p>
          <p>So our current objective has been to hold our relative expense level to the same level as Q4 of '06, hold that flat while in the ideal world we grow our revenues and therefore we are generating incremental profitability and improvements in our mix ratio. But on an absolute basis, we have also through trimming the businesses and divesting businesses that were not strategically targeted as to where we want to go with the bank and that were not profitable, we've also managed to keep the absolute level as I say now down to a ten year low.</p>
          <p>And so I would say that when I get to the comp ratio there are a lot of cross currents in the comp ratio when you look at it on a strategic basis. Our comp ratio historically was elevated above what I believe it should have been because of the variety of businesses that were not strategically well-positioned and did not have the right mix in terms of sustainability and operating leverage.</p>
          <p>So our comp ratio is affected by the improvements relatively in the business as to the structure and the platform. We've exited and we continued between '08 and '09 to exit a variety of areas that would have elevated our comp ratio.</p>
          <p>So my answer would be that I believe that our comp ratio today is sustainable. I think the probability is that if you were to ask me is it going to decline or rise? I believe that it will probably rise but that will be because of the success of the business and building on the efforts of the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>So the comp ratio rising should not be something that is a net drag in terms of profitability at least that's the way I would see it now. We need to be competitive, we need to make sure that we are attracting and retaining the best people and as the bank returns to a pattern of success, I would expect that we would probably be seeing that rise but in a profitable circumstance. Does that answer all your questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. Thanks Gerry and if I can sneak in one more for Sonia. A year ago at this time you were pretty quick and pretty upfront about the fact that the slowing housing market would likely result in weaker residential real estate loan growth, if you look right now at retail markets mortgages, personal loans, cards, commercial, how are you feeling about your loan growth in 2010, and I'll leave it there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think that I think mortgage market outperformed pretty much where anybody assumed that it would be in 2009. And assuming that the interest rate remains where it -- in this same kind of a range and the economy, economic environment doesn't materially change. I would suggest that the mortgage market will continue at these kinds of levels and I would say that across the board we are looking at reasonably strong lending environment in sort of mid single digit range across the board. In our case I would say lower than that in cards because although we do want to increase our growth a little bit in cards, we do not plan to do that on an aggressive basis. So we'll likely still be a little below market in that space.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jim Bantis at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Tom, just following back on your comments with respect to the credit card portfolio, just wanted to get a sense if there is any seasonality that we could be surprised by as we go in through the holiday season and look at Q1 results on adverse impairments or delinquencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jim Q2 is typically higher loan losses. And if you go back in time you can see that. And there is no reason to think at least from my point of view whether that's necessarily going to be any different this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Thank you. The other question I had was with respect to capital. The bank's Tier 1 ratio was quite strong at 12%. If you look at the bank's Tier 1 common ratio, clearly, the bank's relied heavily on innovative capital and preferred shares. With regulators and market conditions forcing banks to increase the level of core common, how do you see CIBC transitioning to a higher common ratio going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our picture in terms of our total common equity is reasonably unique amongst the Canadian banks. In that there is a portion of our preferred shares and we believe it's the largest portion by far compared to any of our peers that we have our option to convert to common shares. Now, I'm not telling you that that is our intent here. But I'm saying that we have always had that as a contingency if the issue around total common equity became something that was critical we can get one full percentage point increase in our total common equity ratio by converting some of our preferreds. And that puts us versus the Canadian industry in an extremely good position if you were to add one point and have us at the equivalent of 8.6 with that conversion.</p>
          <p>So that's the first part which is that we've always been very well-positioned from a total common equity ratio because of the fact that we have this unique feature of high optionality around conversion of preferreds. That having been said, we believe that through growth in our retained earnings and earnings in the next periods of time, that we will have a very, very strong total common equity ratio.</p>
          <p>Our total common equity today compared to almost any group of banks around the world is extremely high and we believe that it is probably higher than by a fair bit any international standards that may be emerging in the next period of time.</p>
          <p>So we think we're very well-positioned here. It is a focus for CIBC to increase the ratio of our total common equity to Tier 1 over time and that is something that I think is not going to be unique in terms of banks around the world. It's just we would like to stay at the very top of the banks in terms of balance sheet strength. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does Gerry. You had made a point saying that the CIBC's current Tier 1 common ratio, I think it's roughly about 7.5, 7.6% is going to be well above international standards in terms of where they get to. So do you see international standards with regards to that ratio being sub-7%? Is that what your, let's say discussions with regulators and feedback that you've heard after G20 meetings kind of leads you to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was not intending in this forum to report on any discussions with regulators. What I was more going to report on is and I have had discussions. But if you look at the broad based media on the G20 discussions and then you overlay those discussions with the reality of the banks around the world, and then you take the tone of the requirements to keep the banking system lending around the world, the reality is, is that I think that the world getting to Canadian standards of total common equity, would be a multi-year task.</p>
          <p>And it's not based on anybody telling me what the world standards are going to be, it's based upon some assumptions on my part around where most jurisdiction's total common equity ratios are and what it would take them to get the Canadian levels and presuming that the appetite for that would probably not be the dominant appetite in the other G19.</p>
          <p>So that's it's basically a matter of the math involved and timeframe. You can get to any total common equity ratio you want given enough time, but in the foreseeable future I think the Canadian standard is probably a bit high for the other G19.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can Darko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you for that. The question though still remains in my mind with respect to capital. And one of the things, I mean, I'm just wondering when we look at your medium term performance targets, and you suggest a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5 and at a total of 11.5. Should we really focus on this number, I mean, in today's environment those numbers look exceedingly low, especially relative to a Tier 1 ratio of 12, and a total 16. Is it just something &#x2013; is it a throw away comment or should we actually think that you over the course of the next three to five years will bring your ratio down to 8.5. And if so how would you get there, would it be, I mean, it looks like you'd have to grow risk weighted assets by a ton. Or some other combo of getting yourself down to 8.5 Tier 1 ratio. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have left our historic target in place, this is the same target we've had for five years and we did consider shifting at, but we thought it in the absence of the information on a really directive basis that I just discussed in the last question, that it would be indicating more than was intended. If we had shifted it to another number, we would have been picking a number rather than doing it based upon the critical information that's going to be forthcoming as a result of the G20 discussions cascading through the various countries regulatory processes. And so we stayed with &#x2013; for the first half of your question, we stayed with our historic metrics and we will be updating them when we receive more direction from the international community on what they are targeting, as well in consultation with our regulators.</p>
          <p>And our understanding is as another bank CEO has mentioned, that early in the New Year there will be more information forthcoming on that. I suspect that probably what will first be floated will be position papers and papers for discussion, but there is a possibility that those discussion papers by the time we come to next year at this time would permit us to update our scorecard and have something that more timely than the 8.5%.</p>
          <p>So, Darko, your first part of your question, which was, are you going to manage to getting yourself down to 8.5 over the next three to five years is my answer would be probably not, and if that's the world that we happened to be in it would be a surprisingly good world compared to where it is today.</p>
          <p>But your question about excess capital, I think still &#x2013; is still there, because while you are pointing out correctly that 8.5% maybe a better than anachronism. I think under most of the assumptions that are out there today that 12.1 would leave us with a fair bit of excess capital, if we were at 12.1 by the time the entire cycle had played it out.</p>
          <p>Since we don't know the new regulatory levels that would allow us a comfort zone. It is hard to speak in terms of any thing definitive, but we do believe that there will be a fairly large amount of &#x2013; with everything we know today as I say things can change, it's been a very interesting cycle with lots of abrupt changes. But we could have a pro forma a bit of excess capital here as could the entire Canadian Banking system. And we're at the front end of that.</p>
          <p>My belief is and maybe this is a little bit optimistic, but my belief is that as the recovery gathers momentum that one of the very positive elements that will assist Canada in terms of its recovery is that the Canadian Banks do have by and large fairly large excess capital positions and that I think that they will deploy that in the domestic environment as is required to support lending in the expansion of the economy. So I think that what appears to be a large excess capital position today for us versus the assumptions you might make pro forma of future regulatory requirements may not be as excess as it looks for positive reasons. Meaning that we're not in an expansionary environment and when we get there I do think there will be ample opportunity to take on new Canadian assets and for the bank to grow as well as the Canadian economy goes. So that is the critical assumption is the strength of the expansion.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I want to get back to your comment about the payout ratio through the cycle and based on your 40 to 50% payout objective through the cycle would it be reasonable for us to conclude that you don't increase your dividend until your reported earnings are greater than $7 or until you have adequate confidence that you can actually achieve something in excess of $7 through the cycle earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think the sustainable earnings are the &#x2013; you're saying &#x2013; I think what you're saying is if you just tick the number, are you happy to say you're at 50% or are you looking at a number that is sustainable. The answer is it's the sustainable number that matters. Because once you raise the dividend it's done, and you support it for all years to come.</p>
          <p>So, does that answer you question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well not completely, what I'm getting at is I guess you could reach the $7 level, but not be confident that it's sustainable. So which is more important, do you have to reach it and be confident that it's sustainable or do you just have to be confident that that is any achievable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that and again this is not a &#x2013; I have to remember what I said later. But I believe that you have to reach it and it has to be sustainable. And that's how we've operated generally in the past. And what we learned from the past is that when you think through sustainable on your dividend you need to think further out in the cycle. So I can tell you that if we reach $7 <mark type="audio gap" /> and we're not in the expansion &#x2013; in the peaking part of the credit cycle then we would look on that quite differently than if we hit $7 at the peak of the cycle,  when credit losses are likely to go up in the future. So not only would I say to you that we have to hit seven and it has to be sustainable. I would put in the criteria of sustainable that we need to consider the credit cycle and if you are at the peak and you're going to find that you're back to six a year later because of the fact that credit losses are going up with unemployment rates and the all of the stuff you've heard about for the last two years, then we would not be inclined to raise the dividend.</p>
