          <p>Welcome to our Enel Conference Call on First Quarter 2008 Results. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Now let's hand over to Mr. Luigi Ferraris, Chief Financial Officer.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our presentation on the first quarter 2008 results. First, I will take you through our financial results. Then, our CEO, Mr. Fulvio Conti, will join us for the Q&amp;A session. The annexes will provide you with additional details from each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>First, some financial highlights. As you can see in Chart #2 of your package, group EBITDA increases by almost 50%, driven by the consolidation of Endesa, the solid performance of the domestic operation and the increasing contribution of the other international activity, mainly the Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne.</p>
          <p>Group net debt increase reflects the completion of the acquisition of the OGK-5, while it does not include the expected cushion from the asset sales to E.On. Later on, I will be better detailed on this.</p>
          <p>Now, on Chart #3, our overall financial results, starting from EBIT down to net income. EBIT increases by 36.7%, thanks to EBITDA improvements, which has been partially offset by the effect of the lower fair value of Viesgo for &#x20AC;168 million, set up during the negotiation process with E.On.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges amount to &#x20AC;748 million. This is the net affect of the following. First, higher interest charges for almost &#x20AC;630 million, mainly due to the increase in the net debt position following the acquisition of Endesa and the last tranche of the acquisition of 59.8% stake in OGK-5. Our cost of debt is equal to an average of 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Second, higher income resulted from the fair value valuation of Acciona put option, which decreased also because of the higher value of Endesa Europe assets set up during the negotiation process with E.On.</p>
          <p>Tax rate decreases from 37.7% to 31.3%, mainly thanks to the impacts of the new tax rates in Italy. Group net income grew by 6.5% to about &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, on Chart #4, our EBITDA evolution. This chart shows an increasing EBITDA in all of our divisions, with the exception of Domestic Generation and Energy Management, which decreases by &#x20AC;274 million versus last year.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on this division first, moving to Chart #5. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;707 million, representing a decrease of &#x20AC;274 million versus 2007. The unit margin in the domestic thermal generation is slightly increasing from &#x20AC;25.9 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;26.1 per megawatt hour. Our average fuel cost per megawatt hour has increased by &#x20AC;10.4, while our average unit revenues net of auxiliary services have increased from &#x20AC;70 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;80.6 per megawatt hour. In the annexes, you will find also some details regarding our fuel cost evolution in the period.</p>
          <p>This confirms the robustness of the domestic market fundamentals and Enel's capability of securing margins, also thanks to the forward-selling activities. <mark type="inaudible" />, the increase in the generation margins equaled &#x20AC;64 million, thanks to the following: plus &#x20AC;84 million, due to the contribution of higher unit margins driven by the positive effects of price and volumes, and minus &#x20AC;20 million, due to lower margin in the auxiliary services markets.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, we record minus &#x20AC;61 million of energy trading activities, due to lower volumes coupled with lower prices, and minus &#x20AC;253 million of the fair value of both bilateral contracts with a single buyer and commodities. Such effect is expected to be more than substantially absorbed during the year.</p>
          <p>In the light of the good margins already shown you for the first quarter and maintained also in April, we expect that, at the end of the year, Domestic Generation and Energy Management EBITDA, net of the fair value impact, will be about &#x20AC;3.4 billion, in line with last year figures, always net of the fair value impact. All this has been positively supported by the Italian market fundamentals represented on Chart #6.</p>
          <p>As far as electricity demand is concerned, the first quarter 2008 shows an increase of 0.9% versus last year. Total demand has been covered for a portion of 88% by domestic production and for 12% by imports. In particular, let me underline the decrease in imports, basically due to higher base low price in France, which more than doubled versus last year. As far as Enel is concerned, the electricity production shows an increase of 3.1% from 22.3 kilowatt hours to 23.</p>
          <p>And now, let's move to electricity sales on Chart #7. As you can see from the slide, our strong growth in the free market has more than balanced the expected decrease in the regulated markets. In particular, Enel stock of sales to the free markets have increased by 48.2%, or by 4 kilowatt hours, as respect to last year. Also, customers on the free markets moved from 458,000 to 1.6 million with a back level 2.1 million customers at the end of March. This strengthens our strategy of selling forwards -- aiming at protecting our Domestic Generation margin.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the market division EBITDA evolutionalities on Chart #8. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;189 million versus &#x20AC;69 million of 2007. This is the cumulative effects of the following. First, the increase of &#x20AC;20 million in the electricity regulating markets. Second, the increase of &#x20AC;100 million in the contribution of the free markets, mainly thanks to the following. Higher electricity margin for &#x20AC;115 million, basically due to how our volumes sold and the positive contribution of the forward-selling strategy and lower gas margins for minus &#x20AC;12 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Chart #9 on Domestic Infrastructure &amp; Network division, EBITDA totals &#x20AC;967 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;62 million versus the first quarter 2007. This is the net effect to the following. First, the improvement of &#x20AC;75 million in the electricity business, mainly thanks to higher energy margin for &#x20AC;52 million and &#x20AC;15 million for higher tariffs. Cost saving for &#x20AC;23 million mainly related to the personnel. Second, the decrease of &#x20AC;13 million in the gas business despite the increase in volumes more than offset by the non-recurring items posted in the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Chart #10 on Iberia and Latin American divisions, the EBITDA totals &#x20AC;1,217 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;1,130 million versus the first quarter of 2007, mainly thanks to the consolidation of Endesa for &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Endesa EBITDA includes an accrual of &#x20AC;160 million, which was conservatively recorded to take into account the effects of 2007 Royal Decree on CO2 allocation.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Chart #11 on the International division, EBITDA totals &#x20AC;289 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;57 million versus 2007. This is the cumulative effects of the following: in the Centrel region, a strong contribution of Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne for &#x20AC;26 million. In particular, first quarter 2007 EBITDA of the Centrel region equal to &#x20AC;217 million was boosted by higher domestic energy prices, higher volumes sold and cost reduction. These positive results will continue all throughout 2008, since 75% of Slovenske Elektrarne output has been already sold forwards. In France, the positive impact of &#x20AC;31 million, due to higher volumes and higher price.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Chart #12, a quick look at EBITDA of the Services &amp; Holding area, which stands at &#x20AC;72 million, with an increase of &#x20AC;16 million versus the first quarter 2007. This is mainly due to the following. On the side higher margin of imports for &#x20AC;13 million and some other minor items for &#x20AC;3 million.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, on Chart #13, you see that the overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;58.8 billion, including the net debt related to Endesa Europe and Viesgo for almost &#x20AC;1.8 billion. This high level of debt is mainly due to the following. First, the impact of extraordinary activities and, in particular, the acquisition of the 23% stake of OGK-5, which accounts for almost &#x20AC;1 billion. And second, temporary higher working capital for a delayed collection of the following receivables. &#x20AC;1.4 billion of equalization fund receivable in Italy and &#x20AC;1.2 billion of regulatory receivable for the Spanish extrapeninsular activities.</p>
          <p>The cash-in of most of the above-mentioned receivables, expected during the year, coupled with the completion of the asset sale to E.On, will bring our consolidated net debt by year-end well below &#x20AC;50 billion, also considering the disposal of the non-strategic networks, which, as indicated, in London will be finalized by year-end.</p>
          <p>And now, on Chart #14, let me focus your attention on renewables. Installed capacity, as of March 31st, 2008, is 3.2 gigawatt versus 2.8 gigawatt last year. And the production is equal to 3.5 gigawatt hours versus 3 last year. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;218 million versus &#x20AC;214 million, with an increase of almost 2%. First quarter 2008 EBITDA includes some negative non-recurring items related to 2007 regulatory adjustments. Net of this item, first quarter 2008 EBITDA stands at &#x20AC;252 million, with a growth of 18% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Chart #15, a quick look at the evolution of the Russian market. First, let me remind you that while the acquisition of OGK-5 has negatively affected the net debt figure at the end of March, its EBITDA has not been included in our results. In the first quarter 2008, OGK-5 reported an EBITDA of &#x20AC;48 million that represents a 40% increase on a like-for-like basis versus last year.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the chart, the electricity price net of capacity payment is up by almost 21% versus last year. This confirms that the liberalization process of the Russian markets and the alignment of these prices to the European average is going on according to the government's agenda.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and now, opening the Q&amp;A session, I welcome our CEO, Mr. Fulvio Conti.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we are starting <mark type="inaudible" /> Q&amp;A session.  So if the first question is here, we are ready to get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first participant speaking is Chris Moore, ABN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. I have three questions. The first one is can you just talk about some of the key factors which are you going to drive your timing about the renewables IPO? I think you said by the end of next year. Maybe you can talk about what factors are driving that timing?</p>
          <p>Further questions, please. The first is on your supply business, I see quite a healthy increase in margins, and yet, the pool price was up year-on-year. Perhaps you could just give us some guidance as where you see supply margins going this year, since this is something which is quite hard for us to forecast? And then there is the last question, and this is, again, on the numbers.</p>
          <p>On the Services &amp; Holding business, I see it last year that there was a negative EBITDA, I think with the parent company, and yet you're posting quite a healthy number for quarter one. Again, can you give us some guidance as to what sort of contribution you're looking for from Services &amp; Holding this year, and what's driving that swing versus negative quarter for last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, on the first question, I'll take the answer, and I'll ask Luigi to go over the last two. Commingled renewables is, as expected, dependent on two things. One, it is the in-house reshuffling of the organization. As you know, today's renewables are commingled with at least three different divisions, meaning generation in Italy and the two international divisions. We need to complete our current work of bundling them up, which is obviously quite complex, because you have umpteen numbers of individual companies in many different countries, which we are working.</p>
          <p>We think we can achieve this in the fall, and that very moment we will start looking at the opportunities to either offer on the market or finding a co-investor for this minority stake that we would like to place, in order to fund additional moves that we are looking for this division, this company, in the other years of the plan and beyond the 2012 targets.</p>
          <p>And you might remember that we have set ambitious, yet achievable, program of CapEx for organic and development business opportunities in all the areas where we're present. We are aiming to get from the current 3,100 megawatt capacity to more than 7,000 megawatt capacity. We have a pipeline of projects that we have already identified, and earmarking a total of about &#x20AC;7 billion worth of CapEx to this in effect.</p>
          <p>And we think there is room for offering, during 2009, the market the opportunity to look at the gross value in program that we are enhancing so that we can &#x2013; we arranged in the bundling up of our company. So there is no change in our program. I think this is something that will be possibly achievable, if market conditions are available, of course, towards the end of this year and the early parts of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris, comes to your second question, that was what we should expect in terms of profitability in the domestic market division. First, let me tell you that the first quarter shows very positive results, because we benefited of some regulatory decision, which basically allows us to keep for three, four months some big customer, that we call in Italy sort of protected customer, big customer, that should be lost through an auction, which should take place starting the beginning of May.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I will suggest that something like &#x20AC;30 million of margin that we have on this customer in the first quarter should not be repeated in the following months. Having said that, the remaining profitability, mainly of the free market, will continue, thanks to our forward-selling policy that we have put in place in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Coming to the Service &amp; Holding activity, let me just remind you that last year we still had a contract with EDF, an import contract, which, in particular &#x2013; only last year &#x2013; reported a very poor margin, because of the very low price in France. You must recall that last year, the electricity price in France had been in the region of &#x20AC;30 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>And we had to sell that energy both from Endesa to the French market, while in the past we could sell that energy in Italy. That was a decision taken by the French regulator, and therefore the 2007 was not very positive for us. Clearly, in the first quarter of 2007, we reported a negative contribution of this contract. When you compare 2008 versus 2007, you do not have any more of this negative contribution.</p>
          <p>While, on the other hand, you have a positive contribution of our contract with Atel, which is the last contract we have with this company in Switzerland, and we are benefiting in terms of profitability of this contract. And then, finally, in the EBITDA level in the Services &amp; Holding, we basically have all the other company saving the group. Therefore, we are talking about the <mark type="inaudible" /> services company, and the EBITDA you see over here is basically an inter-company profit and nothing more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next participant is Porcari Nicola (sic) [Nicola Porcari] from Exane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and three questions for me. Two on Slide 5 that is related to Domestic Generation. If you can you give us a bit more color about the comments you made about the fair value of bilateral contracts. You have said that you expect more than substantial absorbed during the year. So if we could hear about the 250 million that you reported in the decrease in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Second item, if you can give us an update on your coal repowering strategy in the domestic market. And third, we have seen some comment recently regarding appointment of management in Endesa which were driven by <mark type="inaudible" />? If you can provide some comment on that please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the last two questions, and I'll ask Luigi to deal on the first. With the coal repower strategy, we continue to work on the condition of the <mark type="inaudible" /> in our plants. We do expect the first group, Group #4, will be fired with gas to test the total equipment, by the end of June and, therefore, that group will be thoroughly receiving first coal by the month of October and then in November it will be fired fully.</p>
          <p>The second and third group will follow with six months installments. So, at the end of the year, the Group #3 will be gas-fired and then will be available few months later for full production towards the end of the second quarter of 2009, and the third will be in the second half of next year. We are confident to go back to a permitting process for the <mark type="inaudible" /> project.</p>
          <p>We feel comfortable with the idea that this new government might be more in favor of infrastructural investments, which are requested by the country to bridge the gap of energy mix and infrastructure investments to diversify their sourcing. And, therefore, I definitely look with optimism on the future outlook of our coal strategy and our overall investment compiled in the Italian markets.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Endesa, I have very little to comment. There has been a request for change in the organization, with the addition of new people, we have been outcomes testing, and we have the potential reorganization, which are driven by the need to have better referral of our information and managerial skills. The good thing is that strategy and developments of Endesa's are carried out without any major difficulties. We are happy with the performance of the company, and we will continue to benefit from that. I'll only ask the people to abstain from inviting changes that were not preliminarily discussed at length and that were not open to the outside market opportunities for <mark type="inaudible" />. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to cancel your third question, there are &#x20AC;253 million of EBITDA reduction reported in the Chart #5 that basically regards two effects. The first effect regards basically the valuation of the contract with a single buyer. You might recall that last year we reported the positive contribution of the fair value discounted with the single buyer for more than &#x20AC;100 million, yet this year has not been reported since this contract has been closed last year at the end of 2007. So that's the reason why we expect that at the end of this year there will not be any effects linked to this fair value evaluation.</p>
          <p>The second item regards the fair value evaluation of our contract on the commodity side. In particular, we are talking about the contracts still open which refers to energy sold and fuel boats in the following months of the following quarters. According to the conditional accounting standard, we have to value at the market value these contracts, which means that there is not a cash item but is a pure accounting item. And once this contract will be closed, which means once the transaction of the energy will be delivered, at that very moment, those contracts will become effective and the valuation will be go back to zero in terms of revenue.</p>
          <p>So that's the reason why we expected that this contract, which will be closed during the year, will be closed and this negative effect will be disappear. Clearly, at the end of the year, we still have to value the other contracts regarding the future sales or purchasing of fuel. And every moment we have to see what would be the commodity scenario and the forward curve, in order to see what would be the final result.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. This is <mark type="inaudible" />. I have a couple of questions. First, in relation to the renewable IPO or tell however you're going to do that? Could you be more specific? Do you have a clear idea now of which assets will you include in this <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Louis, Louis. Somebody's interrupting.  This is Luigi speaking. <mark type="inaudible" /> the first part of your question, so can you kindly repeat your question? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear? Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You have to slow down the way you speak, because there is an echo on the communication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Is it better now? Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now my question was in relation to the renewables IPO or minority stake sale.  Could you give us a clear idea of what assets will you be including and the evolution of that from now to year-end, the evolution of those potential assets? And second, in relation to your relationship with Acciona, if you're not taking decisions unanimously, I take it that relationship is somewhat deteriorating. What will be the plan if this gets worse? What is the potential outcome? Or how do you expect to face that if you think there is any sort of problem there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me repeat what I just said, Louis. I don't consider this to be a major issue, to be honest with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the strategy and the development of the company continues to be driven by common -- shared views by both partners. And I don't expect anything significant to come out of this recent <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>When it comes to renewables, the chart that we presented to you, the Chart 14, gives you an idea what kind of renewables we're speaking about here. We're speaking about our geothermal, our wind, our mini-hydro, and all <mark type="inaudible" /> developments we already have achieved.</p>
          <p>The package will obviously be confirmed as we will be continued to bundle up. And this is what will make up the 7,000-plus megawatts, about 7,380 megawatts that we want to achieve, and which we have listed a number of projects, which are already are through the permitting process phase, from here to 2012. And then, a lot goes beyond 2012. So what we are aiming at achieving is to provide enough fuel for further expansion of our renewable business. We think we are not selling pie in the sky. We are selling hot projects into potential floating and/or private investments.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a question regarding the financing needs this year. How much of the debt will be US dollar, if any? And the second question is regarding the negative outlook by <mark type="inaudible" />. How comfortable are you with the outlook and what's the report on that? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The connection was poor, but I assume that you are asking about debt reduction and outlook by the rating agencies, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to debt, as you heard Luigi speaking earlier on, we are obviously benefiting from the closing of the disposal to the assets that we have agreed with E.On, directly through Viesgo disposal and through Endesa's by &#x2013; Endesa's Europe and the smaller assets in Spain. This will have, overall &#x2013; will be benefiting us at the tune of about &#x20AC;9 billion altogether of debt reduction.</p>
          <p>We continue to do work in the disposal of the high-voltage with Italy. And as you heard me saying this, we are, obviously, taking all the next preliminary steps to look into potential disposal of the low pressure distribution gas network in Italy during 2008. Then the potential disposal of a minority stake in renewables next year, coupled with the continuing strong cash flow that we are receiving from our operations, will make it possible for us to have, by year-end, a well below &#x20AC;50 billion worth of debt.</p>
          <p>And, as you might remember, we have presented our case, our plan, not only to the financial community but also to our rating agencies.  And we already have clearance from S&amp;P's that's improved our A- rating recently, and we're now expecting Moody's and Fitch to come along with their advice, which I am confident that will confirm their current rating altogether, and we'll be removed from being on credit watch. So it's a series of good news, when it comes to this, and the permanent commitment that we've taken to maintain financial stability is a strong and fundamental pillar of our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't understand any need to go there. The debt structure has not changed from what we have presented to you during our London presentation. The debt's maturity will be 2010 and this will be obviously more than impacted by the benefits of us stating cash inflows and debt in consolidation through business proposals, the next which we will be 2012. So I'm fairly relaxed about this, and I don't need to tap the market.</p>

First of all on Russia, I just wondered if you could outline to us what the level of further increases in prices you're expecting in Russia for the remainder of 2008. And what the impact on EBITDA would be as the result of that?</p>
          <p>And, the other thing, I just wanted to the return the debt structure, if you don't mind, and your financing needs. If I understand rightly, you're saying you don't intend to come into the market at all for the remainder of 2008 and, from the sound of it, possibility even 2009. Am I right, then, in assuming that all the proceeds that you're going to be receiving from the sale of assets are going to be used to reduce your short-term debt? And is there any -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The intention to turn out any of the remaining part of the 50 billion of debt that you've got given the current market conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the debt, you should be aware that we have more than half of the debt which is long-term, which you can refer to on the annexes of our presentations at page 27. We think that the short-term component is the one that is going to be repaid by the cash inflows.</p>
          <p>Today's interest rate is 5.3%, and I think as we apply the cash inflows to the short-term, we will keep the long-term fixed component, which is below the 5.3% rate. So, altogether, again, I repeat what the council and rating agencies are confirming. We are maintaining a solid grip on our financial structure and will maintain an A rating altogether.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Russia, prices are increasing according to a low. And these are confirmed year after year. The intention of the Russian government -- and now, there is a note approved by the Duma &#x2013; that the internal pricing will be adjusted to, let me say, the netback of exporting gas into Europe. This is meant to favor cash flows and operating profits for those operators that there are willing to invest in additional gas resources or energy resources altogether to provide enough of fuel for the growth of the internal economy, and that's what the government is speaking to.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, we will take advantage from the situation of having a good combination of generation capacity, which is 50% based on coal and 50% based on gas, and to the extent that we own gas reserves through our SeverEnergia, our Northern Energy company, together with the united Gazprom, we can source our own gas into our gas fields-- into our gas plants and benefits for the core components of our generation mix.</p>
          <p>Altogether, Russia, in terms of OGK-5 development and SeverEnergia, development will further increase our margin nowadays in that country. Russia is expected to contribute more than &#x20AC;1.2 billion of EBITDA by 2012. This is because of the need for the local markets to gradually adjust to the netback of exporting gas from Russia into Europe or to other countries.</p>

Then, if I'm right, you ask the same question when it comes to the coal, and again, on a year basis we expect to have 6,000 hour, basically, a loss effective per annum, even more, which is increasing versus last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just have two questions. One is on your financial charges. I am looking at page three, and I wonder if you can give some details on the calculation of the fair value of the Acciona put option, and if you can also explain which are the other financial charges that you have in slide -- the 81 million on slide three?</p>
          <p>And the other question is on the net debt guidance. You are talking about the <mark type="inaudible" /> billion. I would wonder if you can give us a little bit of flavor of what you are including in it? Because we started from 58.8. Disposals, they are probably well above 10 billion. So is your cash flow enough to cover the dividend in 2008? Is your free cash flow enough to cover the dividend in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the debt components &#x2013; Antonella, good morning, again &#x2013; it's the obviously the 9 billion that we are expected to deleverage from the disposal of the assets, weighing the decontribution of the two assets that will be disposed . In addition to that, they will obviously be dependent on how many <mark type="inaudible" /> we'll be working on, and we'll maintain the &#x20AC;3 billion of inflow and outflow. Altogether, they should take us into a number at the end of the year, which would possibly start with a 4 as opposed to a 5, and comes to a total of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the fair value of the put option with Acciona, let me just remind you that, at the beginning, at the moment we launched a tender we posted the valuation of this puts both on the asset side, on top of investment, and on the liability side, in terms of fair value dispute as a liability. Therefore, when we make this type of valuation, the more the intrinsic value of the company increase and the more the timing versus the moment that we should be <mark type="inaudible" /> is going to be reduced, let's say, that the more you will see this liability bid be reduced.</p>
          <p>And that's the reason why we have posted this &#x20AC;110 million, which means, basically, a fair value on the liability side of the dispute in the region of &#x20AC;900 million, which has to be compared, if I'm not wrong, versus something like &#x20AC;1.1 billion at the very beginning at the moments of the launch of the tender. So this is the result...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is implied &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; which is the implied price value of Endesa in your valuation of your put option.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is an intrinsic value of Endesa that, of course, is higher than the value of the tender. Otherwise, we should be on the negative side, in that this value Endesa is being determined on the basis of the DCF methodologies based on the, let's say, that the industrial plant and results expected of Endesa.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the other financial charges, we have here I think most of this regards some fair value evaluation of derivatives on the interest charges, which, again, has to be reported as a charge for &#x20AC;80 million. Then there are some minor items. But, of course, this is not regarding again the cost of debt, which is the one that you see reported in the line of interest charges. So the &#x20AC;777 million is the pure cost of that. And that's what we bought here, and this is at the basis of the 5.3% average growth that we have reported before.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I have two quick follow up questions. First of all, if you can please elaborate a little bit more on your tender working capital in Italy? And explain when this and if this is going to be fully re-absorbed that during the year?</p>
          <p>And second, sorry, going back on your agreement with Acciona. If we had to run a worst case in terms of a major disagreement with Acciona on key issue, which sort of provisions you have in the agreement? Is there any exit prior to the put option exercise time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Susanna, let me repeat again. We continue to work with common interest, both Acciona and ourselves, to develop further Endesa and we have presented you with the plan that denotes a lot of the sources to organic growth, and I believe there is no real need for any further discussions about worst case. There is a base case on which we are working today and will continue to work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of the working capital in Italy, as I said, we have in our working capital &#x20AC;1.4 billion worth of receivable for the <mark type="inaudible" /> plant, and we expect to collect the entire amounts of this receivable by the end of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, any other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Moulder Andrew (sic) [Andrew Moulder] from CreditSights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's Andrew Moulder, CreditSights. I just had couple of questions on Endesa actually. On the situation with Acciona, Mr. Conti said that they didn't discuss the management changes they were proposing externally, and I wondered what that actually means? Does that actually mean that Acciona can make management changes without consulting Enel? And if they can't, I'm a little bit confused as to why didn't actually block the management changes that you didn't agree with?</p>
          <p>And my second question on Endesa just concerns the free float, which is only about 8% at the moment, and I just wonder what your plans are for this? Would you consider buying out the minorities of Endesa, or, alternatively, if the agencies are putting pressure on you to reduce debts perhaps faster than you are at the moment, would you sell down your stake in Endesa to, say, 51% and increase the free float there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not considering anything around that. We're happy with the float. The floating of Endesa today is allowing Endesa to be included on the IBEX 35 index, is enough of a floating for the market to be receiving big amounts of quotes. And the fundamental fact of life is that we consider the value, and it is beyond the true representation on the stock exchange, and that's the growth Luigi has been reporting to you.</p>
          <p>Again, I have to repeat what I said three times already about the conditional change. There is nothing serious about the fact of an extension on the voting. That refers to the fact that we were &#x2013; were not consulting the information about the people that were selected to the standard of our agreement saying that whenever we want to enact the additional change, you have to make sure that you hire the best people available.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, we just abstained from voting because we are not opposing any change, but we just wanted to make sure that we had selected the right people at the right moment. That's what we have, again, said earlier on, and I continue to say it. It is nothing more than just that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I just be clear be there, then, that Acciona actually cannot appoint any new members to the management board of Endesa  without your approval, in one way or another? You approve or you abstain or you vote against.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. These are not appointments to the Board. These are just second level of the additional changes. This has nothing to do with the Board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Again, the Chairman of the company, as well as the CEO of the company, have their autonomy to organize themselves. While it is conceivably accepted on the current agreement if that, when they do this they inform, and they make sure that we have been looking at all the potential opportunities in the market. And that's all we are asking for.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Chris Moore from ABN.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so if I can just ask one more question, please. I think you said, in presenting, that your unit margins in Generation in Italy in quarter one this year were up, from 25.9 to &#x20AC;26.1 per megawatt hour. Given the big increases in coal prices recently and volatility in oil, in particular, can you just bring us up to date on where you think your spark spreads, attendant spark spreads are heading this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, let me just clarify that this 26 is, let's say, the average cost of our production costs, which show an increase &#x2013; and, by the way, you have, I think, a chart in the annexes, one of them which shows you the increase in the cost &#x2013; the fuel cost evolution. This shows an increase of &#x20AC;10. On the other hand, we have increased our average revenues, net of auxillary services, of more than &#x20AC;10. That's the reason why we had a leverage on the thermal side, an improvement of our margin, on top of increasing volumes.</p>
          <p>So the 26 is basically the difference between the average price on the thermal side versus the average cost, coal included. When it comes to the combined cycle, the spark spread, based on this average calculation, is just in the region of 24, 25. So it's not very, very far from that. You're also to take into account that the increase of &#x20AC;10 in the energy prices is to pure profit when it comes to our renewable side of production. So, as I said, I think this is a very solid first quarter for our profitability &#x2013; for our margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. I have only one follow-up question on the Domestic Generation business and on the year guidance of 2.4 billion for 2008. Given that you're assigned to get ten additional euros in your wholesale price, which should benefit all the renewable and manual part, does it mean that you are assuming a bit of relation on the margin on the thermal electrical option for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I said, 2.4 is basically the EBITDA expected, without taking into account the effect of the fair value, which in 2007, was equal, if I'm not wrong, to something like &#x20AC;160 million worth of contribution to the EBITDA. This means that, in terms of unit margin on the thermal side, we do not expect any major changes because, as we said many times, we enhanced our position.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the improvement that we have seen in the first quarter, should be repeated in the following quarter, and more than offset the light decrease in the auxiliary services that, as you might recall, I said it many times. On the other hand, the first quarter, in terms of either production outfit, has been in line with 2007, which means that if there has not been very all in line with the normal level of production, when it comes to April we start to see some improvement, because, as you can see, it's really more than the past. Therefore, we should probably expect some additional contribution on this side as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Could you please give out the guidance for your working capital change expectations, including in your net debt add-ins for the end of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, we expect that 100% of the 1.4 receivable in Italy for the acquisition mechanism will be fully collected by the end of year and we also expect a collection of a portion of the extra needs receivable that we have in Spain. After the collection of these two major items, we should go back to a normal level of working capital, which we expect to reach, I would say, in the third quarter of this year. So we should go back to the normal level working capital, which should not be very far from there, in the long run.</p>
