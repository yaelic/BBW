        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining myself and Julian Heslop, our CFO, on this call today. Before I open up for Q&amp;A, I'd like to make a few comments. This first quarter performance marked what we always expected to be a year of two halves for GSK. With the year-on-year comparative effect of generic competition to products in the U.S. at it's most extreme in the first six months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Generic competition to our neuroscience portfolio in the U.S. reduced sales by close to &#xA3;450 million compared to the same quarter last year. And this largely accounts for U.S. sales declining 22% to &#xA3;2.3 billion in the quarter. As expected, this impact to higher margin U.S. sales resulted in a decline to our gross profit margin, and together with one-off intangible asset write-offs in R&amp;D, this primarily explains the reported difference we see between sales and earnings performance for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking broadly at sales performances for the quarter, you will see divergence between the U.S. and the strong sales delivery reported in Europe, Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Japan. In the U.S., we experienced some tough performance challenges as our product portfolio transitions and we've restructured our business model. The scale of change we've undertaken has undoubtedly been disruptive and testing for our employees but it is essential that we reconfigure our U.S. business to make sure we have the right resource in the right areas with an overall lower level of cost</p>
          <p>The first quarter saw a lot of this change happen with for example, 60% of the primary care sales force being trained on new product areas and given new territorial responsibilities. The appointment of Deirdre Connelly as the new leader of our U.S. business was also an important event in the quarter. She is undoubtedly one of the best executives currently working in the pharmaceutical industry and is already well down the track of implementing the changes we need in our U.S. business. With generic exposure reducing and several new product launches to come, I expect a significant improvement to the performance of our U.S. business during the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to the regions outside of the U.S., first quarter pharmaceutical sales were very positive, all together growing at 7% to over &#xA3;3.3 billion. The strong start to the year of our Japanese business was particularly encouraging, with sales growth driven by Advair and Relenza. New indications for Advair in January for use in COPD and with pediatrics are helping to accelerate sales. First quarter sales were triple those in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We've increased resource behind Advair through a new co-promotion agreement with another Japanese company and you can expect to see more of this kind of activity as we look to execute successful launches from the extensive product pipeline we have in Japan. This includes and I'm delighted to say, two new product approvals we received just yesterday, one for Allermist and the other for Tykerb.</p>
          <p>In the emerging markets, first quarter sales were up 18% to &#xA3;661 million and we are investing rapidly in our sales forces to drive forward our product portfolio. In China for example, our sales force has increased by 40% since the start of last year and we now have well over 1,800 representatives working for GSK in the market.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we are in the midst of launching two major new products; Synflorix, our new vaccine that provides increased protection for infants against pneumococcal disease and alli, our new OTC weight loss treatment. This is the first time that GSK has launched an OTC brand simultaneously across the region and by mid-year alli will reach consumers in almost 30 markets.</p>
          <p>This kind of launch capability indicates the competitive scale of GSK's consumer business. And with 12 new products launches in the first quarter alone 15% sales growth in the BRIC markets and market share gains for seven of our top 10 consumer brands, it's clear that we are demonstrating the performance of this key business.</p>
          <p>Given the current economic downturn, overall sales growth in the first quarter for consumer of 4%, to well over &#xA3;1 billion, a very resilient performance. So far we have only seen a limited impact to our business due to the downturn, and mainly in Europe. We'll be talking to you in more detail about our consumer business at our meeting in London at the end of May.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased with the progress we've made against our strategic priorities, to improve long-term growth for GSK and to reduce risk. We have invested in a series of transactions to leverage our existing assets and maximize value to shareholders. The acquisition of Stiefel Laboratories and our collaboration with Pfizer on HIV assets will create two new specialist businesses for GSK, and provide us with new options to diversify GSK's growth profile and reduce the risk of pipeline cyclicality. In the same manner, we've now completed five targeted bolt-on acquisitions in the last six months to strengthen our commercial position in consumer healthcare and emerging markets. Products acquired from all of these transactions will deliver new revenues to GSK from the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to maintain a level of around 30 medicines and vaccines in our late-stage pipeline, and pipeline output for the quarter remained positive with six filings completed with regulatory authorities. Notable was Cervarix in the U.S., and it was good to see Ofatumumab granted priority review by the FDA. Biopharmaceuticals, excluding vaccines, now constitute almost 15% of GSK's clinical pipeline, and this is a further example of the way in which we're aiming to broaden our portfolio.</p>
          <p>All of these filings will be further valuable additions to our new product portfolio, sales of which were &#xA3;265 million for the quarter, so already annualizing to around &#xA3;1 billion per year. These and other products together with the changes we are making to invest in and change GSK's business model are intrinsic to delivering greater growth and improved shareholder return.</p>
          <p>Finally, and in conclusion, I'm also pleased to confirm that our policy of progressive dividend continues, with this quarter's dividend up 8%, an increase to 14 pence.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now hand over to Julian to take you through the numbers in some more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew. And as usual, I'll concentrate on constant exchange rate growth. Turnover in the quarter was &#xA3;6.7 billion, 5% lower than the previous year, and pharmaceutical turnover was down 6%, to 5.6 billion and Consumer Healthcare was up 4% to 1.1 billion. U.S. pharmaceutical turnover declined 22%, adversely impacted as we expected by continued generic competition, primarily to our CNS portfolio. However, pharmaceuticals turnover in Europe and the rest of the world was strong with combined sales growth of 7% to &#xA3;3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>At the product level, total sales of Advair were flat at &#xA3;1.2 billion with good growth in emerging markets in Japan, offsetting a 5% reported decline in U.S. sales. Our estimate for underlying U.S. Advair sales growth is in the mid-single digit range, the primary reason for the difference being variations in wholesaler stocking patterns.</p>
          <p>Our vaccines business had another strong quarter with sales up 18% to 625 million driven by strong growth in Europe and emerging markets. However, vaccine sales declined in the U.S. due to increased competition in the hepatitis and DTP segments. Overall, we continue to expect our vaccines business to be a key driver of growth for the Group during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Relenza sales were 222 million, reflecting significant pandemic stockpiling orders from both the U.K. and Japanese governments. Avodart and Lovaza also performed well with sales growth of 12% and 54%, respectively. However, Avandia sales declined by 19%. Sales of newly launched pharmaceutical products totaled 265 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer Healthcare business reported sales growth of 4%, despite suffering from some customer de-stocking, particularly in Europe where sales fell 4%. However, this was more than offset by sales growth in the rest of the world. And encouragingly, we saw market share gains in both our OTC and oral care businesses. We did however see lower sales in the U.K. nutritionals business as lower consumer purchasing power adversely impacted Lucozade soft drink sales.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results before major restructuring costs in more detail, you will have seen the cost of goods as a percentage of turnover was 24.3%, in line with my expectations for the full year with the increase over the previous year principally reflecting lower sales of high margin U.S. products due to generic competition.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs, excluding legal charges, were 30.6% of turnover. You will appreciate that this margin is a function of both the phasing of costs and turnover. I continue to expect the SG&amp;A margin excluding legal charges to be slightly higher for the full year than it was in 2008. Overall, SG&amp;A costs were 1% lower this quarter than the previous year. This reflected a 9% increase in investment to deliver sales growth in emerging markets, Japan and consumer healthcare, higher pension charges, primarily offset by significant reduction in SG&amp;A cost elsewhere in the business, reflecting the benefit from the ongoing restructuring program.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D costs of &#xA3;1.1 billion were 14% higher than the previous year. This included &#xA3;115 million of intangible asset write-offs compared to only six million in the first quarter last year. Excluding this write-off, R&amp;D expenditure was 3% higher than last year. I did not expect this level of asset write-offs when I presented the Q4 results to you earlier in the year, and I now consequently expect full year R&amp;D expenditure to be slightly higher as a percentage of sales than it was in 2008 as a result.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, other operating income together with the profit on the sale of some of our Quest shares amounted to &#xA3;169 million, which was similar to last year's income of &#xA3;161 million. Included within this was royalty income of &#xA3;67 million, some &#xA3;5 million higher than last year. I expect other operating income together with the Q1 profit from the sale of our Quest shares to be slightly higher in 2009 than it was in 2008. Earnings per share before major restructuring costs was 26.3 pence for the quarter, 28% lower than last year, which was in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>We expect 2009 to be very much a year of two quite different halves, with the first being significantly impacted by generic competition in the U.S., but with this impact projected to diminish significantly in the second half of the year at the same time as we expect the sales contribution from new products to increase. Currency continues to be strongly beneficial, and the actual sterling EPS growth, excluding the restructuring charges for the quarter, was 3%, a 31% currency benefit, principally reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. And taking period end rates, quarter end rates, I expect the currency benefit, if that applies for the whole of the rest of the year, to be around 23%. The restructuring program is progressing well. We took charges of &#x20A4;264 million in the quarter and remain on track to deliver &#x20A4;1 billion of savings by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed on pages 15 and 16 of the release that we've implemented the new operating segment standard, IFRS 8, with effect from the 1st of January. This requires us to report externally segmental turnover and operating profit on the same basis as it is provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer in our management accounts. I would like to make a couple of points on this information. Firstly; it reflects our internal management reporting process, which simply allocates all profit on product sales to the segment in which the external sale is finally made. Secondly, there is no allocation of central or pharmaceutical R&amp;D costs. This has the effect of ensuring that sector presidents see the total group profit impact from performance in their businesses.</p>
          <p>Finally, if you look at the cash flow, you will see the net cash inflow from operating activities for the quarter was &#x20A4;1.7 billion, 4% lower than last year, reflecting higher cash restructuring charges. Cash generated in the quarter was used to fund acquisitions of &#x20A4;500 million.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand back to Andrew.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen your question-and-answer session will now begin. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question in the queue is from the line of Gbola Amusa from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Couple of pipeline questions. Given that MAGE-A3  went into Phase III melanoma, I just had a question about whether gene expression profiling data that emerged at ASCO 08 was used in this Phase III trial for recruitment purposes. And then secondly, I know Promacta is still in early days given the 20 November US approval, is there anything you have anecdotally as to which direction that could be going even for early days? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Gbola thanks for the questions. As far as the MAGE 3 gene profiling, the answer is yes. It was used in the way in which the trial was designed, in the way in which recruitment and the analysis will be carried out, so confirm that.</p>
          <p>As far as Promacta is concerned, I actually think Promacta is going to be fine and a slow start not least in terms of the various risk management programs required by FDA now, which I think is becoming a bit of a pattern if I can put it that way for many drugs. We should expect it for many drugs in the future and essentially this creates a bit of slowing of the initial introductory phase to the marketplace. But we are starting to see good commitment from accounts, from the marketplace. And so the in terms of the beginning of sales as we've gone through Q1 into April I'm fairly confident that Promacta is going to do okay after what was admittedly a slow start, but I think we understand exactly why is it's a slow start.</p>
          <p>The other thing I emphasize is obviously that idiopathic thrombocytopenia purea is really the -obviously the launch indication, but by far and away the smallest of the potential indications for this medicine and we won't really see the real opportunity open up for Promacta until the indications such as chronic liver disease, hepatitis C induced liver disease, chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia, all of those indications, which are underway in our trial program are really where the larger volume opportunities are. But I remain pretty optimistic around Promacta and beyond that nothing more to say.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question comes from the line of Kevin Wilson from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, a couple of questions, if I may. Andrew, what's the sustainability of the 18% emerging market growth? And secondly, what's the sustainability of the 7% European growth? And what was also behind that European growth? And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...finally a couple of questions for Julian. If we were using three times sales as an NPV value of the Pfizer HIV business, would that be a good starting point to think about calculating the intangible asset value? And finally, are you going to change your guidance on net financial expense for this year in the light of the acquisitions and if so can you give us some sense of what that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, Kevin, thanks very much for those two questions. As far as the emerging markets are concerned, we're obviously very pleased with the performance. We haven't seen any material impact, one or two countries, but nothing really material in terms of downturn in demand due to economics. Although, I think we should continue to be watchful around this. Seeing one or two areas of de-stocking. In Russia, I'd say, we remain conscious of keeping a close eye on.</p>
          <p>In terms of any distorting factors to Q1, a little bit of phasing around some vaccine tenders, but actually not very material. On the other hand, all of the acquisitions we've made, so the UCB and the BMS transactions will all start to kick in Q2. So net-net who knows what's going to come next. I don't see any great reason to certainly feel concerned about our ability to deliver robust performance whether it's exactly 18 or plus or minus a little bit, not sure yet, we'll see have the rest of the year goes. As you absolutely know, we've prioritized emerging market as a place where we do believe we can deliver superior growth. And we're investing behind it. So that's clearly we want to see and delighted to see it starts so well this year on the back of what was a 12% growth rate in 2008.</p>
          <p>As far as Europe is concerned, we have had a very robust start to Europe. It has been flattered a little bit in Q1 because of the Relenza order from the U.K. government, and so that obviously that won't recur again during the rest of the year. But beyond that, we've seen good robust performance across the portfolio in Europe and with the introduction as we speak of Synflorix, we'll start to see Synflorix sales in the next quarter and then that will obviously ramp up as we go through reimbursement. As you know that's a big marketplace in Europe. So again, I think robust start; will it be as good as seven for the rest of year, we'll see. The Relenza thing has clearly bumped up the Q1. But a good start for the European business. I'll hand over to Julian for the other two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Kevin, I mean if you want to do a net present value with Pfizer in terms of that combination, really I wouldn't use a multiplier of sales. You have to obviously use your extrapolation of the Pfizer sales over time or if it's easier, which it may be, just take 15/85 of your estimate of the value of our portfolio, which clearly I expect is much easier to do.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial expenses, I mean the unhelpful answer is it all depends on when the transaction closes; the more helpful answer is the guidance I gave you before those transactions is still good for the year and the interest that we are receiving on those moneys that are currently on deposit is around the sort of 1% mark and so if you apply that, you can come up I think with a very good call.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Jeff Holt from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Yeah. We can now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just want to get some broad fresh comments from you on stocking and pricing for the pharma business. So the first being, are you seeing any abnormal tightening of inventories anywhere, but particularly in the US market? And secondly, are you &#x2013; have you &#x2013; or are you looking to change any of your drug pricing policies in the US at this point given the focus on that in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of stocking, if I just look around the world what we've seen is as I mentioned earlier one or two of the emerging markets we've seen some destocking going on. In the US marketplace, we've seen a little bit destocking compared to last year. Q1 to Q1 comparison is slightly adverse in terms of destocking because there was some quite a lot of stock building going on last Q1 -- Q1'08; particularly I think in Cardinal, we're opening warehouses or big warehouse in the US, which obviously didn't repeat. So there is a big of a year-on-year thing. A little bit of destocking in the US affected some other products; obviously Advair was affected a little bit there. We've seen some destocking in the consumer trade, so some of the retailer; the big retailers in Europe have really destocked quite a bit.</p>
          <p>So I actually think there is kind of -- although we have got great performance of our overall consumer business, Europe Q1 was a little bit held back in consumer. I think that's probably a one-off effect, because the inventory levels in some of the big European retailers is pretty thin right now. Beyond that, nothing dramatic to report yet.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing, we are not -- I'm not going to go into great detail of what we're doing on pricing and we certainly don't have some whole new pricing plan which were about to spring in the U.S. But we are obviously looking at how best we go forward in terms of pricing given the evolving marketplace, and you've started to see in the way in which we price some of our products. Promacta is a very good example where we've priced it at a significantly lower price to existing products in the marketplace. That has received a good support from the accounts as we've started to sign them up. And we have already got something like 3,500 accounts and doctor signed up for Promacta not least I think because of that, alongside the profile of the drug.</p>
          <p>We will look drug-by-drug and make the right call. And I think the best way to think about it is we're embarking on pricing with a flexible mindset and a very open mindset in how we might use price to maximize the value of our assets as we go forward.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon. Three quick questions if I may please, Andrew. So firstly, just returning to economic sensitivity, but this time on the U.S. business and this time pharma, and just talking about the consumer level. What percentage of your revenue base is exposed to co-insurance and do you have any sense of how you see pressure on that growing as COBRA program starts to mature as we get into the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>The second question is on investments in your consumer business, to what extent do you think that you have got sufficient management competence and expertise with your existing franchise without seeking to augment from some of your peers and standalone competes with expertise in that &#x2013; in those spaces?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is on Syncria. Obviously the FDA is chewing through the issues with GLP-1 as my understanding is that you initiated a Phase III trial with 5,000-odd patients. But you can't put the drug into rodents. Have you addressed that with the FDA and have you thought <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...I think you probably, let me just double check, you're probably thinking about some of the anxieties which have surfaced around high price drugs in U.S. Is that where you are going with that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct, and but also more generally the increasing use of co-insurance plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we certainly are not exposed in the way that others are &#x2013; or appear to be with these very high priced &#x2013; obviously, we're not particularly exposed in that marketplace. We haven't seen generally too much impact so far in term of the economic impact on the pharma business, I mean I think we have issues, which affects us specific like our genericization but beyond that not too many, no real evidence of a trend I'd say to be honest with you at this point.</p>
          <p>As far as the consumer business is concerned, and I think given the performance of our consumer business versus a number of other consumer companies, I'm pretty confident with the leadership we've got of our consumer business and I remain extremely impressed with the people who are running our toothpaste businesses which once again Sensodyne remains one of the fastest going products in the oral care sector. We grew market share in the oral healthcare market, we grew market share in the OTC market, a phenomenal launch of Panadol Advance in the U.K.</p>
          <p>To be honest with you, but for the weaker performance of the nutritionals businesses in the U.K. partly driven by weather, partly driven by stocking in the economy, the consumer business is firing on all cylinders. So I'm very &#x2013; a big fan of our team. Of course, we look to how we can upgrade personnel and where we see key challenges as I demonstrated on the pharmaceuticals side, we'll go and get them. But right now, I'm very proud of the performance of our consumer company. I think this is the business which has performed strongly across the world; continues to perform strongly across world, even when others are stumbling and haven't done quite so well. So, I am very happy with that.</p>
          <p>As far as Syncria is concern the reason why we haven't conducted studies in rodents, is that they have an immuno reaction to human albumin which is in Syncria. So it's very kind of straight forward reason for that. We've had no thyroid findings in the pre-clinical or clinical development program for Syncria today. Obviously, we have done studies on primates, so we've had this clearly in a significant range of species and in Phase III, we are going to collect data on thyroid findings as adverse events if they occur to make sure that we don't miss anything.</p>
          <p>So overall in terms of the issues which are around here, we feel like we are addressing them. It's obvious why we didn't do the work in rodents. And obviously, we are starting the study &#x2013; the studies in Q1 and I think we are in good shape to get going on Syncria. We will go to the next question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. It's Brian Bordeaux from Deutsche Bank. Two questions please: one financial question, one product question. Firstly, on the financial side: I'd just like to ask you about cost of good sold, specifically the constant currency growth rate of 13% that we saw...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, could you just repeat the question? You broke up just as you asked it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. A question on cost of sales, you reported a 13% growth rate for COGS at constant currencies in the first quarter year-on-year. That looks high compared to the run rate we might expect over the year and just looking back in the last three years, COGS grew constant currency 6% in 2007, 4% in 2008, although it does seem very volatile. I was just wondering what's driving that spikiness in year-on-year constant currency growth rate please. And the second question on Cervarix. I was just wondering if you could update us on the progress of Cervarix, specifically related to any further tender sales, and whether you are seeing continued similar patterns that you were seeing last year in terms of how you are going against Gardasil on some of those contracts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Brian. I am going to hand over to Julian in a second to address the COGS question. As far Cervarix is concern, we've seen a continued evolution of the business exactly in trend with what we have seen in the past, continued to win significant proportion of the competitive tenders. Obviously, we have been supplying now in the U.K. against that tender, I think something like 800,000 girls have already been vaccinated in the U.K. Netherlands, we won 100% of that tender as well. So Cervarix continues to go just fine.</p>
          <p>We filed the new data in the US. We will see how that goes with the FDA over the next few months, but I have to say with the Cervarix, I think the product is living up to expectations and as we progress through our FDA dialogue hopefully we'll be able to bring this to the U.S. in the not-too-distant future. I'll hand over to Julian on the COGS question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian on COGS, I guess two main factors. One is the significant decline due to generic competition in the U.S., so we are losing very high margin and hence very low cost of goods as a percent of sales products. So that's reason number one.</p>
          <p>And the second reason is mix, which is that the products that are growing have a lower cost of goods &#x2013; sorry have a higher cost of goods margin. So for example, if you think of emerging markets, which was growing 18%, they have a higher cost of goods margin. You think of the Relenza product, that has a higher cost of goods margin. If you think of our vaccines business, which is growing strongly, that has a higher cost of goods margin as well. So all those factors combine to give you that overall result.</p>
          <p>What I do simply is to look at the gross profit margins as a percent of turnover, which is 24.3, and my expectations for the year was between 24 and 25, so it's a pretty much where I had expected to be at this stage.</p>

          <p>Next question is from the line Philippe Lanone from Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions on some of the midsized products that have been growing in the quarter. First of all, a comment on Tykerb that on the other hand seems to be sequentially stable. What can we expect going forward? We had Ventolin making a strong contribution, how sustainable is it going forward? Then one question on Arixtra because they have being doing a very good job here because it's making now a significant contribution, but in the Sanofi days we remember that there were some generics coming, because there were no patent. They disappeared because of virtually no sales. What will be the situation there, according to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philippe, thanks for the question. Let me take those in the order you asked them in. Tykerb right now continues to do well; it's just under a 20% market share of total metastatic breast cancer as of the end of 2008. And as we've penetrated that advanced stage of the disease it's inevitable we're going to see these sorts of plateaus I think in sales. We are beginning to get more and more use in Europe, not in every market. The U.K. we remain in dialogue with the U.K. government and NICE trying to get Tykerb reimbursed by the NHS. We continue to appeal the issues there with Tykerb, and overall we've just filed &#x2013; not long ago filed for first line use for Tykerb.</p>
          <p>So I'm not really surprised with the evolution of Tykerb; I think it's done very well in its approved indications. We now need to extend the indications, obviously with the first line that looks good, you know we have encouraging data in hormone sensitive tumors. We have the adjuvant studies up and running. Tykerb is going to be a classic oncology agent in the sense of building up its potential over the years as the various indications come through.</p>
          <p>As far as Ventolin is concerned, strong performance of Ventolin, a lot of that's driven by the U.S. in particular, the introduction of a lower priced Ventolin through the Wal-Mart chain under the label of ReliOn Ventolin. This has been a very significant success for us in terms of increasing share in the biggest retailer in the U.S. And obviously there is lot of dynamism in this marketplace as we've seen rotation from CFC to HFA propelled aerosols, and again that's given a new lease of life for Ventolin, which was up 23% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as Arixtra is concerned, I'm delighted with the way Arixtra has developed. I think particularly the European business has done a very nice job of developing the Arixtra franchise on the back of the Fraxiparine one. I think in hindsight that was a really tremendous acquisition when we brought the Fraxiparine and Arixtra businesses. We are conscious of companies working in this space from a generic point of view, but we're also conscious that this is a 50-stage synthesis. We were well aware of the risk of generic competition when we acquired this business and began to invest in it. We'll wait and see what happens, but let's say this is, to put it very mildly this is a very difficult product to get to from a generic point of view. And I'd also point out in Europe, where the majority of our current sales are, we have data exclusivity protection until 2012.</p>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Philippe. Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have two questions. One on the Advair franchise in the US, down 5% in local currency, but we do see some prescription growth and we do see some pricing for that product. Is it all to do with wholesaler destocking? And how we actually move down to a lower level of stocking? So we'll just see the growth of Advair come through in the future or should we see some sort of rebound?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I wonder if you could go a little bit more into the vaccines issue. I understand the hepatitis decline because of the temporary problem that Merck had that have now been put right. Could you just give us a little bit about the outlook, what you think would be reasonable assumptions for the vaccine business, particularly the pediatric and the hepatitis vaccine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jo. Thanks very much. Yes, so, Advair was primarily affected by stocking issues, Q1 comparison as I mentioned earlier in particular. We think the run rate, the core run rate on Advair is somewhere mid-single digits in the US. I think that's a very good kind of estimate, at least of what we see today. I've been very pleased to see the gradual strengthening of the prescription growth rates that we've seen over the last &#x2013; certainly the second half of the quarter and as we go into this month. So I am pretty relaxed around the Advair performance, frankly, in terms of what it's doing in the real world versus what we're seeing in the reported numbers. Obviously, we need to also make sure that as we've reengineered our sales teams, they are really focused on making sure they're delivering impact in this marketplace going forward. But I would say that mid-single digits number is a pretty reasonable estimate for where we really are today. We'll see obviously how the rest of the year goes, but that's where I would be on that one.</p>
          <p>As far as vaccines is concerned it's a very complicated set of moving parts. Last year, because of the Hepatitis A shortages from one of our competitors we had a tremendous year on Hepatitis A. Not surprisingly we've seen some share pull back for us as that company has come back into supply, so that's part of the story. We've also seen on our DTPa franchise, the Pediarix franchise, a reduction in sales and share for GSK because of an absence of Hib monotherapy vaccine in the marketplace. What was happening last year was people using our Pediarix plus monotherapy Hib to vaccinate. In the absence of monotherapy Hib they've gone to a competitor which has Hib included. I told you this was going to be complicated.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; as a consequence of that we've seen a movement in our Pediarix sales. Interestingly enough, now people are using more Hepatitis B monotherapy, so we have seen a positive movement in Hepatitis B. So there is a tremendous amount of moving parts in the US vaccine marketplace. I think there is some settling out to be done during the rest of this year. In the background, we have seen great growth of our new vaccines Boostrix and Kinrix. And to be honest with you I think as we go through the rest of the year, we'll see all of this start to settle out. I think in the long run our pediatric vaccine business in the U.S. is very robust. It's been the beneficiary and the victim of other company stock out problems over last year and the first part of this year. As all of that starts to settle, I think we have really strong brand in Pediarix, we have a great portfolio of hepatitis products and with Boostrix and Kinrix we've really got the full line. So I would expect some continued volatility in the next quarter or so and then I think it will start to settle out and I think we're in very strong position. Thank you, Jo. I've got time for two more questions.</p>

          <p>Okay. The next question in the queue is from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions. First, would you provide any color on the tone of discussion regarding Synflorix with key e-regulators? Do you believe there is an opportunity for Synflorix to become the pneumococcal vaccine of choice in key markets and is the eventual arrival of the 13-valent product part of these discussions and perhaps stop regulators from long-term commitment.</p>
          <p>And then secondly there was no mention of Avodart's reduced trial even as an upcoming event despite the fact that it's very near term. Presumably you know the data by now, is there any other conclusion we can draw than maybe the study was not positive? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, thanks very much for you questions. As far Synflorix is concern, we've just started the negotiations with different authorities as well as with multilateral funders for the emerging markets. And I think it's really worthwhile just putting in the back of your mind that pneumococcal vaccination is likely to be high on the list of emerging market and developing market, agenda over the next two or <mark type="audio gap" />. .</p>
          <p>We have approval now in Europe, Canada and Australia. We also have our first approvals in Latina in Chile, which included an indication for otitis media caused by NTHi. And the first launches are underway. So the primary markets have started in places like Portugal, Czech Republic and elsewhere. Germany should go by the end of this month and then we move from there.</p>
          <p>In terms of a dialog with the authorities, I think the authorities have been waiting a long time to have the opportunity to have choice in this marketplace. And I would fully expect Simplirix to be a significant player in this marketplace. And we'll see how that competition plays out over the next 12 months. I do think that market, that the governments are looking to make decisions in the next 12 months. And I think they will be focused on products which have got their approvals and are ready to go.</p>
          <p>As far as the reduced study for Avodart is concerned, absolutely happy to confirm that the data is going to be presented next week at the AUA in the US. My view is that's the place for information of this nature to be communicated and I'd encourage you to tune in and listen to it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. The first is a follow-up question on Andrew's question &#x2013; Andrew Baum's question earlier on the Syncria. My understanding is that you do not measure calcitonin level in this trial, and please correct me if I'm wrong. But there seem to be quite some focus on the calcitonin levels, so I'm wondering do you at least &#x2013; if you're not at least thinking about modifying the protocol of the Syncria trials. Then I have a few financial questions. Firstly, just thinking about modeling all these recent transactions? Julian, are you going &#x2013; what are we going to do with amortization? Will you also book that potentially in the middle column so we can focus on something like &#x2013; previously you've focused on business performance EPS, or are your EPS on the left column going to include intangible amortization? And then you seem to be have quite a benefit, a margin boost from mass spec, could you just quickly tell us where that is coming from? And the final question is, can you just confirm that the gain you're making from the HIV transaction is excluded in your guidance of other operating income, and that's incremental to that guidance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alexandra, can you just repeat your third question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry. The first question was on the Syncria assay program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, the third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Third. The third was on the &#x2013; I think the third question was on the margin benefit you had from FX because the top line was boosted a lot less than the bottom line. So hence I assume there was a margin benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We got the rest. You just broke up on that one, that's perfect. So Alexandra, let me just answer the question on Syncria, first of all. The whole issue of the relevance of calcitonin is not proven. We're open minded on this in terms of whether we will need to do &#x2013; to look at this as the story evolves and we're certainly open &#x2013; and we keep open discussion to this as it does evolve, but you're right, and we will wait and see how things play out. On the other three questions, I'm going to hand over to Julian, all three of which I think he'll be more than happy to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Alexandra. Thanks, yeah. In terms of amortization the only thing that goes in the middle column are major restructuring costs in respect to the large restructuring program we've talked to you about. And secondly, significant major acquisitions and the only major acquisition to-date that has gone in there has been the Reliant acquisition. All the other restructuring costs and other acquisition related costs in relation to acquisitions have been reported as part of the left hand column, the profit excluding restructuring cost.</p>
          <p>Looking forward Stiefel is the only transaction which is big enough again to go in that middle column. But in terms of amortization, all the amortization charges that we take on the fair value of the intangibles goes into the left hand column. In other words, it's in the column which is profit before restructuring cost. Clearly as that starts to get more significant, I may well disclose that separately, so you see what it is. But when you look at our profit before restructuring charges, that bears the cost of that amortization charge.</p>
          <p>In terms of FX, the one element in term of our manufacturing is we have lot of manufacturing in the U.K., so when currencies strengthen in comparison to sterling, we clearly benefit from the fact that our U.K. cost base is clearly very &#x2013; even more competitive than it was before.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the gain on the HIV transaction, this is the gain in respect of the exchange of assets with Pfizer, providing we complete it this year as we expect, there will be again and it will go through the accounts and it is excluded from that other operating income guidance I gave you but if for whatever reason it should fall into 2010, a new accounting standard applies and the gain will go straight through reserves.</p>
