        <plist>
          <p>Very welcome, everybody, to the Atlas Copco Mine in Nacka and, of course, also a very warm welcome to everybody participating on the telephone conference. I say the Atlas Copco Mine, but we also refer to it as Ronnie's gold mine sometimes and that is perhaps more a virtual gold mine, but nevertheless it's something we are very proud of anyway, so hearty welcome to everybody.</p>
          <p>Let me, before we start, also say that we are sorry that some of the direct distribution of the press release was late today for some technical problems, specifically to some receivers outside Sweden. Fortunately, the website, the information to the stock exchange and to media worked as it should. So I sincerely hope that you haven't experienced too much inconvenience for this technical problem. Sorry for that.</p>
          <p>With that, again welcome and we will, of course, talk about the fourth quarter report of Atlas Copco and the full year results and we will do it in the normal format. I will hand over to Ronnie, the CEO of Atlas Copco, Ronnie Leten, in just a few minutes and then from there on, we will take some questions, but I'll come back to that after 20 minutes or something like that.</p>
          <p>So with that, I hand over to you Ronnie.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans-Ola, and all warm welcome to my gold mine. So it's nice to be here and to see this historical place. I go with like &#x2013; normally, I go to the presentation and I go immediately to slide number two where we talk about the highlights. A good quarter ending a record year, I would start with that. If we talk about the quarter more specific, I will take later a bit more about the year. We see that the demand lowered somewhat. It mainly comes from a softer mining equipment sales but also from a softer gas and process compressor business.</p>
          <p>What's good to know is good to see that our parts and service, what it says here, our aftermarket business continue to develop very solidly, very strong. So it's always good that part of the business continues to do well and you all know that that is our resilient part of our business.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to have the profitability and if we readjust for two one-time items, we will end up with 21.4%. So I think for quarter four it is a very solid profitability. What really makes me proud about this quarter is our cash flow. We really made a great contribution to that mainly coming from a good accounts receivable part but also a very good inventory achievement. So that I think was very good from our organization.</p>
          <p>And the last sentence here on this slide is also what we should be proud of all of us in Atlas Copco is that we are again ranked among the world's top sustainable companies by, say, on the top of the Global 100 list. So congratulations to all of you in Atlas Copco.</p>
          <p>Well, in terms &#x2013; and now on slide number three, the figures in summary. We saw a slight decrease on orders received. So the SEK 21 billion organic, a little bit down to 2%. A good output, revenue up SEK 22 billion &#x2013; a strong SEK 22 billion, organic 4% up and operating profit of almost SEK 4.7 billion. And of course, if you then reconnect with the two one-time items, you see that we are close to almost to SEK 4.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share SEK 2.8, now they are more and like already said, the operating cash flow almost SEK 4.3 billion. And we proposed a dividend of SEK 5.5, so that's an increase of 10% compared to last year, which gives a payout of SEK 6.7 billion.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to slide number four. And I would like to spend just a minute on this slide. Normally I go through it quickly. But I think this is a bit giving the overview on the world and you see also the difference is the &#x2013; it's not homogeneous, but we see in the globe on this map is we see North and South America solid. I think we still see a good development of the business.</p>
          <p>When you take then Europe, if we take first that part, it's, yes, it's still not coming really where we would like be. We are still suffering from negative development. And I think if you take then Middle East Africa, we also this time a minus as we also see a softer South Africa. But on the other hand we take then the Asian part, yes, I think there we still also not sure are we know in the real plus. Okay, we see we're coming close and there's a minus on the year but a plus on the quarter, so it's still hanging. So a rather mixed view on the world today.</p>
          <p>If we take it more specific, Americas, like I already said, positive, strong on the industrial part, good on the construction equipment part. So that's good to see, but on the other hand, we saw a softening on the mining equipment that's mainly coming from our thermocol projects which are not coming as they were coming four quarters ago, so the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>South America, very solid, I'm going to say even good. And of course, it's always good to see if the biggest country in that continent does well and that's Brazil. So we had a good quarter in Brazil and, of course, at the same time, we landed two good orders for mining equipment.</p>
          <p>Europe, I'm now on slide number six, yes, sequentially a little bit improvement so we said, like you could say, you can be positive on that but if you look year-on-year, it's still down. We had, as it says there, good order intake on compressors mainly coming from three countries, Turkey, Russia and a bit of Germany, which was positive. All the rest was down. So again, a rather mixed outlook on that part.</p>
          <p>When we take then the mining equipment and then specific Russia that was really weak. It was really, yes, soft when it comes to Russia. There's a bit of the same explanation as given to &#x2013; when I was talking about North America. It's the cold story what made that amount weaker. And, yes, Africa I already mentioned it. It's softer in South Africa and on top of that, we didn't get any large order. So it made it then also not a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>Asia, aggregated, stable Asia if we look to the plus 2 for the quarter, but again, also makes South Korea, India, South East Asia, solid good development. So I'm happy to see that. But on the other hand, you see China which is, yes, still I don't know what we should read about it, but anyhow not in the positive field yet and mainly also this time due to weak orders for gas and process.</p>
          <p>Australia, although you see a minus 19, but those who are following us very closely would know that that we had a couple of very strong quarters last year and also at the end of previous year. And that is a little bit lower so we didn't get this very high big orders, but we have still a very solid business going on in Australia.</p>
          <p>Yes, more to say about slide number 8, if I take then the sales bridge currency minus on the year, it is zero. But we see a minus coming mainly, of course, from the Swedish krona. Price continues to innovate our products, create value for our customers, which also allows us to have, yes, enjoy also part of that benefit with some price increases. And as you see also the orders received and volumes were minus 4%. So bringing it a minus 4% coming a big part from currency as we also had a positive stretch run.</p>
          <p>Maybe I'll spend two minutes or a minute on the year. I'm very proud to see that we had the SEK 90 billion in the year. The total revenue increased with 11%. If you take orders received, it was 4% where 2% coming from structural change, so acquisitions and the other part from organic.</p>
          <p>We take it then by business area and now I'm slide number 11 and then I'm talking about compressor technique. Yes, a slight increase for industrial compressors, so that continues to give a bit of positive outlook on that part when we look to quarter four. But again as already mentioned, gas and process was soft. Maybe just to come back on the industrial part of our compressor business, it's mainly in North America and a little bit in Europe where we saw a positive development.</p>
          <p>Strong operating profit, I'm very pleased to see them and I would like to congratulate our guys in compressor technique, 24.2% operating margin. I'm very pleased to see them in that league and it's good that the investments in efficiency are also seen in the bottom line.</p>
          <p>When we talk the next slide and then I'm talking industrial technique, slide 12, where we saw a weakening of our equipment mainly coming from a softer Asia and a softer Europe, but a good North America. And that also matched what we saw on the compressor side so both businesses are doing well in the Americas.</p>
          <p>Strong development in aftermarket, so also that is keeping going on and it's also nice to see that our efforts are paying back. And the operating margin is around say the 22.2%, which I think is in line of our expectancies, giving our investments we're doing constantly intensifying our service presence and of course, not giving up our R&amp;D and releasing of new products.</p>
          <p>Mining and rock, excavation, already mentioned it in the beginning, a softer equipment. But if we really dig into details and really compare quarter three with quarter four, we see, yes, sequentially a flat development, which giving everything what you read about the mining part, is maybe not so bad. And okay, on top of that, we also got a couple of large orders in South America.</p>
          <p>Parts and service, again, same as I said in industrial technique, good development, pleased to see that growth in the operating margin, 23.8%, a very high level and congratulation to the organization. Even that we have lowered the production, as also we lowered the inventory and on top of that, that had a bit of headwind from currency. So I think giving all that, I think it's a good achievement for this quarter. And of course, we are very proud to see the latest acquisition, MEYCO, our Swiss company where we also were able to extend our product offer in the tunnel and in the mining equipment with our shotcreting equipment.</p>
          <p>Then we come to construction technique, order intake up. Who had expected that? But at least it's definitely there, 10% up. So that's very nice to see and coming from a very solid North America, but also posted Asia. And maybe if you recall last year quarter, it was tough in China. I think a lot of activities were stopped in the construction part and we see that creeping up from a lower level but at least it's positive. But unfortunately, this plus was compensated with a tough Europe.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, adjusted 7.1% so we have taken a couple of one-time items in restructurings as we are adapting our custom to the new level so that, unfortunately, that brings some one-time cost with it and, yes, it is what it is. And on the other hand also, as you know, this quarter is also a lower production volume so would also affect the profitability.</p>
          <p>But what's good is in this, we keep investing in new products, as you also see here on the PowerPoint on the slides. So we also have launched a new product, a new breaker. So that is good that we keep investing in that business and, on top of that also, we keep investing in the present, so we're really intensifying our market presence and we really invest in having the best offer to our customers.</p>
          <p>Group total and the profitability, I think you have seen all the figures so I don't think there's much to say. It's more or less in par with last year to the same quarter even if you do correction with the one-time items. So I would, by this, give this word to Hans-Ola.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ronnie. I would just add on a few questions on this slide and then take you through a few of the other coming slides. When we look at this one, we can see that what Ronnie hasn't touched upon already is the financial net which came in roughly at SEK 200 million negative, not too far away from the same figure for last year. The only difference, we had no capital gain this quarter like we had last year. Otherwise, they're rather the same.</p>
          <p>If we look ahead and there, of course, it's very difficult to judge any financial exchange differences, whatever comes on that score is highly unpredictable. But from an interest point of view, interest net point of view, something in the order of SEK 800 million of next year for the full year is probably the cost that one could expect.</p>
          <p>Then if we move further down the income statement, just a few comments on the tax, came in at 23.9% of profit before tax, almost identical to last year again. But this year, we had some one-times. We have about 3 percentage points positive impact from the fact that Sweden next year will move from 26% corporate tax rate to 22%. And recalculating some of the liabilities that we have in the balance sheet, it gives us one-time effect in the positive direction. On the other hand, somewhere in the 1 to 1.5 percentage point, we estimate from various negative impacts around the world of different, very difficult predict differences in timing et cetera.</p>
          <p>So from that, you arrive somewhere in the region of 26% as the underlying tax rate. If we look ahead and we see, of course, next year will benefit from this Swedish tax rate change. But that is, of course, not impacting the full group earnings. So we believe that positive will be roughly compensated or offset by some other changes around the world. Mix is playing a little bit against us. We earn more money in some of the higher tax rate environments. And so 25% to 26%, I would still keep as our assumption for 2013.</p>
          <p>If we then move on, I have to switch slide and I come to slide number 16, which is the famous profit bridge. If you look at this one, which is the full group for the full quarter for, you see the impact of the various headlines organic, of course, the big part. And we have their 29% so called flow through, what amount of profit we make from a certain change in revenue, which we believe to be relatively normal in a situation where we are right now.</p>
          <p>We have a slight negative when it comes to the effect from currency and then when you see the other impacts you can calculate backwards. Ronnie mentioned that if you take the one-time out items or let's say the non-comparables from a normal quarter out, our profit would have been 21.4%. But also to be honest, last year we had similar types of effects, so the comparison is 21.7% last year to 21.4%. So I would say that it's not very surprising and rather normal flow through.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the next one it gets a bit complicated. The situation we're in right now is that the volume growth is not dramatically negative and it's not dramatically positive. So of course, the percentage points that you see when you split it up per business area is rather strange, to say the least, whereas the group number makes a lot of sense.</p>
          <p>Compressor technique, building on Ronnie's comments, is better I would say. There is the efficiency that we talked about that is coming through and they also had a very strong good invoicing quarter. When we talk about the industrial technique, you can see that in spite of the investment in the organization which is, of course, then affecting the cost of building that organization, the invoicing in the quarter was about the same as last year and hence, there is a negative impact on the margin.</p>
          <p>And then mining and rock excavation, it's a little bit the same but here you see clearly that with the reduction of the order intake we've seen at the end of 2012 compared to the beginning and compared to last year, there is a lower production in the factories and hence, the flow-through looks rather meager in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And then construction technique, which as Ronnie had pointed out, is a little bit still in work in progress in terms of stabilizing the performance and, of course, they also should see that there were some issues on the comparables. But that's the comment when you look at it by business area basically.</p>
          <p>I move on to the next one, which is the balance sheet. A rather uneventful if you compare with last year's December, but for some cash generation, otherwise, rather similar. We are very happy that the last trend on working capital accumulation, and Ronnie touched upon it already, is seen that we are now in spite of the bigger volume we have in the group, we are back to the same type of inventory and receivables that we had already a year ago or even slightly lower.</p>
          <p>So, it signals, of course, a strong financial situation no doubt. Perhaps I can take the opportunity here also to again look into 2013. Some of you have seen on page 9 in the report that there are accounting changes going on in certain recommendations in the international accounting standards.</p>
          <p>And one relates to pension liability accounting. And next year, not in these numbers, but next year, you will see that there will be an accounting increase, an increase of the liabilities of about SEK 1.3 billion in the balance sheet, which is part of this figure here which is a one-time correction due to a change of calculation principles.</p>
          <p>A slight offset will be booked under deferred tax liabilities. So the net effect next year will be a one-time negative of SEK 900 million in the equity. It will have no impact more than very, very marginally on the profit and loss performance next year, however, compared to this year. I just thought it would be good to have that question.</p>
          <p>If we bake all this together, the income and balance sheet movements, we come to the cash flow and again I won't dwell too much. You see that the big difference between last year and this year is in the performance of the working capital in the quarter. And actually, even if you look at the year, you see the same thing, that the difference in cash from that line is explaining more or less all the difference in the operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>So I think, with that, I leave it back to Ronnie for some concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans-Ola, and this is the summary slide for the year 2012. And I would say, should I say a record year and then although again, so 2012 was again a very strong year for the company and if we look a little bit back, say, 12 months and start the journey, we see six strong months and I think the latter part of the year was softer.</p>
          <p>What we have been doing and still keep doing as you should not forget that Atlas Copco is a growth project and all the goals for sustainable profitable development tells us that we have a growth target of 8% over the business cycle. So we definitely keep investing in market presence, so densifying, entering into the market, get feet on the street, dig deeper into our service, value stream and, of course, lead with having the best products wherever we go.</p>
          <p>But okay, these are very good to have these three legs, but they don't bring anything if we are not top in operational excellence. So also this year we have taken a hell of a lot of initiatives in rolling out efficiency programs in manufacturing, in logistics. So, lean manufacturing becomes really our second nature and more should come, but we also have done it in administration where we also are giving high focus on efficiency and we keep doing that.</p>
          <p>If we then look to the results, SEK 90 billion and making SEK 19 billion operating profit so that's easy to remember. So that's great figures being first time in history about SEK 90 billion and an operating cash flow, given even that we have been growing in revenue 11%, even this company has been able to create an operating cash flow of more than SEK 12 billion, which I think is a real good achievement. And I think on the dividend, I really already mentioned it.</p>
          <p>And I would like to take also this time also to congratulate the whole organization. We have been doing very good, very fine, congratulations and it really comes from keeping focusing on our customer relations, on our service, on our product development and that is the secret of this success. It's only hard work and we already know there is always a better way. So thank you for that.</p>
          <p>So then I am going to, yes, I think if we talk about the earnings per share I think, Hans Ola, I think we don't need to mention more on that, that we only see it going up. I will go immediately to the near-term outlook. So as you see, the near-term outlook has not changed, when you look back to the quarter three announcement. So we still believe that our products and services are expected to decrease somewhat.</p>
          <p>So thank you, Hans-Ola.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken. Ronnie, to begin with, the organic order drop in the fourth quarter sequentially, when you had sort of a slight negative demand situation, was around 4%. Is that slide in your sort of wording? Secondly, on your outlook on slightly weaker demand, maybe you could try to specify that a bit by going through the divisions.</p>
          <p>And finally, a specific question on the mining side, we have seen sequential growth for the aftermarket despite sort of a flattish spare business. Maybe you could comment where do you see any sort of destocking in the spares and wares in the fourth quarter and whether that is expected to come back. I'll leave it with that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I get your first question. What was it organic drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really I mean, the outlook last time was a slight negative demand and we saw that. We saw 4% organic drop, I think, sequentially and you continue to have the same wording basically not saying falling off a cliff. But I just want to have your comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I didn't use that word, falling off a cliff. That's definitely not what our demand outlook says. But even like and that was the reason I also state during the presentation a little bit longer about, say, the globe when I explained that, it's rather a mixed view what I get. If I take it first geographically, I still expect a positive development in North and South America. Europe, I don't believe that that will be and if we go in the next months that we will see suddenly hallelujah development. I think I'm rather careful.</p>
          <p>And you have also heard me saying a bit when I was explaining a bit about Asia which the big question is and maybe the $20 billion question, what about China. I think my visibility and I think for many people today it's rather fluffy. January, February, Chinese New Year, last year in January now in February, okay, how do we compare? I don't see it really, really taking off. And so I think I would rather to wait another three months, so to see what it is.</p>
          <p>So, it's a bigger uncertainty what I have and that made me not seeing really the big orders coming. That is one. Second, if we then take it a bit by sector, I think I will start with the mining part. What we have seen over the year, last year now I'm talking, that we have six months very strong, but after midsummer, it was significant lower and you remember Q3. If you compare that sequential with Q1 and Q2, you would see and that was mainly in mining equipment. We seek sequentially the same level.</p>
          <p>I don't see any signals in the mining community what may be saying quarter one is going up. One should know, I don't know how many CEOs have been replaced recently in the mining business. That creates certain slowness because boards need to take decisions and new CEOs looking again to the CapEx. A lot of companies have run over the CapEx. So, I think they re-visit that. When you look a little bit on the long-term, I still believe in the commodities where we are. Copper, gold, iron ore, I still have a good positive belief in that and definitely there will be good orders coming.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your last question about, say, the aftermarket and I take quarter four, I think we all saw good parts and service business, and the mining, it went down as normal. What we saw is a bit softer consumable demand which what you also mentioned I think is a bit of a destocking. What I see now is a little bit you are a couple of days too early, give me the full visibility of January. But when we look to the orders coming into the factory, that didn't give the same trend that we were in a destocking situation, so I think it was again at a normal level.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Frederic Stahl from UBS. Could I maybe go back to China? I was just wondering if you could give more color on what you see on the industrial compressor side and then on the construction side in particular. And the second question if you could quantify the large orders you took in mining in the quarter. And then finally just housekeeping if you, maybe Hans-Ola could give us an idea of the currency impact in the first quarter. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The large mining orders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes I think when it comes to China and again, if we compare, the construction business in China was definitely, really if we take this same period last year, it was a mostly a standstill. That is definitely not the case anymore. I think we see the amount coming up but it's definitely not on the level where it was 12 months ago. But we see, yes, orders coming in. I don't use the word positive. It's positive of course, but I don't want to sound that rah rah, we are back in business there. I think it's still on the prudent development.</p>
          <p>When it comes to compressors, it's a bit of mixed view. I mentioned also what we see is the larger one, the gas and process and the larger turbo compressors and the big orders. I think that is not really there. Okay, you have them, but not at the same magnitude if you hint to my birds. I think they are really, say, not gradually positive, I would say, gradually positive. But now I'm really stretching me out of my comfort zone.</p>
          <p>But I think it's &#x2013; and it's difficult because the reason I'm so careful is because you see January, I would say December is always strange months and all that and you need to be very careful when to conclude on that, not to take your dreams for reality. But it's definitely not going further on that one. When it comes to the large orders, there were two. Now I have to look how much it was. It was 300, yes, so 300 was it around and that was mainly in South America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, then you asked about the currency situation. Well, we had still a negative in Q4 as you saw and it's primarily coming, of course, from the strengthening of the krona. Lately and very lately I would say, after December, but right this week basically, we started to see that the dollar is turning into a totally new level than what we have seen for a while. And it has also impacted some of the so called mining country currencies like the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, particularly the South African rand et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we will not have a very easy comparison from a currency point of view in 2013 to 2012. It's a bit early, but if I just take today's rate, it will at least be in the same level of comparisons that we have seen now for two quarters. I mean, Q1 compared to Q1 last year and Q2 last year. So if it stays like this, we will constantly have a little bit of a negative comparison. It will oscillate a little bit over time, but that's judging exactly where it is today. If the dollar moves up $0.30, $0.40, already that changes the picture again. So anyway, that's about how we see it today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is also, Hans-Ola, I think the euro/dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. We were glad when the euro/dollar were below $1.30 because we haven't been spoiled with that type of rate for many years and now we're already at $1.35 again. So the euro and the krona relatively weak is the best situation due to our exposure. But you can't get everything.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have stood here many, many years talking about currency up or down. And at the end of the day, it's the operating margin performance that is the only truth. And I think that the company has been capable of compensating quite a lot when there has been headwind and also used the tailwind to take further positions in the market. So I think that will be the case also going forward. Yep, I think we move over to the first two questions on the telephone line, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there, good afternoon, Ronnie and Hans-Ola. Just three questions from my side and I'm pretty sure you can guess the first one. Record cash flow in the quarter, record low net debt to EBITDA, and I'm just wondering in how we should think about capital allocation. And I know you don't have an official net debt to EBITDA target or guidance but whatever you're sort of aiming for, it seems to be trending down and so I was just hoping that you can give us some idea. For instance, if we have another sort of average year but with very strong and cash flow generation, should shareholders expect to see a bit more of that than just the ordinary dividend?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was just and related I guess, within which division do you see the sort of biggest opportunity for inorganic redeployment on capital if any at all? And then finally just one question, Ronnie, I was just curious about your comment on your canaries or what you refer to them as because within the construction division in the release, it seems to say that the increased order volumes were most pronounced for I think, amongst the other things, the portable compressors. So generally I think you referred to this as a good indicator that things are looking up but you now sound quite a bit more cautious than what we are reading in the release or likely start a little bit. That was all for me. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will probably need some help here from Ronnie with some clever comments. But when it comes to the capital allocation, yes, we understand your question. You are absolutely right. I just want to repeat that we have no fixed leverage target, debt to equity, or debt to EBITDA as you know. Of course, we believe that the company has not changed in any way since October to now. We believe that there is a strong cash generation capability in Atlas Copco based on the high profitability level et cetera, et cetera. So, that has definitely not changed.</p>
          <p>What we have always stated is that from a timing perspective of when that is allocated to shareholders, to acquisitions or to fewer organic growth building stocks when the demand is there et cetera, that is much more difficult to have a strong and a good answer to. So, the board has favored quite clearly a strong financial position as in the past and continuously. And we consider also the board, of course, Atlas Copco as a growth project, I think that was also the words of Ronnie in his initial comments. I think that your next question if I understood it well, if we then look at capital allocation opportunities and not organic, where would those opportunities be? Did I understand you right in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I think that I take &#x2013; Ronnie can elaborate a little bit on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think if and &#x2013; I think we have already met in several occasions and you have heard me answering your same question on that. I think there is no specific business area where I will exclude any type of acquisition. Of course, one can say and looking to say the achievement and the profitability level of some business area that you rather choose to invest in that part and in the other part. So if then I'm really more specific, well, I believe where I think it will be &#x2013; if you can talk a little bit about easy levels because it's not always easy to comment these areas and then I'm talking in larger tickets, it should be mainly in the area of the industrial scenery and then you come to city and you come in industrial technique. So that is where I believe the likelihood is a bit higher than it is in the mining side and on the construction side.</p>
          <p>I think the third question, you were starting to talk about the birds but then I got you mentioned to portable construction and I must say your line was rather bad so, I don't know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question was related to the comment in the report on construction technique that portable had in Asia a particularly good trend and that you sounded a little bit more cautious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think because that's maybe more, I think, a wording and giving more value to some words than orders. But I think when it comes to the construction part and if I repeat myself a bit, I think we saw in the quarter four compared to quarter four the same year, a positive development. You have seen that. Although if I look region by region, continent by continent, the European situation is rather difficult where I think the North America and I also believe also the Asian part and it's not only about China.</p>
          <p>I think we have many more regions with many more people than China in Asia where I see a slight positive development. But again, I am using slight because I have not really seen it really taking off yet. So I'm bit more prudent may be than the text says.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have another question on the telephone line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. James Moore of Redburn. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. It's James at Redburn. I've got two question, one on inventory. I see the balance sheet was down for inventory by about SEK 1 billion. I wondered if you could just say how much that was currency and how much it was real. I see the inventory to sales has come down 20.7% to 19.5%. Just trying to get a feel for how much whether you could quantify the impact on the EBIT from that destocking. And whether you could give us a forward-looking view as to whether 19.5% is a good level to think about for the end of 2013 or whether you have further ambitions.</p>
          <p>And the second question really I'd like to come back to the special dividend question. And can I take it from your answer that the board has favored a strong financial position, that the board rejected a decision to distribute further funds or whether you just didn't propose it to the board. And are you trying to signal that this is about M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We start from the bottom because that's probably a quicker answer. There was no intention of choosing of words, James. The board does favor a strong financial situation and the decision on the capital allocation outside the normal running of the company et cetera, of course, rests with the board and ultimately with the shareholders. So that's how it works. So that I think is on that one.</p>
          <p>Then you also asked about the inventory, I'll let Ronnie complement it, but I can say immediately that from a currency impact that explained the development in the fourth quarter you won't find very much. It was not much affected by that since we had little movement on currencies within the quarter. So it's really an impact of course of adjusting the purchasing of goods because we have lower order intake on certain equipment primarily in mining.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the impact of EBIT, we will defer that question. We have no meaning or wish to express a specific impact level. We have commented when we saw that margin development and the flow-through of mining in the fourth quarter, I think that's as far as we will go when it comes to what is normal or not. But the impact, of course, is there but to quantify it, we'd rather not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add to that, is the current inventory to sales level what we should consider as normal for the end of 2013 or 2014 or do you have an ambition away from that over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think let me answer on that part and, James, also in a couple of other occasions, we had been talking about that but when it comes to working capital and you have heard also me saying that, of course, we are striving to get a lower working capital over a more efficient working capital and that means working on the payables, working on the receivables and of course, on the inventory part.</p>
          <p>When it comes more specific on the inventory part, the main efficiency improvement, if I can express myself like that, should be found in construction technique and in the mining and rock excavation business area. There, we have still potential to improve our inventory and by implementing that lean manufacturing principle, also changing product design with moderate design which we are doing by the way in several divisions which we a couple of years ago acquired, but that takes a bit of time before it really been seen. But you should ask me maybe every six months where are you on that. I will definitely own you an answer or the organization owns you an answer in efficiency on that one.</p>
          <p>Maybe I would like to also elaborate a bit on the second question because that gives me the possibility to also bring it to the audience. We have increased the dividend with 10% and one should not forget that. We have really &#x2013; as the board have decided that, okay, this is what we do this year. We are a growth project. We work on that. Given the present circumstances, we have said that is how we go into the next coming year. That gives us on one hand a good shelter and on the other hand gives us also muscles if we need to do something.</p>
          <p>I'm not spreading any rumor. I am not hinting to anything. Don't try to find any sophisticated explanation in my wording. This strategy, this company is not changed today. It's still a growth project where we have the ambition to grow organically, as well as acquisitions. Some acquisitions where we had been looking for several years, maybe we have to look another for a couple several years. When that come, we will do our move. When they don't come, yes, we will not do our move. And there will be next year to, yes, if we need to distribute and to adopt the balance sheet we will do. But our promise to all the shareholders, we will not destroy value with the money.</p>

          <p>We'll take a question here in Nacka.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a question about compressor technique. A couple of years ago or a year ago you were talking about the hard work on gaining market shares and you said that I rather gain 1% on market shares that contained EBIT margin. Probably, we're not focusing on margins, rather on growth. If you look at the margin curve, it's been quite flat. So I wonder what about the market shares? Have you gained the market shares you wanted the organizations to do? And a second question on the same topic is within the compressor technique, can you talk a bit about the aftermarket and how that grow in compared to the rest? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know our situation when it comes to compressed technique. I think our market share over the world and also more local specific will not allow us to do big acquisitions and that also means, if we want to grow in that area, we need to gain market share and also do the transformation, so more from a fixed speed to variable speed, more integrated compressors, more value selling that we need to. And that is also the reason why we moved from a more indirect channel to a direct channel and densify the presence which you have me heard saying many times, and feet on the street and all that. We keep doing that and you see sometimes also when you look to flow-through, it does not look always as we would like but, okay, cooking cost money and that is something.</p>
          <p>When it comes then to results, show me the money, show the market share, I can tell you that we have &#x2013; if we take it in an aggregated level that we have gained market share. That does not mean that in certain specific micro markets that we have over there but circumstances have lost, but again, on the older hand we have taken our part on that one so that, for sure I can look deep in your eyes on that and say it this way.</p>
          <p>When it comes to aftermarket, this journey with a dedicated service organization in city we started end of 2007 so we are now becoming more and more in a maturity phase. I'm pleased to see that also now the second generation of management is bringing it really on a higher level, so we definitely increase our penetration and we are still not there at 100%. You can question why we're not servicing 100% of our compressors, our driers, our installation. That is question you can ask me every quarter. Have you improved on that? I think we should get better than that because that is low hanging fruit.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, we are developing more and more service products. We're also getting better on unbound logistics. If you remember what I said about operational excellence, we're doing a couple of projects when it comes to distribution centers so that we get more efficiency and really getting, yes, more out to the market.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we keep constantly moving from indirect to direct. That strategy, although that may be not so, say, the last 6 to 9 months, not so obvious because we have not announced many acquisition on that one, but that strategy is still valid and maybe it could be this year that a couple of more following on that point. We keep doing that. So that is because that is the winning strategy, densification, feet on the street, surface and the best product. So that triangle is and that yield, market share and aftermarket. So the strategy works. Can it be better? There is always a better way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Anders Roslund, Swedbank. I have a question about acquisitions. You mentioned specifically compressors and industrial technique, but you have very high market shares and by definitions those acquisitions can't be very big in size. Why don't you talk more about the mining and construction sectors or should we look for adjacent businesses in the industrial area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you were asking the question, I was writing down exactly that word. What I said is, I think you should &#x2013; and that was the priority what you asked, what's the likelihood, I think it's more on the, I think, in the industrial field. And of course, then you come close to the industrial technique, CT be on top. But of course, we cannot buy a compressor company. I think, that's for sure. It's really in the adjacent field. You remember a couple of months ago, we bought a very small company in Denmark. So in these areas, that is where we are also, yes, exploring the opportunities, that's the area.</p>
          <p>Does that say not in the mining, I'm not excluding. If you look now at the track record over the last three, four quarters, I think we have done significant on the mining side. And we do that, but of course, to have a larger one on the mining one, a big one and some there were rumors at a certain moment that one, I think that will be a bit more difficult. But who knows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So we'll take on the two questions from the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Andreas Willi at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time. The first question is on pricing in mining. Maybe you could split that into kind of the price increases you get for passing on salary inflation in some of your service businesses and how equipment pricing compares like-for-like maybe in the second half versus the first half of the year when the business was stronger.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the FX impact you talked about, you said it's going to be similar to what we have seen recently. I mean, in Q4, we had SEK 200 million. Looking at the translation impact alone, one can get to SEK 500 million, SEK 600 million for 2013. Does this mean we shouldn't expect, therefore, a more meaningful transaction impact or impact on the margins as we go through 2013?</p>
          <p>And the last one on acquisitions, I know it's difficult to comment for you looking forward. But if we look at the last four years, you've added just below 2% a year from M&amp;A. Given your balance sheet, your management track record, your cash generation, this looks quite a low number. Is this mainly because of limits on anti-trust or is it just because there are no targets out there at the right price or do you think M&amp;A, larger M&amp;A doesn't add any value to Atlas Copco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a rhetorical question. I think if I take the last one, I think, what we always have said, of course, we will keep doing on this close to home, nice extending the offer presence acquisitions. We will keep doing that and these are the 10, 20, 30, 50 million euro or dollar acquisition. These things we will constantly doing that.</p>
          <p>The largest one, I think we have not excluded that. It's just the matter when they fall, when they come and when they are, yes, therefore the right value because one should know, I think I'm not here the CEO to boost the top line. I'm here the CEO to create value for the company and that I think one should also take into account when we go after acquisitions. And that is also our guidance what we use on that.</p>
          <p>I would just &#x2013; and then Hans-Ola can take the FX &#x2013; on the pricing mining, I think I don't see much different behavior in 2012 in the beginning of the year as I saw at the end of the year. There is not much different in the way our customers are interacting with us. So that mainly stays at the same way. So I must say, I have not picked up any other trends than what I confirm now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood your question, you say that looking at today's currencies you could only by translation effects come to roughly SEK 500 million, if I heard you right. I think you're right, but it doesn't mean that there is no transaction effect that we calculate. When I explained it in the beginning, I talked about the most recent quarters having SEK 200 million per quarter something of a negative from currencies between translation and transaction of course. And I think that if we look at how it is today, that's about the trend that would continue into 2013. And so from that, yes, there will also be some transaction effects.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So we have another question from the telephone line, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Klas Bergelind at Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Klas from Nomura. James Moore asked most of my questions but I will try to rephrase one a bit. Looking at the inventory levels again, it sort of doesn't feel like you need to reduce your production levels much more from here. And my reasoning is really as follows. If you look at inventories to sales, they are now at the similar level as the start of 2011. Looking at your orders in MR and in CR, they are also at the same level and certainly in MR. So if demand is sort of flattish from here, it feels like this was the last destocking quarter either impacting margins. So that is my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on your construction orders. They were up quite a lot sequentially in North America and I'm just curious to see where was the step change? Was that in road construction or more towards commercial buildings or your non-res. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will take the last one first. I think it's, you know when we talk construction and in our business, we also have a significant market via the rental companies so we saw good development with our partners in rental. So that was a positive trend. But on the other hand, we saw also good development on the road part, I think, where we got a couple of good orders. It was not so mainly because we are not exposed somewhat directly when it comes to the housing part. Of course, that goes via indirectly. Of course, the rental companies are coming into that. But it's mainly say on the rental part where we saw a positive and then partly on the road one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your inventory question and what James asked, I must say I don't like so much your analysis because I'm going to say you undermined me a bit with my people that, because I think I &#x2013; of course, when you analyze it, I agree. On the other hand, what I said to James, I think we want to go for efficiency. I see still some opportunities in the mining and on the construction side and that's the reason why I said you undermine me, because I'm sure also my collaborators are listening in and they will use it, your analysis against me. So that's the thing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I know, I know. But I think one thing you should know, the business model of Atlas Copco when it comes to inventory is definitely an assemble to order flow. Why do we have more on the mining side? Okay, we have much more in transit we produce here in Sweden and we sell a lot to Australia. It takes time. They need to adapt this. So we need also to do a step change in improving the process and that is also what Bob, our business area President in mining is doing there, definitely changing the way we assemble, the way we handle orders, which will then improve the process and of course reduce the inventory. But that are called then as efficiency</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same is on the construction side where we also can do that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question, Ronnie, was more sort of on the production levels that would impact the margin. I know that you are mostly an assembler. So I was just wondering, are we going to see that sort of headwind also going forward in the first half? That was my question.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and that is also the reason why Hans-Ola didn't answer specific in money terms, the question from James. I think we should not see that, that we get suddenly an enormous under-absorption because we stop our factories for a month or whatever. I think we are not vertical integrated, so of course the higher the production, the more absorption you have and the more flow-through we had. I think we will not go from 100% to 0% when it comes to our production level. I think we will gradually adapt on the level, but we did a bit more in last quarter. And I'm sure Bob will do a bit more also in the coming two quarters. But I think we should not use that as a significant drop for our profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Hi, Ronnie. Hi, Hans-Ola. Ronnie, three quick questions on end markets to follow up. First of all on the question of market share gains in CT, can you give us your assessment of the materiality of your market share gains during 2012 and particularly if you could elaborate on the gain within industrial compressors in North America and Europe? Would it be fair to suggest that your market share gain there have been accelerated as you went through 2012, particularly given the restructuring and corporate activity that's currently ongoing at your two major competitors?</p>
          <p>And secondly on mining your comment that you see iron ore more positive in terms of order intake now. Obviously, at Q3, you were quite cautious as most were but have the development during Q4 changed your view on the outlook for 2013, specifically on iron ore and do you think iron ore equipment segment could grow for you in 2013 even if we see a pullback in iron ore prices to, say, $120?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on construction the good pricing development during the quarter 2012, is that primarily a result of a rollout of new products or a mix shift away from more challenged pricing environments and what should we expect going into 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll start with the last question to answer first. I think, of course, we are comparing also with a tougher &#x2013; weaker quarter last year. I remember that Q4 on the construction side was not strong. So that makes it a bit better. But on the other hand, we see also in the markets where we were traditionally strong and then I'm talking about say Brazil. I'm also talking North America. They are positive when it comes to construction. So that helps us. So we get a bit of continental mix or geographical positive mix, where on the other hand, Europe, especially when it comes to road construction, is rather weak. So that is a bit the way you should read it.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have been launching new models and we will do that also this year. So, it's not only just luck, what the guys have there. So, they're also coming up with new products and yes, we have to fight this upwards here and we need to fight this up here double, I think, when it comes to share and it comes to profitability. So, we still have some work to do.</p>
          <p>When I'm taking on the iron part, iron ore part, yes, maybe on that part, I'm a bit more positive than we were in Q3 and you remember all this announcement what was made and what will happen. I see now that the demand for iron ore is positive when it comes to even China, when you look to also to the States. So that is good. So I am a little bit more positive when it comes to iron ore.</p>
          <p>When it comes to real orders, I don't believe that it will come very soon for the noble reason like I already mentioned when it comes to decision makers who need to make the decision and, of course, they are still looking to their CapEx. So I'm a little bit prudent on that part. I am thinking more on the latter part of the year to see some positive movements than, say, next month.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to market share, one should know in that type of business, market shares are not sweeping 5% one year to another year. Here, you see market shares creeping up. Of course, what is going on into the market, I think, is definitely also an opportunity for us to be dynamic in that part of the market which we definitely do.</p>
          <p>We are really making sure that we go after each order as we used to do, but of course, if there is a little bit doubtness on the order, say, on the competitive side, yes, it always helps on that one. But I would not put too much value in on that part. I think the market share that comes really from the presence, the good work, I think having the best products, I think that is where most of the positive contribution comes from the market share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Ben Maslen at Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Ronnie. Hi, Hans-Ola. Two very quick ones, firstly, just on the mining business, could you just say how long the backlog is at the moment and what point would you expect the delivery volumes to turn negative if orders stay at the current level? And just maybe how that would impact the margin?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the gas and process compressor business, just it sounds very weak. Is that just kind of timing, certain projects being delayed or do you seeing a bigger change in that market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gas and process part, I think it's, yes &#x2013; these are larger tickets. Some orders fall in the quarter and then, I think you have either a very strong quarter and when they don't fall you have a bit of a weaker quarter. There are definitely some segments which are weaker. I think if you take about the air separation market, specifically in China where we were strong is a bit softer or is soft when it comes to new equipment. When, on the other hand, the energy markets, say, for fuel gas boosters, for geo-terminal installations is very strong.</p>
          <p>So it's just a matter of yes, when do we lend, which order that yes, and make it then a good quarter. So then I would not take too much value on that part when you are going in 2013 that one. Of course, I needed to say fourth quarter forward because it was definitely, yes, diluting the figures of CT and that's the reason why we also had to speak about this. When it comes to the orders on hand on mining, and then I am talking equipment, we can say that we have more or less two quarters equipment, orders on hand of equipment in the mining part.</p>
