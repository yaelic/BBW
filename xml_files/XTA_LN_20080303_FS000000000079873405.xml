        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation on Xstrata's Results for the Year Ended December 2007. I also like to welcome, as usual, those who are attending the presentation by the webcast or by telephone.</p>
          <p>I have other members of the Executive Committee as usual with us this morning and are familiar to most of you. With me at the front of the room is CFO Trevor Reid, Santiago Zaldumbide Executive Director and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc, Ian Pearce Chief Executive Xstrata Nickel, Charlie Sartain Chief Executive Xstrata Copper and Peter Freyberg who has since the 1st of January become the Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal, Peet Nienaber who is our Chief Executive with Alloys business, Benny Levene who is our Chief Legal Counsel and Thras Moraitis who is the General Manager of Strategy and Corporate Affairs, are others in the audience.</p>
          <p>Now growth and value creation continue to characterize Xstrata's performance in 2007, strong operational performance boosted by record production across much of the portfolio enabled the group to capture the benefits of continued robust markets, commodities and its key markets. And this strong operating performance, particularly in the second half, was achieved in the face of a number of unpredictable one-off operational disruptions during the year, and these included earthquakes in north Chile, a fire at the Isa zinc-lead concentrator, Collahuasi and Antamina SAG mill repairs, the Tropical Storm Noel in the Dominican Republic and torrential rain this year in eastern Australia and the load-shedding by Eskom as a result of the shortage of electricity in South Africa.</p>
          <p>The impact of these one-off incidence was offset by the Group strong operating performance and higher average commodity prices for most of Xstrata's products. Indeed prices and volumes also mitigated the negative impact of the weak US dollar against the majority of Xstrata's operating currencies. And the ongoing and significant cost pressures across the mining industry.</p>
          <p>EBITDA rose to some $11.3 billion, which is 56% and 7% higher than the previous year on a statutory and pro forma basis respectively. I actually think it is worth reflecting that the Xstrata's net earnings of $5.5 billion at the end of 2007, represents more than 10 times the market value of Xstrata from six years earlier, when we started along this odyssey of building for this company. And I think this demonstrated the successful execution of Xstrata's strategy and the delivery of superior shareholder value through growth.</p>
          <p>In the period since this IPO in 2002 to the year ended December 2007, the compound annual growth rate in Xstrata's EBITDA has been 100%. In other words, we have on average doubled our earnings every year. Primarily through making the right acquisition at the right time. And this compares to our compound annual growth rate in EBITDA of 36%, of the average of our diversified FTSE100 mining peers and demonstrates the significant momentum we have achieved in delivering year-on-year growth in earnings.</p>
          <p>Pleasing, EBITDA margins have also increase more rapidly than our peers, growing by 19% over this period compared to 14% for the average of Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton Anglo American. I think this clearly indicates that our businesses have constantly improved the quality of earnings, maintaining a tight grip on cost to deliver increased value to shareholders.</p>
          <p>The ongoing transformation of Xstrata's portfolio continued in 2007, with further progress against our strategic objective to, firstly to enhance the net present value of our operations including improved operational efficiency and productivity, reduced costs, mine-life extensions and mine plan optimization; to access, to seek meaningful entries into new commodities, to complete value-adding bolt-on acquisitions to Xstrata's existing commodity businesses, to develop the Group's industry-leading portfolio of brownfield and greenfield organic growth projects across its commodity businesses and to act as a catalyst for the industry evolution by pursuing transforming transactions.</p>
          <p>To look at these ones in detail, Xstrata's portfolio of assets continued to benefit from the acquisition or development of new, low-cost, high quality operations and a range of initiatives to enhance the net present value of our existing assets in this last year.</p>
          <p>Once again our businesses achieved an industry-leading performance in reducing real operating costs by less amount of $250 million from the cost base. This very pleasing performance marked the sixth consecutive year of real cost savings and demonstrates the significant transformation underway across Xstrata's asset base, as new, lower cost production is introduced and further productivity and efficiency gains are achieved at existing operations.</p>
          <p>Since 2002, Xstrata has reduced net operating costs, net real operating costs by an average of 1% per annum of the cost base, compared to an average increase in cost by 2% annually over this time period by our diversified mining peers, taking into account mining sector inflation in each case. So our vigilance on real costs has avoided higher fixed costs becoming embedded in our operations during the current period of extended commodity price strength, and has positioned our business to capture greater value on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>The value of existing operations has further enhanced during the year through the extensions to mine resources and conversions to reserves, leading to the consequent extension of mine lives and optimization of life of mine plans. Increased mineral resources have been confirmed at a number of operations and projects including Minera Alumbrera, Mount Isa, Lomas Bayas, Tampakan, Araguaia and Raglan.</p>
          <p>Additionally a substantial 28% increase in the resources base at Collahuasi, supports our plans to more than double production at this particular world-class asset. Xstrata Nickel published updated resource estimates for the tier one Raglan operation, adding over 4 million tons of resource to the 2007 Zone 5-8, the largest mineral zone in Raglan's history.</p>
          <p>Our strategy to establish Southern Peru as a major copper-producing region for Xstrata Copper has been robustly underpinned by the publication today of resource estimates, which indicate an increase almost 400 million tons or 31% in resources for the Southern Peru district.</p>
          <p>This comprises upgraded resource estimates for the Antapaccay and Las Bambas projects and the first resource estimate for the Coroccohuayco deposit and support Xstrata's copper strategy to establish the Southern Peru division as emerging major copper producing district for the Group.</p>
          <p>These further improvements to the reserve and resource life position of our operations has resulted in a portfolio, which compares favorably to the average resource life of our diversified mining peers, particularly in coking and thermal coal, copper and zinc. Our commitment to continues improvement in business is also reflected by continuous improvement of our safety record, which is supported by enhanced training programs and additional safety resources at site level. While emphasizing leadership and responsibility with Xstrata's developed and management model. The result of this investment and a further range of initiatives can be seen in a graph behind me, which shows a very significant reduction in the frequency of injury sustained at Xstrata's operation. The most marked improvements came from the former Falconbridge operations, where the frequency of all recordable injuries reduced by 33% compared to the previous year. Overall, Xstrata's total recordable injury frequency rate improved by 26%.</p>
          <p>And I have noticed in the past good safety performance and injury management is vitally important which of course, is vitally important in protecting our people and assets, but equally it's an important indicator of effective leadership and operational excellence. And so, it's very rewarding for me that Xstrata's uncompromising focus on safety and associated devolution of responsibility to each employee to protect themselves and their colleagues has so rapidly become embedded in a former Falconbridge and other acquired operations.</p>
          <p>Now, in August, Xstrata Alloys launched the next stage of its ambitions platinum group metals strategy, with an agreed offer for Eland Platinum in South Africa, building on the foothold established through the Mototolo joint venture. In addition to the Elandsfontein operation, which commissioned on schedule in October2007, the transaction has also provided Xstrata with the access to the contiguous Madibeng and Beestkraal reserves.</p>
          <p>These have been contemplated by the recent &#x2013; these have been complimented, at least, by the recent acquisition of the De Wildt property, adjacent to an up-dip from the open cast Elandsfontein operation, permitting a significant optimization of the mine plans of Xstrata's existing platinum properties and access to the Madibeng property. So these acquisitions have facilitated our meaningful entry into platinum during historically strong market and the fundamentals for this commodity remain very, very promising over the medium term.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions continued to be an important element of our growth strategy and core capability. As a result of the growth achieved today, each of Xstrata's five major businesses now has critical scale to compete for significant transaction in its own right, multiplying significantly the nodes from which growth can be delivered to across the Group. This capability was emphatically demonstrated through the completion of over $6 billion acquisitions in separate transactions in 2007 and in early 2008, following the recently successful conclusion of the acquisition of Jubilee Mines, a Western Australian nickel group, and of Resource Pacific, an Australian thermal coal producer.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's coal position in the Hunter Valley thermal coalfields has been strengthened through the acquisition of the Anvil Hill project and the remaining interest not already owned by Xstrata in Narama and Cumnock Coal. The acquisition of Austral Coal represents significant addition to our Australian coking coal business and its underground Tahmoor coking coal operation provide an additional 2.3 million tons of premium quality metallurgical product annually, as well as an entry into the southern coalfields in New South Wales.</p>
          <p>Now, we assumed management control of Tahmoor on 30 October and the operation contributed over 0.25 million tons of coking coal by the year's end. Critically, Tahmoor's coal is exported via Port Kembla, one of the few unconstrained ports in Australia. In December, as you know, we made an offer for Resource Pacific and, at the close of business today in Australia; we earned over 94% of the company and will start the compulsory acquisition process tomorrow. These acquisitions represent an additional 4 million tons of predominantly semi-soft production, together with 2.3 million tons of coking coal production annually from 2008, increasing our earnings exposure to coal at a time of record prices.</p>
          <p>On the 4th of February, Xstrata Nickel assumed management control of new Jubilee Mines, comprising of the operation of Cosmos mine, and a range of growth projects in Western Australia. These operations form a new division, Xstrata Nickel Australasia, with targeted production of 90,000 tons per annum by 2013, including the Koniambo project. Further significant growth potential exists from Jubilee's prospective land position and the former Jubilee team's historic exploration success in the region.</p>
          <p>Now these acquisitions will introduce immediate incremental volume growth in key commodities at a time of heightened demand, it's a sort of acquisitions that company should want to do. Equally important, each transaction also injects further near-term growth options into Xstrata's pipeline, which now represents over $30 billion of organic growth projects across each of our commodity businesses.</p>
          <p>In ferrochrome, installed infrastructure at Project Lion &#x2013; the Project Lion smelter supports two further phased expansions to bring annual production capacity to over 1 million tons using the energy efficient and proprietary Premus technology. In our national platinum business Elandsfontein opencast mine began production in late 2007 and is ramping up to reach 250,000 tons per month by the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The infrastructure at the operation has been designed to enable current annual capacity of 183,000 ounces of platinum group metals to be doubled. To achieve this, Xstrata Alloys team is planning the development of a 500,000 tons per month underground mine, with the first decline expected to be sunk in the third quarter of 2008. Work to double the capacity of the Eland concentrator will commence in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>The Eland acquisition also provided us with title over the Beestkraal prospecting area. This highly prospective property of some 11,000 hectares contains a potential 100 million ounce resource and a two-year drilling program will be initiated in the second quarter at a total capital cost of approximately $26 million.</p>
          <p>In total, Xstrata Alloys' ambitious platinum group metals strategy is targeting the production in access of 1 million ounces of platinum in the next decade to give us a significant industry position. And I think at this juncture, it's important to point out that the successful development of our major platinum business would not be the first time that Peet and his team has built a sustainable business from scratch.</p>
          <p>The ferrochrome business we own today consists entirely of assets built and run by Xstrata &#x2013; the Xstrata Alloys team in South Africa. From a standing start in 1988, Peet and the key members of his current team built a business that reached 1 million tons of annual production in around a decade and became the global leader five years later, with significantly lower mining costs than our competitors. I have every confidence that the entrepreneurial spirit and passion that drove this previous success will again result in the creation of an outstanding value-adding platinum business. Xstrata Coal continues to benefit from a broad range of brownfield, low cost expansion options across its portfolio. The new Goedgevonden and 5-Seam operations in South Africa commenced production in 2007 and will ramp up in 2008, further improving the overall cost profile of our South African coal business.</p>
          <p>Additional near-term growth will come from further expansions at Cerrej&#xF3;n in Columbia which will reach the 32 million tons per annum rate in 2008, with further growth in excess of 40 million tons currently being assessed. In Queensland, the addition of a second dragline at the efficient Rolleston operation has further produced &#x2013; boosted production from this asset, although first half production this year has been impacted to date by heavy rains and flooding.</p>
          <p>The brownfield developments of Liddell and Mount Owen will deliver an additional 5 billion tons to New South Wales division over the next five years. Further out, pre-feasibility studies are under way into the massive 1 billion ton Wandoan resource in the Surat Basin in Queensland, which is expected to deliver over 15 million tons annually and could begin production around 2011 markets conditions being appropriate. Further progress was made in 2007 in assessing and prioritizing Xstrata Copper's world-class portfolio of greenfield growth projects. In total, these projects will see Xstrata Copper projected to double annual cooper production progressively to some 2 million tons over the next five years.</p>
          <p>In December, the division and the engineering company Bechtel joined forces in a strategic alliance. This agreement secures access to scarce skills which is absolutely fundamental if you have done most a growth program and facilitate the timely and cost effective development of our copper project pipeline. Near-term growth will be achieved from a further increase in production at the tier one Collahuasi assets in 2008, as part of the ultimate strategy to double current production levels to 1 million tons annually at that asset. During the year, scoping studies also completed for the Frieda River and Las Bambas projects.</p>
          <p>I am particularly pleased that over 1.6 billion tons of copper resources have now been confirmed within the newly-established southern Peru division, comprising the Tintaya operation and the Antapaccay, Coroccohuayco and Las Bambas projects. This is a very positive development that should progressively add production of some half a million tons by 2013 from this division.</p>
          <p>The development of the southern Peru regions offers a potential to leverage infrastructure, processing and port facilities to maximize the value of these very substantial mineral resources. And it just underlines significant value that is been created by Xstrata Copper management from our acquisition of the basin Tintaya less than two years ago and from our original acquisition of the Las Bambas option in Peru less than four years ago.</p>
          <p>Tampakan in the Philippines, as you know, is one of the largest under developed -- undeveloped copper resources in the Asia-Pacific region. Since assuming management control in March, Xstrata Copper has dedicated considerable effort to community consultation and to improving environmental and social engagement practices. The extended pre-feasibility study is expected to be completed this year, with a comprehensive environmental and social impact study in 2009 alongside a full feasibility study.</p>
          <p>Our Nickel pipeline comprises of three-world class projects, Araguaia, Koniambo and Kabanga, together with significant brownfield expansions at that Nickel Rim South, Fraser Morgan, Raglan, and Falcondo. The $3.8 billion Koniambo project in New Caledonia gained Board approval in October last year and will deliver a tier one nickel assets with a world-class resource base, low cash costs and the potential to increase the life of operation to well over 50 years.</p>
          <p>Nickel Rim South, and Fraser Morgan mines commence production in 2009 and the Sudbury operations to increase production to 35,000 tons of contained nickel by 2010. Raglan's expansion to 1.3 million tons is really underway with further exploration work planned this year to support its expansion to over 2 million tons per annum by 2013. The expansion in zinc of the Mount Isa operations and the accelerated development of the Perseverance mine will deliver near-term growth to Xstrata Zinc and will optimize its existing assets.</p>
          <p>In Australia, 2008 will see the completion of the Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator expansion to a capacity of 8 million tons per annum. The successful completion of this project will see production increase to 440,000 tons of zinc effectively doubling output since the acquisition of MIM in 2003 for the moderate capital cost of $150 million. And may I add at this juncture it again is significant to note that at the time of acquisition of MIM in 2003 the plans by that management team were to close down the zinc operations at Mount Isa. And here we have a mine, which is going to last for many years to come at such a significantly increased rate for a very significant &#x2013; very insignificant capital or capital investment. And to supplement that we have the development of the Handlebar Hill mining project, which is going to be commissioned this year as well.</p>
          <p>The ongoing development of the open pit at McArthur River is on schedule, which is a great thing these days of mining projects many of them are not within McArthur River re-channeling on tracks to be completed in the second quarter of 2008. And a new Perseverance mine in Northern Quebec, Canada is ahead of schedule and will start production by mid 2008. Perseverance will have an annual production around about 228,000 tons of zinc concentrate and 35,000 tons of copper concentrate and will have a mine life of around about five years. These developments will further reduce our exposure to third-party zinc concentrate, enabling approximately 90% of the zinc concentrate process by our smelters to be supplied from our own mines in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now ongoing constraints in the rail and port facilities that comprise the Australian coal chain, particularly at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Newcastle port, continued to impact Australian producers' capacity to increase exports and led to extensive shipping queues. Consequently significant demurrage expenses were incurred by all producers and the cost to Xstrata rose to over $112 million, more than double the previous year's charges.</p>
          <p>In January 2008 an independent facilitator was appointed to resolve the issues that are currently restricting growth in the Hunter Valley coal chain. Any sustainable solution is likely to require two to three years to be fully implemented, however disappointment is a positive step and our coal business continues to work closely with relevant authorities to address this particular issue. In the meantime our operations continue opportunistically to fill any capacity freed up by production problems elsewhere. And I complement them on the way that they been able to do this.</p>
          <p>On the positive note, access to the unconstrained Port Kembla, has been secured for the Tahmoor acquisition that I mentioned earlier. Now in South Africa, the shortage of electricity has became acute in early 2008 necessitating emergency power cuts and outages across the country. In response, Eskom has implemented a mandatory 10% cut in the supply of electricity to the mining and beneficiation industry, to try and stabilize the situation in the near-term.</p>
          <p>For Xstrata, the most significant impact is on our ferrochrome business, which accounts for approximately 90% of our total South African electricity consumption. We currently estimate that restricted power supply will constrain ferrochrome production to approximately 85% of capacity for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Given the strategic important of domestic coal &#x2013; the domestic coal industry in solving the energy crisis. I expect that South Africa &#x2013; that our South African coal operations, the majority of which produce both coal for Eskom and coal for export, will remain relatively unaffected by the reduced electricity supply. And our team, of course, at Xstrata Coal is working closely with Eskom and the national government to assist in securing the supply of coal to domestic coal power stations &#x2013; coal-fired power stations to ensure that they can operate at full capacity.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to hand over to Trevor, who will take you through the financial results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As in the past, my team has ensured that the results announcement provides very comprehensive detail on our financial and operating performance. And consequently, I'll use the opportunity today to focus on the key factors that have helped to deliver another record financial performance for Xstrata in 2007. 2007 has indeed been another exceptional year and follows the strong performance in 2006. Group revenue from continuing operations rose by $3.1 billion to $28.5 billion. And with costs again well controlled, the Group continues to generate strong operating cash flows, with EBITDA rising to $11.3 billion, an increase of 7% over the previous year.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization were broadly in line with the prior year and consequently earnings before interest and tax rose by 8% to $9.1 billion. Minority interests declined, due to lower earnings from Alumbrera as that operation commenced full payment of profit royalties to our local Argentinean partner.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate before exceptional items and discontinued operations remained consistent with 2006 at 29%. Higher taxes from profits earned in high-tax jurisdictions, particularly in the locations of the nickel operations, were offset to some extent by the recently announced reduction in the Canadian corporate tax rate and one-off deductions that were related to the Falconbridge acquisition.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's effective tax rate, together with the annual synergies achieved through bringing acquisitions within our financial structure, continues to demonstrate the substantial benefit of our Swiss tax domicile, even in times of high profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, taking all of that into account, earnings attributable to shareholders increased by 13% to over $5.5 billion or, on a per share basis, $5.78.</p>
          <p>At this point, I usually provide some guidance as to my expectations for next year's tax rate. Given the positive outlook for the business and earnings in 2008, I expect our effective tax rate to rise modestly to around 30%.</p>
          <p>Higher commodity prices for virtually all of Xstrata's commodities were again the main driver of improved earnings. Primarily as a result of a 45% -- 54% rise in average nickel prices year-on-year, which peaked at over $54,000 per ton in May, EBITDA from our Nickel business increased by some $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion. Now, to put this in context, this result from our newest commodity business outstripped the entire Group's reported statutory EBITDA in 2005.</p>
          <p>The performance of the Alloys business was also buoyed by rising prices for ferrochrome and platinum, which increased by 25% and 17% respectively. We have big ambitions in platinum, as Mick outlined. And while this initiative is in its infancy, we are pleased to be participating in the current PGM price boom through the Eland acquisition, which started contributing PGM ounces from December, and the Mototolo joint venture, which is now ramping up to full production. Copper prices increased on average by 6%. However, Xstrata Copper's result for the year was negatively impacted by approximately $100 million as a result of provisional price settlements in 2007 from 2006 sales. Earnings were also impacted by lower head grades at Mount Isa and Alumbrera, continued mining inflation cost pressures and the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>The Xstrata Coal results reflect this business' exposure to the stronger Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, together with the impact of increased demurrage costs at Australian ports and the ongoing industry-wide cost pressures. Together, these factors outweighed higher volumes and stronger thermal coal prices. Spot prices for both coking and thermal coal rallied strongly in the last quarter of the year, off the back of ongoing infrastructural supply constraints, poor weather conditions and strong demand growth. I'm pleased that this rally has continued into the New Year and it provides a backdrop that augers well for the forthcoming contract negotiations. The Zinc business was also impacted by mining sector inflation across the industry and a weaker U.S. dollar, together with flat year on year average zinc prices.</p>
          <p>The significant contribution of higher nickel prices, which on their own accounted for an increase of nearly $1 billion, underpinned a $1.3 billion increase in Group EBIT across our business units. It is, of course, pleasing that Xstrata's diverse portfolio of businesses provides us with such a broad exposure to rising prices. However, the operating performance of our teams on the ground remains our shop window. We consequently continue to strive to improve the productivity and cost efficiency of our capital base across all our businesses and, in this regard in 2007, we were able to achieve real cost savings of some $253 million.</p>
          <p>While these cost improvements were achieved through a concerted top to bottom drive for efficiencies, they were stimulated by the commencement of new, lower-cost production from the Rolleston and Wollombi coal operations and the Lion ferrochrome smelting complex, also improved product recoveries in Xstrata Zinc and operational efficiencies at the Alumbrera and the Australian copper operations.</p>
          <p>Strong volume growth, driven by record production levels at Xstrata's Coal, Nickel, Ferrochrome and Platinum businesses, contributed almost $250 million. It is also noteworthy that, as Charlie forecasted six months ago, the Copper business recorded a very strong performance in the second half, recovering substantially all of the production shortfall in the first six months. The inflationary headwinds that beset our industry in the first half continued through the second period and the full-year impact of mining and CPI inflation reduced earnings before interest and tax by $481 million. The shortage of key input manifests itself not only in increased costs, but also in severe operational challenges that continue to threaten production capability. And we have seen the significant impact that unforeseen disruptions have had on the global supply of commodities.</p>
          <p>In the light of these challenges, our solid volume and cost performance is all the more impressive. Now, the U.S. dollar weakened significantly against the majority of our operating currencies and the impact of this reduced earnings by $457 million. Depreciation and amortization was broadly flat, but did increase modestly due to higher production volumes, which accelerated the D&amp;A charges, and the commencement of the amortization of our entitlement in the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa. And corporate social involvement expenditure increased by $33 million as programs to support community initiatives were extended across the former Falconbridge operations.</p>
          <p>As you would expect with such a robust earnings performance, cash flow in the period was commensurately strong, with cash generated from operations rising by $1.7 billion to over $11 billion. The cash tax payments of $3 billion included payments in respect of the former Falconbridge business for tax years that predated our acquisition of this Group. Net interest paid of below $700 million is more than 30% lower than in 2006, as we continued to reduce average debt levels through the year. And after funding expansionary CapEx of $1.4 billion, free cash flow from the Group was very robust at $4.6 billion.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, Xstrata's diversified portfolio of operations provides us with earnings exposure to a broad basket of commodities. Notwithstanding the fact that average commodity prices in 2007 were, on the whole, higher than in the previous year for the majority of our products, tight supply conditions and continued robust demand from emerging market economies have supported a further rise in prices. As you can see on the screen, not only our significant exposure to &#x2013; you can see on our screen, not only our significant exposure to both thermal and coking coal, which are both enjoying record prices, but also the propitious timing of the coal acquisitions that Peter and his team completed in 2007. The copper market, which has become our largest business following the Falconbridge acquisition, has also seen a surge in prices. First quarter revenues from copper sales will also benefit disproportionately as concentrate sales concluded in the last quarter of 2007 will be priced against far higher quotational period prices in 2008.</p>
          <p>Ferrochrome and lead prices are at levels significantly above those received last year and, while nickel and zinc prices are trading below last year's record levels, they have surged over the past weeks.</p>
          <p>Expenditure on capital programs increased to $2.9 billion in 2007, including $1.4 billion of expansionary capital expenditure, as the Group advanced its extensive portfolio of growth projects. Xstrata Nickel accounted for the largest allocation of expansionary capital following the approval of the Koniambo project in October. Further spending was incurred on the highly prospective Kabanga and Araguaia greenfield projects, together with expenditures to accelerate the Fraser Morgan mine to commence production next year. The Nickel Rim South project continues to advance towards its date of first production in 2009 and both ventilation and production shafts were completed in early 2008, as you can see from the picture on the front of your presentation pack, which demonstrates the headgears to those two shafts.</p>
          <p>Now the Nickel Rim ore body benefits from significant PGM and copper by-products. And at current prices for platinum the operation will product nickel at a very substantial negative cost. Sustaining capital expenditure rose to $1.5 billion, and as always the differentiation between sustaining and expansion in capital is a gray area, as many of our sustaining programs also include initiatives, which while sustaining in nature will further, improve the cost profile, efficiency and lives of the operations. And which have historically enabled increased productivity and volume growth. Significant investment was also committed to improve the safety, environmental performance and efficiency of the former Falconbridge copper, nickel and zinc operations, where we continue to deploy capital to catch up on investment programs that were delayed or suspended while Falconbridge was involved in various take over processes.</p>
          <p>And a good example is the refurbishment of the Raglan port facilities and the rebuilding of the Arctic MV icebreaking vessel, which we undertook last year. Both of these projects have been included as sustaining expenditure, but will also facilitate the planned expansion of the Raglan operations in the future. Given the ongoing investments in initiatives to support growth, improve efficiency and enhance productivity across our operations, including capital at the bolt-on acquisitions, which we completed this year, I would expect sustaining capital expenditure in 2008 to remain at a similar level to that of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our recent acquisitions of Eland, Jubilee and Anvil have added further growth projects in platinum group metals, nickel and thermal coal to our pipeline, and boosted the total quantum of planned capital to over $30 billion. Together this pipeline is expected to deliver in excess of 12% compound growth in volumes over the next five years. Our growth portfolio is balanced roughly between near term lower risk and lower cost brownfield expansions, and major new greenfield projects, which are diversified by commodity and now spread across 11 different geographies.</p>
          <p>Over $12 billion of projects have already been approved and are currently being developed. And in 2008, major investments will be made in the Goedgevonden open coal &#x2013; open cut coal mine in South Africa, the Tampakan copper gold project in the Philippines, the Koniambo nickel project in New Caledonia, and the expansion of the Collahuasi copper mine in Chile, and, of course, the Nickel Rim South operation in Canada.</p>
          <p>In total, in 2008 I expect expansionary capital expenditure levels to rise to $3.7 billion brining total capital expenditure to over $5 billion in this year. As we foreshadowed at the time of the time of the acquisition we have completed the strategic review of the Falconbridge aluminum businesses. And those businesses were divested for $1.1 billion. During 2007, we continued to expand and improve our portfolio of assets through targeted bolt-on acquisitions, and Mick has reviewed the extensive acquisition activity during the year, which led to a total cash outflow in 2007 of some $2.1 billion. Now that amount excludes the Jubilee and Resource Pacific acquisitions, which will only settle in this financial year.</p>
          <p>In August, following the fall in global stock markets, we opportunistically reactivated our equity capital management program, and repurchased 9.3 million shares or 1% of our issued share capital at an average price of &#xA3;27.67 per share, returning over $0.5 billion to shareholders. As always these shares remain available for resell to fund growth initiatives in the future. Despite these cash outflows, and after payment of dividends and the redemption of convertible borrowings robust cash generation from operations enabled the Group to reduce net debt by $1.6 billion in 2007, to bring the overall net debt level of the company to just under $12 billion at year end, and our debt to debt plus equity gearing ratio to 32%.</p>
          <p>Off the back of a strong investment grade credit rating the Group continued to diversify its sources of funding during the year, commencing with an inaugural multi-tranche euro bond offering, which raised &#x20AC;1b in June 2006. This, combined with cash flows, allowed the final $9.5 billion tranch of bank debt, associated with the Falconbridge acquisition, to be refinanced with a new five year syndicated bank loan of $4.6 billion on significantly improved terms and conditions. In November a second U.S. bond offering was successfully completed with the issue of $0.5 billion 30-year bond, which further extended the Group's average debt maturity profile.</p>
          <p>Further committed bank bridging facilities totaling $3.5 billion have now been secured to fund the acquisitions of Jubilee Mines and Resource Pacific. Xstrata continues to maintain a progressive dividend policy in which we take account of the underlying growth in earnings of the Group, while seeking to progressively <mark type="inaudible" /> cash returns to shareholders. We generally pay interim and final dividends in the approximate ratio of one-third to two thirds of the total annual dividend.</p>
          <p>In July 2007, the Board approved an interim dividend of $0.16 representing a 38% increase in the rights adjusted comparable 2006 interim dividend. And now the Directors have proposed an increased 2007 final dividend of $0.34 per share, amounting to $326 million. This brings full year dividends to $0.50 per share, which is a 20% increase on the comparable distribution in 2006.</p>
          <p>Now that brings me to the end of the financial section. Thank you very much for your attention. And I will hand back to Mick for his concluding remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There is currently much debate about the extent to which the expected slowdown in the United States would impact GDP growth in China and consequently the global demand for commodities. Now, while the slowdown in the United States now seems probably, well highly probably, with likely negative consequences also for short term growth in OECD countries, I expect that any impact on Chinese GDP growth and emerging market to market commodities, including metals, to be muted.</p>
          <p>Now a lot of debate has been held about the decoupling of markets. But rather than decoupling global financial markets, financial markets are becoming deeper and more integrated as cross-border capital flows and increasing open and wealthy emerging markets lead to ever closer global financial integration. A decade ago the U.S. was the undisputed central hub for global trade and financial flows, and the U.S. dollar was <mark type="inaudible" /> factor of the global currency. High savings rates and budget surpluses in many emerging markets, most notably China, imply that new financial hubs are developing in Asia.</p>
          <p>Europe's growing influence as a financial center, and Asia &#x2013; and an Asian trading partner, and the mergence of the Middle Eastern countries are significant international investors has further reduced the global financial systems dependence on the United States. So together with the ongoing growth of global financial assets this diversification of risk through increasing integration should lead in time to in fact more stable global financial markets.</p>
          <p>So while the financial markets are integrating, as the physical demand for metals and energy and other commodities is decoupling from the U.S. and other OECD countries. Chinese GDP growth rate is increasingly driven by the combination of rapidly accelerating domestic demand, and ongoing investment, rather than export led growth. With China's urbanization ratio approaching 45%, rapid income growth, high savings rates and the urbanization of around 15 million people annually, the bulk of Chinese demand is driven largely by these internal factors.</p>
          <p>Furthermore exports from emerging Asian countries to China now exceeds exports from those countries to the United States. On the other hand only half of U.S. imports are sourced from emerging markets. It would certainly be naive to claim that this commodity demand is entirely impervious to severe slowdowns in the U.S. and other OECD countries. But the significance of internal growth in China and other emerging economies is likely to offset knock on effects to a large extent.</p>
          <p>Given that exports now account for less than 25% of Chinese GDP with only a small proportion going to the U.S. a 2 to 3% reduction in the U.S. GDP is expected to only to impact Chinese GDP by less than 1%.</p>
          <p>So looking beyond the current uncertainty relating to the U.S. economy its now broadly accepted that we have entered a period of secular change in demand for commodities, driven by the industrialization and urbanization of two thirds of the world's population. These drivers of growth are underpinned by substantial infrastructure investment in these emerging markets, estimated over $20 trillion over the next decade. To put this into context, China is building the equivalent of a new Australia every year in terms of the infrastructure required.</p>
          <p>Rapid reductions in U.S. interest rates, as well as proposed fiscal remedies, has already signaled central banks willingness to avert a severe slowdown, and all the where I think for a subdued reduction in the demand for commodities in OECD economies. And I believe that the medium term outlook for commodities is further strengthened by a return to growth of the Western economies in the next two to three years. Investment in ageing infrastructure in Western Europe, and indeed in the United States, which is set to increase, and in the U.S. itself has earmarked over $1.6 trillion of infrastructure investment over the next five years.</p>
          <p>So these factors will renew Western world demand for metals. And together with ongoing investment of petrodollars in the Middle East, will fuel a period of synchronous demand growth across the globe for commodities. Expectations are for this demand growth to outpace even that evidenced in 2003 and 2004, which lead then to the significant rally in commodity prices. The real evidence of this thesis, this decoupling thesis can be seen in continued strong demand for all our commodities. China is now a net importer of coking coal. With the removal of import duties I expect that China will remain a net importer for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Strong demand in other BRIC countries for coking coal is set to continue, and will exert pressure on a really very tight market. The recent flooding in Queensland has severely constraint hard coking coal supply, which will not be recovered this year due to ongoing infrastructure constraints. Consequently, Queensland's coking coal exports could drop by as much 10 million tons in 2008. Current spot prices are in excess of $300 million per ton. And any good news out of this aside from the price is that Xstrata's production has been less severely impacted than others. And so together with the additional coking coal from our acquisition of Tahmoor, we will benefit a great deal in the current climate.</p>
          <p>In thermal coal, China end of the year has a marginal net export of 2 million tons compared to 25 million tons in net exports in 2006. I do not see this trend reversal. Robust demand and constraint supply in this specific market have now driven new cost of spot prices above $130 per ton. These strong fundamentals have resulted in South African coal be redirected from the Atlantic to Pacific markets for the first time, I think, something like 14 or 15 years. Strong global stainless steel growth is also set to continue, at over 10% for 2008, driving demand for ferrochrome. Following a period of de-stocking, demand for stainless steel in Europe and America has started to recover in the first quarter of 2008, albeit at a slower rate than a similar recovery in China. Supply side constraints on the South African ferrochrome producers as a result of the <mark type="inaudible" /> power outages are expected to result in supply deficit for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>As a result record contract prices for ferrochrome are being negotiated in the first quarter of 2008, with the first quarter European benchmark price set at $1.21 U.S. cents per Pound. So much for our exposure to bulk commodities. Turning to our base metals businesses, the copper price has strengthened in recent weeks. Demand growth remains high at around about 4% per annum. China accounts for a quarter of the global demand, and imported around about 4.5 million tons of copper in 2007, a 25% year on year increase with double digit growth expected to continue for 2008. And indeed now accounts for over 90% of global copper demand growth.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the risk on the supply side is very high indeed. Mine disruptions resulted in a record amount being lost in 2007, in 2007 relative to projections, representing 5% of global supply on slower than expected ramp up of brownfield projects, strikes and technical problems and other factors. Copper concentrate is expected to be in deficit for a number of years. And at five days consumption, exchange stocks are at critical levels and will continue to support a strong pricing environment, driven by a fundamental support of supply-demand outlook.</p>
          <p>Now as Trevor said nickel price has spiked at record levels in 2007 on the strong demand growth. And this subsequently flattened over the course of the year at about 1.4 million tons. The demand slowdown was attributed to the substitution of primary nickel &#x2013; by nickel and pig iron production, as well as a period of de-stocking by stainless steel producers.</p>
          <p>However, this year demand is expected to be strong from both stainless steel producers and other users of nickel. Scrap discounts have narrated the traditional level of 10% as supply tightens. And pig iron production is forecast to be curtailed to 100,000 tons in 2008. But its high production costs will nevertheless continue to underpin the fuel of the nickel price. Demand for global refined zinc on the other hand rose by 4% during 2007 to 11.6 million tons. Strong growth in many of the world, many of the developing world economies, particularly China and India, helped to offset slower consumption in North America and Europe. In China galvanizing requirements continued to grow rapidly, mainly driven by the strong construction and motor vehicle sector, consumer goods and urban construction. And China, unsurprisingly, is now the third largest producer of motor vehicles. Chinese power constraints I think could lead to a fundamental shift towards a net import position by late 2008 early 2009 of zinc metal.</p>
          <p>And strong zinc demand is also being witnessed from Brazil and Russia where the construction industry is beginning to benefit from high government spending on infrastructure. Supply and demand I think will be in balance in 2008, but LME stocks apparently at historically low levels of consumption, indeed around about four days. I, therefore, think that zinc has been over sold at current levels.</p>
          <p>So our bulk and base metals business seem to be very well positioned. And over the next few years this position will be augmented by our growing platinum business, as that metal is also likely to outperform for a number of years. So, in this environment industry consolidation, which is a trend we foresaw our some years ago, as we set out to play a central role in the industry's transformation into a global industry. And I think it will comprise in the future, as I said before, of a large number &#x2013; or a small number at least of large diversified players with more stable cash flows, and the ability to deliver superior returns over the cycle.</p>
          <p>In this regard Xstrata has pursued both value adding bolt-on acquisitions and transformational transactions. And the &#x2013; indeed the momentum for consolidation in the global mining industry I think has undoubtedly accelerated following the announcement of an approach by BHP Billiton for Rio last year, and the subsequent formulization of an offer in February. Now in this respect you all know that we've been in discussions with Vale. And it is possible that these discussions may result in an offer for Xstrata serving before my Board. And there has been a great deal of speculation in the media about the nature of these discussions. So, what can I say to you? Well I can say to you that I can offer no further comment.</p>
          <p>But I can say that throughout Xstrata's rapid evolution into diversified mining &#x2013; global mining major; Xstrata's management team and the Board have consistently focused on the value proposition for shareholders. And this passionate and rigorous assessment of value remains the key consideration for any transaction we continue to assess, as we continue to assess a range of opportunities to achieve further success in delivering superior value to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So to summarize the fundamentals and price outlook for Xstrata's commodities remains positive, even in the short term as demand is underpinned by China, India and other emerging markets, and reinvestment in the infrastructure in the Western World. Additionally supply constraints are expected to prevail in most commodities. Xstrata, therefore, enjoys a powerful momentum, and is ideally positioned to maintain its record of success by delivering against our strategy, by delivering growth and NPV enhancement, transforming our portfolio, delivering growth through our leading internal pipeline and external strategic options, and participating in the exciting evolution of our industry.</p>
          <p>So this concludes our formal remarks of the presentation. You might have thought that it is long, because it's a silly battle to prevent you from asking questions about Vale. But we no longer need to be pestered about that given my inspired comments about the transaction. But nevertheless we will be happy to take all your questions. So please feel free to ask. There are microphones in the audience, so if you just want to put up your hands we will take the questions.</p>

          <p>Jim Lennon, Macquarie. I just wanted to ask about the ongoing negotiations on coal, both coking coal and thermal coal. There have been press reports that you've offered $210 for a hard coking coal into Japan and around about $130 for thermal. Have there been any progress on those negotiations? And what's likely to be the timetable for the outcome?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll pick that up. Negotiations are underway, but those numbers are not exactly correct. The spot market for thermal right now is about 130. But coking coal spot currently runs at about 330. And those are probably better indicators of where we will settle.</p>

          <p>Jason Fairclough of Merrill Lynch. Just a quick question I guess on power. And as much as the South African power situation is &#x2013; I won't say it's taking people by surprise, because we had lots of warning, it's still sort of reared a pretty ugly head. Could you maybe talk a little bit about power in some of the other regions where you operate? And in particular Chile is a region that comes up again and again as a potential region of concern here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Charlie do you want to --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, in relation to Chile, there's been a crisis situation I guess for at least the last 12 months in Chile, and now that has given sufficient time, I think for the mining industry to put in a response to that. The initial response has been to convert the gas fuel generating capacity there to diesel. And really that's resulted in some of the cost increases that we are seeing in the industry. There is sufficient generating capacity in Chile, I think, which is one of the distinguishing features of it compared to other regions in the world. At the moment, it is more a question of the cost of the fuel to generate the power. But there's no doubt that Chile is going through a fundamental shift in its power mix, and will go almost entirely away from gas dependency on Argentina, and will progressively introduce fuels such as coal into the energy mix over the next two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Sam Catalano from Macquarie. A few questions actually. First of all just on the zinc strategy; clearly the mine production growth in the near term means that you're close to a balanced position, but longer term in the Lennard Shelf and then Perseverance are relatively short mine life, Brunswick is set to exhaust early next decade. So just wondering what the strategy is with regards to the smelting assets there? And two, further questions on coal; do you have an estimate for roughly what your production losses might be in the first half out of Queensland as a result of the flooding? And secondly, what's the status of the, I guess the infrastructure linked to the Surat Basin with regards to Wandoan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can we -- if we handle the zinc question first. I mean I think that you mustn't missed out from the fact that there is significant growth potential still in Mount Isa and we see that as a major zinc-producing province for us and growth province for us going forward. But Santiago, I don't know if you've got any particular comments you want to make on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will &#x2013; going to comment on what you have said. In Mount Isa potential is still very good. This year we are planning to have an increase of production of about 30% over last year. At the end of the year, as Mick explained, we are supposed to produce about 8 million, so it will be an additional increase in our mine. The Perseverance project is going to offset about 50% of the Brunswick mine production and potentially that mine still has close to four years to go. So I really don't see any threat in that strategy. And I think we will maintain levels of vertical integration close to 90%, and realizing that's what we wanted to achieve. So I don't see any problems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. On the two coal questions, perhaps, Peter will just remind me of your production and the infrastructure around the Surat Basin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The early indications on the losses are about 1 million tons of coal out of Queensland. We've lost about 6 million bank cubic meters of overburdened stripping, and we're continuing to assess that. It's been raining as recently as last weekend. But our operations are on fairly good position and we've introduced additional stripping capacity, so there may be some potential for closing that gap. At the same time with that rain some of our underground operations that are well positioned at the moment have taken advantage of spare roll capacity that exists. And in fact we've been able to boost exports from Oaky Creek as a result of other producers not being able to come to the fore. The development of the threat link will be ultimately phased in with development of any mining production in the Surat Basin. And as we mentioned earlier on Wandoan we are expecting market conditions permitting to be somewhere around 2011, so there will be time for that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi it's Justin O'Brien from Citigroup. Just a couple of questions, the first is could you give us an update on any progress that's been made on the synergies in the Sudbury Basin, or any further thoughts on unlocking those synergies? And the second thing is you couldn't remind us of what the benefits you see of having Glenco as your agent to marketing your metals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me deal with the second question at first and then I'll ask Ian to handle the synergy issue. Well I think the benefits are obvious, Glenco was the &#x2013; is without doubt the finest marketing and trading group in the world, it has an enormous reach in terms of office and in terms of market capacity. And the shareholders of Xstrata have benefited immensely from that. Now I think it is a misconception to think that Glenco actual markets all our metals. We have an agency agreement in alloys. We have our own core marketing team in alloys that participates in all those discussions. We have an advisory agreement in coal we essentially market our own coal. They've had a distribution agreement in nickel where we've concluded, I think, an outstanding contract with Glenco where they take our nickel effectively from the mine gate; they guarantee us the element price obviously. But the average premium that Falconbridge has managed to earn over its sales over the last few years. And we've entered into a sharing agreement with them for anything they achieve above that premium. And so as far the Xstrata is concerned we feel that we have someone who bears the burden of the working capital, bears the burden of the distribution and we bear the advantage of the guaranteed economics and the potential to participate on the upside.</p>
          <p>So I think that the advantage is obvious. And I recall well in 2004 when the industry settled the coking coal prices at a modest 40% odd increase I think over the previous year and because of the advice from Glenco we settled at well over 100% increase. And I think that in itself is testimony of the value that Glenco play in our marketing and trading arrangements. And I think there is no doubt in my mind that ongoing involvement by the worlds best marketing and trading team in this part of our business is going to value adding for our shareholders. So having answered that question, perhaps we can return to the issue of the synergies at Sudbury.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks Mick. As you know the synergies that we have worked on had covered four areas where we saw opportunities, and those four areas had been well advanced last year. But it does require both parties to agree to putting those assets into the mix, and also sharing in the value. So as you can imagine with what's going on right now we are basically on hold until we know where we go towards the talks, and then we will be able to progress it once we understand what's going on there.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the ferrochrome, given the ongoing power problems in South Africa, what is the prospect of further expansions with project Lion from 2010 onwards? Is that likely to be threatened by the ongoing power shortages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is obviously yes in the sense that we have to gain certainty that we will have power to flow through the connections. I mean the connections to the Eskom system are guaranteed that project has been approved both by Eskom and ourselves and there is no difficulty in getting ourselves hooked up. What we have to be sure is that we are going to get power to flow through the circuits. And clearly we need to understand where Eskom is going to be going over the next period of time to gain some certainty over that. And I think it's just too early for us to make that judgment. I think that the power situation in South Africa obviously is resolvable. It requires a two pronged approach, one is they have to increase the capacity. And two they have to operate the existing capacity at a higher level of efficiency and availability than it has been operating at the moment. Both those are possible, and we will as an -- obviously, a concerned user of electricity in South Africa pay as much of a proactive role we can in doing that. And I don't think that we should underestimate the challenges to achieving that position. You don't get into the situation over night and you don't come out of it overnight. And I think we just have to be realistic about it. One of the great advantages, of course, of the Lion project has been the fact that it uses less energy than traditional processors. So it is a &#x2013; those are projects that we clearly would like &#x2013; and we'd like to advance.</p>

Have you actually had non-Glenco shareholders approach you and ask you &#x2013; well, they are focused on the NPV of Xstrata and Glenco is focused on the NPV of Xstrata and many other things? Have they approached you and said something about that difference of interests? And how are you going to bridge that difference of interest between one set of shareholders with the others?</p>

          <p>Tama Willis from Deutsche Bank. Just a couple of questions, firstly on nickel, maybe on for Ian on the pig iron production in China, some commentators are looking for actually higher production in '08. Can you talk a little bit about your 100,000 ton forecast? And the second question following on from the comments on coal its clear that you are looking to try and achieve close to spot for various commodity costs, or bulk commodity contracts. And <mark type="inaudible" /> always share the spot price, which is double the contract price. Can you talk a bit about the interaction maybe between the spot and contract price there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the pig iron, yes we are forecasting a slight up tick in pig iron production for this year. The markets, the pig iron markets interesting in that it started out with blast furnaces, of course, using coking coal as a source of feed. And we know where coking prices are going. So there has been some movement to electric furnaces. That allows them to put in high grades feeds, allows them to get more and a 300 series type feed material. But again that offers some further challenges with regards to energy. So we think that nickel pig iron is in a fairly stable position, its still at the top end of the cost curve. They are becoming more efficient, but there are constraints with regards to freight, energy and, of course, coking prices. So we don't see massive changes in what we've predicted in the market right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the spike in feed gap at the moment between the contract prices and spot. As a matter of fact on the 29th there was an offer being made for high carbon ferrochrome at 2, $2.00, which is way above the $1.20 we've got at the moment. So our marketing team will have to responsibly address the gap and endeavor to close it without misusing the situation that we've got at the moment.</p>

          <p>Just to follow up on the power and coal situation in South Africa. I think we've heard Eskom saying they require an additional 45 million tons of coal in the reasonably near term. Is this -- does Xstrata have the capacity to assist them with that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no shortage of coal in South Africa, point number one. So if Eskom wants the coal they can simply go and buy it. And from Xstrata's position, we are well positioned to support Eskom in meeting their coal needs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> Standard &amp; Poor's. Just a quick follow up on the power risk. Could you please elaborate on how you are working with Eskom to -- what kind of relationship do you have with Eskom to solve the problem? And do you have any sort of view on how long it will take? And finally do you think that this effects sort of your -- how does this affect your view of the value of the assets in South Africa and your plans for developments going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am generally speaking we have a very good relationship with Eskom; we are both a supplier and a customer. And from our point of view where we can practically help them is to make them offers for coal which they can then use to ensure that their power stations are supplied with coal and they have appropriate reserves of coal. On the management of capacity side there is a constant interaction between ourselves and between the industry and Eskom in terms of capacity management. I think there is a concern by the industry at the moment that too much of the burden of capacity management is going to be borne by the mining industry. And if that's the case the negative consequences for the economy will be significant and that will impact jobs and a whole range of other things. And so we are trying to have, I think, constructive discussions on how we can achieve capacity management. But in the short term the power situation will only be managed by capacity management; which means that, people will have to consume less energy and the question is how is that burden spread across the total of the electricity users in South Africa.</p>
          <p>And what I think we have to ensure is that that burden is not borne disproportionately by the mining industry, because that will have &#x2013; impacts for us, but impacts for the economy as a whole. And while South Africa is an important region for Xstrata, it's a relatively small contributor to our EBITDA. And so our concerns are really more broad-based than simply trying to protect our bottom line here. We have people in Xstrata who have substantial expertise in power generation and we are more than happy to facilitate these sorts of solutions coming through.</p>
          <p>Eskom have estimated they need probably another five or six years to work through this problem. And that pre-supposes that they can actually put in capacity, they can build the capacity and achieve appropriate operating regimes. I think there has to be some level of risk attached to that, but it certainly is doable. But we mustn't be blind to the fact that there are the potential risks.</p>
          <p>So, in the short term this is not good news, it is not good news for us as operators, us as potential investors, its not good news for the South African economy. And it certainly will impact economic growth and it will impact future investments in South Africa until the situation is resolved. Hopefully, it will not change the view that South Africa is a good place to do business. And because I think that's important clearly for the maintenance of growth in the country. From our perspective, we remain committed to our investments in South Africa. And we think that once these issues are resolved that will be a place that we will be more than happy to continue taking on investments. We have a very exciting expansion program in ferrochrome, which is our the most energy intensive part of our operations. We have very exciting plans for the growth of our platinum division. And our coal business is an important leg in our total coal division. So there is no doubt that we are in South Africa for the long term. And this, hopefully, will just be a little blip on the horizon when one looks back over the years in terms of the value contributed by those operations to the Xstrata bottom line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sam Catalano again. A slightly cynical question, in your half year presentation you had some conceptual charts regarding the organic growth profile in each of the various divisions, and we don't have those again. I am just wondering is that a reflection of the fact that you think there is a bit more uncertainty around project delivery of your project pipeline over the next 10 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, to the absolute contrary. And the reason why we didn't do it, because in December this year we had substantial presentations on our growth programs from each of the important divisions. With respect Santiago, not to say that zinc is not an important division. But Santiago couldn't make it that day that's a quick recovery. But of the majority of our important divisions gave very substantial presentations on growth programs in December. And we just didn't feel it appropriate to burden you again with similar presentations. They are available on the website in absolute detail and if there are any questions on those please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
