      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Aldo speaking. Welcome to our conference call to discuss Banco do Brasil's fourth quarter results. Geovanne will present our performance in the period, but before that I would like to highlight some of the main events in 2008. And a year that we celebrated 200 years of Banco do Brasil, we have a net income of R$ 8.8 billion which corresponds to ROE of 42.5% and earnings per share of R$ 3.43. The recurring net income reaches R$ 6.7 billion, a 13.7 increase compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>You'll see in the presentation that we accomplished with the commitment we made on the roadshow during the public offering of 2007, and with the guidance that we published in 2008. Our assets surpassed R$ 520 billion at the end of the period and our loan portfolio, which grew almost 40% in 2008 amounted more than R$ 224 billion, with highlights to the individuals portfolio that increased more than 6% in the year, with R$ 49 billion in balance.</p>
          <p>Regarding properties, our loan portfolio grew 48% 2008 and in the year we have almost R$ 100 billion. Regarding the finance through investments, we ended the year with the largest BNDES on-lending agent with 9 billion disbursed.</p>
          <p>I highlighted that while credit growth was higher than the Brazilian financial system and it was compound by the maintenance of the portfolio quality. Anyway due to the present economic scenario, we've received our statistical model to the loan losses of our portfolio and reinforced in R$ 1.6 billion the additional provision.</p>
          <p>I'd also remind you that as I said in the third quarter due to the Resolution 26 issued by the Brazilian pension plans authority, we've received the calculus of our actuarial assets and liabilities, which brought a one-off gain of R$ 2.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the year &#x2013; in the last year, we will be &#x2013; in the last year, we will be in the history Banco do Brasil as the year when we broke an old buyback and conclude our first acquisition. We know that 2009 will present many challenges to the financial sector worldwide. And despite that, we will work hard to transform those threats in opportunities for Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Before Geovanne starts with the presentation, I would like to mention that from this quarter on, we will start to present in our MD&amp;A some highlights of our social-environmental responsibility.</p>
          <p>Now, I would ask Geovanne to proceed. Please, Geovanne.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you all. Hello, everybody. As Aldo told us before, we recorded an R$ 8.8 billion net profit in 2008. This result represents a 74% growth over 2007 and corresponds to a 32.5% return on equity, against 22.5% in the previous year as can be seen on slide number three. The recurring net profit also grew and reached R$ 6.7 billion, a 13.7% increase in relation to 2007.</p>
          <p>It is worth to highlight that Banco do Brasil's performance during it's &#x2013; during the fourth quarter, in this period the net profit surpassed R$ 2.9 billion. Without one-off items, the net profit would be</p>
          <p>R$ 1.6 billion, a 26.1% growth over Q4 '07 and a 20.2% decrease over the previous quarter. The recurring return on equity reached 24.5%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, slide number four, we can observe Q4 '08 one-off items. We recognized a R$ 5.3 billion one-off gain related to the actuarial assets from PREVI surplus, Banco do Brasil's employees pension fund plan.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we had some one-off expenses, R$ 1.3 billion liability due to actuarial losses in CASSI, Banco do Brasil employees healthcare plan, R$ 1.6 billion of additional provisions for NPL and income and social contribution taxes and statutory profits that together amounted to R$ $1.1 billion. We also had expenses related to economic plans of R$ 44 million. So, the net impact in Banco do Brasil's result was R$ 1.3 billion, which led us to a R$ 1.6 billion recurring net profit in Q4 '08.</p>
          <p>Moving on the next slide. It's important to mention that the fourth quarter was full of challenges and opportunities. We were finally able to better identify the effect of international financial crisis in the Brazilian banking system. With the lack of liquidity, credit restrictions and higher risk, the Brazilian Central Bank reacted quickly and took some measures to bring some relief to the National Financial System. These measures allied with our size and skills made possible to Banco do Brasil to benefit more from the opportunities raised by the crisis.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 6. We can observe that the release of reserve requirements allows Banco do Brasil to intensify the transactions with other financial institution. The purchase of loan portfolios and interbank transactions totaled R$ 14 billion in the year. At the end of this period, the balance of those operations reached R$ 9.8 billion from which R$ 3.8 billion comprised the loans that were purchased by Banco do Brasil. From this amount, R$ 3.1 billion corresponded to payroll loans and R$ 700 million to auto lending that was purchased by Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we can observe that, despite the financial crisis, we kept our credit expansion. Our loan book has an outstanding performance. The total balance reached more than R$ 224 billion, a 39.9% increase in 12 months and 11.2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We outperformed once more the banking industry, which grew 6.5% in the quarter and 31.1% in 12 months. The domestic loan portfolio volume also surpassed the industry. It grew 40.4% in 12 months and 10.8% in the quarter. Therefore, Banco do Brasil was able to increase its market share in the credit market to 17.1% as of December 2008. The highlights here were the individuals' portfolio, which grew 52.5% over 2007 and 12.4% in the quarter, and the businesses portfolio, which grew 48.4% in the year and 13.9% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, we present the break down of our individuals' loan book. As we can see on the graph, we kept a strong growth in payroll and auto loans. The payroll deductible lending portfolio increased 48.4% in 2008 and 21.2% in the quarter, a very strong growth. In auto loans we more than doubled the portfolio in one year and in the last quarter, we grew 19.4%.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, we see that the businesses portfolio almost reached R$ 100 billion. Highlight here the operations with middle and large companies, which grew 52.4% in the year and 16.8% in the quarter. This impressive performance was possible because since Brazilian companies were not able to raise funds from abroad, internal, or from the capital market due to the credit crunch, Banco do Brasil ended up using its excessive liquidity to strengthen the relationship with business clients to meet their financial needs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 10. We see that the flow of some of the main credit lines were restored to the same levels before the crisis or even higher. I would like to highlight the increase in the flow of working capital line, which achieved R$ 3.8 billion in December. With regard to foreign trade finance, the volume of credit disbursed to this segment was maintained thanks to the Central Bank's decision to start providing Brazilian banks with dollar denominated funding from the country's reserve. However, we can see that the volume of credit before we entered individual segment started to slow down as a consequence of the worsening scenario.</p>
          <p>Also analyzing the contracted operation, we compare on slide 11 the disbursement in the Brazilian banking industry and those from Banco do Brasil. We can see in the graph that after the credit retraction seen in the banking industry from this September are the level of disbursements went back to its normal level in December. Moreover, given Banco do Brasil's counter-cyclical behavior due to its excess liquidity, we were able to increase its market share in Brazil, especially with business operation.</p>
          <p>Looking to slide 12, we have our loan portfolio performance compared to the banking industry here and to private banks as well in Brazil since 2001, where it became clear that historically Banco do Brasil has had a credit growth higher than the banking industry and its private peers. While the banking industry had a 20.3% compounded annual growth rate from 2001 to 2008, in the private banks &#x2013; among the private banks this ratio was 19.9% and in Banco do Brasil, it was 24%.</p>
          <p>In nominal terms, it means that while Banco do Brasil increased more than 350%, its loan book in 70 years its private peers grew 255% in the same year and the National Financial System grew 265%.</p>
          <p>It is worth to highlight on slide 13 that the expansion of Banco do Brasil's business was due to its strong position, especially in the funding base, it was an impressive growth in funding in 2008. Especially in the last quarter due to the "flight to quality" effect which increased our funding but also brought an increase in the cost of funding due to mix change.</p>
          <p>As we can see on slide 14, the strong expansion we had on credit, besides the higher funding cost led to a strong growth in the net interest margin, especially on the fourth quarter, went through a general increase of 25.5% compared to the same period in the previous year, and 17% compared to the previous quarter. In the year the growth was 15.9%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 15. It is important to notice that the growth of the portfolio also allows the maintenance of Banco do Brasil global spread at the level above 7% &#x2013; at 7.3% to be more accurate. That is because despite the reduction on the spreads for individuals portfolios, this stronger increase in business loans led by working capital lines mainly helped to sustain the spread because loans went <mark type="inaudible" /> had shorter maturity and higher rates.</p>
          <p>I will use the next slide, slide number 16 to show that we are compensating the top of our spread with loan growth, especially in our earning assets throughout the years.</p>
          <p>The red line of the graph shows the behavior of the spread from 2001 to 2008, when it came from 9% to 7.1%. However, if we look at the line below this red line, it will show &#x2013; we will see that the pink line shows the nominal impact in the interest margin due to the changes in the spread in the period &#x2013; sorry, the impact in the interest income.</p>
          <p>While the blue line brings us the increase in the net interest income is due to the expansion of earning assets, we can also observe that in all the periods the increase of earning assets was enough to compensate the reduction &#x2013; the impact of the reduction of spreads in our net interest income, which once more proves the strength of Banco do Brasil's flow charts.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 17, which suggest that the expenses with allowance for loan losses were inline with the credit growth, and it represented 3.6% of the average loan book. When compared to the third quarter of '08, the increase of 67.3% in provision expenses, which amounted to R$2.2 billion is mainly explained by the seasonal effect of the contracts in the agribusiness portfolio. It reached &#x2013; the allowance for loan losses totaled something roughly around R$700 million.</p>
          <p>But, this amount of expenses was also explained by the revision of our reclassification methodology, we revised them into a more conservative prospect.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 18, we can observe once more that the expansion of our price book happened along with the maintenance of its quality. Past due loans over 90 days. That is the yellow line on the graph, represented 2.4% at the end of '08. This ratio is more than the 2.7% as seen at the end of '07. And significantly lower than the 3% achieved by the National Financial System. We kept the required provisions over total book ratio at 5.4% and together with additional provisions the coverage ratio went up to 6.1%.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we can observe that through the past years, Banco do Brasil's delinquency ratio is below the delinquency ratio for the banking industry and this trend is proved by the falling numbers, which breakdown is on graph 19.</p>
          <p>In business loans we can see that delinquency ratio in Banco do Brasil has a similar behavior that from rising industry, while in the individuals loans, we can observe that Banco do Brasil's delinquency ratio is much better than the average delinquency in the industry. While in the fourth quarter past due loans over 90 days in the individuals' portfolio for the banking industry grew 110 basis points climbing up from 13.6% to 14.7%, growth for Banco do Brasil remained almost stable.</p>
          <p>This performance is a consequence of the mix that Banco do Brasil has in its individuals portfolio with the higher concentration in payroll deductible lending.</p>
          <p>And on slide 20, we show the Vintage for individuals' loan book, excluding here credit card loans, auto loans and overdraft accounts. And considering past due loans for more than 90 days here. And can be seen on the graph, 2005 Vintage was the vicious one and it posted the maximum delinquency rate at 6.5%. We can conclude looking at this graph that Banco do Brasil's credit compression methodology and also due to the mix of its book has considerably improved the delinquency ratio for the newest vintages.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, as we promised you, we brought the car loan vintages. Here we are considering the operations contracted in our branches and the loans contracted with dealers. It is important to be historic. It is important to highlight that this portfolio is the brand new one and its delinquency ratio reflects our learning curve in this segment, making it difficult to estimate what would be the delinquency trend for this portfolio so far.</p>
          <p>Following on the slide 22, we would like to share with you some information about Banco Votorantim loan project volume. Votorantim is our partners in the auto financing market. The expertise of Votorantim in this segment is senior, as illustrated by the bar chart to the left hand side of the slide. Its delinquency ratio of 1.8% is substantially below the average industry. And if we consider that this portfolio that is made up by 90% of used cars, this is a very outstanding performance.</p>
          <p>In this way, we hope to have benefits from the partnership between Banco do Brasil and Banco Votorantim. And we expect it to help us to improve the quality of our auto financing book.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 23, let's talk a little bit about the Agribusiness sector and the present scenario. As we know, in the fourth quarter, is when the crop is contracted, which implies in the higher volume of contract in this period that can be seen on the slide 24.</p>
          <p>Especially in Q4, the volume of contract was even higher due to the anticipation of the resources for the 2008-2009 crop that was expected to be delivered in the first half of 2009. This anticipation was authorized by the government to offset the impact from the lack of trading companies funding the Agribusiness sector. They are increasing the disbursement to the crop brought out higher equalization revenues, which grew 27.6% more in the previous quarter and reached R$ 494 million in the period.</p>
          <p>In the slide 25, we bring you some information that allows us to be more confident about the future performance of the Agribusiness sector. Although production costs were higher, prices are in a safe level to guarantee producers good margin. We can see in the bottom graph on the left hand side of the slide that even in the less favorable scenario margins are still comfortable about 20% in the case of one crop, for instance.</p>
          <p>On the slide 26, we present the evolution of operations contracted with risk mitigators. The share of working capital credit insured came from 42% in 2006/07 crop to 69% in 08/09 crop, an increase of 2,700 basis points. This increase results from the positioning of Banco do Brasil, when adopting towards the agricultural sector through 2007, set for requirements requiring the use of higher volumes of risk mitigators in new loans. And the total of insured contracted to date, 90% is reinsured with international players.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 27, as Aldo mentioned in the beginning of the call, we are going to talk a little bit about the commitment we had made during the 2007 roadshow <mark type="inaudible" /> and from the estimates that we have disclosed to the market in 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 28 shows us the behavior of our administrative expenses. We told the market that this item should present a growth up to 10% in '08, and indeed, reached 10.5% increase, perfectly inline with the top range of the guidance. However, when we set aside Q4 '08 expenses related to BESC, the State Bank of Santa Catarina that was incorporated by Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Admin expenses will drop by R$ 18 million reaching a 9.9% increase in 2008, completely fulfilling with our guidance for admin expenses.</p>
          <p>Concerning Q4 alone, the increase to income is mainly from the personnel expenses growth, which was due to the salary raise negotiated with the banking union in September.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, brings us Banco do Brasil's productivity ratio since 2001. Here, I would like to point out that the amazing improvement we promoted in our cost income ratio, which came down from 71.8% back in 2001 reaching 41.9% in 2008. And in our coverage ratio that stepped back from 67.4% in 2001 to 124% in 2008.</p>
          <p>On slide 30, we make a comparison between our 2008 guidance and the performance posted by Banco do Brasil. The bank confirmed almost all estimates released to the market. And we are surpassing our guidance for total deposits and loan portfolio. So from the deposits perspective, the success of Banco do Brasil's strategy of growing its deposits raised together with the slight fall in movement due to the pricing was to increase the total deposits to 44% in 2008. Way above our guidance that was between 25 to 30% increase.</p>
          <p>The 40% growth of our loan book was also above our growth estimates, which were, 30 to 35% increase, and it's important to highlight here that in Q4 '08, there was an impressive increase in our loan book. And finally, provisions for our loan losses ended at 2008 close to the lower range of the guidance at 3.6% ratio.</p>
          <p>Then what should we expect for 2009. On the slide 32, we highlight the strength of Banco do Brasil together with Nossa Caixa and Banco Votorantim. Just for an illustration purpose pro forma, if we sum up, Banco do Brasil at the end of '08 with Votorantim and Nossa Caixa, we would have seen an increase in our assets fund by more than 17%, which is R$ 611 billion. We would have seen an increase in our loan book, an actual increase of 13.6%, total deposits increasing by 16%, and net income roughly close to 10%.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we expect to see even higher gains from the consolidation of our acquisitions, mainly due to the efforts we needed to speed up the integration, and to start adding quickly the synergies expected from this transaction.</p>
          <p>Regarding Nossa Caixa, we expect gains from the operation being acting as the financial agent of the State of Sao Paulo, but now a day's response for 30% of the Brazilian GDP. We also expect to profit from the lower cost funding that comes mainly from judicial deposits and to leverage our business with Nossa Caixa's customers. And in that just as a consequence, we will consolidate Banco do Brasil as the biggest bank in the State of Sao Paulo.</p>
          <p>From the Votorantim JV, we expect synergies by strengthening and widening our footprint in the car financing market. We expect to rather access to the well developed and managed alternative distribution channels that Votorantim has. And we also expect to widen our corporate segments and cost &#x2013; capital market businesses together with Votorantim.</p>
          <p>Finally, moving to slide 33, we can observe our BIS ratio, which reached the same level as 2007, closing the year with 15.6%. In the left &#x2013; in the bars on the right hand side of the slide, we show you pro forma was <mark type="inaudible" /> the BIS ratio of Banco do Brasil together with Votorantim and Nossa Caixa. It would be 13.5%.</p>
          <p>It is important to highlight here that we are very comfortable with this level of capital base. We don't foresee any capital constraint with regard to volume growth or even to absorb increase in delinquency.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have excess provisions. We are well covered with provisions and we have a very sound capital growth rate. But anyway, if in the future we believe that the level of capital we have, will represent a constraint in asset growth, there are many ways of improving it that we can discuss later during the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Coming to an end on slide 34, I would like to finally to present you our 2009 guidance. It's important to mention that besides the expected slowdown in our economy, we foresee that Banco do Brasil will be able to improve its business and differently from many analyst that are forecasting return on equity for Banco do Brasil below 15% in 2009, we believe that we are able <mark type="inaudible" /> to our shareholders and return on equity between 19 to 22%.</p>
          <p>Of course, that due to this slowdown, we expect our loan book to &#x2013; the growth in our loan book to slowdown as well. So the guidance for loan growth in 2009 will be, an increase between 13 to 17%, depending on the outcomes from &#x2013; or depend on the unfoldings of the crisis in the Brazilian economy. With regard to the loan book, what will be the increase expected in the individual segments, between 23 to 25%; in the business segment, between 16 to 19%; agribusiness between 2 to 5%.</p>
          <p>Fee income, we will maintain its growth rate seen in 2008, so for 2009, we are forecasting, a fee income growth between 5 to 8%. Total deposits will increase less than 2008, so we are expecting total deposits to grow between 10 to 14% in 2009. The net interest margin will be practically stable, but we are just in the range expecting a net interest margin from 6.8 to 7.2%, depending on the performance of our loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses, given the tighter scenario, we are increasing the guidance. We expect to grow provision charges as a percentage of the average loan book. It will represent 3.8 to 4.2% of the book. And the administrative expenses, it will grow between 9 to 10 &#x2013; 12%, sorry, for 2009. And finally, the tax rate, effective tax rate, we should expect from 26 to 29% effective tax rates.</p>
          <p>Well these were the major information I would like to share with you. We could now open the floor for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Excuse me. We have a question from Saul Martinez from JPMorgan, who would like to ask a question. Please Mr. Martinez, go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody, I have two questions, first on asset quality. As you mentioned Geovanne, you guys reclassified. You changed your risk methodology and reclassified some loans. And obviously, became more conservative, and this really shows up in the increasing category D through H loans, especially in the retail loan portfolio, which rose much more than your delinquency rates did in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit more about some of the assumptions underlying that change? What are you expecting? What are you assuming for the economy next year? And also, importantly, what segments within the retail loan book are most impacted, is it certain products, is it the micro and small businesses, is it across the board? Are there certain areas that you're more worried about than others?</p>
          <p>My second question is on your capital ratios, your pro forma BIS is 13.5%. Can you break that out between Tier I, an estimate between Tier I and Tier II? And obviously, my understanding is that Tier II cannot exceed 50% of Tier I. And I just want to get a sense for whether on a pro forma basis after these Votorantim and Nossa Caixa consolidated how much capacity you would have to raise Tier II capital if you were to need to?</p>

          <p>Hi. Saul. The Tier II capital is calculated by 60% of the Tier I, and the margin that we can forecast, our best forecast as per the consolidations for Nossa Caixa and Votorantim is more or less R$ 4 billion. This number is subjected to mainly assumptions, so I would say that is something between 3.5 to 4.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But Ren&#xEA;, I guess my question though is the 13.5 do we know how much of that is &#x2013; do we have an estimate for what is Tier I and what is Tier II? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Tier I will be 9.6, again, is our best forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regards to your second &#x2013; your first question, Saul, this is Geovanne speaking, about delinquency, one of the macroeconomic assumptions that we have, we are forecasting and the guidance that we're giving is considering also these macroeconomic assumptions. We are expecting GDP growth close to the 2% range. We expect a price index close to 4.5%, the official IPCA index; unemployment rate could go up to 9%, the benchmark rate at 10 to 10.25%. These are the major macroeconomic assumptions.</p>
          <p>And what we did in order to become more conservative in the agri &#x2013; I am sorry, in our risk methodology system was, first of all, to make provisions above the minimum required by the Central Bank, okay. And there has also been a change in the dragging effect, for those operations that were 60 days past due, we changed the dragging effect from five to one. So we are now adding instead of all the loan &#x2013; how can I say, from five to 1%, and we are dragging all loans in the individual's portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I didn't understand. The five to 1%, the drag effect, what is that? Can you explain how that works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The volume of credit that they have, that is past due, usually, we would start the dragging effect when the 5% of the customer's outstanding credit became past due, 5% above debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if 1% of the total credit it has is past due, we start the dragging effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It became more conservative with the dragging effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. And then just one final follow-up on that question. I mean, are you comfortable with your level of excess reserves. Obviously, I mean would you use any of those excess reserves going forward. Is that a level &#x2013; in other words, if credit quality trends continue to deteriorate, are you going to keep provisioning levels up at such a level that would maintain that sort of &#x2013; that sort of excess reserve or would you be comfortably &#x2013; would you be comfortable eating away at that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we would be comfortable in the way that level will add up. The additional provisions were done to face this scenario that will be tougher. Of course, the major impact for pickup in delinquency will be much more a volume growth effect since we're expecting a huge slowdown in the growth in our loan book. And with the seasoning of the loans, we are expecting delinquency to pickup as a consequence of this slowdown in the volume growth. So if we need so, we will be eating away these provisions to cover this increase in delinquency.</p>
          <p>Of course, we will maintain the conservativeness in addressing provisions. But we are not so pessimistic about it, so it's important to mention. So far, economic conditions here in Brazil, of course, that we are suffering, the impact of the crisis, but in the individual's portfolio, for instance, given the concentration of payroll deductible lending in our book, we are very comfortable with the level of delinquency in this book.</p>
          <p>The one that should bring some burden would be definitely the corporate lending &#x2013; the corporate loan book, and mainly because many corporate clients are having difficulties in raising money to rollover their debt. We expect that the decision of the government to provide Brazilian companies with a specific fund for them to rollover their debt might help improve the delinquency in this portfolio. And it will depend on the unfoldings of the crisis in the Brazilian economy. If it deteriorates further, probably should expect a higher pickup in delinquency, however, we are well provisioned. And if it does not, provisions will remain here as a kind of guarantee that we have to face volatilities in the delinquency.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi would like to ask a question. Please Mr. Abut, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. I wondered if you could elaborate more on your guidance for loan growth. The 13, 17% guidance for this portfolio as a whole did not surprise me that much. I think it's pretty much inline with what we are hearing from some of the other banks in the system. I was surprised though about two things when you look at the sub-segments that you are expecting so much growth in individuals because the economy is going to slowdown as much as we all expect, it seems that that could be an area of possible duration. Do you really feel comfortable extending so much at the individual level in economies that may grow 2% at most and even then we grew because we're optimistic?</p>
          <p>And second if could elaborate it more on your agribusiness assumption because one of the difficult pullback we get from investors when we talk about the story of Banco do Brasil even that you're pretty much the only one lending to agribusiness, that you're concerned that next year &#x2013; currently to your credit to that sector remains in term of credit lines <mark type="inaudible" /> that Banco do Brasil could asked to fill the gap and led much more than in fact that you are predicting only two to 5% growth in that segment, it should be comforting doing business here. But now that it is gone, why do you feel comfortable that you may not be helped by the government and even then agribusiness remain one of your core businesses to led much more in support of that segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, it's Aldo. Regarding the expected growth for Brazilian economic of next &#x2013; this year, we think that 2% is the minimum level. We still believe that Brazil will grow at least 2% this year. And regarding the portfolio for individuals, you cannot forget that since we have a concentration in our book in payroll loans and we are going to be the bank of the State of San Paulo, as probably if you should see they are in negotiation with the government here in Brazil and in the State of <mark type="inaudible" /> going to be the bank of the State of Esp&#xED;rito Santo and the State of Brazil. So we're going to add to our &#x2013; in our books, the possibility to offer or to grant loans, or payroll loans for the employees of those governments. So we can see a growth in our portfolio mainly in the payroll loans and we are expecting this at least not pessimist. If you're not optimist, no pessimist view of the Brazil economy that we will grow at least 2% this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add, Daniel, we cannot forget the salary raises that will be granted to pensioners and the retirees here in Brazil because their benefits are linked to the minimum wage, and there will be an increase in minimum wage that increase the leverage for the payroll deductible lending book. And also, the salary raises to government employees are roughly 80% of our payroll deductible lending book comprises government employee civil servants, okay. And we expect to step up their growth now with car lending business. We have seen a kind of a reaction in the car segment here in Brazil, and we believe since we have a very small base, that we will be able to increase further this book.</p>
          <p>And with regard to the agribusiness, it's important &#x2013; first of all, it's important to highlight here that we have already a mandate from the government, like the peers have. They have to comply with official rules to finance mortgage, while Banco do Brasil must comply financing agribusiness, using same used accounts as the major funding source to finance this book. We are not the only ones that finance agribusiness. We have 60% of the market and direct of the 40% comes from Santander, from Bradesco and even Unibanco, all Brazilian banks. They do provide agribusiness loans. Of course, that we are the leaders, but we are not the only ones that provide loans to that.</p>
          <p>Why we are expecting so much &#x2013; a small growth in this book? Basically, because there will be a shift between loans to &#x2013; how can I say, agro industries to loans to agribusiness in the future. If you look on slide seven, we give the breakdown of the loan of the agribusiness both to individuals, which balance was R$ 45 billion and to businesses, which balance was 18.5%. We are expecting, first, a moderate growth in funding, basically savings accounts that is used to finance agribusiness. And secondly, the loans to be granted to the sector, a part of that will come from the loans that we were using to grant to agro industries. These agro industries will probably get funds from traditional working capital lines in the business segment, not from the agribusiness portfolio.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank would like to ask a question. Please Mr. Pierre, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions as well. The first one, just to be clear, this guidance that you provided for 2009 it excludes Nossa Caixa and Votorantim, right? And if you could provide us with any guidance that you &#x2013; or any changes in your guidance that would arise from the integration of the two banks? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on your net interest margin outlook, you're expecting about a contraction on your net interest margin, but latest data from the Central Bank we see spreads improving in the system. So just would be interested in hearing your &#x2013; the reasoning behind the margin contraction?</p>
          <p>Finally, the third question is, if you could comment a little bit about the appetites that the banks still have for acquisitions. Most recently you announced that you're pursuing the acquisition of Banestes. I was wondering if you could make any more comments if this is it, or we could see more acquisitions in 2009. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Aldo. Thank you for the questions. Regarding the &#x2013; our guidance, I am wondering Nossa Caixa and Votorantim, I think very hard to us to make any kind of statement now. It's so difficult to imagine. What would be our guidance in terms of growth, considering both banks? Frankly, we are not able to do this right now. Probably at next &#x2013; in the next quarter we'll be able to give you some idea about this.</p>
          <p>Regarding the compression of the net interest margin, we expect that this compression, because in our view, interest rates in Brazil will be falling during the year and there will be a pressure coming from the government to all banks, that may apply all banks to contain to compress margin and spread. And this is what we are expecting.</p>
          <p>And finally, regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> it's just starting with the evaluation of Bank of the State Piaui S.A., I think this is a process that will take three months &#x2013; within two months, we're going to have our evaluation and probably we are going to start negotiation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the further incorporations, the answer is we are not thinking to additional incorporations, so we know the kind of attrition because we think we have work enough with those banks that we had already bought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I may add, Mario, with regards to the spread. The guidance we are giving is a range between 6.8 to 7.2. It will depend on how fast we add to our business, higher spread loans like the individual ones. So despite a huge drop in the benchmark rate, we are expecting and this definitely compresses &#x2013; tends to compress margins.</p>
          <p>Given the mix of loans we have now a day, as long as we continue to grow faster our individuals loan book will be able to cut back more of our &#x2013; on spreads. So I think that maintain an average threshold to the 7% range is a good a estimate, 6.8 that is the lower part of the range would be in the case that one, which drops really fast. Secondly, I am not able to add higher spread loans to the book; and thirdly, the spreads in the corporates and quarter two starts to slow rapidly. Because so far rates in the corporate segment are too high due to the crisis and if we maintain this rate for the entire year, we would probably share different perspective in terms of spreads. However, we believe that throughout the year spreads in the corporate book tends start dropping.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me follow up then on what Aldo said about pressure from the Central Bank to reduce rates. What specifically are you seeing from the Central Bank? Because so far, what we have seen is more comments from the press but nothing really specific. However, like in Mexico, for example, we are hearing more and more, the government is thinking about implementing limits on rates that banks can charge. Do you think there is a possibility in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I don't think that &#x2013; this is not a possibility in my opinion. What I mean is Central Bank view continuing the process I think of reduce the interest rates because expectation regarding inflation will make possible to reduce the interest rate. What I mean by pressure is what we are really in the press, the government itself, not the Central Bank specifically. But the government is inviting banks and not only public in original sense but also private banks to reduce the interest rates. That is, of course, a political pressure. It is not something that can be translated in the new regulation, but it's just a kind of psychological pressure you know.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is just to follow-up on the questions about the agribusiness book. I saw in the fourth quarter looking at your MD&amp;A, there was a very big increase in terms of the new transactions originations in the fourth quarter. It was more than 100% increase on the previous quarter and about more than three times what it was in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Can you confirm that this &#x2013; is this what Geovanne was talking about earlier, about the farmers and agribusiness operations generally sourcing their funding needs for the future, given the scarcity of credit going forward or is this due to some other factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Victor, this is Geovanne. If I understood you correctly &#x2013; if I understood your question correctly, well, the increase in our origination was a reflex of the price of trading companies. They stepped out of the agribusiness sector and they needed more funding to finance the other plantation season. They used a bigger part of these funds from their own capital, their own money. Their '07 &#x2013; '08 crop was a very good one. They were well capitalized. They were able to use their own resource to finance the plantation. And they're governed by &#x2013; the government by its turn allowed banks to anticipate a part of the money that would be dispersed during the beginning of '09. And because of that we ended up increasing the contracts or the volume contracted in Q4, because of this funding anticipation, okay? This was the major reason why it grew significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that in part is baked into your very low growth for agribusiness loans in '09 then, because of the anticipation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions. The first one, in your guidance what is the SELIC target that you are forecasting, the declining rates that you are putting in your margin assumptions?</p>
          <p>And secondly, given all these discussions regarding spreads and interest rates, et cetera, what has been so far the impact of lower reserve requirements in your margins and could you expect or are you negotiating right now, total decreases in reserve requirements in order to allow the industry to lower lending spreads going forward, what is the likelihood of seeing something on this front during the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the reserve requirements, what I heard from Central Bank is that they are not going to release any &#x2013; no loan release reserve requirements for Brazil. They think what they have promoted during the year &#x2013; since this last September was enough to help the system, and they are not paying <mark type="inaudible" /> because of this pronunciation of the Central Bank, perhaps the very kind of <mark type="inaudible" /> side here in order to know the impact of and release of reserve requirements in our book &#x2013; in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add, Boris. In Q4, the brunt of reserve requirements that was released allowed us to contract more than R$ 14 billion of loans, and you saw the impact of that in our &#x2013; in the increase in our net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it definitely helped us, because we decided to act in a contra-cyclical way and instead of just keeping that money to protect liquidity, we decided to lend it. Since we had no liquidity issues, quite the contrary we had excess liquidity, we decided to continue in the market, gaining market share and the consequence you see in the margins is not because of that.</p>
          <p>However, our peers, many of them instead of maintaining the presence in the credit market, they decided to retain that reserves that were released by the Central Bank to protect their liquidity and we are not seeing the results, this major increase in their margins because of that.</p>

          <p>Have you used up all the potential leverage from the lower reserve requirements, could we expect further leveraging of these?</p>

          <p>The total volume of reserve requirements that was released by Banco do Brasil, was close to R$ 12 billion, so we ended using more than that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just have two questions actually. The first one was on agri. We saw in the third quarter this year that that quite a few loans in the rolled over portfolio were paid back and so quite an exceptionally low provision charge in that third quarter. With the margins that you guys have given us in this presentation and so in corn do you think that these margins are sort of good enough, much that farmers can play back again in the third quarter '09?</p>
          <p>And then second question is just on margins. Just in this fourth quarter, it's quite a exceptional quarter, and obviously, we saw a very large growth Q-on-Q in your net interest income. I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that can be extrapolated and how much of it relates to the fact that you guys had a lot of excess liquidity and sort of exposure to that in what was quite a tight quarter. What kind of momentum have we got in terms of the net interest income for the first quarter and the second quarter? How much will that performance in this fourth quarter sort of peak through?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian. This is Geovanne. Well, let me try to answer your two questions. Well first one, with regards to agri, we are confident that the margins that we have in our base will be enough for those farmers to pay back their loans, no problem. Of course that you will face some specific problems in certain areas, but on average margins are strong enough for them to pay back their loans without no problems. So that's why I stated during the conference call that we are very comfortable and confident that regarding these numbers, farmers have no excuse for not paying back Banco do Brasil. Okay.</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with the net interest income. You're right it had an amazing behavior in Q4 due to this counter-cyclical behavior of Banco do Brasil. I don't think you would be &#x2013; you could extrapolate, I think you use that word, because I'm not sure. That's for the upcoming quarters, because, from Q1 on, the other banks they have improved their liquidity and they started to tap the market again and started competing once again. So, I don't think you will see such big growth momentum in the upcoming quarters from Banco do Brasil. And this is confirmed with the guidance we gave for the whole year. We are expecting the credit growth in Banco do Brasil to drop by almost 50 basis points, okay. So I think that you cannot extrapolate this margin for the upcoming quarters.</p>

          <p>Just want a quick follow-up question to Aldo on this topic of the political pressures, which you said are increasing not just only for Banco do Brasil, but for all banks in the system. When you guys are now trying the ROE of 19 to 22% down from almost 25% last year, is that in to the equation as well? Are there any discussions given that Banco do Brasil is a public sector bank, clearly government controlled bank, that 25%, is that too much in this kind of environment, then you guys should be reducing rates more rapidly and spreads more rapidly even if that implies, having an ROE that is lower than your private sector peers, so be it. Probably more sanctions should be that of a public sector bank. Is that sort of what drove you to guide such a decline in the ROE or it's simply that you are seeing a more challenging year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no, any kind of, how can I say &#x2013; political pressures in terms of ROE of Banco do Brazil. The one that we established, the one that we are rating here, that the guidance that we are offering to market is the one that we think it's possible to achieve in this scenario that we are foreseeing for the Brazilian economic &#x2013; economy and the market itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will account higher provisions expenses in 2009 where we have higher admin expenses. So the smaller ROE reflects is slowdown in the Brazilian economy and is perfectly in line so far as we know with our large private peers. Even the large one that has already disclosed its number is expecting a drop in its ROE close to the 20% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then <mark type="inaudible" /> as part of political pressure that was event a mention of it <mark type="inaudible" />, I mean, we often read in the papers someone got an appeal saying that, well the public sector bank should not charge, as that related the private sector bank and especially in these two being leading the process in terms of lowering rates. So I was curious to know if the same applies to the overall profitability that you reported. That was an helpful answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You should count that as political posturing on the one hand and newspaper gossip on the other hand.</p>
