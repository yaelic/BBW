        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We'll follow the usual running order with Andy covering the financial results followed by Terry with an update on strategy. And we'll then be pleased to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take a few moments today to share with you our recent progress on strategic initiatives, and also on delivering solid results in challenging times. When we set our strategy for growth over a decade ago, we had a clear vision for the future. It was about strong sustainable growth. It was about patient investments in new markets and new businesses that will provide a solid platform from which we could continue to build.</p>
          <p>In the last few months we cemented some important building blocks, which mean that we are rapidly realizing this vision. In May, we announced our plans to bolster our position in Korea. With the acquisition of the 36th Homever stores, Korea is already our most profitable market outside the UK, and this deal will put us in the position to challenge the market leadership there.</p>
          <p>Just recently we've announced plans to establish a wholesale cash &amp; carry business in India. And as you know we have spent some time developing our strategy there and searching for the right partner. I believe our patience has paid off. We're delighted to be working with Tata and share many &#x2013; and they share many of our values. And India is a great opportunity for the group in what is one of the most vibrant economies.</p>
          <p>Another important market for the future is China. And having taken full control of our business there, a little over 18 months ago, we're extending our reach and bringing our offer to more customers across this vast country. We are now ready to begin investing in building a portfolio of large modern freehold shopping centers in prime locations. And as our venture in the United States approaches its first anniversary, we continue to be very encouraged by the early performance of Fresh &amp; Easy, giving us confidence in our aim to build a substantial business for the future.</p>
          <p>And again, on the Retailing Services, we've taken another significant step. As you know, Andy has been appointed Chief Executive and will drive forward the next phase of growth. We will soon complete our acquisition of our RBS' 50% share of TPF, and this will enable us to expand our offer in the growing financial services sector at home and internationally.</p>
          <p>This all bodes well for the future of Tesco, but today is about results and we've delivered a good set of numbers against the challenging background, which I think demonstrates the strength of the business and the experience of the management. In fact the whole Tesco team has worked incredibly hard over the last few months to deliver an even better shopping trip for customers, and you see on the whole some of the recent efforts. And I'd like to thank them for their efforts, which I know will continue through Christmas and through to the year-end.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I'll now hand over to Andy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks David, and good morning everyone. First, I'd like to you through the main financial headlines for the group. In the first half, we've delivered good growth in sales, profit, earnings and dividend. We've done so in challenging trading conditions and whilst carrying significant start of custom new businesses, mainly Fresh &amp; Easy.</p>
          <p>We've also taken advantages of some compelling opportunities to buy quality assets. We remain disciplined with our cash and capital management, and with completion on these transactions expecting in the next few weeks we have clear plans in place to deliver a solid net debt number by year-end. To achieve this, the underlying business will be cash positive during the second half.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through the group performance starting with sales. Total group sales for the half year ending 23rd of August 2008 were &#xA3;28.1 billion, up 14.1%. Sales had a following win from exchange rates, and at constants rates group sales were up 10.5%.</p>
          <p>Group trading profit rose 9.4% to &#xA3;1,367 million. Profit is stated after absorbing planned U.S. start-up losses totaling &#xA3;60 million for the first half. Excluding the US, trading profit rose by 12.7% to &#xA3;1,427 million and group trading margin was stable at 5.6%.</p>
          <p>Group underlying profit before tax was &#xA3;1,453 million, up 10.3% and this faster rated growth was helped by higher property profit in the first half. The increase of property profits on last year is driven by the UK where profits grew to a &#xA3;164 million following the four transactions we announced in the first half. The store deals were completed on an average yield of 5%, showing that even in the current climate appetite for Tesco's property and covenant has remained strong.</p>
          <p>Our plans to release more than &#xA3;5 billion from our property portfolio are on track. Value realized to date now totals &#xA3;2 billion and we hope to complete further deals in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>Statutory Group operating profit was up 13.1% and group pre-tax profit was up 11.3%. This is slightly higher than our underlying profit growth due to non-cash IFRS effects including the IFRS pension charge.</p>
          <p>Underlying diluted earnings per share grew broadly in line with underlying profits, up 11.6% to 13.28 pence. And the proposed interim dividend is 3.57 pence, up 11.6%. This is a strong dividend, consistent with our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to take you through the performance of the UK. Sales in the UK were solid and growth was well within our planned performance range. Overall, sales grew 9.7%. Excluding petrol, sales growth was 6.9%, including like-for-like of 3.7% and growth from net new stores of 3.2%. Like-for-like growth improved in the second quarter to 4% from 3.5% in quarter one.</p>
          <p>Fuel price inflation was a little higher over the second quarter than the first, but it looks as it peaked just before half year-end, and as we move into the second half we're starting to anniversary some of the commodity driven price increases in areas such as dairy and bakery that came through this time last year. We expect inflation to remain but to gradually reduce over the rest of the year. Whilst commodity pressures are easing, the impact of this will be partially offset by the residual effect of higher energy costs in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>Last year's UK trading profit number included the startup costs in the U.S. This year we're reporting the United States separately within &#x2013; in the international segment. So we've restated last year's comparison numbers.</p>
          <p>Excluding any impact from the U.S., UK trading profit was &#xA3;1,081 million, up 8.6%. UK trading margin was stable at 5.9%, and I was pleased with this result given the energy price pressures we faced in the business this year.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to take you through international results. Total international sales including United States were &#xA3;8 billion, up 26.8% at actual rates and 12.6% at constant rates. Excluding United States, sales were up 25.6% at actual rates and 11.4% at constant rates. This is a strong performance with international now having passed the anniversary of the initial reporting of sales in China.</p>
          <p>International trading profits were &#xA3;286 million. Before U.S. start-up losses, trading profit was up 27.7% at actual rates and by 15.9% at constant rates. International trading margins rose by 10 basis points to 4.9% before the effect of including the U.S. This was an excellent performance, reflecting the growing strength and maturity of our existing markets.</p>
          <p>In Asia sales were &#xA3;3.2 billion, up 16% at actual rates, 14.8% at constant rates. Trading profits in Asia rose to &#xA3;145 million, an increase of 16.9% at actual rates and 18.5% at constant rates. Margins were stable at 4.9% after significant investment in China, both in terms of systems and processes and in setting up our regional structures. Korea, Thailand and Malaysia performed well, and Malaysia has now moved into strong profitability with the full benefits of the macro integration now coming through.</p>
          <p>Going forward, margins in Asia will absorb integration costs on Homever in Korea, estimated at &#xA3;16 million for this financial year and similar amounts for the following two years. We expect the acquired stores to move into profitability and the transaction to be broadly earnings neutral in the second full year of trading.</p>
          <p>In Europe sales were &#xA3;4.7 billion, up 33% at actual exchange rates. At constant rates sales growth was 8.7%, which is a little slower than usual. An important element of this was the timing of openings. We expect the contribution from new space to pick up as the heavy second half weighting of this year's opening program kicks in.</p>
          <p>Trading profit rose to &#xA3;201 million, an increase of 36.7% at actual rates and 13.6% at constant rates. Trading margins rose to 4.9% due to strong performances in Poland and Slovakia. We're pleased with progress in United States where sales were &#xA3;75.6 million, and Terry will talk more about developments in the U.S. later on.</p>
          <p>Now much as I love this meeting, I am excited as I am sure you are about me taking on my new role as CEO of Retailing Services full time. We see tremendous opportunities in these markets for Tesco and I am looking forward to delivering on the ambitious plans we are putting in place for these businesses to take them to the next level. The process of identifying my successor as Group Finance Director is already well underway.</p>
          <p>We announced in July this year a new profit target of &#xA3;1 billion for Retailing Services, and with this we also are committed to an increased level of memorandum disclosure. So for the half with TPF in at 100%, Retailing Services has made good progress delivering sales of &#xA3;1.7 billion, up 16.4%; and profits up &#xA3;200 million, up 26.5%. I will now run through each area giving an update of development and some new individual disclosure on sales and profits.</p>
          <p>I will start with what would be the largest component of Retailing Services, Tesco Personal Finance. Discussions with the FSA are progressing well and we expect to complete this acquisition shortly. In the growth numbers, TPF is obviously still reported as a joint venture, but from completion it will become a subsidiary. So for modeling purpose it will retain a December year-end for the time being.</p>
          <p>TPF total profits for the half were &#xA3;113 million and our share of profits after interest in tax, a 35.5 million of 34% on last year. The TPF business mix is solid and stable, and even in the challenging period for the financial services market it delivered strong results. We've also continued to add new products to our portfolio such as Travel Money Card and we've broadened the offer on Tesco Compare.</p>
          <p>Our high quality loan book has ensured we have not seen an increasing bad level &#x2013; bad debt level over the half. We've tightened our credit policies and, as this chart shows, arrears are pretty stable. The gap between TPF performances in the market was already wide and now it's growing. As you'd expect though, we're keeping a very close eye on this in the current climate.</p>
          <p>Tesco.com, which of course now includes direct, is performing well with strong sales growth of over 20%. Sales for the half were &#xA3;902 million and profits were &#xA3;48.4 million, up 21% on last year. Dot.com grocery availability and customer satisfaction are at their highest levels ever, and new customer numbers were up 11%. Following its launch last year, nearly half of all customers are now routinely choosing bag-less delivery. This is helping to make our picking process more efficient as well as helping to meet our targets for the reduction of carrier bags.</p>
          <p>Tesco Direct has started the year well with good growth in its second year of trading, almost a third of direct customers now collect their goods from a network of over 230 in-store desks. Direct is now the eighth most visited shopping website in the UK, up from tenth a year ago. And that's a great performance reflecting an increasingly &#x2013; an increasing popularity with our customers. Incidentally, the tesco.com website is fourth on the list.</p>
          <p>Tesco Telecoms has continued to build the foundations for a very substantial business, growing profitability by 8% to &#xA3;29 million and sales to &#xA3;299 million. Tesco Mobile remains the number one pre-pay network for customer satisfaction. It was the only major provider in the market to grow its customer base in the half.</p>
          <p>Okay, back to the numbers. This is a chart to show the progression of capital expenditure over the last five years. And let's start with the UK. UK CapEx rose to &#xA3;1.5 billion from &#xA3;0.9 billion last year, and this increase was driven by three main factors.</p>
          <p>The first is new mixed-use development schemes, accounting for 0.3 billion of that growth. And remember here that our initial outlay will be offset by substantial future receipts.</p>
          <p>Secondly, windfall stores, including more from summer field, accounted for another 0.1 billion and then more investment in energy-saving projects, which will have a rapid pay-back for us, accounted for a further 0.1 billion. These three things in total represented almost all of the year-on-year increase.</p>
          <p>This year the planned timing of UK CapEx is weighted towards the first half. In fact, we're expecting UK CapEx in the rest of the year to be around half of what we've spent in the first six months.</p>
          <p>Total Group capital expenditure during the first half of this year was &#xA3;2.5 billion. Total international capital expenditure rose to &#xA3;1 billion from 0.7 billion last year, reflecting our enlarged new store opening program and unfavorable exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>There was &#xA3;140 million of capital invested in the United States and we're expecting U.S. investment to be around &#xA3;330 million for the year. In line with our previous guidance, we expect Group CapEx this year to be between 4 and &#xA3;4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow was &#xA3;2.2 billion, up from 1.9 billion last year and 0.3 billion below CapEx. Overall, JVs and associates profit was &#xA3;43 million, up 34% on last year, driven by the strong TPF performance.</p>
          <p>Tax has been charged in its effective rate of 27.5% for the half. This is a good indication of our full-year tax rate, following the corporation tax rule change that took effect in April this year. You will remember that last year's rate was a little lower due to the impact of the rule changes on deferred tax.</p>
          <p>Net finance cost increased &#xA3;36 million on last year to &#xA3;88 million, excluding the impact of the net return on our pension schemes, assets and liabilities and the impact of IAS 32 and 39. Underlying net finance costs were up 35%, in line with net debt.</p>
          <p>Net debt has increased to &#xA3;7.4 billion from 6.2 billion at the end of last year. A third of this increase, 0.4 billion, is simply a result of exchange rates. Excluding exchange rate, we are committed &#x2013; yes, excluding exchange rate movements, we are committed to a target of &#xA3;8 billion net debt at the year-end, which means tightening things up a bit after the &#xA3;2 billion about to go out in Homever and TPF. This will mean that in an underlying sense, Tesco will be cash positive in the second half.</p>
          <p>To get back to the 8 billion, we are currently targeting a significant improvement in working capital, some disposals on non-core assets and lower CapEx in the second half. We are also looking at the near-term phasing of the buyback program.</p>
          <p>Moving on to pensions, the IFRS pension valuation has moved from 0.6 billion post tax deficit in February to 1.1 billion deficit at the half year. The change was driven by a reduction in corporate bond yields and an increase in the inflation assumption caused by an upward shift in the Bank of England yield curve. This movement has almost entirely reversed again in recent weeks. And as a result, our current IFRS deficit today has reduced back down to 0.7 billion, clear evidence of the volatility of this measure.</p>
          <p>Back in the real world, the trustees are currently undertaking their regular independent review of the funding of the scheme and is part of our triennial valuation is due to be completed in November. We expect the results of this review to show a relatively small deficit.</p>
          <p>In summary then, we've delivered a good performance in the first half, both in the UK and overseas. We've done so in challenging trading conditions and whilst carrying significant startup costs of new businesses, mainly the United States.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I will now hand you over to Terry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. Good morning everyone. Tesco has made good progress in the first half. Sales and profits have grown steadily and the growth has come from right across the group. And I am pleased about that because producing this kind of performance hasn't been easy. Consumers are under strain and are trying cope with rising costs, lower real incomes. As retailers we used to enjoy having the wind on our backs, but now it's in our face.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing the same cost pressures in our own business, whether it's rates or fuel of utilities bills, and we are carrying the necessary expense, as Andy said, of investing in future growth in the United States and China in Tesco Direct.</p>
          <p>It's a challenging background, but Tesco is at its best at times like these. We get the best out of the company when it's difficult, and I believe that these results are a clear demonstration of that. We've delivered this performance by keeping our focus on getting cheaper for customers, helping them spend less, keeping our costs down and by sticking to our strategy.</p>
          <p>Of course there will be more to do, there will be more to change, as it always is. We've got to stay close to customers and make sure that as they change, as their needs change, we change and keep our plans up to date.</p>
          <p>For strong companies like Tesco, tough times presents opportunities as well as challenges, and we've been able to use our strength to buy high quality assets, buy them well I think in these markets and push on our long-term strategy. The opportunities to go faster in TPF, Korea and with our new space pipeline, all came along at the same time. So there is quite a bit to digest all at once. But I am excited about the potential. We can manage it. These moves are ones we've been working on for a while. I suppose it took the arrival of the downturn to unlock them.</p>
          <p>I am going to begin my usual update this morning with International. We've made excellent progress there, not only in our established markets, but also with the early development at Fresh &amp; Easy and with our entry into India.</p>
          <p>Sales in International have increased again strongly, up 27% in the first half despite passing the anniversary of China's consolidation. Of course, favorable exchange rates helped in the sales line in Europe, less so in Asia. But we saw a positive overall like-for-like growth despite difficult trading conditions in a number of markets; you might mention that in Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Before initial trading losses in the U.S., International profits advanced very well supported by solid margin performance, both in Europe and in Asia. As a result, International again delivered half the increase in Group trading profit providing more evidence of the growing scale and profitability of our established oversees businesses and of course useful times like this to take us through any slowdown at home. Returns are on track, and I'll update you on those as normal at the year-end.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our businesses have delivered good growth, very good results despite worsening economic conditions and against last year's very warm summer weather in Central Europe, so it is a record good summer last year there, record bad one this year for what is worth. We've made good progress, our competitiveness has improved in the market, we've got strong market positions, growing capability in pan-European product sourcing and the flexibility of our multi-format approach is an advantage in these markets.</p>
          <p>I'm very encouraged by Hungary, as you know I've said before, the economy there has been pretty depressed for three years now, but we've been able to grow market share, sales and profits by adapting to the market that's investing hard to customers and building out the store network. In a way that's a good template for what we will have to do in any other market that's slow in the next year or so.</p>
          <p>Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic all did well helped by particularly good growth in smaller formats, which have been the backbone of the new space program in these countries in the last few years.</p>
          <p>Ireland delivered a good performance helped by our new composite distribution center at Donabate. Turkey enjoyed rapid growth as we built out the store network there. We added almost a third to our sales at constant rates. We opened our first hypermarkets in Istanbul and Ankara, they've gone well, and our first 1k store opened there. It's encouraging to do well in Istanbul and Ankara of course because the business originated and is best known in the South Western Izmir.</p>
          <p>I am pleased with our performance in Asia. Our two largest businesses, Korea and Thailand, both grew strongly in difficult markets for different reasons. Malaysia delivered an excellent performance, extending its leadership in the market through the successful re-launch of the Makro stores and a strong organic opening program and came strongly through to profits.</p>
          <p>In China, we've begun to put in place regional teams and infrastructure, which will provide the base for a larger scale business. So we are really focusing on the regional differences and putting the resources in &#x2013; on the ground that you need to do justice to China. And in Japan, our work on adapting the Express format for local consumers is coming together well and I believe we have a good model now to take forward in Japan.</p>
          <p>As usual, I am going to highlight the significant developments of the past few months using the six key elements of our international strategy, which you'll know is about being flexible, local, focusing on just a few countries, multi-formats, really concentrating on skill rather than scale, and building up the brand as you get to the right size.</p>
          <p>We've continued to build stronger positions in our existing markets through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisition. This year we will add almost 12 million square feet of space in international including the U.S., that's an increase of 25% in the year.</p>
          <p>The focused approach is behind our enthusiasm for the Homever acquisition in Korea. We know the business very well of course, it's a former Carrefour business. It was an opportunity to buy 36 high quality, mainly freehold hypermarkets. They were developed a lot of them in the mid-90s right in the Seoul capital, 3 million square feet of space, another 1.3 million of miles. For 30 million a store, now &#x2013; if we tried organically now to build a store of any sort in Seoul, you would be looking north of 60 million per development.</p>
          <p>Large synergies are available. The Homeplus format is the strongest in the market and we can now challenge the leadership in Korea with the combined businesses. We are not a particularly acquisitive business in Tesco as you know, but these opportunities in market acquisitions do create value and I'm confident this will prove to be one of the best deals we have done. We will start converting stores and integrating the two businesses in the next few weeks. We've had clearance &#x2013; competition clearance and we expect to complete the process well within the three years we've allowed.</p>
          <p>Being flexible in international expansion is about different ways to market and different ways forward. Our recent entry into India is a good example. Cash &amp; carry has potential in a very big market. We are going to start there with the aim of building &#x2013; it allows us to build a modern network of purchasing and supply chain and supply base. But at the same time, of course, we're getting involved indirectly in retailing through our franchise agreement with Tata, supporting the development of their Star Bazaar hypermarkets.</p>
          <p>Multi-format is a great strength at a time when customers of course are coping with high petrol prices and high crude prices and so they are leaving their car at home in some countries shopping locally. In Poland, we have seen very strong like-for-like growth in our small stores, over 7% in the first half. If we take the leader price stores, that means they've got combined growth of well over 50% since we acquired those stores.</p>
          <p>The same is happening in Express. It's got a uniquely competitive position in the convenience sector. International Express sales were up 52% in the period at constant rates, with a good like-for-like growth of around 5%.</p>
          <p>Having the skills to adapt formats to the needs of local customers is crucial. And you know that we believe capability, this kind of transfer of skill is behind the Fresh &amp; Easy format. I am very encouraged by the promising early performance of Fresh &amp; Easy. I was there last week coincidently.</p>
          <p>Customer response to our combination of fresh wholesome food at compensative prices in the neighborhood has been extremely positive. Our store number is now 90. We are growing rapidly. Feedback from new as well as regular shoppers &#x2013; we're still getting new shoppers every week and it continues to surpass our very highest expectations.</p>
          <p>As the chart shows, sales are building well. This is an update on the one we showed you in April for all stores. It looks at an index of average weekly sales per store, so it's per store rather than including new opening. The trend is particularly pleasing of course because good growth has continued through the annual somewhat difference sales in the western states. It gets so hot in some of those cities, actually people leave and then come back in October time, they become snowbirds, but despite that and despite the slow economy I am pleased that we have seen a constant increase in sales per store.</p>
          <p>What's driving this rising sales densities after just nine months? Average sales per week is already at $11, as you know the different definitions, but the U.S. average is somewhere around 8 to 9, $8.5 a square foot. So we are already well ahead of that. Our best stores are doing more than $25 a foot. The new store has actually opened since the spring. We started opening again in July. They've seen densities closer to $13 a foot. I think people are just more aware of Fresh &amp; Easy, we are probably launching them a bit better. Some of the small adjustments we made in terms of warmer store ambience, introduction of some promotions, a limited number of promotions, one or two range changes that will have probably helped.</p>
          <p>Our Riverside DC and kitchen I visited again. They are doing extremely well. It's absolutely unique facility, that campus, not just in the United States, let's say, but anywhere in the world. And it's really at the heart of the competitive advantage of the Fresh &amp; Easy business and there is plenty of capacity there. It can actually serve hundreds of stores, both the distribution center and the kitchen.</p>
          <p>So we have made a very good start. Clearly, there is more to do. It's the beginning of a long development, but I'm pleased to say that everything that we've learnt in practice has confirmed our expectations about the potential for Fresh &amp; Easy. In summary, international has had a strong first half.</p>
          <p>I would like now to turn to the UK where overall we made good progress, although it hasn't been easy. Consumers are feeling the strain of course from rising household bills. They're less confident because of everything they hear and read, but also because they've got less money to spend. And that's quite a big change.</p>
          <p>I believe Tesco is adjusting to it as well as anyone by doing what we do best, stay close to the customers, trade the business harder, adjust as customers need change. We've pushed down with reassessing the offer to meet their changing priorities with a real focus on helping them to spend less. There is no point in trying to sway them to spend more if they've got less money to spend. We've got a head-on cost in the business. We've got the cost base down. And as a result we've got solid sales growth, strong productivity in the business, good margin control and being able to deliver good solid numbers.</p>
          <p>We've invested a lot to improve the shopping trip. I'll highlight some of things we're doing because it isn't just about price and value, though obviously that's top of the agenda, but also we've made good headway on service and range and availability. The actual shopping trip is very, very strong at the minute in the business.</p>
          <p>Our price position is strong; a sustained program of price cuts this year so far covering thousands of products has helped improve it again. We've also put more investment into promotions; especially money-off-deals, people want a single price points and giving them prominence, more impact in store. And of course, there is more to come. Two weeks ago &#x2013; less than two weeks ago we introduced the biggest change to our grocery range for more than a decade with the launch of the discount brands at Tesco, 400 of them, probably 500 of them we finished. This is the second launch this week, some of them out there in the foyer.</p>
          <p>As you know, the range is higher in price and quality than Tesco Value, so if fits in beneath the standard Tesco brand, which matches the sort of international brands and value. People are increasingly familiar with this type of positioning, and it's got a very comprehensive coverage across the categories. We've also reduced the price on some other products. So we've moved on about 1,100 products overall. And the customer response so far has been very, very encouraging. They get the idea, and of course it's very timely.</p>
          <p>Service in our stores has also improved, 0.5 million more customers a week receiving our one-in-front promise; it's the real strength of the business. We've reduced queues at our checkouts using faster, more accurate scanners. They're being implemented during the during the year, and of course the checkout cameras that you know about. And we've got more self-service checkouts, which are very popular. By the way, those are working very well in the US as well. They now account for 20% of all transactions in the UK.</p>
          <p>On-shelf availability, being able to get what you want, has improved. Again it's actually been biggest year-on-year increase that I can remember. And more customers are able to buy everything they want when they shop at Tesco. So one of the ways we to look at is actually as a basket rather than a percentage, for each customer because they absolutely buy what they wanted. This increased investment for customer is being funded by good early work around costs, we got ahead of it. We are on track to deliver our planned 450 million of step-change savings. Now this helps us to deal with higher energy costs. I mean the UK bill for utilities in UK alone was 70 million higher in the first half, that's a bigger loss than the U.S. &#x2013; than a year ago, and we've had to absorb that within the business.</p>
          <p>Big benefit has come from picking up the pace on step-change. In store, we've made substantial savings from lower energy usage, so it's a good long-term. These fridges use 20% less electricity. We've seen big benefits from new checkout technology. In the supply chain, savings has come from better vehicle utilization such as double-deckers &#x2013; I mean that's a double-decker there, more efficient DCs, more shelf-ready packaging in the business and through the supply chain. These are sustainable reductions and we are looking for more going forward.</p>
          <p>The headwinds in non-food have strengthened in recent months. I am pleased to say Tesco has weathered it pretty well. Our customers recognize the quality, the breadth and the value on offer. Tesco's general merchandise sales have been less affected than most of the retailers in the current climate, and we've continued to see market share gains.</p>
          <p>We've made significant investments in lowering prices, careful management of mix, costs and inventory. That means that we've maintained solid margins and profitability. We are strong on that side of it. Sales have slowed with growth in the UK of 4% in the first half compared with 8% in the second half of last year. Total UK non-food sales increased to 4.1 billion, including 1.7 billion International Group sales were up 7% to 5.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Despite subdued markets we saw good growth in electricals. They were up 9% in the UK, particularly strong in computing, cameras. Entertainment sales were fairly robust, helped by the strength of the games market and the poor weather, as it happened. Toys were up, DIY was up. So it was a mixed picture.</p>
          <p>Our clothing brands, Cherokee and Florence &amp; Fred, outperformed a falling market. Actually, they strongly outperformed the falling market as well as the economic issues. Of course, the weather didn't help the clothing business. Actually internationally, our clothing sales rose 18% despite the bad weather in the summer because I think the new ranges there are reaching customers for the first time.</p>
          <p>Our recent agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland to take control of Tesco Personal Finance marks a milestone, a significant milestone for our Retailing Services. At the announcement in July of our agreement to acquire the remaining 50%, we set a target to grow the aggregate profit contribution from services to &#xA3;1 billion over the next few years, so a significant contributor to the growth in Tesco from the current levels of just under 400 million.</p>
          <p>It's a serious commitment, we're excited about it. We've done the groundwork in getting these businesses up and running and profitable. They are already substantial. TPF alone, as you know, is a &#xA3;200 million profit generator. But they offer potential to become even more material to Tesco in the future as they accelerate their rate of growth. Andy will move across, I'm delighted, to become Chief Executive of Retailing Services to drive this growth, leading an enlarged team of experienced senior managers.</p>
          <p>TPF had a good first half, resuming good profit growth, delivering a faster rate of product development. Broadening TPF's product portfolio, eventually evolving it into a full service retail bank, offers huge scope for long-term growth with the banking sector consolidating, looking to rebuild margins. It will turn out I believe to be very timely for us. And I know Andy and the team are looking forward to the challenge.</p>
          <p>Dot com is also in good form. Sales and profits grew well, both up over 20%, as did customer numbers, helped by early success of Tesco Direct. The catalogue has just relaunched again. It's very, very good, if you've not had a chance to see it. Very strong growth year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Building on the excellent performance of our first dot com only store at Croydon, some of you may have seen that. Now it takes well over &#xA3;1 million a week. We are opening the second one in Aylesford in Kent in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p>Telecoms did well with mobile and our branded businesses both seeing good growth. Pre-pay, as you know, has struggled as a market. So we've really bucked the trend there and we are rapidly expanding our network of in-store telecom centers. They do very well. We opened the first in Slough a couple of years ago, now 40 opened before Christmas.</p>
          <p>Before closing I want to talk about our work with communities and the environment. We strengthened our community program right across the Group. We've now got Community Champions in many stores. They've been one of the most successful things we've ever done in stores. They've really registered with staff and with local customers. We've got them in the UK, in the Czech Republic and in China.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight our work on sports in the UK. We are ahead of our target to have two million people physically active with Tesco in the run up to the Olympics in 2012. This year alone 750,000 primary school children took part in the Tesco Great School Run. Another 400,000 children participated in the Football Association Tesco Skills Program. That's been a fantastic success for five to eleven year olds. The World Cup is in the bag, I would say, actually. And we also continue to support Race for Life, with more than 18,000 Tesco staff participating and many more raising funds.</p>
          <p>Tesco's growth and willingness to invest during the current economic climate both in the UK and internationally is also good for communities because one of the most important products of that, of course, is job creation. We'll be creating 30,000 jobs around the Group, 6,000 here in the UK.</p>
          <p>We've made strong progress in demonstrating that a revolution in green consumption can best be achieved through information and incentives. For example, helping customers reduce the number of single-use carrier bags by well over 40% in just two years, 2 billion bags and we are well on track to reach 50%.</p>
          <p>We want the Sustainable Consumption Institute, which we've funded at Manchester University, to lead thinking in this area to assist people, to change from mass to green consumers. And we've recently appointed Professor Mohan Munasinghe, a Joint Nobel Prize Winner and Vice Chair of the IPCC, as its Director General. I'm very pleased about that.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, Tesco has continued to deliver strong growth. This has come from across the Group, reflecting the breadth and scale of our business. We've done it by staying close to customers and keeping our focus on investing hard in the things that matter to them now and by keeping our costs low to stay competitive. We've delivered for our shareholders and other stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Now these are uncertain times. But I'm confident that our business is well placed not just to cope with the challenges that lie before us, but also to grasp the growth opportunities open to us by continuing to invest in our strategy. Thanks. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Terry. Just open it up to everybody. I'll be using the microphones. Just put your hand up. <mark type="inaudible" />, traditionally the first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Three quick questions probably because you probably have answered them. But first of all, the time of the moving to banks, is it well-timed or sort of ill-timed? And do you view &#x2013; have you changed your plans since you announced that you're going to become more aggressive and what are your thoughts on new opportunities now after the turmoil?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the Korean acquisition, some might say is quite expensive, it wasn't so long ago you made an acquisition in Poland called HIT, which at the time looked expensive. Can you give us some numbers on how that's created value for the business to give us some sort of reassurance that Korea will be the same? And finally, the fact it's taken so long to replace Andy, apart from the obvious reasons and why is it taking so long? Does that mean that it's an external appointment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, do you want to talk about the banks and perhaps Terry take up Korea and Poland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He is not going to talk about himself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd never get on to the other question. Well, I think there are opportunities actually on the banking side. Clearly, I mean, the consumer situation is more difficult. But I think there has been a large loss of confidence in the banking system at the moment, which is not great for anybody. But I think would allow a new entrant if I can call TPF some opportunities. I think, also you are seeing the return of some more rational pricing in some areas. So I mean we're not in mortgages for a reason because we could never see a way of making money at the way that mortgages will be priced in the UK. And, I think you're seeing more sensible pricing, painful for consumers today but nevertheless more rational in terms of a business case for us.</p>
          <p>So I think there are good opportunities for the bank. I think the business we've got has been managed very conservatively, it's built gently up to sort of couple hundred million net profit a year but it's been done on a very cautious basis, nothing will be an appetite with consumers for a cautious bank. I mean, last week, we saw a doubling in the rate of the applications for savings products, for example. I think perhaps people see Tesco as a relatively safe place to leave their money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, Korea and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the thing about Korea is all the properties look expensive because it's such a particular property market as you know. The &#x2013; is very little land for development that you'd be knowing, <mark type="inaudible" />. And so 30 million a store is actually pretty good because we can compare it against the going in cost of our own business. So it compares very well on that basis, and particularly, as I said, when you take the fact that most &#x2013; many of them are in Seoul, it's very hard to get into Seoul now. You have to do very complex mixed-use developments and I mean, the script said 60 million. I'd say that's a conservative figure in terms of how much it would cost you to get a store opened in Seoul now.</p>
          <p>So actually in a Korean context, these are good value assets. How do you make money out of it is the normal way of an in-line acquisition. So you have to improve the margin through buying synergies, you have to take the distribution costs down, the overhead down, and you have to improve the sales densities. And so we've got a very strong plan around those things. We've done before, as you know, in a number of places. I think there is an added benefit in Korea in that it does give us a chance combined with a good opening program to challenge for the number one position there and to be number one in Korea, in a big, almost developed market is important for Tesco.</p>
          <p>You take HIT and I think in many ways, it's a safer acquisition than HIT. I think HIT was either double up or get out. A lot of retailers got out of Poland, we stayed in. As it happens, it's turned out well because the local currency strengthened enormously and property prices have gone forward. So actually the value of the investments in HIT is a very good one. It also allowed us to stay in Poland and work our way through to sort of a leading position where we can &#x2013; we're certainly the most profitable retailer in Poland. But actually, I think Korea is altogether a stronger, more solid bet as an acquisition. Andy, did you want to say anything?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andy, I mean I'd just like to say he's done a tremendous job since taking over from the previous incumbent, so <mark type="inaudible" />. And we are expecting him to do that for several months. Obviously, these processes, you look at external and internal candidates and I am sure there will be a strong demand to fulfill land issues. So I think we are in a good position on both fronts. Andy starting a new area and we will find a competent and finally a good replacement. On the right, lady there.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Caroline Gulliver here from Execution. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the Discount brands that you've introduced in the UK, particularly, the price differential between Tesco standard brand, the Discount brand, and then Tesco value, and what sort of cannibalization you expect between the different brands or whether you expect to take purely market share from Aldi, et cetera? And also if it's successful, do you plan to roll it out internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, interestingly, our experience in this type of an exclusive brand began in Central Europe and over the &#x2013; obviously, it's more of a home turf of limited-range discounters with their use of exclusive house brands. And so shoppers are more familiar with it. And so the first task of the Pan-European buying team was actually to develop a range to match a limited-range discounter for the Central European market, which has gone well, some of which were sold in the UK and they've been in the business for a little over a year.</p>
          <p>So we took that up a notch as the economy slowed here. And we started, as I said in April, to reset the business and to develop a fuller range. Part of it actually was because of developments in categories, actually as international brands, Procter &amp; Gamble, Walkers, these types of people, perhaps they got better at what they do. It was hard for a single-owned label to keep up with them in terms of quality, but also be able to fight at the bottom of the market. So a gap opened up, quite a big gap.</p>
          <p>And these exclusive house brands were coming in-between value, which was the cheapest entry point price, and where own brand was having to be to actually match the international brands. And so you were filling really a strategic gap as well as a sort of tactical move for this market. So we developed them pretty quickly. As I say, we already had some and then we've added to them. And they've gone in. The interesting thing is, if you look at the ones that we already had, they are growing anyway at 30% year-on-year. If you add the new range to it, and that's now our discounter range, that's our discounter in a Tesco, it's growing 70% year-on-year; it's also bigger than Aldi. So the sales of those products in Tesco are bigger than Aldi in the UK.</p>
          <p>So it's bigger and growing fast, and I only make that point because it's not as if there's some great sort of strategic change people going off to Aldi, it's a completely natural process faced with high food inflation, pressure on spending, people are having to change how they shop which includes downtrading, which includes shopping around. And you got to respond to that and then say to people, look, actually, all the shopping, all the value you need is here in Tesco. Many people know that already, that's why we're bigger than Aldi and growing faster in that range than Aldi; some people don't, they've gone and shopped around. But I believe they'll come back with this range. And so we will have some trading down. But we'll actually get the volume and get the customers. And that's the most important thing to do is to keep the customers, accept the trading down as it's going to happen, keep the customers, and then eventually people feel a bit better off and you get the trading back up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And if I may, just one follow-up question. Just actually different question, on the US, first of all congratulations, how many stores do you expect to open in the second half? Are you still on track for your plans there and any plans to go into other areas outside of the West Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the &#x2013; we're keeping the same targets. We're opening up at a good rate. I think we opened four stores this week. As you know, we've got a firm plan to go north into Northern California. And so we've no plans beyond the West Coast at this time. There's plenty of capacity in the facilities that we've put in. I mean we're hindered a bit obviously by the extreme slowdown in cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas and what they call the Inland Empire. But we've never known anything different, because we opened up into that slowdown. And most people expect that in a year or two, you will start to see those cities resume growth again and it will all be to the good. It is a plus side, it is easier to get properties. Obviously it's taken a lot of the trough out of the property market. So actually getting locations and getting them at more reasonable prices is easier going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If you could just say which company you're from, that would help us in &#x2013; if there is any follow-up required. So I think you've had your hand up, I'll come over there next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. John Kershaw, Merrill Lynch. I had two questions. First, I suppose following on from the Discount brands, Terry, clearly uncertain times, getting visibility is difficult in the UK at the moment, but can you give us your sense for what is worth in terms of the &#x2013; how do you think the consumer is going to play? And as perhaps some of the inflation comes offs, can we see volumes pickup and the Discount brands kick in or should we still be expecting at the lower end to stay at the 3 to 4% guidance range in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And in terms of International, clearly, presumably give us a bit of color on inflation, because some of the like-for-like numbers seem to have come up quite sharply. So how the volume dynamics are going there? And the incremental things you can do to keep the P&amp;L turning in a positive momentum, because I think last year, certainly Europe in the first half benefited some one-off costs. And so just <mark type="inaudible" /> how we see the momentum continuing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it doesn't help me much to speculate overly on the consumer. I think as I said is, the good thing is the population of Britain doesn't change much. At this Christmas, there will be the same number of people as last Christmas, give or take. They'll still be coming in through your doors. They'll just be looking to buy different things and they'll be looking to spend a different amount of money. You've just got to come to terms with them. So it's much more important that each week, you make sure that your plans are relevant and appropriate and connect with customers right there.</p>
          <p>And so it's interesting that after 10 years of deflation, a lot of marketing techniques in our business, I know this too, have been to persuade people to spend a little bit more. That's why things like three for a price and so on and so forth came into the market. If you look at how we &#x2013; when we do Clubcard mailouts, we know what kind of things people buy and we persuade them to buy something that they might buy extra. A lot of those techniques are not relevant today. People, because of high inflation, they've already spent as much as they're going to spend. So your main focus should actually be to keep them as customers and keep the volume up. And so changing the techniques is the most important thing to concentrate on and keep a happy customer even though they're spending a bit less with you and then keep your costs under control and learn to live on the takings that you have.</p>
          <p>Now we're helped because it's food. It's basic essentials. People will continue to spend on it. And there is a bit of inflation. It's not as high as the spike, but there is some inflation. When inflation spike too high, it was counterproductive anyway, because it destroys people's sense of value, they get disorientated, they start trading down in an unplanned way, because they just have to cap what they can spend. So actually, a little bit of inflation is more stable than some of the spikes in inflation that you've seen.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Europe, on International. Well, I said the last time I think to <mark type="inaudible" /> question. You got this unusual thing. Because of high impacts in International, you've got lower like-for-likes when a network is being developed out, then when the market gets closer to full development, you get higher like-for-likes and less total growth in the country. So you're always going to get low like-for-likes in the developing economies unless you got an exceptional boom like in China.</p>
          <p>And that &#x2013; but this year, there was an additional feature in Europe in that over there, although the economies were growing, consumers started to feel the high food prices and the high petrol prices. And so they switched their shopping habits a bit. So they switched &#x2013; they are shopping in smaller shops at the minute. Now we benefit to the extent that we've got small shops. But chains like Biedronka that have only got smaller shops, they will be doing a little bit better. And again, I think, you'll come through that. I don't think it's a long-term thing. I don't think it's any strategic issue about big stores. It's just at the minute people are leaving their car in the garage in those countries.</p>
          <p>But our position in Europe is good. The profitability is good. Actually our price position is sharp and as we bring in our clothing ranges, which are very popular, improve our hard lines business, that keeps the vitality and the attractiveness of the big stores up as well. So when people feel a bit better off, they'll come through. As I said in the presentation, Hungary's been terrible for three years. We had this in the first year and we've come to terms with and done very well in the last couple of years.</p>

          <p>Yes, no, I think that's what we plan around and I wouldn't worry too much about trading down, as I think, Andrew, I've never myself worried much about the difference between cash take and volume, because it's pretty elastic anyway. And all that happens is when inflation gets above a certain figure, people trade down anyway. And as the inflation comes back down again, the trading down will ease a bit. And even though the discounted range drives that process, it's not across a massive percentage. Remember that you are in single-digit percent within our mix. And so &#x2013; yeah, it causes a bit of overall trading down, but nothing that you can't handle. And you get the dividend of higher volume, people get a stronger sense of price and value and affordability, and you attract a few more customers in.</p>
          <p>So I think it's perfectly possible to produce figures in the three to four range. And clearly, we've got to set out our plans in the event that you get a short period below that figure, because obviously this week, I mean people are pretty gloomy about the economic outlook. So we can't rely on any particular figure, but that's the range that we plan it.</p>

          <p>It looks to me like it's above and beyond the normal promotion environment in Ireland at the moment. Can you just make a few comments, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean Ireland is everything that you are seeing in the UK, but sort of on a bigger scale. So it started the year at sort of 7% growth in the economy and it's come down much faster than the UK and so it's declining because it's got much bigger property base. It's declining faster than the UK. We are helped a bit by having good top-line growth. We are building out the network there. So that helps defray overhead and so on. And we've got good margin control.</p>
          <p>But in the last &#x2013; through the summer &#x2013; and again now helped by the weather, sales have been hard to come by. I think that Dunnes have reacted to that in the short term. They've done that before in Ireland. The thing to do in Ireland is not if you can avoid it to get into kind of tit-for-tat things, but actually to address what's going on long term and make sure that people &#x2013; again, like the UK, you are giving them the products at the prices they can afford week in, week out, rather than sort of bribing them to buy what they used to buy, but now can't afford to buy. And so it will settle down in Ireland.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Jaime Vazquez from JPMorgan. Three very quick questions today. Can you please quantify the non-food space growth in the UK? Secondly, whether the 4.2 billion CapEx guidance for the full year still applies? And thirdly, give us a hint &#x2013; sorry, some help with the petrol effect on the EBIT margin in the UK? And perhaps related to that, please remind us if you sell petrol internationally and how much of sales is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can help out, Andy, chip in. Non-food space growth is higher than overall space growth. So if you take non-food on a like-for-like basis at the moment in the UK, it would be into small negative &#x2013; small negative, not large. And so we get to 4% by the space growth.</p>
          <p>The petrol &#x2013; CapEx guidance, we included that in the presentation of 4 to 4.5 for the full year, billion. So that was that. And petrol, I mean obviously first half &#x2013; and the interesting thing is in a funny sort of way that the inclusive figure, the inc. petrol number, in a funny sort of way represents more what customers are actually spending. But in terms of its impact on margins, as you could see in the first half, our margins were flat in the UK. So we've managed through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the gist of your question that it would be beneficial to margins?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, we &#x2013; I mean, we never give that as a separate number obviously. But as you say, the actual experience in the first half was that we managed the margin to a flat position. And the petrol effect elsewhere is not huge. There is a bit in Europe, Ireland, Central Europe, but it's pretty small in the context of everything.</p>

          <p>A few questions. Firstly, a couple of years ago you set a returns target, I think your <mark type="inaudible" /> on a returns basis. Having the expenditure of the last few months both CapEx and forthcoming acquisition, how would you guide us in terms of your Group returns for the next two or three years? I think you talked about 200 basis points of appreciation a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p>And then on the UK, following the last couple of questions, are we reaching a point where CapEx in the UK actually peaks and how do you see your position in terms of its maturity as a business in the UK going forward?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, there's been a couple of question on sales in the UK. But how do you see the trading environment in the UK going forward for the next quarter or two? From a pricing perspective, how challenging do you think the environment is, is it normal, whatever?</p>
          <p>And lastly, you seem to be talking or writing anyhow quite positively about Japan in your statement, perhaps the most positive you've ever been. Has the Japanese trial ended and are you now in a roll out mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, do you want to start on returns and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, our overall returns number will, of course have been &#x2013; we didn't know we'd be buying the bank. We didn't know we'd be buying in Korea and so on and so forth. So I think we will have to adjust the former there. So the good news is the underlying, if you strip those out, the royalties continue to go up quite nicely, actually. And it may be a good subject for us to return to, in terms of demonstrating that perhaps around the year-end. So I think we are pleased with the way that's going. As I say, we'll be hit obviously in the near term by the acquisitions. And such a long question, what was the....</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think CapEx has peaked in the UK. I think, as Andy said, there may have been a spike because of mixed-use schemes. And we've got quite a program of mixed-use schemes. So we won't be adding a lot to those for the moment. I mean, if you look at it, the space now, just looking at a table, it's gone from 30% outside the UK in '99 to 65% outside the UK.</p>
          <p>And I think this year, <mark type="inaudible" />, correct me, but we're adding with acquisitions 12 million square feet outside the UK and a couple of million inside the UK. So you can see what's happening. So the opportunities to invest in space are more outside the UK. And there is also the arbitrage that you can sell a fully-valued, fully-developed 50,000 square foot store in the UK and you can get 0.5 million square feet for that same money in China or in other parts of the world. So it's a good property play as well as being where you're going to get your growth from.</p>

          <p>Yes, pricing going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just different &#x2013; a little bit different in nature. I think people are focusing on a different sort of customer and getting on with it. I think the reality is that if you've got for whatever reason a good price image or price is your main play, forget the reality. But if that's the image, you've got a bit of a following wind at the minute. If you haven't, you've got a bit of a headwind. If you're somebody that's got a mix where you sell up market gear and so on, you're going to get a bit more downtrading than somebody who hasn't.</p>
          <p>I think rather than tit-for-tat, you've just got to concentrate on your customer and make sure you're actually, as I say, well attuned to what they need to buy and what they're prepared to spend money on and make sure that you attract more customers than you lose. Now actually Tesco is attracting more customers than we lose. Even on the dimension of price, we attract more customers than we lose. But traditionally, in the normal cycle, we attract many more than at the moment. And so the purpose of the discounter range is to reverse that a little bit and to get some more customers back on the price dimension. And I think that's possible.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; as I say, the main issue will be for businesses to come to terms with the customer that's out there now. I think if your costs are set up or your ranging is set up for a customer in 2007, I think you've got a problem. It's interesting the big brands, no disrespect to them, but they're big machinery. And what's coming into the market at the minute are products conceived in 2007 and they are inappropriate, many of them. They are too high priced. They've got too many bolt-ons and add-ons. And it's just interesting to see it from another dimension. You've got to quickly readjust.</p>
          <p>The launch of the discounter range is a good reminder to the big brands to say, you can't just go pushing prices up no matter how strong your market share is because the customers and others will be going somewhere else and selling them different things. And I think that too will help bring the inflation thing under control as we bring people around to the reality of the market that's out there.</p>

So it sounds like he is blundering around the market, looking for opportunities.</p>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I think we're much &#x2013; we've learnt a lot there. I think we've &#x2013; the systems are in now and starting to produce. We are pleased with the response to the Tesco Express formats we opened out there. And we think we've got something in that that means we can push on. And so yes, we are looking for opportunities now to push on and give the management team a chance and give all that learning a chance. I think we've learnt a lot over the last few years and are ready to push on at least at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. James Grzinic from Dresdner Kleinwort. A couple for Andy really. The first one is, can you maybe give us more details on the working capital improvement you expect in the second half, the magnitude and the nature of them? The second one is, in terms of thinking about launching a fully-fledged banking offer, what would be the implications in terms of funding, in terms of the Group balance sheet? And do you think that customer deposit, per se, could be the big drivers of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean working capital not in particular &#x2013; I mean I think it's just right across the broad. We're going to be looking at cash management and I think that's &#x2013; you'd probably find every finance director would be telling exactly the same thing really. So I think we'll just be looking at all sources. I think I have got a long list. I mentioned working capital is part of it. We will be, as I say, cutting CapEx a bit and just running a tighter ship, I think that's right and proper at the present time.</p>
          <p>On banking, we've got several things we have to do. One of the things, of course, is to move to our own systems platform over time. So our ability to do much in the near term is going to be quite limited. But in terms of the funding, yes, I think more and more you'll be looking at a much more traditional looking kind of bank where customer deposits are taken in and lent out in a conservative way. I think that's the way the whole market's going to have to go, by the way.</p>
          <p>So I think that the bank will largely be self-funding. I think we'll have clear limits in terms of what it can or can't turn to the Group for in terms of any additional funding. But yes, it's going to have to be largely self-funding in its own way. I think most banks will have to go the same way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Yes, a couple of questions, please. Just a follow-up on the working capital, in the first half, can you just clarify a little bit on what was the impact of FX on the working capital improvement? That's the first one. And the second one...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second one is more on the UK market again. Inflation, if you could help us, what was it in the first half? You were making some comments about slowing down of inflation. Can you talk a little bit about that? And then finally, in the UK, as you look at sort of next 12 months or so, where do you expect the growth to be in the UK industry, sector aggregate? Do you see some slow down, do you see volumes coming back in the market? What sort of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While Andy reminds himself of the FX effect on working capital in the first half, which is one of the many figures he has at the front of his mind, I'll deal with the second question. The &#x2013; we don't &#x2013; we didn't publish a figure on inflation. Actually, it wouldn't have been that useful. If we just got an average inflation figure for the first half, it would have been wrong because there was no week when inflation was actually at that average. It went up in a big spike and came down. If you want to know, the government published their food inflation figures. The reality I think on the measure that we have, which is a bigger measure, was on average about 2% lower than that.</p>
          <p>As you know, when we add non-food into our total mix, which is deflation, that brings it down again. So you basically peak the kind of high-single digits, and you've come off a couple of percent into mid-single digits. So it's &#x2013; the slowdown is sort of well established in that sense. It won't go to deflation or no inflation. You can actually see where the sort of commodity effects lie going forward. And two, you won't get deflation on non-food anyway. That will start to come through to no inflation or slight inflation going forward.</p>
          <p>I mean, outlook for the consumer, it's interesting because this is the anniversary of Northern Rock. So you're actually coming up against the first big step-down in consumer spending in the UK and the first big peak in price sensitivity. So whilst it's not to say it doesn't carry on, you do annualize these things, and as long as you've adjusted to it in terms of you're offered any cost base, you can kind to say, well, this is the new reality. I think there's quite a lot for Tesco to play for in the autumn. I don't think our trading form was great last autumn. I don't think we've handled necessarily the inflation that was in there and the change in the consumer as quickly as we might. We spoke a bit about that at the year end and how we were resetting the business. So I think there is quite a lot for us to play for this autumn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, in terms of market shares, do you &#x2013; when do you expect to see sort of stabilizing? We were still using TNS of course here as market share proxy, when do you start to see market shares gaining back into sort of market share gains rather than stabilizing...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on our measures of TNS, so how we look at it, we get &#x2013; we're still gaining market share, but not as you say at the sort of rates that we were doing when we had the wind on our back. I think in a period of when it's all about price and people are searching and changing their shopping behavior in search of price, it's going to favor people whose only image is price. I think we can crawl that back a bit by changing what we do. We've begun that process. We're accelerating the process. We do know how to do it and so I think we would like to get back into pretty solid, if not spectacular, market share progression.</p>
          <p>But you've also got to remember that it's in the context of where the Group is going and the Group is going and putting its space internationally. And for the very simple reason that in the end, it's going to be easier, more profitable for us to gain market share in these developing economies than go on growing market share forever in the UK.</p>
