        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to the TD Bank Financial Group's Fourth Quarter 2009 Investor Presentation. My name is Tim Thompson, and I'm head of Investor Relations at the Bank. We'll begin today's presentation with strategic remarks from Ed Clark, the Bank's CEO, after which Colleen Johnston, the Bank's CFO will present our fourth quarter operating performance. Bharat Masrani, Group Head U.S. P&amp;C Banking and Bernie Dorval, Group Head Global Insurance are unable to attend today due to unforeseen personal commitments. We are delighted to have Steve Boyle CFO of U.S. P&amp;C Banking with us. Steve will provide an update on our integration initiatives and business growth in the U.S. P&amp;C segment. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality. After that we'll take questions from those present and from pre-qualified analysts and investors on the phone.</p>
          <p>Also present today to answer your questions are Bob Dorrance, Group Head Wholesale Banking; Bill Hatanaka, Group Head Wealth Management and Tim Hockey, Group Head Canadian P&amp;C Banking who will also take questions on insurance in Bernie's absence. As in the past, we're trying to keep the call to about one hour with Ed, Colleen, Steve and Mark's comments taking up about half that time.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page two. We know that this presentation contains forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what's discussed. These statements are presented for the purpose of assisting our shareholders and analysts and understanding our financial position as at and for the periods ended on the day it's presented and our strategic priorities and objectives and may not be appropriate for other purposes.</p>
          <p>Certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these statements. For additional information, we refer you to our Q4 2009 and annual MD&amp;A. These documents include a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ and can be found on our website at td.com.</p>
          <p>Let me turn the presentation over to Ed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. So Colleen is going to be up shortly and she is going to describe in more detail, how we did in the fourth quarter and how we did in the year overall.</p>
          <p>My comments are slightly longer than they would normally be and I apologize for that but there seemed to be a number of things that we have to cover at the year end. But before I get into the business I want to just make some comments on a personal note, we've had some inquires of why I was absent from a couple of conferences that I would normally attend.</p>
          <p>While I have had a recurring back problem for some years now and for those of you who had to deal with back problems you know that you always sit and try to figure out whether to have surgery or when to have surgery. Since in my case as you know I intend to stick around on this job for a number of years now, postponing surgery and waiting until I retire wasn't really a realistic option. So when I decided I did need surgery I concluded I might as well do it right away. I have a great team, perfectly capable of running the bank without me and it seemed to me this was a good time to do that. So that is I have been absent for about a month off work because of that. For those who are inquiring the surgery was a complete success and I am back at work full of energy but I do appreciate people who are expressing concern.</p>
          <p>So let me talk about 2009 the performance in 2010 and then look ahead in what I think some of the developments later in 2010. Really we have a remarkably good year despite the fact that it started off with some pretty tough market conditions. And if given how we felt at the end of the year, I have to say who would have actually thought that we'll be announcing a record year for the TD Bank, by almost every measure our performance did exceed our expectations.</p>
          <p>I had always thought that the bank was well positioned for a tough environment but I have to say even I was surprised by the resiliency and the adaptability of the bank in all parts of it. Of course I do want to know that all our success is underpinned by our people. As you know I firmly believe that you can have the best strategy in the world but at the end of the day the real difference is do you have a talented team that can actually execute that strategy. So given it's a year end, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 74,000 employees for all their unbelievably hard work during the year in which they faced really frankly unprecedented challenge I'm extremely proud of what they all delivered.</p>
          <p>And what is it that they delivered? Record adjusted earnings of $4.7 billion even though our loan loss provisions more than doubled. And adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% despite the fact that last quarter we issued additional shares. Our balance sheet that's incredibly strong with Tier 1 capital 11.3% with over 75% of it in Tangible Common Equity. And adjusted return on risk weighted assets that's one of the best in the industry at 2.27%. The best customer service in North America is shown by JD power and Synovate wins and during, 2009 more evidence of being great operators. A record low efficiency ratio of 50% in TD Canada Trust, 24 new branches in Canada, 33 new stores in United States, another 75 client facing advisors in Wealth and 155 new business bankers in Canada. And of course the successful integration of our two U.S. banks. In 2009, we demonstrated that with the right strategy and dedicated employees there are ways strong businesses can perform even in a tough economy.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on each of our businesses. Once again we had excellent performance in retail in Canada and in the United States. We hit almost $4 billion in adjusted retail earnings for the second year in a row. That is a fantastic foundation for our bank and you're going to see those earnings grow from here. In Canada, TD Canada Trust continues to deliver great results in spite of a challenging economic environment driven by our consistent focus on offering unparalleled convenience and legendary customer service. And as you heard at our investor session in October we continue to take market share.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Wealth and Wholesale businesses, they both have been helped by improving market conditions. The <mark type="inaudible" /> in wealth, robust trading volumes continue to help offset the effects of low normal interest rates and the resulting margin compression. And we're beginning to feel the positive effects of the equity markets rebound in our asset-based businesses.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale the unprecedented market conditions over the past two years, I believe have validated our strategy. We've built a dealer focused on franchise businesses that is designed to be profitable even in adverse market conditions. After a tough 2008, who would have guessed the TD Securities would post the kind of record breaking year we've seen in 2009. Importantly, all the while reducing risk and further focusing our franchise on franchise business. With the changes we've implemented this year in Wholesale, I think we've reached the point where no further strategic adjustments are required. We feel we've built the dealer model of the future; one that's a less vulnerable to changes in regulatory capital requirements. In the United States, after more than a year and a half of incredibly hard work, we've completed the integration of Commerce and TD Banknorth achieving our goal of uniting our U.S. operations under one brand from Maine to Florida. Now Steve is going to comment in more detail. But this was an extremely complex and demanding integration and the team delivered to the highest possible standard on hundreds and hundreds of projects.</p>
          <p>However, we have to acknowledge that we did experience delays in overnight processing shortly after the integration weekend. Now we know that these delays impacted our customers and for that we are truly sorry. However, I am incredibly pleased with how the team responded. We came together as one organization that worked incredibly hard to identify the problem and come up with a solution and then worked hard to make things right for our customers. Our reactions to the batch delays will only reinforce our leadership position in convenience and service. However, changes from conversion and batch delays heightened customer reaction and we tend to see those reactions immediately in our customer surveys. But our Customer WOW! Index today has bounced back from where it was after the conversion weekend and we continued to see improvement in that metric.</p>
          <p>I just want to say that the team in the United States and across the bank that supported them and I'm truly WOW-ed by the outstanding job done by Bharat and his team and everyone and else involved in making the integration such a great success. Now, I have been asked by investors &#x2013; are you pleased with where you are in the United States. Steve is going to review our progress shortly, but let me say that I'm very pleased with our actual business model. Today, we are operating a better bank in the United States. Our fundamental business strategies are delivering and we have an organic growth engine, a strong deposit base, a growing loan book and significant cross-sell opportunities.</p>
          <p>Combined with our ownership position in TD Ameritrade, which has been a huge financial and strategic success, our prospects for growth in United States are excellent. But it is important to acknowledge that we aren't earning our cost of capital in the United States. And frankly, a long recession and a slow recovery is not going to help us. But lot's happened since we announced the Commerce acquisition in October 2007. Back then, we thought we could earn $1.2 billion in 2009 and we are coming in at just over $900 million, which isn't bad when you compare our performance to other major U.S. banks. But clearly, we did not anticipate the severity of the downturn that has occurred. On a pre-provision basis, we think we delivered pretty much in line with our original expectations and considering our business model is one that leveraged convenience and service to drive deposit growth we have to acknowledge, it's much harder to deliver earnings from that deposit base in a very low nominal rate environment. But we do see upside when the headwinds of the low margins and higher PCL's begin to ease. So, overall, we think we got a two year delay in getting our ROIC up to our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>On that note let me look, move to our outlook. At the beginning of 2009, I said that the recession was like a valley. We didn't know how wide or deep it was, but we need to get across it with our business model intact and momentum on our side. We're confident that our business model will survive the downturn. What we're wrestling with now is how long the recovery will take and what that means for us as we recover. In effect, what kind of recovery are we going to have? We want to ensure we continue to deliver growth. So our attention is focused on how we build our momentum coming out of 2009.</p>
          <p>For deposit-rich, retail-focused bank like TD, there are four key factors that will determine our earnings from here. One, provisions for loan losses; two, the actual level of nominal interest rates; three, the degree of normalization that occurs in capital markets and four, our rate of organic growth which is driven by consumer and business confidence and the underlying nominal GDP growth in Canada and in the United States. So let me briefly touch on each of these factors.</p>
          <p>In terms of loan loss provisions we think they'll increase in 2010 as unemployment continues to rise. We see them peaking first in our Canadian personal unsecured businesses. In the Canadian commercial as in previous recessions those losses should likely lag. So we do expect increases from the extremely low levels that have occurred so far. But we see them peaking at levels well below those that we've seen in previous recessions. In the United States we expect that loan losses will continue to increase from here, but at a much lower rate. Peaking at the end of 2010 and then in 2011 gradually trailing off.</p>
          <p>Before I move on, let me just address another topic which has recently risen. Earlier this week a report was published highlighting that loan portfolio disclosures in our U.S. regulatory filings deferred from that in our financial disclosures. Now this is actually not new news, but it seems to be for some. Our financial disclosure provides what we consider to be a more accurate representation of the risk within our portfolio. In addition to our Commercial Real Estate portfolio, our Commercial and Industrial portfolio includes loans that have real estate as collateral.</p>
          <p>We assess the risk, our credit risk of a borrower based on the strength of their underlying business and its ability to repay the loan with real estate collateral representing the secondary source of repayment. As a result, we classify according to the industry of the borrower since we believe this provides analyst, investors a superior indication of the credit risk that we're taking. This practice is consistent with what many large industry players follow.</p>
          <p>Moving to interest rates, in some ways the very thing that's fueling results in Wholesale, very low interest rates is hurting our retail businesses. Given that fact, we see 2010 is something of a transition year on our mix of earnings as we start to see rate increases. We think they will come in the latter part of 2010, which means that they won't have a material impact on our retail results until 2011. Given the unpredictable and extremely competitive nature of the capital markets, forward-looking observations about our Wholesale bank are difficult indeed. However, after such an extraordinary year, we would expect Wholesale earnings to start moving back down to more normalized level. But if rates stay low and volatility persist, we could see a continuation of above average returns. And stronger markets mean the tailwind of higher assets values should help our Wealth Management business as well.</p>
          <p>Moving to organic growth we still think, we see growth in 2010 but at a pace that's in line with recovery but slower growth in the economies in both United States and Canada. So that means continued new volume growth but slowing from where we are today. We still though and it's important to realize this had the tailwind of strong organic growth in 2009. Business which is already on the books but already will in fact meet some earnings growth in 2010. We'll see a negative impact on the Canadian dollar of our U.S. operations as long as we see higher value of the Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>So you might think on balance this paints a pretty gray picture of the year ahead. It certainly identifies our challenges but at the same time I don't want to overstate these challenges. We learnt two lessons in the past year. First you can have positive surprises in a challenging year and second you can always figure out other ways to outperform. We are entering 2010 with very strong capital position and that is a great place to be whereas &#x2013; while governments and regulators around the world review capital requirements. We believe it's prudent to maintain strong capital ratios given this current environment, the truth is no one really knows where these rules will come out, but there is a real risk that they will require higher capital levels in different definitions of capital. TD and the other Canadian banks are going to these changes in a position of absolute strength and will likely be less impacted by any changes compared to other banks in the rest of the world. We have also got that solid foundation of retail earnings that I mentioned earlier. So as we go down into 2010, we continue to work hard to grow revenues and keep expenses well-contained and then we should see the positive effects of our embedded earnings from PCL declines and interest rate increases coming through starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, I think a word about compensation is probably appropriate. All of us have been sensitized the importance of ensuring that our compensation plans, reward behavior which adds value for our shareholders over the long-term and avoids excessive risk. While compensation plannings matter, strategy matters even more. And as you know TD's business strategy has been relentlessly focused on taking out tail risk and resisting market pressures to meet short-term earnings expectations, which involves sacrificing long-term value for incurring excessive risk. Nevertheless, it is important that compensation plans are aligned to strategy and reinforce the desired behavior. Our compensation plans already rewarded appropriate behavior by acquiring large equity holdings by executives paying a significant proportion of variable compensation in equity and requiring the CEO to hold his required equity for two years post retirement. As a result of the financial crisis we've undertaken a thorough review of our plans and had discussions with some of our major shareholders. This review has resulted in some fine tuning which we'll outline in this year's proxy circular.</p>
          <p>The key changes we made were designed to ensure that we're fully compliant with the Financial Stability Board guidelines and more explicitly factor in risks taken when determining compensation awards. As for the level of compensation at TD, the cost of senior management has steadily declined over time as a percentage of adjusted earnings and revenues. If we look at incentive compensation the same way, incentive compensation has also declined. Incentive compensation growth this year reflects the spring-back in Wholesale earnings and the full year inclusion of Commerce. As a percentage of adjusted earnings and revenue, incentive compensation has fallen by about 10% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>So overall, how am I feeling about 2010? Well I'm feeling pretty good about TD. We still see some significant headwinds that demand a certain amount of caution. The market has bounced back more strongly than we would have thought. But we think the underlying economic conditions will remain lackluster for the foreseeable future. And we know that many of our customers face hardships as a result. So we've said before, we intend to stick by our customers and clients in these tough times. But against that background, we believe that still TD has still enormous earning potential, which we will see later in 2010 and end of 2011. We are emerging from the financial crisis and resulting economic recession with our business model intact and momentum on our side.</p>
          <p>On that note I'll turn things over to Colleen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ed, and good afternoon. Let me first take you through the results for the full year before we address the fourth quarter. So please turn to slide four. You should note that Q1 opening retained earnings and Q1 and Q2 results for 2009 were adjusted due to the implementation of the amendment to CICA Handbook Section 3855 which relates to the reclass of available-for-sale debt securities to loans. The related general allowance impact was a 59 million after-tax impact to the opening retained earnings and a combined 132 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share cost taken over Q1 and Q2. I will go into further detail on this reclass later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>So, back to the results, 2009, for the second year in a row, our retail franchise had total adjusted earnings of just under four billion. Wholesale banking had a record year with earnings over 1.1 billion, well above the earnings of 65 million last year. Corporate segment losses of almost 400 million on an adjusted basis up from 2008 mainly due to lower tax benefits and higher unallocated corporate expenses. Adjusted EPS for 2009 was 535, up 10% compared to last year. Impressive performance in light of the global recession this year and capital issuance during the year. Tier 1 capital ratio continues to be very strong, 11.3%. During 2009, we added 4.7 billion of qualifying Tier 1 capital common, preferred and innovative while reducing RWA by 22 billion, or 10%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide five, Q4 2009 highlights. Total bank adjusted net income was 1.3 billion, a new record, up 97% from last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter $1.46, 85% increase from Q4 of '08 and down 1% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Total adjusted retail earnings just shy of one billion, down 5% from last year and down 9% from the last quarter. Wholesale, another record quarter with net income of 372 million, up significantly from Q4 of '08, and up 14% from last quarter. On an adjusted basis, corporate posted a loss of 54 million compared with 153 million loss last year. Lower adjusted net loss was primarily driven by the decrease in net securitization losses and the impact of tax benefits in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide six. Reported net income of a billion, or $1.12 per share, adjusted net income of 1.3 billion, or $1.46 per share. The difference between reported and adjusted numbers is mainly due to four recurring items of note highlighted here.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide seven, Canadian P&amp;C, TD Canada Trust &#x2013; net income of 622 million, up 4% from last year. Very strong operating leverage, a five point gap between revenue and expense growth more than offset a 50% increase in PCLs. Net income was down 8% from Q3.</p>
          <p>Highlights &#x2013; revenue up 7% over last year due to broad based volume growth and higher fee revenues. The increased volume growth was partially offset by margin compression and significantly higher industry wide property and casualty losses. On volume growth, we posted record growth in real estate secured lending. Compared to last year, total lending for TDCT grew by 13% with personal up 14% and business up 7%. TDCT deposits grew 13% with core banking growth of 26% and business deposit growth of 16%.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, revenues decreased 1% sequentially due to lower global insurance revenue. While insurance revenue declined due to higher claims and weather related losses, the fundamentals in the business were solid. Provision for credit losses of 313 million was up 50% from last year and 8% from last quarter due to higher bankruptcies and delinquencies on unsecured lending and credit cards. Quarter-over-quarter business banking PCLs grew 13 million to 34 million, still low given this economy. Expenses were up 2% from last year and 5% from last quarter. The margin was down eight basis points compared to last quarter due to lower mortgage prepayment fees, but stable year-over-year. Next year we expect relatively stable margins in TDCT despite an increase earlier in the year due to our HELOC repricing. Overall, another strong quarter for TDCT.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide eight. Global Wealth Management, which excludes TD AMERITRADE, net income of 97 million down 12% from last year, but up 2% from last quarter. This was our strongest quarter in wealth earnings this year. Earnings were helped by improved market conditions and higher asset levels.</p>
          <p>Highlights &#x2013; revenue of 587 million decreased five million or 1% from the prior year. Strong growth in transaction revenue was offset by net interest margin compression in the slow rate environment. The sequential improvement was due to higher asset levels. We added 75 client-facing advisors this year. 2.2 billion in long-term mutual fund net sales this year compared to 0.7 billion in net redemptions in 2008. We were number one in net long-term sales in Canada on an industry basis in 2009. Expenses increased by 4% from Q4 of '08 due to volume growth and continued investment in the business. TD AMERITRADE contributed 59 million to TD this quarter flat to last year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide nine, the U.S. Personal and Commercial Bank. In U.S. dollars, adjusted net income was 196 million for the quarter, down 26% from last year due to significantly higher provisions year-over-year. The U.S. P&amp;C segment continued its solid performance in a tough operating environment.</p>
          <p>Highlights &#x2013; revenues were over $1 billion, up 3% compared to last year and quarter. Sequential improvement was due to higher retail fees and volume growth. Good growth in core deposits and real estate secured lending. Retail core deposits were up 9% year-over-year and commercial was up 11% for the same period. Residential mortgage growth was very strong, up 46%, driven by our originate and hold model and strong refinance activity. Provision for credit losses increased by 23% compared to last quarter. Impaired loans and charge-offs also increased. Excluding credit losses related to the non-agency CMO portfolio, PCL was flat quarter-over-quarter. Expenses were up 5% compared to last quarter mainly due to higher advertising related expenses. Year-over-year change was due to an increase in regular FDIC premiums and new store openings, partially offset by commerce deal synergies. Margins are up in the current quarter, mainly due to better lending spreads and improved deposit mix. We expect margins to remain at this level on a year-over-year basis in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving on to wholesale slide 10, record net income of 372 million, another very strong quarter and up significantly from last year and last quarter. Dramatic improvement in revenue growth versus 2008 reflects the turnaround in credit markets, improved margins in our trading businesses, very strong origination and our commitment to developing franchise businesses. Q4 proved a strong quarter for our equity derivatives business. We expect wholesale earnings to normalize as markets are more liquid, competition increases and interest rates rise. Credit losses declined quarter-over-quarter due to recovery, expenses were up year-over-year due largely to higher variable compensation due to improved results.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11, the impact of CICA Handbook Section 3855 election to reclassify from AFS debt securities to loans. Certain debt securities including the non-agency CMO portfolio which were accounted for as available for sales securities were reclassified as loans, retroactive to November 1, 2008. This resulted from amendments to Canadian GAAP which permit debt securities to be classified as loans, if they do not have a quoted price in an active market. Securities were reclassified at amortized cost. Impact of reclassification, the unrealized loss in OCI was reversed for prior quarters with the offset being an increase in the carrying value of securities.</p>
          <p>Slide 38 in the appendix shows the P&amp;L and balance sheet impact. As a result of the reclassification of the debt securities to loans a general allowance was established. This impacted opening retained earnings by 59 million after tax and Q1 and Q2 earnings by a combined 132 million after tax or $0.16 per share.</p>
          <p>Going forward we expect small quarterly impairment charges and the possible release of some of the general allowance.</p>
          <p>With that I'll hand it over to Steve Boyle.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Colleen. Please turn to slide 12. I'll provide a final update on the integration. There are some additional information on charts and the appendix of the presentation that you may want to refer to as well. Our integration is now essentially complete. The integration of TD Banknorth and Commerce was not your typical rip and replace integration, rather we pursued a best of breed strategy which is more complex and more costly but in the end it was the right thing to do as we build out our franchise in the U.S. We completed our systems conversion at the end of September and our final rebranding in New England and now are one bank with one brand, one operating model and one product suite from Maine to Florida. The investments we've made in our front and backend systems have allowed us to create a scalable platform from which to grow.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, now that our integration is complete, it's appropriate for us to look at how we perform throughout the integration and how we met our key objectives. So how did we do, overall extremely well, although we did fall short of some of our goals which we'll talk about in a moment.</p>
          <p>From an employee perspective, internal survey show that our employees remain engaged right through the integration and we retained all key senior management personnel. In addition, as you know, how companies come together from a cultural perspective can often make or break a merger of this size and we have created a unique culture based upon the best of both companies. From a customer perspective, we grew the franchise right through the integration with households growing 2%. It should be noted that most banks either customer base shrink as part of the merger and we saw an increase, so we're pleased by that. More importantly, we won the J.D. Power award for customer satisfaction for the fourth year in a row which is a clear indication of how our customers felt about the integration.</p>
          <p>From a systems conversion prospective the conversion went extremely well. Over the conversion weekend the data converted seamlessly, and all of our channels were available the Sunday morning immediately following conversion earlier than planned. As you are all aware however we did experience some post conversion challenges with our overnight batch processing which create a significant issues for some of our customers. We deeply regret this inconvenience and have worked diligently to resolve any outstanding issues and to do what was right for our customers in the bank. I am pleased to report that the batch processing issues we experienced are behind us and its business as usual at TD Bank, America's most convenient bank.</p>
          <p>So how did we do from a financial perspective, here the picture is mixed which reflects challenges facing the U.S. economy in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009. First, we will meet our expense synergies in the first quarter of 2010. Second, the integration charges are expected to come in higher than the originally projected when the commerce transaction was first announced, approximately $480 million U.S. pre-tax has been sent through the end of 2009 and we anticipate taking additional 45 to $70 million of charges in the first quarter of 2010 for a total of 525 to 550 million. This is due to higher than anticipated spend on IT to upgrade our front and back-end systems, deeper restructuring efforts, increased cost of real estate disposition and some expenses associated with the post conversion issues that we faced. Although higher than originally anticipated, the decisions were the right ones and we have created an enduring platform from which to grow.</p>
          <p>Lastly as Colleen had discussed, our earnings in 2009 were impacted by higher PCLs margin compression and unplanned FDIC assessments. Although I'm generally pleased with our performance given the significant challenges facing banks in the U.S. in 2009, I'm not satisfied with the absolute levels of returns in the U.S. Having said that we're well positioned to continue our growth and should see the benefits when PCLs and margins return to historical norms.</p>
          <p>Slide 14. From a growth perspective we continue to grow our franchise right through the integration and during one of the most challenging economic times in the United States. One of our core capabilities we acquired through Commerce was the ability to open new stores. Throughout the integration, we opened 47 new stores from Q3, '08 through the end of fiscal year '09 primarily in our higher growth markets of Metro New York, Metro DC and South Florida. And the de-novo growth strategy continues to be an important growth catalyst for us in the United States. We opened 23 new stores in 2009, approximately one-quarter of our stores are maturing with the average deposit per store of $59 million compared to mature stores with average deposits of $84 million per store.</p>
          <p>This represents significant embedded growth opportunity while at the same time we continue to open new stores every year. In 2009, while maturing stores represented 25% of our retail outlets in the United States, they accounted for 60% of deposit growth. We saw good growth in deposits up 11% year-over-year. Much of this growth came from more profitable retail and commercial deposits, while more quasi-government deposits were up only slightly during the year. Although strong deposit growth has not been a significant contributor to earnings in a low interest rate environment, as rates normalized this will be a tail end for us.</p>
          <p>Finally, our loan growth and credit performances held up well in 2009. Our average loans grew at 13% year-over-year reflecting strong growth and our personal portfolio in market share gains across the franchise. And as Mark will review in more detail, our credit performances continue to hold up well, outperforming our peers. With the integration behind us and momentum in all of our businesses, we look forward to continued progress in 2010.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Over to you, Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Please turn to slide 15.</p>
          <p>First I'll provide an overview of our performance at a consolidated level, followed by brief highlights on each of our credit portfolios. Please note that the information provided in this section is presented on a credit portfolio basis versus the financial results, which are presented on a business segment basis. The primary difference is the inclusion of U.S. credit cards in the U.S. credit portfolio. Also, we've excluded the impact of debt securities reclassified as loans to provide a clear picture of U.S. credit portfolio performance.</p>
          <p>Turning to the loan balances, lending growth was concentrated in the Canadian and U.S. personal real estate secured portfolios, while the commercial portfolios reflect quarter-over-quarter. Wholesale lending was down 5% over the third quarter and almost 14% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to refinancing of bank debt in the capital markets. We are satisfied that we're adding good quality real estate secured loans in our Canadian and U.S. credit portfolios, consistent with our strategy to build our North American franchise.</p>
          <p>Turning to loan portfolio quality on slide 16. As expected, gross impaired loans continued to trend up. However, the rate of increase has slowed from that experience during the first half of the year. Default rates remained elevated across all portfolios with the exception of the wholesale portfolio, which continues to perform strongly. The U.S. personal and commercial portfolios remained the main driver of gross impaired loan growth.</p>
          <p>Our specific allowance to gross impaired loan coverage decreased slightly to 24.8% during the quarter, resulting from a decline in total specific allowances; while gross impaired loans continued to grow. The decline in specific allowance resulted from the reversal of $44 million in specific reserves in the wholesale portfolio upon resolution of several impaired loans.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that our U.S. coverage ratio, measured by total allowances to gross impaired loans, is lower than our Canadian ratio due to the U.S. market practice of charging off impaired loans earlier in the workout process. This results in a lower total allowance coverage of 86% in the U.S., which continues to compare favorably with our end market peers.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I know there has been some questions on our total coverage ratio falling from 130% in Q3 to 112%. As a result, I would like to point out that the 130% number includes allowances established upon reclassification of debt securities to loans retroactive to November 1, '08. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the debt securities reclassification, coverage dropped only slightly from 116% to 112%.</p>
          <p>In summary, we remained comfortable that gross impaired loans in all of our credit portfolios are adequately provisioned.</p>
          <p>Turning to provision for credit losses on slide 17. Although still elevated, credit losses were fairly constant during the quarter and remained within our general expectations. Notwithstanding the reducing trend in credit losses during the past two quarters, we remain concerned that continuing high unemployment and bankruptcy rates, combined with the expected lag effect of the recession on commercial credit losses, will results in higher PCLs in 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 18 for more detailed discussion performance and specific areas of concerned within the credit portfolio. With respect to portfolio performance, I would like the following key points.</p>
          <p>The composition and performance of the Canadian Personal portfolio is fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. Both the Canadian commercial and wholesale portfolios continued to perform well. Commercial losses have been holding at historically low levels.</p>
          <p>Having said this, early signs of deterioration in recent quarters suggest losses will trend up in 2010. This is consistent with a lag effect experienced with commercial credit losses in previous recessions. Although elevated, we are confident loss rates will remain well below historical peaks. Losses in the U.S. personal portfolio continued to trend up at a moderate pace. Notwithstanding this trend, we're comfortable with the quality of new loans originated in our growing real estate secured and indirect auto portfolios.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. Commercial Credit portfolio, commercial real estate specifically residential for sale remains the area of greatest concern, representing more than one-third of total U.S. commercial impaired loans. We continue to reduce exposure in this segment with no new exposures added during the past 18 months. Non-residential commercial real estate continues to record acceptable performance, although it does represent a future vulnerability given current market dynamics. Favorable results to date in this segment can be attributed in part to our limited exposure to investment real estate in the downtown cores of large urban centers which have been more severely impacted by the downturn.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals in our commercial and industrial portfolio remain sound, supported by a focus on stronger performing industry sectors such as healthcare, education and the public sector segments.</p>
          <p>As outlined in the appendix, 38% of our exposure in this portfolio is secured by real estate. We classify these loans according to the industry as a borrower since this provides a better indication of credit risk. Risk in this portfolio is related primarily to the business performance of the borrower and secondarily to the value of the real estate security. In our experience, loan secured by real estate produce higher recoveries than those that are not and therefore is consider to represent one of the strengths of our commercial and industrial credit exposure.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned by Ed our presentation differs U.S. regulatory disclosures, which required classification by collateral type versus industry segment. On balance, we're comfortable that our geographic footprint coupled with conservative underwriting standards position us well in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Overall, Q4 was a good quarter for TD, with credit performance meeting expectations. However, the outlook remains uncertain and we are still concerned about increased pressure on credit losses across the portfolios. As a result, we expect credit losses to gradually increase throughout the year, peaking in the fall of 2010, followed by decline in 2011.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the presentation back to Tim.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to ask a little bit about the residential real estate in the U.S. If it's the area of weakness, I mean help us understand why the specific PCLs are still 9 million out of the roughly 400 million gross impaired loans. Does it mean that you're going to be looking for problems going forward that haven't been identified or...?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The specific PCL is 9 million, the gross is 373, it was 328 last quarter. In your comments you identified that's the area of weakness. I guess the question is why is that number, why is that number at that level? Shouldn't we be seeing that going higher?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The specific part? Actually, I think that the specific is only a small part of our actual allowances under the U.S. GA methodology and if you were to take the total GAs applied against that sector it would be the highest coverage that we have. I don't have the specific number on top of my head, but specific is different in the U.S. as it is in Canada and it's a relatively small percentage, but we would have a higher allowance number against it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A question for Colleen on the reclassification, it looked to me based on the disclosures that there is about 8 billion coming out of the AFS bucket. But based &#x2013; again based on their statement, looks like there was something in the range of another 3 billion coming out of the held-to-maturity bucket into the loan book. Is that the case and what was the nature of those exposures and what's the thinking behind moving from one accrual bucket to another there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Steve the new standard did require us to transfer any loans out of held-to-maturity into, or securities out of held-to-maturity into lending that are not traded, actively traded or quoted. So, these particular ones are &#x2013; they're held-to-maturity securities that were transferred to loans, they are investments in one of our subsidiaries which the bank intends to hold until their maturity. Securities are all very high quality. They're basically AAA rated, supranational and bank bonds. So, they &#x2013; we don't have any general allowances against that portfolio, but that was about 2.5 billion that was transferred from held-to-maturity into lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As a follow-up if I might, on the &#x2013; if I look at the U.S. P&amp;C segment on page eight, in U.S. dollar terms of your sub-pack, you see 39 million of credit losses this quarter attributed to the debt securities classified as loans and then 95 and 75 million back in the first half of the year. You talked a bit about it, but in that there could be some additional losses there, but based on this reclassification, should that number get a lot closer to zero going forward and you may get some routing there, is there a risk you could get kind of losses in this type of range going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So these losses are specifics. So these were some impairments, so the general allowances is different than what's happened here. This is some specific &#x2013; specific provisions on impairment in the portfolio. And so, we think overall in terms of the coverage that we have from the reserves that we've taken initially as part of the write-down as well as the GAs that we've taken, we think we're very well covered on the portfolio overall, but we think there are &#x2013; there's some likelihood that we'll have, we'll have some small charges or perhaps credits going forward. But I don't think you should expect to see much in that line, would be the bottom line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. This is a question for Ed. Ed, I just wanted to clarify, in your opening remarks, you referred to the recession and the credit situation in the U.S. as being viewed as a two-year delay in achieving, I guess your return on capital objectives. And I think this year in fiscal '09, your return was about half of what your cost of capital was. And I was just wondering where does the two years start from, is that starting years ago or is it starting now? And then I was wondering if you might also just to augment that with some comments about how things have changed and how that may or may not have impacted your outlook for your overall return potential in your U.S. strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was afraid someone was going to ask me that question. So, I think we don't want to get too precise here because reality is to be precise in answering that number I've got to be very precise in answering the speed with which PCL has declined and interest rate absolute levels rise. But in the sense of our head, I think what I'm saying is we thought we were going to earn $1.2 billion this year. We obviously didn't earn $1.2 billion. You can basically explain that all away by the higher than normal PCL running rate and we absorbed much lower absolute interest rates, so pressure on the margins. So, I think we'd be disappointed if in 2011 or 2012 we weren't certainly getting something like that kind of level and moving up.</p>
          <p>If we didn't get that level moving up, it won't reflect and I guess that's the main point we're making. It's not that the core operating business isn't doing well. In fact, if you look at what the operating ROE of that business is, it's still extraordinarily high and it's not like when we open new branches we're disappointed with the performance. It's not like we're not growing new customers. But if the recession in United States continues to go on and on and on, and if the absolute level of interest rates go on and on and on, it's hard to grow when you &#x2013; that number against those two headwinds. And so it's really when do you think those headwinds will turn around and then I think you should see a spring-back in our earnings because we're building the fundamental base for a spring-back if the conditions change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one supplemental to that then, Ed, if conditions remain sort of stressed as they are do you see opportunity to improve your returns by growing your scale or are you at a scale level currently that would preclude that opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. I think we first start off and so I don't want &#x2013; I think what we're trying to say is if you don't think management feels badly about the ROIC then you don't get what the culture is at TD. So even though you could say well no one anticipated this downturn at this level and the kind of financial crisis the fact is we're <mark type="inaudible" /> by the shareholders to make money for the shareholders and we are all shareholders. So, we &#x2013; I think the challenge that we certainly are saying to ourselves right now is let's assume the world stays bad for a while, how are we going to get that number up. And so we're looking at all the different ways that you could actually run this kind of franchise in a low interest rate environment, a slow growth environment in which PCOs don't drop off as fast as you might hope.</p>
          <p>I would say &#x2013; I think certainly with tuck-ins and FDIC-assisted deals I think we can actually help improve the rates of return on this franchise. So it would be one of the things that we would look at but clearly we got to look at other things of finding ways to exploit market disruption. We know the mortgage market stays disrupted in the United States, we think there's opportunities there. We know that we've barely begun to cross sell that customer base. And so we bought us a deposit-gathering monoline. And so we've got this tremendous customer loyalty so we're not penetrating that customer base nearly enough.</p>
          <p>So we think there's lots of those things to be done if we &#x2013; I think we actually, I think it's amazing to me that we could open 47 branches while we're doing a merger. There's just only so many things you could do while you are doing a merger. So certainly the scrutiny on the team is now and the focus on the team is to say let's assume the world stays ugly, how are we going to get that ROIC up. But obviously it would make a huge difference if absolute rates rose and PCLs fell off.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ed I just want to follow up on that and I just want to make sure I understand the numbers. So I think do you spend U.S. 17 almost 18 billion on the U.S. businesses and then <mark type="inaudible" /> your cost of capital, would that be 10%? Could those be right, so you need to earn about 1.8 billion, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think 10 is frankly a little high for a number and you take a look at our P/E and what our real cost of capital is I think it's a lower number than that. So we've always said, we'd really like to get in the, at least in the 7 to 8% return within the medium term. If you take, if you go back and look at history of what TD Canada Trust was when TD bought Canada Trust, they bought a 20% ROE business and they paid 4.1 times book. So they're earning a 5% rate of return and as you can see now the ROIC in that business is 27. I am not sure we're going to get this up to 27% on a ROIC basis but, I certainly think you want to start getting it, once we are in the seven to 8% I think we'll start to breathe a little easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just to follow up on that, the &#x2013; I guess talking about a more difficult environment out there and the scale you have. Can you get to those kind of returns with an efficiency ratio that's above 70% or do you &#x2013; I assume that's a big, that's the big factor if the world stays the same you've got to get that efficiency ratio down. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the issue on the efficiency ratio is less expenses. I think we're going to run a higher expense model because we're also driving growth very heavily off that, off a smaller earnings base. And so I think as long as we can open branches that have high IRRs, it's kind of crazy from a shareholder point of view not to do that, and that this is where we've come with a philosophy is don't let short-term earnings management destroy shareholder value and so if you can open up a new branch and make money on it, keep doing that. But clearly what would drive the efficiency ratio would be if you start to get a spring back in absolute interest rates and so you've got to have bigger margins on your deposit side.</p>
          <p>So I'd say what is sort of unique is &#x2013; and obviously I think we're &#x2013; the great news is that we are way better performers on the asset side than everyone else and the great news is we're better to <mark type="inaudible" /> deposit side. The bad news is deposits is not a great business right now at absolutely low interest rates and so we're great at something that turns out in a low interest rate environment harder to make money at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's also maybe just worth clarifying that if you look at the efficiency ratio on a reported basis, I mean this business it is in the sort of 70 plus range but on an adjusted basis, you're at about 60% and we obviously do see the potential over time to improve that efficiency ratio in the U.S.</p>

When we look at page nine of the press release toward the end of the P&amp;C segment, it talks about the outlook for margins being stable next year and I gather there is no expectations of rate increases, that's fine, but what about the very material repricing of the HELOC book, I would expect that to drive higher margins maybe not the 400 basis points but what are the offsets that lead you to say margins aren't going up?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Andr&#xE9;. The &#x2013; it's a great question, so the timing of our repricing of our HELOC book was effective middle of this past month. So we get almost a full quarter's effect in Q1 and that will obviously drive the number up. Just a couple of caveats, if you're doing the relatively straightforward math of taking our HELOC book as disclosed and multiplying it by 1% that would be too high a number, there was obviously some caveats, both some &#x2013; it's only on the float portion which is a smaller number. There were some segments of customers that were excluded from that and there was fairly liberal granting of discretion to our field force in the branch and in the call centers to make accommodations. So the number obviously is quite a bit smaller.</p>
          <p>And the last thing I'd say is we offered our customers an opportunity to switch from their HELOC book at a very discounted fixed rate into a traditional mortgage. So all of that has an impact on the absolute level of revenue gains. But it will be mostly in the first quarter therefore will drive an uptick in margins. Over the next few quarters in the rest of 2010, there will be a drift down as our <mark type="inaudible" /> programs fall off and as Ed was talking about in the last little while the just absolute low level of interest rates continue to work their way into the portfolio.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. My question is for Tim as well. I wonder if you could just give us some more details on what went on in the insurance business over the course of the quarter, it's a bit lighter than the expectations. So any color there would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, on Bernie's graph, he's scripted me well I'd say, short answer is, you've seen again and as disclosed is we had about a 50 million drop in linked quarter in insurance revenues and that really is to coin a phrase, there's a little bit of a perfect storm. I mean we actually had quite a significant uptick in claims, usually weather-related that tended to hit us mostly in the fourth quarter. Some of those we would expect to be more on one-time in nature not all them of course, but there was a fairly significant uptick and of course it is an industry phenomenon as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So I'm looking at page seven of your supp pack and looking at the U.S. P&amp;C contribution $909 million for the year and if I think about this fairly simplistically, if you hadn't done the reclassification, would it be reasonable just to add back the after-tax impact of the 250 million provision related to those loans during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Colleen. Yeah, it would be reasonable to add back the amounts that we took in Q1 and Q2 and that was 132 million after tax because part of the allowance we took to opening retained earnings but that was the charge and we've outlined that on page 46 in the supplemental would be the 132 million. So that would be the way to look at that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wouldn't it be the full 250, I mean the value would've gone through your AOCI if they were still in AFS?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe we can take it offline because you took another 41 million in the fourth quarter of provision?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now turning to slide 20 of the sub-pack, again related to these reclassified loans, when you reclassified them and you took provisions that you reclassified for the quarter line-10 on that page actually no not line-10, yeah for the loans reclassified, your gross formations were all recognized in the fourth quarter. Can you tell me why they would have all been recognized in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you're talking about the AFS, that's now in lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's because -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>223 U.S. of gross formations that was all recognized in the fourth quarter, what was it about what happened in the fourth quarter as opposed to any of the first, second or third quarters, where you wouldn't have allocated a portion of the 223 to any of those other quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what happened in the fourth quarter as we did trigger a specific impairment which had not happened before. So as you know we have been managing this. We have, as I mentioned earlier, the reserve which is essentially the assumption around credit losses which was included in our original write-down and in the fourth quarter, we &#x2013; in essence sort of tripped our own test as it related to some of those securities and then also some trust preferred as well. So that's what accounted for the 40 million. So that event only occurred in the fourth quarter when we had evidence of impairment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it was in actually turning those provisions into specific rather than general that led you to classify the loans non-performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so we have &#x2013; again they became impaired in the fourth quarter and the reason they're showing up here is because we're now treating them as lending as opposed to AFS. So, they're now coming into the impaired loan category but as I said they only became impaired in the fourth quarter. So, this really didn't relate to the change in standard except for the fact that because it's now lending related it shows up in impaired loans and you see this in the allowance as both specific and general. The impact of this change in the standard was really in the generals and obviously in all of the balance sheet, reclasses and as you have seen the effects on OCI in prior quarters, book value, book value per share, all of those things I think as you've probably observed it had, it had definitely had an impact on prior quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm really getting here is that, in doing the reclassification you have recognized generals and now specifics against these reclassified loans but you've only recognized the formation in the fourth quarter. So, I'm saying let's pretend that these loans had been &#x2013; that what our loans now had been classified as loans all along. Is there a portion of that 223 million that would have been shown as formations in the first, second or third quarter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Looking at slide 14 U.S. P&amp;C business growth and the numbers shown here are really helpful and they kind of lead to the conclusion that the branches, new stores have to be opened in order to get to organic growth engine continuing here highlighting that 60% of deposit growth came from 25% of the stores which were maturing. How many stores are we planning to open in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we're planning an opening of 32 stores next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>32 stores. Okay, and when you look at the loan growth up 13% year-over-year, do you have that similar type of breakdown to give us the sense of what the loan growth primarily driven by maturing stores or is it a different phenomenon where it's the mature stores that lead to low growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you'd have more loan growth related to the maturing stores, but it's not as dramatic and impacted as it is on the deposit side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Is there a way that you can kind of give us a sense on how you felt that your mature stores performed year-over-year? I guess that would be roughly 750 stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, I think we're happy with the growth in the mature stores. I think it's important to point out that in this very low interest rate environment where we're managing for profitability as well as growth, I think our average total cost of deposits is 68 basis points that you're not going to see the same level of growth in the mature stores as you would in a more normal interest rate environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay and when does a maturing store become a mature store, is it the level of deposits or number of years?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, I am sorry I was just slipped out. I had a question just with respect to the recovery, on the tax line in the U.S. segment, you've had these recoveries before but now it's starting to become quite a large amount relative to the pre-tax number. Can you give me just some sort of outlook or where that's going to trend in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brad, I think when you're looking at the supplemental in that 29 million, you're looking on a reported basis and it's probably better and we can lay this out for you, but to look at it on an adjusted basis, because on a reported basis as the &#x2013; as the pre-tax income declines and we have some tax synergies in the United States. So obviously that will lead to what appears to be a credit there. So going forward, I think our tax rate will be in roughly the same range as it's been this year. May be I can ask Steve to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, I think as you see the restructuring charges diminish which are at our marginal rate, you'll see a more normal rate in the reported earnings and I think our adjusted tax rate will be similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And similar being in sort of the 35% range or...?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, our tax rate on an adjusted basis is more in the mid-to-low teens and that's probably where we would expect to be next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of tax in the quarter, Brad, you would have seen the benefits in the corporate segment, you're not really seeing it in the segments. So we did have some positive tax items. It was probably versus Q3, it was probably about a two to three cent impact in the quarter. But it wasn't in the segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be clear, as we go forward and the restructuring or is behind us, we're going to start to see a positive tax charge against positive pre-tax earnings in the U.S. segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Probably for Steve Boyle or Colleen Johnston. The net interest margin in the U.S. banking segment broke a string of declines this quarter-end. I know it's hard to compare across different segments, different geographies, but if we compare this segment to Canada Trust, obviously both have a solid base of core deposits. In Canada Trust after the Bank of Canada stopped cutting rates in Q1 you were able to rather quickly benefit from them expansion here as you re-price the portfolio. I would &#x2013; let me ask you why hasn't it been until the recent quarter a similar trend in the U.S., if that's been on hold, you've got the solid base of deposits and I would think with Jim Bantis touched on that graph where you showed 13% loan growth. I would think any new business you're doing now is certainly being priced with much more discipline on risk. So can you talk about the difference in the net interest margin trend in the U.S. compared to what we've seen with Canada Trust?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, maybe I'll talk to the U.S. and Colleen can contrast the two. So, I think in the U.S. what we've seen is a gradual decline that reflects both the decline in interest rates which has also really been off &#x2013; started to be offset by wider spreads in the commercial loan book. I think what is helping us recently is that we had earlier in the year a liquidity crisis that caused a lot of our competitor banks to keep rates artificially high, I think now as that liquidity crisis has eased the competitive environment in the U.S. has eased with it. And so we've been able to see kind of the bottom of our deposit margins and now the loan margins are starting to lift the overall NIMs. So I think it's probably a difference in the competitive environment in the U.S. versus Canada where we're seeing a easing of the competitiveness in the U.S. on the deposit side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will make brief comment and then turn it over to Tim to elaborate but I think one of the fundamental differences is the, I think, the pricing power that we and collectively the banks have in Canada compared to the United States. So as you saw at the TDCT Investor Day, I mean that coupled with superior treasury management skills so you've seen that in the trend line in our margins over the last number of years which have been relatively stable and despite all of the dislocation in the last couple of years versus in fact the peer group which has come down steadily. So why don't I let Tim to just elaborate on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I am actually okay on the Canada Trust side I know there is probably a few other people. So just quickly for Steve then on that point with the competitive situation in the U.S. and the liquidity side easing somewhat, do you think it's fair to say we've probably seen the bottom on NIM in U.S. and I am bringing this up because obviously you talked about the credit situation, you've talked about a higher expense model. So the way I am thinking about this is NIM expansion one of the positives we could potentially see from here if the worse of the compression is past, is that a fair statement for 2010, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think in general we would expect that we've seen the bottom on net interest margins, I think since we are at a floor in our ability to price customer deposits down, any further decline in rates could hurt us a little bit going forward. But obviously we're at extraordinarily low rates right now, so it's pretty hard to see rates coming down much further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your time guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ed here. I guess I will just make a couple &#x2013; at the risk of getting myself into trouble here, between the two businesses you got to remember that we have a balanced portfolio on Canada than on imbalance portfolio in the United States and so TD Canada Trust generates as many or in fact more assets than it does liabilities. So the re-pricing that's going on in Canada isn't so much on the deposit side, if you take a look at our margins on deposit side. They have come down in Canada as well, yes, they have been able to re-price on the asset side and because the absolute numbers on the asset sides are as big as the absolute numbers on the deposit side you can re-price and hold your margins up. In the case of the United States, there is a big difference between the size of the deposits and the size of the assets generated by the system. So it's not if you re-price on the asset side you don't get the same effect on NIM as you would in Canada.</p>
          <p>The second thing just as a little note of caution is that we're certainly seeing in the United States that loan growth from the commercial side has flattened out and so it's not that we're unwilling to lend but the fact is many small businesses faced with the uncertainty in the economic environment in the United States are not borrowing. So I don't think you can anticipate the kind of growth rates on the lending side that we saw this year.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you for attending this session and I hope you all have a good holiday season, we certainly intend to enjoy it. We feel very good about the year. We think it's a terrific year and frankly it was a better year than we had anticipated going into it. And we do think we're well positioned for going forward, but we have a cautious, as we often do, view on 2010 to say we still got another 2010 to get through before we're going to see all of this spring back effects that I think we're building into our system.</p>
          <p>Clearly we view that we have a huge strength in our retail earnings and the great thing about our $4 billion is that we've been able to have those kind of earnings and add customers, and add branches, and add such fundamentals so that when PCLs decline and interest rates rise, we're going to have enormous tailwinds. I think we're equally just delighted with what's going on in our wholesale business. We've been able to fundamentally reposition that business. We think we are sitting on the dealer of the future, a dealer that has been designed where we think not just the economy is going, but in fact where regulatory changes are going and so we're just delighted with the performance we have. So we're feeling pretty good going into 2010 despite the fact that we think 2010 still represents another tough year to get through from an economic point of view. Thank you very much.</p>
