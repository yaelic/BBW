          <p>Thank you, Patrick and good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, the global economic downturn continued to dominate financial markets with commodity prices and crack spreads, lower than the same period in 2008. Despite this challenge period, Husky still achieved solid earnings and cash flow and continues to maintain a very strong financial position. For the quarter, sales and operating revenues were 3.9 billion, compared with $7.72 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Earnings were 338 million or $0.40 per share, down from 1.27 billion or $1.50 per share in the third quarter of 2008. Adjusted net earnings for the third quarter were 325 million or $0.38 per share, compared to 1.27 billion or $1.49 per share in the same quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations of 452 million or $0.53 per share was down from 2 billion or $2.35 per share in the same quarter of 2008. Cash flow in the third quarter of 2009 was reduced by 188 million due to cash tax installments related to 2008 earnings. Financial results have been affected by lower realized commodity prices. The benchmark WTI oil price for the third quarter was down 42% from the same quarter in 2008 and the benchmark NYMEX gas price this quarter was down 67% from the same quarter of the prior year.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2009, Husky sales and operating revenues were 11.7 billion, net earnings were 1.1 billion or $1.29 per share and cash flow from operations was 1.85 billion or $2.18 per share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings for the first nine months were 1.14 billion or $1.34 per share.</p>
          <p>Husky's production in the third quarter averaged 276,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 2008 third quarter production of 356,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Total crude oil and natural gas liquids production was 187,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, compared to 256,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2008. Oil production was lower due mainly to the scheduled maintenance and satellite tie-in work at White Rose and a lower than expected performance and planned maintenance at Terra Nova.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production for the quarter averaged 535 million cubic feet per day, down from 598 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter of 2008. Gas production was lower mainly due to scale back in capital expenditures on drilling, well completions and tie-ins and shut-in production. At the end of the quarter, approximately 30 million cubic feet per day was shut-in and about 25 million cubic feet per day was deferred due to lower gas prices. For the year, total production is expected to be close to the low end of our annual guidance range.</p>
          <p>During the past 12 months, the company has placed stringent focus on operational synergies and financial disciplines in line with the market conditions. Year-to-date, Husky has been able to achieve a 9% operating cost reduction, compared with the same period of 2008. The company remains in a strong financial position. Total debt at the end of the quarter, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 2.07 billion, compared with 1.04 billion at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at September 30, 2009 were 1.5 times and 18.7% respectively. We are pleased to advise that Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share payable on January 4, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 20, 2009.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Husky advanced several major projects. In the East Coast of Canada, progress was made on the North Amethyst satellite tie-back. During the schedule maintenance turnaround for the SeaRose, modifications to the FPSO, subsea production equipment and tie-in work were accomplished, ready for future production from North Amethyst.</p>
          <p>Testing, commissioning, and drilling activities at North Amethyst will continue in the fourth quarter with first production expected in early 2010. Production will ramp up through 2010 as additional wells are brought into operation. Peak production from North Amethyst is expected to be approximately 37,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>At the Liwan 3-1 gas discovery in the South China Sea, delineation work has been completed with the drilling of the third appraisal well. The Liwan 3-1-4 well test at an equipment restricted rate of 52 million cubic feet per day, with indications that well future deliverability could exceed 150 million cubic feet per day, consistent with other Liwan appraisal wells.</p>
          <p>Front end engineering and design work for the Liwan 3-1 development continues and was approximately 40% complete at the end of the quarter. The plan of development is being prepared with expected submission to partner and regulatory authorities in late 2009 or early 2010. We expect project sanction in 2010 with first production in the 2013 timeframe.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, front end engineering and design work for the Sunrise Phase one project facilities was approximately 60% complete and front end engineering and design work is on track to be finalized by the year-end. Progress has been made in optimizing the project to reduce costs. Sanction of the project is expected in 2010.</p>
          <p>Terrance will now talk about the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>

          <p>Thanks John. While Husky's heavy oil production benefited from the low light to heavy oil price differential in the quarter, Upgrader earnings in the quarter at $2 million were impacted. The WTI to Lloydminster Crude Blend heavy oil price differential averaged U.S. $10.26 per barrel in the third quarter, down 44% from U.S. $18.34 per barrel in the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date in 2009, the Upgrader has generated $14 million of net earnings compared to 199 million during the same period of 2008. The pipeline and other infrastructure segment of our Midstream business continue to perform in line with expectations, generating $42 million of net earnings in the third quarter compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the United States, the Lima and Toledo refineries continue to be impacted by low crack spreads. However, they contributed $10 million of net earnings in the third quarter compared to a loss of $35 million in the same quarter 2008. Through the first nine months of 2009, the U.S. downstream has generated $167 million, up from 132 million in the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>The Lima refinery has commenced its five-year plant maintenance turnaround beginning on October 2 and is expected to return to service in mid November. In the third quarter, our Canadian Refined Products division benefited from the recovering gasoline demand over the prior year contributing $59 million of net earnings in the third quarter, up from $25 million in 2008. In the first nine months, Canadian Refined Products has contributed $131 million of net earnings, up from 91 million in the same period of 2008. Contribution from the asphalt business was also strong providing a gross margin of $69 million, up from $37 million in the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Terrance. Husky continues to achieve solid financial performance in the third quarter. Operating and administrative expenses are well under control and good progress has been made in its strategic projects. The company has a healthy balance sheet and will benefit from the world economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Mark Polak of Scotia Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Wondering with the progress you made on the front end engineering at Liwan and Sunrise, if it's possible give an update on where you think capital cost might land for those two projects and also on Liwan, if you could just give us an update on how marketing discussions and negotiations are going on and when we might get some clarity on what pricing might look like there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark, this is Rob Peabody. So that &#x2013; let me comment first on Sunrise as we've outlined in our &#x2013; in the report we're at about 60% complete on our front end engineering to date. We are expecting to finish front end engineering by the end of this year. I guess the one thing I want to add there too is we've had another meeting with our partner the other day I think both partners are very aligned on the way forward on Sunrise, very committed to the project and we're going to progress that project with the intention of moving it into the full project EPC phase next year.</p>
          <p>So that's where we are on Sunrise. On Liwan, we've finished the delineation wells, we are working on the front end engineering. I believe that was 50% complete to date and the intention is to move that project forward over the course of next year and with &#x2013; again the intention of sanctioning it next year and bringing it on to first production into 2013. Sorry, I might have missed the last point you made there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering about the marketing side for the Liwan gas, any views on where pricing might land or how that would be structured or we might get an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mark, it's John here. And regarding the China project, especially the one in Liwan, we finished the four appraisal wells with a total expected production gas around 0.5 billion gas per total. So far, the estimate cost is to be determined by the front end engineering. We are trying to complete by the end of this year or early next year. The first thing of course we'll submit to our partner and the government for the approval. So we would announce about that front end engineering, their participation at the early half of 2010.</p>
          <p>So far, there were first well cash and although we found to be very positive and all the appraisal well now being complete. So we expect that development is subject to the Board and they come and approval, we will start in 2010 with our first production will be about 201 feet. So did that give you an overview on that?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[inaudible. Yeah, that's definitely helpful. Yeah, just kind of curious if...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll follow up on marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing, yeah, on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked a very good question for marketing. We've been actually negotiating for the MOU with the various parties. The first one I can highlight is the marketing re-negotiate with Hong Kong especially the Hong Kong government <mark type="inaudible" />. So that has been moved <mark type="inaudible" /> progress very smoothly and more or less the reference pricing would be in line with LNG price and because of the Hong Kong is only 320 kilometers away from the well, they only consume about quarter of the production from this well. The rest will be going to Huizhou, Zhuhai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Those will be subject to market price in line with the latest price signed by <mark type="inaudible" /> and other companies and that will be 10 to 20 year firm price with a excavation on uplift, that price will be determined when we finish <mark type="inaudible" /> and the costs of the development.</p>
