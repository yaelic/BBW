        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning and welcome to the Syngenta 2007 Annual Result Conference. Welcome also to those of you, watching the webcast and listening by phone. Let me start by first briefly describing the market background for industry in 2007. We've faced a fundamental supply demand and balance for the major commodity crops brought about by several years in which food and feed requirements have exceeded agricultural production.</p>
          <p>This has been further accentuated by the expansion of bio-fuels all in a context of limited land availability and climate uncertainty. The resulting low stocks caused crop prices of spiral upward stimulating a worldwide drive to enhance productivity particularly in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In this environment, several aspects of Syngenta's performance stand out. Our sales growth encompassed all product lines and all regions with growth of over 25% in the emerging markets. The ongoing momentum of our new products will be sustained through the advances made in our pipeline. We made acquisitions in the areas we've targeted and identified additional growth opportunities in which we shall be investing.</p>
          <p>And our financial performance reflects our ability to capture growth while maximizing returns with 27% growth in earnings per share and over $1 billion return to shareholders through the dividend and share buyback.</p>
          <p>This chart looks much the same as the one we showed you at the half year. And that's just the point. Even if Harvest in 2007 had been optimal they would not have sufficed to restore commodity stocks to historical levels. And as it turns out Harvest were not optimal in many areas with weather effecting wheat production in Canada, Australia and Europe.</p>
          <p>While Soybean production was inevitably lower due to reduced acreage in the United States. This means that at the beginning of 2008, agriculture continues to face a challenge that can only be met through technology. Usage of crop protection products is increasing and growers are looking for new solutions, which go beyond traditional pest management.</p>
          <p>In seeds, germplasm and biotech traits are playing a pivotal role in yields gain. The biofuels industry is now well established, but still with considerable scope for increasing both efficiency as well as output. And, longer term, there is opportunity in the quest for expanding alternative plant based feeds stocks.</p>
          <p>If we look further ahead, we can see that food and feed are the ongoing drivers of agricultural demand with biofuels a further element in that equation. Most of the world's population growth is taking place in emerging markets and as GDP in these countries increases, so it is calorie demand particularly in the form of meat.</p>
          <p>In order to feed more live stock countries must import more grain, while also seeking to intensify and modernize local agriculture. Again, given land and climate constraints and infrastructure, which is often lacking new technology is crucial.</p>
          <p>Syngenta is the only company able to offer a complete range of solutions covering not just crop protection in seeds, but also seed care and traits. And these solutions are adapted to local conditions and sold across the globe. Our R&amp;D innovation bears witness to our ability to meet indeed anticipate grower's needs and is supported by our industry leading field force and marketing programs.</p>
          <p>The future progress of our business is underpinned by our enviable financial strength, which I know John Ramsay, is eager to tell you more about right now. John?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'm pleased to be able to present our results in a year of considerable financial success. Following a very strong second half, sales at constant exchange rates rose 11% to $9.24 billion with growth across all businesses and all product lines.</p>
          <p>EBITDA, excluding the $50 million one-off payment from Delta &amp; Pine Land was up 16% to $1.85 billion driven by strong sales and further operational savings. Earnings per share rose 27% to reach $0.11 -- $11.6 excluding the one-off payment.</p>
          <p>In addition, our continued focus on cost and capital efficiency, led to a 24% return on invested capital. Sales growth, cost and capital management combined to generate free cash flow of some $800 million. And during the year, through dividend payments and share repurchase, we retuned over $1 billion to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Sales growth of 11%, at constant exchange rates was driven by strong volume growth in both crop protection and seeds, in buoyant market conditions, as Mike has described. Reported sales rose 15% with the $305 million contribution being attributable to the weakness of US dollar during the year. Pricing was notably stronger in the fourth quarter up 3%, leading to a $28 million contribution of the full year. This compares favorably with a $90 million reduction in 2006.</p>
          <p>In crop protection, sales at $7.3 billion were up 11%, with growth across all products lines and regions with notably strong performances in emerging markets of Latin America, South East, Asia, and Eastern Europe. In addition, NAFTA performed extremely well in the second half and registered double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>2007 was another year of share gain in the business, a third in a row and John Atkin will expand on that shortly. New products maintained their outstanding performance reaching sales of $1.2 billion, up 20% in the year. EBITDA of $1.8 billion was driven by volume growth and cost efficiency, which allowed us to make targeted investments in key growth areas whilst delivering a record margin of 25%.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, this business has the capacity to increase margins in the future on the back of sales growth and continued cost efficiency. Selective Herbicides sales rose 8% to past $2 billion driven by further strong performance from our leading product range for corn, notably in the US. And also, by an excellent second year in the market for AXIAL, which expanded rapidly.</p>
          <p>Non-Selective Herbicides were up 21% driven primarily by TOUCHDOWN, which capitalized on the expansion of glyphosate-tolerant acres in the Americas. Fungicide sales also passed $2 billion, driven by an outstanding performance by AMISTAR used on soybeans and wheat providing the main impetus. The new project -- the new product, REVUS was also successfully launched in the UK and Korea.</p>
          <p>Insecticides growth of 7% was driven by ACTARA, notably in Latin America and by KARATE in Europe. 10% growth in Professional Products was driven by Seed Care, where CRUISER, once again delivered an exceptional performance across all regions. Sales of AVICTA were up 50% in its second year on the market and the acquisition of Conrad Fafard contributed 5% to growth in this product line.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis, growth was widespread. Sales in Europe, Africa and Middle-East were driven by strong performance in cereals across Europe, particularly in the fast growing markets of Eastern Europe, where our early investments in these markets is paying off.</p>
          <p>In NAFTA, our leading range of herbicides, both selective and non-selective generated strong growth on both conventional and glyphosate-tolerant acres. Fungicides also showed good growth driven primarily by AMISTAR. Insecticides were slightly lower impacted by lower sales of force.</p>
          <p>Seed Care, once again showed good growth driven by CRUISER, but the star performer was Latin America, up 37% with the main impetus coming from Brazil and Argentina. Soybean was a main driver benefiting all product lines, and the breadth of our offer on a number of crops allowed us to capture growth across the region. Asia Pacific generated growth of 5%, driven by another strong year in China, India, and South East Asia, which more than offset lower sales in Japan.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Seeds, sales at $2 billion rose 12% with strong growth in Corn and Soybean registered in the second half. Vegetables continued to generate good growth, and our business in emerging markets expanded at a rapid rate. EBITDA at $98 million was more than in 2006 with the EBITDA margin at 5% as forecast at the half year. For 2008, I reiterate our target of 5% margin as we continue to invest in R&amp;D and marketing, and confirm that we are on track to achieve in 2011 the targeted 15% margin.</p>
          <p>Corn and Soybean sales rose 12%, driven by strong growth in Corn worldwide, most notably in Brazil, where sales grew 48%, and in the US, where growth was supplemented by a one-off contribution in the fourth quarter relating to the final sales of non-proprietary traits. Increased Corn sales more than offset lower Soybean sales in the US due to reduced acreage. 7% growth in diverse field crops was primarily driven by a strong performance in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Our high margin Vegetables business continued its double-digit growth record at 12%, excluding the effect of the acquisition in the second half of the Israeli company Zeraim Gedera. Flowers growth was supplemented by the consolidation of Fischer, with Europe and NAFTA producing a combined growth of 5%, excluding the acquisition.</p>
          <p>Returning now to the Group as a whole, operating income at $1.5 billion rose 25% on the prior year, driven by strong business performance and good cost management. Further cost savings of $168 million more than offset slightly increased oil related costs and additional expenditure on marketing and development to support specific growth initiatives. The business growth and cost efficiency led to an improvement in operating income margin of 190 basis points to 16.3%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our cost savings, 2007 saw the completion of our 2004 operational efficiency program achieving cumulative annualized savings of $430 million, all net of inflation. On the graph you can see that in addition, we made savings of $88 million from the cost saving plan announced a year ago, and are on track to attain our $350 million target by 2011. Combined savings in 2007 from these two programs, therefore, amounted to $168 million.</p>
          <p>Going forward, savings generated will continue to be used to provide headroom for expenditure to support specific and tracked growth investments. In 2008, we plan to continue to ensure we capture the increased opportunities available to us with $150 million investment. About 50 million of this is R&amp;D in marketing in the Seeds business in line with previous plans. A further $100 million will accelerate growth in Crop Protection through investment in projects, mostly with rapid payback periods, in some cases only two years.</p>
          <p>Net income, excluding the one-off payment from Delta and Pine Land rose 23% driven by an increase in operating income. Net financial expense was slightly higher than an exceptionally low figure in 2006, and the tax payable increased due to the strong business performance and a higher tax rate of 24%. I expect the tax rate to be in the low 20s in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>The business continues to generate substantial levels of cash with free cash flow in 2007 reaching $802 million. Here you can see how we have utilized our cash flow since 2004. Our aim is to maintain balanced capital efficiency through investments to meet the requirements of a fast growing business, making selective acquisitions, but at the same time returning cash to shareholders. In 2007 we achieved our goal with higher CapEx at $317 million whilst reducing the ratio of average trade working capital to sales by 400 basis points to 39%. We were also able to make targeted acquisitions in 2007 and seek to retain the flexibility to do so in the future.</p>
          <p>In addition, we returned substantial levels of cash to our shareholders with gearing reaching 23%. Balanced capital efficiency will continue in 2008 within a gearing target of 25 to 35%. Our total cash return to shareholders since 2004 is some $2.7 billion. In 2008 we intend to propose to shareholders an increase in the dividend to CHF4.80 per share. This is a significant increase of 26% in Swiss francs and over 30% in US dollars. Together with a further share repurchase, we return to return up to $1 billion to shareholders in 2008.</p>
          <p>In summary, in 2007 we continued our consistent record of value delivery and fully intend to do so in the future. This will be achieved through continuing cost discipline to allow headroom to make targeted investments in growth. A constant focus on capital efficiency, coupled with prudent capital investments, and an ongoing retention -- intention to return cash to shareholders. At the same time, the strength of the business enables us to do this while targeting double-digit growth in earnings per share through 2010 as announced this morning.</p>
          <p>Thank you. May I now hand over to Davor for a review of the Seeds business?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning. It is my pleasure to be here for the first time as Chief Operating Officer of Syngenta Seeds, a business which has evolved dramatically over recent years, and which is making rapid progress in key strategic areas. One of these, of course, is US Corn where we're in the middle of a redesign of our range. In 2007, we passed another milestone with the US approval of our double stack containing Agrisure, corn borer and rootworm traits.</p>
          <p>In Vegetables, we continued to gain share in a highly attractive market. In emerging markets, we achieved excellent growth across crops, and prospects have been enhanced by the announcement of significant investments in China. During 2007, we also strengthened our leadership position in Flowers with the acquisition of Fischer which, like the acquisitions we have made in vegetables, will accelerate our growth prospects and reinforce our offer in key crops.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into more detail on these crops, starting with Corn. As I said, we are in the process of transforming our US corn range. We now have all current trait technologies in our portfolio, herbicide tolerance, corn borer, and corn rootworm control. In 2007, we sold these traits singularly and in double stack combinations. In 2008, we are launching our own proprietary triple stack. The transformation process means combining these traits with strong germplasm and then multiplying seed in order to produce full commercial quantities. This takes time but from next year we will be in a position to start to exploit the strength of our technology offer and begin to capture its margin potential.</p>
          <p>This transformation is taking place at a time of dynamic market shifts in the US. In 2007, corn acreage increased by 19%, largely at the expense of soybean. At the same time, triple stack penetration rose markedly to over 20%. The strong demand for corn seed is reflected in our sales, which in the fourth quarter also benefited from the advance sales mentioned by John. As we had no proprietary triple stacks yet available, our market share was lower at 10%.</p>
          <p>We successfully launched our Agrisure rootworm trait in advance of the triple stack launch this year, and stepped up our investment in R&amp;D and marketing. These investments are targeted at increasing grower recognition of our offer, and at advancing our new pipeline traits, which I will show you in a moment.</p>
          <p>The key driver of our performance going forward will be matching our full trait selection to a high quality germplasm. In doing so, we will be bringing growers a highly attractive offer as the following slides illustrate.</p>
          <p>Trial data shows that the yield performance of Agrisure RW, under high rootworm pressure, is fully competitive with other products on the market, as you can see from the bars on the chart.</p>
          <p>The initial quantity sold last year met with strong customer acceptance. The total yield potential of a seed, of course, depends not just on the traits but also on the underlying quality of the germplasm and on the way the traits are ingressed. Stacking technology is highly complex, and our expertise in this area has enabled us to combine our insect traits without yield drag.</p>
          <p>As we expand our production of traited hybrids, we have considerable scope for enhancing yields further and the next slide show why we are so excited about the outlook.</p>
          <p>Our integrated breeding program for corn hybrids is allowing the rapid renewal of our portfolio. We already have a strong position in late maturities with leading hybrids bringing a yield advantage versus competitors of up to 15 bushels per acre. The products to be launched in 2009 will replicate this advantage in the early and mid maturities. This means that we will have a full combined offer of competitive traits and germplasm.</p>
          <p>Since we showed you this slide last time the pace of triple stack introduction has accelerated, and from 2010 we intend to bring to market multi-stack options drawing on our pipeline. By 2011 we expect 85% of our portfolio to be triple stacked or more, and this will be accompanied by ramp up of our elite hybrid offer.</p>
          <p>Since the acquisition of Garst and Golden Harvest in 2004, we have selected the best performing hybrids from our combined germplasm, and in 2008 these will already account for 40% of our offer. The combination of new elite hybrids with competitive traits will reinforce our market position and significantly improve profitability.</p>
          <p>As we expand our corn offer in the US, we will be capitalizing on the unparalleled breadth of our portfolio, which enables us to offer growers not just seeds and traits but also a leading Crop Protection and Seed Care range. We have branded this unique offer in our AgriEdge program launched in 2006, which saw a strong increase in sales last year to well over $150 million benefiting both Seeds and Crop Protection.</p>
          <p>Both the number of participating growers and sales per grower increased last year, an indication of the value of such programs in a highly sophisticated market. We now have broad US coverage with 12 learning centers attended by corn and soybean growers representing some 80 million acres.</p>
          <p>Our corn trait pipeline has made significant progress. Our triple stack is, as I've said, now in the market. Next year we plan to launch our second-generation traits for a broad-spectrum insect control, VIP broad lep, with the new mode of action which represents an important new tool in the management of insect resistance.</p>
          <p>In biofuels, we are delivering breakthrough technology with corn amylase, which has received FDA approval and is awaiting USDA approval with commercial plantings expected to start next year. Corn amylase will increase ethanol yield per bushel while improving factory throughput and energy consumption.</p>
          <p>We're also working on a number of agronomic traits, and have achieved a substantial advance in drought tolerance, which has moved into the elite breeding stage. Drought pressure in the US corn market is increasing with approximately half of US growers affected by dry condition at some point, and some 12% experiencing severe drought. Our native traits program, scheduled for launch in 2011, will bring together combinations of genes, which will improve the ability of plants to perform under drought stress without carrying a yield penalty under more favorable conditions. The combination of leading genes will deliver around 10% more yield in drought conditions or allow growers to maintain existing yield while using 50% less water.</p>
          <p>We are also developing two GM events with positive results over the past four seasons, which should take the yield advantage to well over 10 bushels per acre. These projects put us in an excellent position to build on and expand our drought tolerance offer, following on from the introduction of Invinsa, which John will talk to you about in his presentation.</p>
          <p>In soybean, traits are currently less complex and germplasm performance is, therefore, critical. We made further progress in this exciting business in 2007, increasing our market share of over 12%, and placing us in a strong position in a year when soybean acreage is likely to be higher. This chart shows you why.</p>
          <p>In large-scale trials, NK soybeans outperformed in 77% of cases, delivering more than 60 bushels per acre compared with an industry average of 41 bushels. Our leading varieties outperformed the competition in more than 90% of cases.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the market value of Corn &amp; Soybean combined is over $3 billion. The corn market last year was driven by acreage, up 9%, and more particularly by intensity and the penetration of GM technology. We out-performed the market with sales growth of almost 40% and are leveraging our US investments to progress our GM and germplasm offer.</p>
          <p>Our glyphosate tolerant, GA21, is already approved in Argentina and has been submitted for registration in Brazil where we have already received approval for Bt-11 corn borer control.</p>
          <p>Our Soybean business is small but showing explosive growth, driven by the strength of our germplasm, the introduction of ground up ready technology, and our existing strong market position in Crop Protection.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the development of emerging markets generally and across crops. Our business in these markets has shown annual growth of 23% over the last five years and now has sales of almost $0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, the focus is on expanding our Corn portfolio and extending our leadership position in sunflowers. In Asia, our field crops position will be strengthened through our participation in the Chinese corn company, Sanbei, and our research collaboration with the IGDB. Vegetable sales are accelerating across the region, particularly in India and China.</p>
          <p>Globally, vegetables have continued their impressive performance delivering annual growth of 11% over the last five years. In 2007, we increased our global market share to 13% while maintaining very attractive margins.</p>
          <p>As I have just mentioned, sales in Asia Pacific grew rapidly reflecting strong consumer demand and expansion of local varieties. In the US, sales of our innovative fresh produce under the Dulcinea brand also showed strong growth.</p>
          <p>Last year's acquisition of Zeraim Gedera, following on from that of Emergent Genetics in 2006, has strengthened our European position in key high margin crops, such as tomato and pepper. Alongside the acquisition of Fischer, new opportunities are opening up for our flower seeds through the introduction of combined offers with Lawn and Garden, part of our Professional Products business.</p>
          <p>Our Seeds and Plant Protection products target the same customer, professional growers of ornamental plants. Following the acquisition of Fafard in 2006, we can also offer these customers integrated solutions including growing media and our partnerships with COMPO and Westland are broadening our access to the end consumer.</p>
          <p>At the center of our seed strategy is our focus on key crops. In Corn, we're making rapid progress in the transformation of our portfolio and have a very exciting pipeline, which will expand our biotech footprint into the next decade.</p>
          <p>In Soybeans, we have a strong position in the US and are rapidly expanding in Latin America. In Vegetables, we are delivering double-digit annual growth and continue to gain share through meeting consumer demand for consistent high quality and innovation.</p>
          <p>In Flowers, we are the world leader and will enhance this position through integrated offers with our Lawn and Garden business. And finally, the emerging markets represent a major opportunity in all crops and one which, as you have seen, we're already capturing.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand you over to John Atkin for a review of our Crop Protection business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Davor. Well done. 2007, ladies and gentlemen, was an outstanding year for Crop Protection. Not just because of improved market conditions but particularly because of the continued progress we made in market share and profitability. In a market likely to have grown around 9 or 10%, we gained in three out of four regions.</p>
          <p>In NAFTA, our leading position in Corn enabled us to take advantage of higher corn acres. In Europe, another strong performance in the East offset a small decline in the West where in some territories we're in the early phase of introducing new products.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, notably Brazil and Argentina, we outperformed in markets, which grew significantly, driven by our product strength and a strategy well adapted to these dynamic countries.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our local strength in the growing markets of China, India, and South East Asia enabled us to outperform. Now let me review some of these achievements in a bit more detail.</p>
          <p>Our distinctive strategy is unchanged. Portfolio expansion has three critical elements. Of course, introduction and growth of new products, but also enrichment of our existing range with new combinations and formulations, and range enhancement where we add selected technology from third parties.</p>
          <p>Tailored business models enable us to exploit the strength of our portfolio in a way that is adapted to local markets around the world. In 2007, it meant that we fully capitalized on the strong demand in most crops and territories. Furthermore, the buoyancy of agricultural markets is opening up new opportunities, and from these we are creating new markets, and I'll be giving you some examples of this in a moment.</p>
          <p>The consistent growth of new products illustrates the excellent return from our R&amp;D, and in 2007 sales increased 20% to $1.2 billion. All the products you see here are further upsides through new crop labels and greater market penetration.</p>
          <p>REVUS, our new fungicide for vegetables and vines, was the latest addition. From initial sales, the product has already proved its effectiveness against high disease intensity and will be launched in several large markets this year, including the USA where I can tell you we were granted registration a few days ago.</p>
          <p>Now bridging to the pipeline, but with a very similar story of progress, this year will see the first launches of Durivo, the brand name for our new product based on the insecticide, Rynaxypr, developed through our agreement with DuPont.</p>
          <p>We are also delighted to be able to talk, for the first time, about Invinsa. This is the first ever product to counter the effects of moderate drought and other plant stress.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term pipeline has made further progress. 520, our new fungicide is moving rapidly through development for cereals and other crops. 524, the seed treatment fungicide is proving its potential in a range of applications, and 449 will ensure our continued leadership in corn herbicides. We also have three products in early development, two of which have made significant progress, and we have revised up their combined sales potential to over 500 million. The total peak sales of this pipeline, now exceeds 2 billion.</p>
          <p>Durivo will set new standards underpinned by out-performance against current treatments. The photographs on the slide are indicative of outstanding results we are seeing in many crops worldwide. Now, Durivo controls a broader spectrum of insects, including resistant pests, and it offers considerable advantages for growers through being lower dose and longer lasting. We received our first registration for Durivo at the end of last year in Indonesia, and in 2008 we plan accelerated launches in five countries including the United States. By 2011, we expect to be present in all major territories, and our peak sales target for Durivo is 300 million.</p>
          <p>In 2007, strength in corn assumed great important with the record number of acres planted, but I'd like to give you a longer-term perspective. Our global Corn business has grown strongly over a prolonged period, mainly from outside the US with the launch of the current CALLISTO range. In the United States, despite the introduction of glyphosate-tolerant corn, which now accounts for 60% of planted acres, our sales have remained at around 500 million, and we have increased our share significantly, as you can see from the slide. Growers recognize the importance of pre-emergence treatment on conventional and glyphosate-tolerant acres in order to maximize yield. And they also recognize the superiority of our combination products, Lexar and LUMAX, as well as CALLISTO and BICEP, in meeting these needs.</p>
          <p>TOUCHDOWN has played a relatively minor role in this performance, but increased in 2007 as we rolled out herbicide programs. In 2008, we have launched Halex GT combining glyphosate with selective herbicides in one convenient product, and it is tailor-made for maximizing yields in glyphosate-tolerate acres, and in dealing with the increasing problem of weed resistance. Underpinning this performance is, of course, the support we offer growers and the channel, and our integrated AgriEdge programs with seeds, as Davor has explained.</p>
          <p>Now with corn at over $4 a bushel you can imagine that there is further incentive for US growers to maximize yield, and during the past two years Syngenta has been developing fungicides for corn, and has demonstrated that Quilt consistently raises yields against a background of increasing disease pressure. In 2007, therefore, farmers started to treat for disease in corn for the first time. With our strengths in the Corn Belt, we target a leading position in a market that could exceed 300 million.</p>
          <p>High wheat prices led to increasing investment in Crop Protection products. Our AMISTAR range of combination products and programs with BRAVO, essential as a resistance breaker for the important disease Septoria, played a critical role. We are continuing to reinforce our cereal herbicide portfolio with AXIAL, which was launched in nine new countries in 2007, and sales doubled. Over the last five years, we've been successfully expanding our cereals portfolio worldwide, including North America, Australia, Argentina, and India. High global wheat prices provide a favorable environment for further growth. The pipeline products already discussed will further enhance the potential of this business.</p>
          <p>Last year, we achieved excellent growth throughout the emerging markets. Our go-to-market strategies take account of the different needs of growers, say in China, where farms are typically less than one hectare in size, compared with Brazil, where 5,000 hectare holdings, or bigger, are common. But underpinning our success everywhere is the breadth of our product range and our ability to match it to local needs and, of course, the strength of our field force to deliver it. We are able to offer growers the support and advice they need as their use of technology progresses. Now, we're expanding our investments in these markets to ensure continued growth, and let me give you a couple of examples.</p>
          <p>In 2007, the response of Latin American growers to high commodity prices amply demonstrates the critical role which this region plays in meeting global demand. Acreage expansion was relatively modest at around 5%, but usage intensity increased significantly as growers invested in technology to maximize yield. The spotlight was on Soybean, but we also increased our sales in most other crops. Overall, sales were up by 40% and this without increasing our risk profile, which is well managed through our secured credit programs. And we are putting our experience of risk management in Latin America to good use in other emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to East Europe, the numbers on the slide show you the potential. Nearly -- the acreage nearly twice that of Western Europe, but a Crop Protection market which is currently less than one-third of the size. The market opportunity increases the further east you go, and we are particularly excited about the progressive modernization of agriculture in Russia and the Ukraine. In these countries, we're concentrating on the large agro holdings who are engaged in modernizing farming practice. This is illustrated by the rapid rate of expansion of our product range. Currently, professional farmers account for only 12% of the total acreage, but their presence and influence is growing supported by Syngenta's programs, which can double yields from one year to the next. Now, this is the reason why our growth rates exceed 20% in Russia and the Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Syngenta identified Seed Care as a major market opportunity some years ago, and the growth of high value GM Seed has enhanced our opportunity with growers increasingly eager to purchase Seed Care solutions to protect their investment in high value seed. The expansion of the market has been accompanied by the introduction of new concepts, such as AVICTA, the first Seed Care product for nematodes in cotton. The Seed Care solutions we offer encompass a wide range of crops and have enabled us to increase our market share significantly over the last five years.</p>
          <p>Our leading Seed Care product is the insecticide CRUISER, which we market in combination with disease treatments. Now, we have discovered that the application of CRUISER brings a unique vigor effect, and as you can see from the slide, it makes the plants grow bigger, greener, and stronger, and this leads to higher yields. The benefit occurs whether or not there is insect pressure. Now, we've invested significant resources in discovering the mechanism by which this occurs and provided hard evidence that it is a real and reliable benefit, particularly in Soybeans. The novelty of this development is confirmed by the IP protection we have now received in major markets, and this is leading to an increase in demand from customers around the world.</p>
          <p>Three weeks ago, we signed a Letter of Intent with Rohm and Haas to develop and commercialize Invinsa Technology. Invinsa is a sprayable chemical formulation which protects crop yield during extended periods of high temperature and mild to moderate drought. The increasing occurrence of drought in many regions of the world means there is a ready market for the product, which we target to introduce within two years. This will be the first product of this type to be marketed. It has great potential to be developed in association with our fungicides and insecticides, and will be compatible with our drought resistance technology traits which are in development, as Davor mentioned. We estimate a market potential for Invinsa in excess of $500 million.</p>
          <p>Now the fact that Syngenta was chosen to market this technology attests to our expertise in product development and to the unrivaled breadth and reach of our business worldwide.</p>
          <p>And so to conclude, let me reiterate why we feel so good about our Crop Protection business. Agricultural demand continues to increase and there is no doubt that crop protection will play an important role in meeting this demand. We, therefore, expect the industry to show growth over the medium term, and we expect to continue gaining market share in this improved environment. Our upgraded pipeline will be instrumental in this. We have Durivo and Invinsa to launch over the next two years alone, and we have exciting new projects taking us through well into the next decade. Our sales growth record in emerging markets is impressive, and let me remind you that it is in these markets where the bulk of the increase in world food production needs to take place.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand you back to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Never has the need to increase agricultural productivity been greater and Syngenta is playing an essential and increasingly important role in an expanding market. Our presentation today shows how we are uniquely positioned to help meet the global challenges in agriculture thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and our ability to offer tailored solutions to growers across the world.</p>
          <p>In this promising environment our strategic direction and determination remain unchanged. In Crop Protection, we are focusing on continuing market share gains and are maximizing the wealth of new opportunities opening up before us. In Seeds, we are accelerating our corn trade offer while building on our successful growth record in Vegetables and our industry leading position in Flower Seeds.</p>
          <p>We offer growers a comprehensive portfolio that is second to none, covering all areas of technology. We are investing in growth across our business and financing these investments through cost efficiency, for which we already have a proven track record. This strategy, and the positive outlook for agriculture markets underpins our target of delivering double digit growth in earnings per share through 2010, while continuing to return cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>That concludes today's presentation and the team and I would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>We have a number of people here in London. And before we get underway, I would also like to introduce two additional members of the Executive Committee here in the front row; Robert Berendes, who heads our Strategy and Business Development Group and Dave Lawrence, who is the Head of R&amp;D. I'll take all of your questions and share them along with my colleagues. For those of you joining by the webcast, the monitor here, I'll try to alternate between the conference room here and the webcast. And we also have a capability to take your email questions along the way. So, with that, if you could please state your name and the firm you're with, it would help for our listeners.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Jean de Watteville from Lehman Brothers. Three questions. The first one is on Invinsa. Indeed, a new product, at least me. Can you just elaborate on what's the mode of action? Is it a pre-emergence spray and, therefore, should we expect a stable market? Or is it -- and -- or is the spray happening when the drought occurs and therefore we could expect quite a volatile market? The second question is on Corn. You are now, I think, in the second year of partnership with DuPont. We have many presentations from DuPont, Dow and Monsanto, about how outstanding is their Herculex trait. I would be very interested if you can share with us your view on how compare Agrisure with Herculex. And what's the potential of cross-licensing Agrisure and Herculex with potentially Syngenta using Herculex, and potentially DuPont using Agrisure in its portfolio? And the third question is on pricing and Glyphosate and we all know Glyphosate is particularly tight right now. I'm just very interested about the consequences for Syngenta. Have you secured your sourcing of glyphosate at stable prices? Do you suffer from glyphosate price inflation, cost of goods, and what's the type on a visionary impact in the herbicide market we should expect from that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well we've got our work cut out for us here. Invinsa, first, mode of action and how does it work. John, if you could field that as well as, perhaps, then talk about the whole glyphosate pricing and sourcing evolution. And then, Davor, some thought to Herculex, our overall agreement with DuPont Pioneer and how do the combinations of traits perhaps stack up over the next couple of years. No pun intended. John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do know exactly how Invinsa works. It interrupts the production of a compound called ethylene. Ethylene tells the plant to go into a sort of senescence mode to start to shutdown during periods of drought. And by stopping it, what you do is you retain it in a much healthier condition, and when moisture returns, it will perform much more strongly. So you can imagine from that the time to apply it is during the vegetative phase. So the sorts of timings we use for fungicides. So it's not a pre-emergence material.</p>
          <p>Are we concerned that it'll be a volatile market? Well, many of our products are in what you might consider to be volatile markets. We're very used to how to position our fungicides and insecticides and we feel that, particularly working with those compounds as well, this is a terrific addition to our range.</p>
          <p>Glyphosate well, I think the best comment I can make around our supply is to tell you that our sales were up around 50% in 2007. So we are able to expand our supply. I can also tell you that there is some cost of goods pressure, and -- the that price increases are being achieved. And of course, we will be doing our absolute best to satisfy both the demand and to get the price increases that are necessary. Of course, not least because this product brings terrific benefits to our customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're delighted with the performance of Agrisure. It's meeting all of our expectations. So the short answer is we don't see any short-term need to get into any sort of cross-licensing arrangements on Herculex. We're very pleased with Agrisure.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much. A couple of quick questions. Firstly, can you clarify the market share gains, perhaps by product or by geography, and whether it's driven by new products or old products? Secondly, I'm interested in specifically the 3% pricing in the fourth quarter. Do you think that is because of the Chinese capacity shutdowns, increase in commodity prices, or do you think there's a secular price change here, i.e., extrapolating it forward for the next couple of years. How confident would you feel that the pricing dynamic has changed? And did that, in fact, give you anything towards your increased guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, look, market share gains, and I presume this question is centered around crop protection, so market share gains, John, across the territories and how do you see the evolution of pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I won't repeat the numbers that we showed you on the slide, but we did gain share in three out of the four regions. Why? Two reasons. One is to do with our portfolio. We had a lot of launches last year. I showed you the number we had in East Europe as an example. And the other piece is to do with our marketing and our tailored business models. We're very, very happy at being on the leading edge of the growth in emerging markets. In fact, close to 80% of our growth came from emerging markets, so it's there where we have -- we've had a lot of our outperformance.</p>
          <p>Pricing, yeah. It's clearly a better environment to get price increases in. I mean, there's no question that when your customers are having a better time your chances of getting price increases, particularly as we are bringing them products that have huge added value, is great. But we are in very competitive markets. I mean, just to give you an example, I mean West Europe is not a market which is growing very rapidly. North America is not a market that is growing particularly fast. So it's a mix of different markets, different circumstances. We will do whatever we can, our teams around the world, to get price increases that we feel are fully justified. And the environment is better. It is only February and I'm not sure I can really give you much more guidance than that, other than to say it's a more favorable environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also an additional question on Crop Protection pricing. It says here it is 3% in Q4. I would assume is massively driven by TOUCHDOWN. Can you a little bit talk about products and how was actually TOUCHDOWN influencing? Or did you see also other areas price increases? And, obviously, you already mentioned it; we saw these price increases especially in Latin America. That's a very strong region with some bottlenecks. How do you feel globally for 2008, could there be then bottlenecks in other areas, other regions, or do you think supply will fast catch up, so to say, with the higher demand globally? And second question actually is -- sorry, one moment, is regarding your CapEx plans. Could you give us a idea about your CapEx need potentially for the next three years? And is your increase in seeds having effect on your CapEx budgets here? That's if for the questions, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So more interest in TOUCHDOWN and pricing, the guidance to John for that, and John Ramsay, if you could give a little bit of a steer on how we see the evolution of the capital program over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me try not to repeat myself, although what I said before still holds true. A bit more precision on the 3%, that was for the whole business. So 2% was crop protection's improvement in Q4. There really are a lot of moving parts in this equation, and yes, glyphosate is part of it, yes, Latin America is part of it. As I mentioned before, there are competitive areas in markets that aren't growing so fast. It's a mix of many, many things. And I know I am going to repeat myself, but we do believe that it will be part of our growth expectation for 2008 pricing. And we'll try and get what we can. I mean it's on -- it's not going to be a radical departure, but it should be -- it should make a contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as capital expenditure is concerned, you've seen in 2007, we had a capital expenditure about $317 million, and this is somewhat higher than depreciation which has been running at in the past. Additional opportunities in the market for both crop protection and seeds are going to result in more investments in capital expenditure over the next three years, probably between about 350 to about $400 million in total CapEx between 2008, 2010. I think, after that, dropping back closer to depreciation levels.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>So if we could take a phone call, <mark type="Inaudible" /> from Helvea. Go ahead. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Three questions also, if I may. Firstly, I was wondering what the main surprises were to you guys, to top management in the fourth quarter, apart from Latin America obviously? Then secondly, the third segment used to be called Plant Science; obviously now it's called Business Development. I was wondering what the exact changes were here or what prompted you to introduce the new name? Were there also organizational changes? Were there reallocations of items? It seems as if there were, since EBITDA improved sharply from 95 -- from a loss of US$95 million last year to -- or in 2006 rather, to a loss of 14 million. Then thirdly, you've shown a slide where we see oil related costs, I think increased some US$19 million in 2007. I was wondering whether you could give us some guidance on this item for 2008. And also, whether -- I was wondering whether you could elaborate a little bit on the additional growth investments, both in seeds and crop protection. And sorry, if I may also, fourthly, can I just clarify this? Overall fourth quarter pricing increases in terms of selling prices, the crop protection were plus 2% and plus 4% for seeds, or for the group? I didn't understand that. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, there was a host of largely financial questions. And if I could ask John Ramsay, the fourth quarter crop protection price evolution with what part seeds and what part CP, shape the overall growth investment profile for the company this coming year, a word about oil increase, and the Business Development change and impact on the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well maybe, starting in reverse and making sure I remember the questions. The pricing in the fourth quarter was 2% for crop protection, 3% for the group as a whole. The reason for mentioning it is that it is indicative, I think of a more favorable environment for pricing as we go into 2008, with all the qualifications at this time of the year that John alluded to.</p>
          <p>Insofar as the -- and just onto the Business Development, I think the question, just to elaborate for people, was why have we renamed the previously categorized business Plant Science segment to Business Development? This is simply a name change. It's just more reflective, I think of the way we've been operating that segment under the leadership of Robert Berendes for the last few years. There has been no change to the accounting or the allocations. The reason why you're seeing a favorable EBITDA movement between 2006 and 2007 is because that's where we've recorded the credit or the income from Delta and Pine Land is in that business segment. So that's the reason for that.</p>
          <p>Oil, yes, oil came out at about $20 million effect on the bottom line in 2007. I can't predict oil prices any more than anybody else can, but I think if we have oil prices staying around current levels then you could see somewhere up to about a $30 million impact in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got an email this morning here from <mark type="Inaudible" />. And it reads, can you explain why gross margin declined to 49.5% in 2007 from 50.8% in 2006, and what is the outlook? So continuation of the finance question, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Yes, I think so far as margins are concerned, I think the important point to recognize here in terms of EBITDA margin. The group is at 20.6% EBITDA margin. That is a record level. We've produced productivity improvements and particularly in the crop protection business, continuously since the formation of the company. We added something like 130 basis points to the crop protection net margin, net EBITDA margin in 2007. At a gross margin level there's two effects here, one is in seeds, well main reason is in seeds but in so far as we have this mix of corn and soy, which we explain to the half year, which defeated the gross margin in seeds quite significantly and that's had a knock on impact into the total of the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here in the front row. Can you, again, say your name and your firm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's <mark type="Inaudible" />. I just have two questions. The first one is on what is your US corn acreage forecast for 2008? And how many acreage do you expect to be covered by your triple stack in 2008? And what do you expect in 2009 as well? And the second question was on fungicides. Given the increase in acreage in Europe, the high crop prices, which justifies spending more on this type of agrochemicals and also the mild weather at the start of the year. Would you expect to see a strong increase in the fungicide application rates in their first half? That's it for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll start backward, right here in our backyard. John, the overall pricing and usage of fungicides in Europe how do we see it this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to set the background little bit, I mean we still believe the East Europe will be a more exciting growth opportunity than West Europe. Comment on West Europe, we've seen a little bit more acreage in the ground but only just on a 2% in terms of wheat plantings. It's too really to comment on the weather. We get excited about the weather when late February and March comes around, and I don't think we can read anything into the weather. No, question there is a good environment for farmers who invest in their crops in general, whether it be fungicide or herbicides or even insecticides where necessary. So of course, we'll be trying to encourage them to do that and maximize their yield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And continuation of the forecasting question, Davor, our current forecast on corn and soy acreage and the amount of acres that we'll find with our newly introduced triple stack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously, it's still early in the season to predict accurately the acreage of the crops in the US. We're along with everybody else waiting for the USDA announcement next month. But our best guess at the moment is somewhere between 88 and 90 million acres of corn. As Mike asked the question about soybean, best guess is soybean is between 67 and 70. In terms of our triple stack in 2008, as you may have seen from the graph, we expect about 12% of our portfolio to be represented by our triple stack offer. And in '09 that's going to go up significantly to 30%, and the important thing I'd stress here is that that will also include an even greater shift to our proprietary traits within that offer. So '09 is a really key test for us in terms of our own proprietary triple stacks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. <mark type="Inaudible" />.Just a question if I remember correctly at the time where you brought the EBITDA margin down in seeds the -- there was a question mark regarding the mix soybean, corns. I want to get your vision on that. Industry sources are talking about maybe a 5% volume shift reverse towards soybean. And the potential upside that we could see in seeds margin; that was the first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So John Ramsay, if the acres shift back to soybean a little bit from where they were last year, what financial impact will that have on our US seed business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As far as the margin effect in 2007 is concerned, again it was largely that switch from soybean into corn because of the relativity of the margins. So I think in 2007, the margin on corn is somewhat higher because it's got more proprietary material in it, so simply the queen is a little bit more equalized. But I don't think, the actual mix is going to be the major influence on the margin in 2008. I think that's going to be more driven by the level of investment, which is more material in terms of where the margin comes out and given the 50 million that we are planning to invest in the business in 2008, then we expect the margin to be at 5%.</p>

          <p>From UBS. Three questions please. You mentioned that the winter wheat planting looks like it's up 2%, and we were hearing sort of the very conflicting messages on the set aside impact. Some companies are saying that farmers have basically ignored what you were saying last season have planted it anyhow, and then just like they are and just follow the economics. And some people are saying the whole impact is coming in 2008. I was just wondering what your view is, how that's playing into the European top line in 2008? Second question, what was the acquisition impact on the 11% constant currency growth for the Group for these two, three little acquisitions? And then, finally, split in two parts, cash flow statement. You've got a line other provisions which keeps growing. I just wondered what that is? It's just the last line before the operating cash flow keeps going up? And then you, when you talk about capital expenditure you talk about capital expenditure on fixed assets, yet you've got a line purchase of intangible and financial assets. And again, that was a lot higher than what I was looking for. Can you explain what it is? Is that acquired and is that part of the acquisition budget, or is that a capital -- organic capital expenditure for the organic business? And what is the guidance for that? Please.</p>

          <p>So, two part question. The first, the impact of wheat and the set aside John Atkin, if I could ask you to do that. And Thomas you had a couple of specific questions, I think John's going to be able to put his finger right on that. It was three part, acquisitions, other provisions, as well as the fixed asset accounting. So, John, maybe you can . . .</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the basic answer, in terms of our assumptions, is that the set aside reduction will not have a major effect. We think that the potential for farmers to invest in growing more intensively, more inputs, getting better yields, is more important than that. A couple of comments on the set aside itself. I don't think farmers are ignoring it necessarily, but this set aside land, some of it was in marginal land, some of it was already being used for biofuels or other crops which was allowed. So the potential to make a dramatic shift is not really there. And so we -- it's rather normal, we think, what's happening. And it will probably take fully two years for that to have worked into high input crops. And even then, it won't be as high as some of the heartland production that we see today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, Thomas, you may have to remind me on this, the final question. But just on the first two financial ones, the effect of the acquisitions on the top-line was 1%. On the total Group, it's 11%. 1% will come off for acquisitions. So far as the other provisions is concerned, that's just basically the movement in cash out of provisions prior year that are not mentioned in the cash flow statement above. We mentioned the big one, such as restructuring, and all other cash flow effects other than that, come out of there. I don't see that as particularly significant. It's moved by about 20 million year-on-year, and it will stay at similar levels into the future.</p>
          <p>And I may have misunderstood your question on CapEx and acquisitions, but do come back to me. We spent about 160 million on acquisitions in 2007. We've spent about 317 million on fixed capital expenditure. The guidance for CapEx, as I said in the previous question, 350 to 400 for three years, dropping back to closer to depreciation levels in 2011. So far as acquisitions are concerned, as you know, it's a -- it's variable. Sorry, go on.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>104 million, and it keeps going up. And I'm just wondering whether that's a negative effect from acquisition or is that bulk spending, expenditure for the organic business development?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry for misunderstanding. Our ongoing level of expenditure on intangibles is constant, about $60 million. Any difference in that from the figure you're seeing will be purchase really acquisition related.</p>

          <p>A question on this side here, the front row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Andrew Benson from Citigroup. Couple of sort of things I didn't really understand. On the, you said on the corn seed sales, it was the last year of non-proprietary trait sales, or some issue like that. I didn't really understand what that meant and that was contributed to a strong end to the year. On the -- other, again, I didn't quite understand. I thought the triple trait was going to be a glyphosate-tolerant one and the indication was there's a LibertyLink. Can you just sort of explain what that approach is, whether you're going to use glyphosate-tolerant traits or GA21, or the -- just how that's panning out? Can you also just give us an idea of what price increases you've posted and what the indications are on January of what seems to be sticking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I'll take a pass at the first two questions because one of them relates to legacy acquisition of our Garst and Golden Harvest. We needed to have completed selling down some of that inventory as provision and part of a license that we inherited with those two acquisitions. And that needed to have been done by the fourth quarter of 2007. So that's what we referred to when we said completing the sale of non-proprietary traits. Of course, for the past two years we've been getting ready to put our proprietary germplasm and traits into those two acquired businesses. So that was something that we had planned for and is now behind us.</p>
          <p>With respect to the triple stack, that terminology has traditionally come to mean corn borer and corn rootworm, as well as glyphosate-tolerant trait. But many people overlooked the fact that there has been a long standing herbicide-tolerant trait known as Liberty Link and Syngenta has had Liberty Link trait in much of this corn for quite a few years, which, actually makes it a forth trait, which is two different modes of action for herbicide, one resistant to gluphosinate and the other resistant to glyphosate. So much of the product that we have this year already contains that Liberty Link trait. In an effort to just be comparing across the industry, the triple stack that we will be introducing this year is for glyphosate-tolerant and corn bore and the corn rootworm. So, but the price increases that we put on the list, John Atkin, across our CP businesses, already out there, how confident are we that they'll stick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What we currently have is, of course, the only region that's really in major season is Latin America. And so a continuation of what we saw in Q4 in terms of a better pricing environment is continuing into the first quarter of this year. This I can tell you. It's the only region that is significantly in season. In the Northern Hemisphere, we're just doing the pricing work. And, just to perhaps remind you, I mean our products all go through distributors, distributors have programs and rebates, and it will be a while before we're sure exactly what price increases will stick. But the one that that's in season is LATAM, and there we have a continuation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We've time for one more question. Right here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have just two questions on seeds. Sorry, it's <mark type="Inaudible" />. First of all, on seed margins, you've aimed for 15% by 2011. Can you talk just a little bit about how do you see yourself getting there, whether that would be effected if you do any more acquisitions in the meantime? And, given you had a slight down tick in margins there through marketing and development spend, how you see your marketing and developing spend developing as part of that? And second question is on the triple stack, clearly this is a great market at the moment, everyone is trying to get into it, everybody is watching over it. How many years does it take for that product gets commoditized and people start reducing prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The first question on margin evolution for our corn seed business to 15%, John, if you could say a word about that and then, Davor, as a triple stack becomes much more penetrated, what's the likelihood that price is going to be the competitive factor there? Okay, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of progress towards 15%. What we are doing in this business, investing in R&amp;D and marketing, that's the most significant influence on the net margin for the next couple of years. What you will see is an improvement in the gross margin. And in 2008, I expect an improvement in the seeds gross margin. As we get towards 2011, and then corn and the portfolio transition there is going to have a significant effect, but it's not going to be the only effect. And the rest of the seeds business in terms of vegetables and diverse field crops in terms of their growth that's also going to be contributing to achievement of the margins. So, given where we are standing today, I feel quite confident that that's we're on track for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Davor, triple stack, looking ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, our perspective on this would be it's very difficult to divorce the pricing and of the traits, because the grow ultimately buys is corn seed and what he is most interested in is yield that's he gets out of that seed, together with the convenience factors associated with various insect control and weed control. So, just looking at the traits whether they be singles, doubles traits, or multiple combinations. It's hard to divorce that from the germplasm. So I think, in the future continuing effort will continue to go into the development of our best yielding germplasm. And, together with traits that will continue to bring benefits to the grower, whether it be in things line drought tolerance and or the input traits that are already established. So we see considerable opportunities to create value for the grower into the future by using our breeding technology and our traits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just like to build on that. That the farmer doesn't stop with the bag of triple stack. As Davor said, its germplasm but it's also crop protection chemicals. The Invinsa technology that John described to you earlier, all of these come together to be crop protection solutions as Davor said, it's all about yield. So we don't see the competitive advantage that Syngenta can bring to this growers stopping with the evolution of more penetration triple stack. The second generation pipeline is right behind that and for those of us who have the means and the determination to use technology and invest in technology and bring that to the market, it's -- the future is bright. So it's onward and upward.</p>
