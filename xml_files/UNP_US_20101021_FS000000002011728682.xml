          <p>Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2010 earnings. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's Web site. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young. You may now begin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Rob Knight, our CFO; and joining us for the first time is Lance Fritz, our newly appointed Executive Vice President, Operations. As you all know, Dennis Duffy, our Head of Operations since 1998 retired this month. Dennis was a great asset to the UP team, helping transform our rail operations and we all wish him the best.</p>
          <p>Now for our earnings. In the third quarter we are reporting record results starting with our earnings of $1.56 per share. That's a 54% increase versus the third quarter of 2009 and our most profitable quarter ever. Third quarter operating income was a record 1.4 billion, a 46% increase.</p>
          <p>Similar to last quarter, we achieved volume growth across each of our 6 business teams. Total third quarter car loadings were up about 14% to more than 2.3 million. That's our highest level in 2 years but still 9% below our peak in 2007. As business levels on the Union Pacific continue to grow, we're providing excellent service to our customers as recognized by a new best in quarterly customer satisfaction. We're utilizing processes, technology and our commitment to excellence to safely and efficiently deliver the service product customers expect from Union Pacific.</p>
          <p>We combined strong volume growth, pricing gains and great operating efficiency to produce a record operating ratio of 68.2%. This is 5.6 points better than last year's record performance and our second consecutive quarter under 70. It's very rewarding to report another record performance on behalf of Union Pacific who provide great service to our customers every day. As business levels increase on our railroad, we're leveraging our capital investments and delivering on the customer commitments and potential of the UP franchise.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Jack to walk through the performance of our business team. Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning. With excellent service and an improved economy our third quarter volume increased 14% as all 6 businesses again posted gains. Our core price came in at about 5.5% with improvement in each of the 6 groups. Those price gains combined with a boost from increased fuel surcharge revenue and offset by some negative mix produced a 6% increase in average revenue per car overall. Stronger volume and improved revenue per car drove freight revenue up 21% for the quarter, pushing us up over the $4 billion mark for the first time since fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The strength of our value proposition was reflected in our customer satisfaction scores, where we set a new best ever quarterly mark of 90. Satisfaction actually improved as we moved through the quarter even as volume grew heading into peak season. In September we scored a 91, setting our new best ever month.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me walk you through the performance in each of our 6 business. Ag products revenue grew 16% as 7% volume growth combined with an 8% increase in average revenue per car. Strong worldwide demand for U.S. wheat, corn and soy beans drove a 47% increase in whole grain exports. That strong pull of the export market led to a slight reduction in our domestic shipments. Ethanol continues to be the most significant driver of growth in our grain products segment with volume up 1,500 cars or about 9%. Growth in DDGs also continued with volume up 4% and gluten meal shipments were up 23%. Last but not least, U.S. strong demand for Mexican beer led to a 22% increase in import beer volumes.</p>
          <p>Our Automotive revenue grew 36% as an 18% increase in volume combined with a 16% improvement in average revenue per car which reflects some of the contracts that we've repriced over the recent past.  Volume gains were the result of a 32% increase in finished vehicle shipments as production levels in 2010 continue to closely match vehicle sales. With around 50% of our finished autos and parts business moving to and from Mexico, the flooding in Mexico and South Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Alex resulted in supply chain disruptions but led to flat volume in our vehicle parts business.</p>
          <p>Our Chemicals volumes grew 9%, which combined with a 5% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 14% increase in revenue. Fertilizer volume was up 26%, largely on the strength of export potash. Continued strong demand for finished lubricants and fuels produced an 18% increase in petroleum shipments. The start-up of unit-train service as well as incremental manifest business to unloading terminals at St. James, Louisiana, drove an 80% increase in volume in the emerging crude oil segment of this market. Plastics car loadings were up 7% with growth in domestic shipments and movements to storage and transit more than offsetting a decline in export volumes. And industrial chemical shipments grew 5% boosted by increased industrial production and a return to more normal inventory levels.</p>
          <p>Turning to coal, our Energy revenue was up 11% as volume grew 1% and average revenue per car increased 10. The fourth hottest summer on record and the increased demand for electricity that comes with a stronger economy drove 4% growth in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage. By the end of August, the SPRB stock piles were actually slightly below normal levels, having declined to an estimated 53 days of burn, down from 75 days at the same time last year.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, demand for Colorado/Utah coal continued to be weak, contributing to a 12% decline in volume. Coal stockpiles remain above normal in this market, which faces strong competition not only from eastern coal sources but also from natural gas conversions in the east. Additionally production downtime associated with relocating mining equipment to other reserves reduced coal supply and will most likely continue into 2011.</p>
          <p>Industrial products revenues grew 25% as a 20% increase in volume combined with a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. With a stronger auto industry and increased drilling activity driving demand for steel, our steel and scrap car loadings grew 44%. Non-metallic mineral shipments were up 38% as that increased drilling activity also translates into demand for frac sand, barytes and bentonites. Hazardous waste shipments were up 101% again driven by year-over-year growth of uranium tailings for the Department of Energy. Despite solid profitability, this high volume low revenue per car short haul movement has a significant negative mix effect on overall industrial products where average revenue per car would actually have been 8% if we excluded the impact of the uranium tailings move. Last but not least, while there's been little improvement in construction related markets, our rock shipments were up 20% supported by drilling related construction. Our lumber and cement shipments were actually down year-over-year.</p>
          <p>A 24% increase in Intermodal volume combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit to drive Intermodal revenues up 34%. International Intermodal volume grew 30% as improved consumer demand and some inventory replenishment led to a strong peak season. We also benefited from share gains by our largest ocean carrier. Excellent service that's competitive with single driver truck in major lanes continues to attract highway conversions, driving a 16% growth in our domestic Intermodal segment. Our streamlined subsidiaries' door-to-door product grew 70% with about half of that growth coming off the highway.</p>
          <p>For our International segment, average revenue per unit was up 4% with price gains in fuel recovery partially offset by a combination of negative mix as more revenue empties moved back to the west coast to address the shortage of boxes in Asia. And our last remaining International intermodal legacy contract continued to grow.</p>
          <p>A 17% improvement in average revenue per unit for domestic intermodal shipments reflects the improved price performance and better fuel surcharge recovery made possible by the elimination of our legacy contracts as well as the new product offerings in both our EMP and the UMAX box programs.</p>
          <p>As we look to the rest of the year, the diversity of our business is again emerging as a strength. We should continue to see volume growth even as some markets are struggling to show some signs of recovery. With no indication of any dramatic change up or down in the economy, our run rate should hold until we see the normal softening as peak season winds down and the end of the year approaches. Tight truck supply will create opportunities not only in Intermodal but for our carload business as well and a strong value proposition built on great service will put us in good position to capitalize on opportunities across all 6 businesses. Core price improvement will combine with volume gains to drive our revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you a quick overview of some of the specific growth drivers that we expect to see in the fourth quarter. In our Industrial products business, they look to have the most upside with the best opportunities in markets that are benefiting from improved auto production, increased drilling activity and hazardous waste disposal. International and domestic Intermodal segments will continue to drive growth with some indications that the international peak may be slightly longer than we had originally thought.</p>
          <p>Fall demand for fertilizer is expected to be stronger than last year, and petroleum should also post gains with growth of crude oil shipments to St. James and increased residual fuel oil moves. It also looks like industrial chemicals and soda ash are going to hold their current run rates so that will close the year stronger than a year ago. Increased electrical demand and the expectation of inventory replenishment following a hot summer are expected to keep our coal trains moving and while feed grain exports will likely not be able to match last year's near record levels, wheat exports should provide a nice boost to our Ag products business as we close the year and move into next.</p>
          <p>Finally we expect our Automotive run rate to hold steady as sales are forecast to stay in the mid 11 million range through the end of the year with production slightly ahead of the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>So that's how we see the quarter shaping up. And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance for his report on operations. Lance?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack, and good morning. Let me start today with safety which is where our operating team starts every day. Through the month of September, the employee reportable injury rate is at 1.36, a 6% improvement versus last year. At safety, we focus on continuous improvement toward the ultimate goal of 0 incidents. We also emphasize severity to lessen the impact both to the employee and the company. In addition to the human and financial benefits, running a safe operation enhances service and productivity. Training is especially important today in the on-boarding process as we bring employees back from furlough who haven't worked for us for a year or more, and as our hiring efforts increase our ability to put new employees into train service with a safety mindset is crucial.</p>
          <p>Turning now to service, our service scorecard for the quarter is illustrated on slide 15. As carloads grew almost 5% from July to September, our service delivery index remained near record levels and velocity increased through the quarter. By applying the principals of a unified plan and utilizing available resources, we absorbed the increased workload on the network while maintaining excellent customer service. I'll talk more about productivity in a moment but we continue to see the benefits that volume brings to our network.</p>
          <p>Our high service levels were challenged by Hurricane Alex and its impact on South Texas. Traffic was embargoed over the Laredo and Brownsville gateways for most of the month of July, which normally handle nearly 50% of our north-south Mexico traffic. In addition, Eagle Pass, our second busiest crossing point, was closed for a week before we were able to start using it as a relief valve for our customers. We demonstrated network resiliency as service improved from August to September once we put the hurricane behind us.</p>
          <p>Dialing it down a level, the local operating teams are doing an outstanding job on the basic blocking and tackling of local service. They establish operating plans that meet customer commitments, communicate with customers and then execute those plans. One of those blocking and tackling elements is captured by industry spot and pull, which came in more than 5 percentage points better than last year even though we tightened the measure. Consistent with Jack's discussion on record customer satisfaction, local customer satisfaction is also at an all-time best. Different from the broader customer satisfaction measure, this survey solicits feedback from customers we interact with daily at the shipping and receiving docks where the accuracy and reliability of our industry crews is critical.</p>
          <p>Quality service is also cost efficient. In the third quarter, we leveraged volume through our transportation plan, increasing car loadings faster than crew starts as volumes grew 14% in the quarter versus only an 8% increase in total crew starts. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
          <p>First, gross ton miles per employee increased 9% in the quarter as we utilized more employee resources to handle the increased volume but not on a one for one basis. In fact, this is our strongest quarter of employee productivity in almost seven years. Train length increased for almost every train type with Intermodal and Auto up 8% and 6% respectively versus last year, and with Intermodal train length we hit both a quarterly record of 170 units and a monthly record of 171. Increasing train length enables us to control train inventory levels, which is critical to velocity and service. Freight car utilization also remained strong in the quarter despite a nearly 3% increase in the length of haul.</p>
          <p>Prudent use of our working resources enables us to leverage volume. This slide gives us a quick status update. In terms of employees, we still have 1,100 on furlough. While recall rates have averaged better than 80% this year, the current furlough pool has been out of work since late 2008 so we expect only about half of these to return to service. Because of this, we are ramping up our hiring efforts system-wide for 2011.</p>
          <p>Our locomotive resources are still in good supply although the average age of the remaining surplus fleet is about 26 years and we had fully deployed our DPU locomotives, and our freight car storage number is currently around 30,000. The biggest change since the second quarter is demand for covered hoppers to support export grain demand. Although it's normal for us to have stored cars as a result of seasonality, we would expect a more normal storage number to be around 10,000 to 20,000.</p>
          <p>As we approach the end of 2010, I'd like to update you on the progress of our capital program. We're still targeting approximately 2.6 billion spend this year, but the allocation of that spend has changed a little. Replacement capital accounts for about 70% of the total with the bulk of that devoted to infrastructure. Those programs are basically on plan, and we see the benefits of that in both our safety performance as well as a 20% reduction in slower to miles year over year.</p>
          <p>We successfully completed work on the new Joliet Intermodal Terminal, which opened for business in August. We're purchasing 9,200 intermodal containers and the necessary chassis to support this growing business and we're acquiring 625 new covered hoppers. Probably the biggest change from prior estimates is that our 2010 PTC spending will only be around $100 million versus the 200 million originally targeted. We remain committed to meeting the mandated installation dates but the deployment of this developing technology is a challenge. We have encountered delays in design work and material availability, all related to the fact that this technology is not available off the shelf.</p>
          <p>Another change is that we recently resumed working on our Sunset Corridor with plans to lay about 16 more miles of double track by year-end. When this is cut over, the 760-mile route will be about 63% complete with more to come in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our mission going forward is to continue executing a disciplined operating plan that delivers a high quality efficient service product for our customers. An important element in achieving that goal is to reduce variability in our network. Running a 32,000-mile outdoor factory means that Mother Nature and external forces can introduced any number of unplanned events on a daily basis. Because of that, it's critical that we take the variability out of our operations and take charge of those things that we control. Along with increasing network reliability, we'll continue our evergreen productivity initiatives. And, of course, everything we do to deliver efficient high quality service is done with a safety mindset, making sure that everyone who works for, does business with, or interacts with us does so safely.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Today we are following up our record second quarter results with an even stronger third quarter performance. Slide 22 provides a quick summary of third quarter revenues and expenses. Operating revenue increased 20% to $4.4 billion as operating expenses grew only 11% to $3 billion. This translated into 46% operating income growth to a record $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Over the course of 2010, we've demonstrated strong volume leverage, which is driving higher profits and better margins. Increased year-over-year diesel fuel prices have been the biggest cost driver for the year and contributed roughly one third of the quarter's operating expense increase.</p>
          <p>Third quarter other income increased $11 million versus 2009 to $25 million largely as a result of lower environmental costs as well as higher licensing and rental incomes.</p>
          <p>Interest expense totaled $153 million, down 3 million versus 2009 as average debt levels were slightly lower year over year. Income taxes increased 62% to $495 million as a result of higher pre-tax earnings as well as a higher tax rate. Our third quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 38.9%, which was 1.7 points higher than 2009. Net income was a quarterly best of $778 million, up 51%. Earnings per share increased 54% to $1.56 per share.</p>
          <p>Resuming our share repurchase program in May reduced our outstanding share balance 2% in the quarter, enabling our earnings growth to outpace the rate of net income increases. Of course, a key component of these strong results is a focus on increasing our core rail transportation pricing. Consistent with our discussions about improving prices in 2010, third quarter core price came in around 5.5%. Our legacy renewals, increased demand and quality service all support the strong value proposition of Union Pacific. Included in our core pricing gain is the impact of higher year-over-year RCAF fuel increases, which contributed a little more than 0.5 point in the quarter. This contribution level has been pretty steady throughout 2010. As we close out the year, we continue to feel very positive about our future pricing opportunities and are committed to achieving real pricing gains that will drive higher returns.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the expense details, starting with compensation and benefits at $1.1 billion in the third quarter, a 9% increase versus last year. Roughly half of the higher year-over-year expense relates to wage and benefit inflation. We are also seeing higher costs as train starts increase, generating more starts per employee as well as paying more for overtime and training expenses. In addition, equity and incentive compensation was a little higher year over year, driving about 10% of the increase. Offsetting a portion of these higher costs is our strong employee productivity. We handled a 14% increase in 7-day car loadings with virtually no change in our total workforce levels.</p>
          <p>We did add about 9% to our train and engine ranks, but that was largely offset by decreases in other areas. Through a combination of our capital investments, technology and unified plan initiatives, we are handling more volume more efficiently. As Lance mentioned, we plan to continue recalling furloughed employees as needed for volume and attrition. We also anticipate further hiring as volumes grow and we exhaust the furlough pools across the system.</p>
          <p>Third quarter fuel expense totaled $608 million, a 30% increase versus 2009. Increased year-over-year fuel prices were the primary driver of the higher expense, adding $97 million to the quarter. Higher volumes were also a factor, adding about $42 million. Our efforts to reduce overall fuel usage did help offset a portion of the quarterly cost as our consumption rate improved 1%.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 provides a summary of the third quarter expenses for 3 separate categories. Purchased  services and materials expense increased $52 million in the quarter or 13% to $465 million. Much of this increase relates to greater contract service expense associated with year-over-year volume gain. As our Intermodal business continues to grow, trucking and lift costs are higher. And as we return more stored locomotives to service, both contract services and materials expense increase. Equipment and other rents expense increased just 1% or $2 million to $292 million. The biggest increase in the quarter was car hire expenses associated with increased finished vehicles and Intermodal shipments. Largely offsetting this lower lease expense were locomotives and freight cars. Other expense totaled $178 million, consistent with the guidance that we previously gave you, down $1 million versus the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>As we have discussed the last several quarters, this category continues to benefit from our strong safety performance. State and local taxes, mostly driven by higher property taxes came in higher year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, we will think that other expense will be around the third quarter levels.</p>
          <p>UP's third quarter operating ratio came in at a new best-ever level of 68.2%, 5.6 points better than last year. This is our second consecutive quarter with a sub-70 operating ratio as we continue to drive improvements across all aspects of our operation. Our ability to efficient move growing business volumes at better pricing and better fuel surcharge recovery is driving greater profitability for Union Pacific. This is consistent with our commitment to improve overall returns in our business as well as achieving the goals of our project operating ratio initiative.</p>
          <p>Along with Union Pacific's profitability comes greater cash generation. Through the first 9 months of 2010, cash from operations totaled $3.1 billion, up more than $700 million compared to 2009. Free cash flow after dividends is up substantially as well, totaling over $1 billion, even as we support our 2010 capital program and increased the dividend 22%.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We are being opportunistic with our program, buying back more than 14 million shares year to date for a total of over $1 billion. Through September, our average 2010 purchase price was around $72.50 per share and roughly $65 per share over the life of the program.</p>
          <p>Our commitments to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating are also still very much in focus. Our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 44% is in the range that supports the rating we believe is appropriate for our business.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap things up with a few thoughts on the fourth quarter. As Jack discussed earlier, we see solid year-over-year volume growth opportunities to close out 2010, even against our toughest comparison of the year. Of course, normal seasonal trends are expected to hold which would likely produce a 7-day volume run rate in the fourth quarter that is below the third quarter levels. With car load growth we expect continued leverage, although against a tough comparison as well.</p>
          <p>As you heard from Lance, we have largely depleted our furlough pool so it will be necessary to ramp up some of our hiring programs to handle more business as well as back fill for attrition. We also have the additional cost of more locomotives and freight cars in service as well as slightly higher fuel costs. Against those cost headwinds, we believe we can still achieve strong productivity as well see the benefit of ongoing pricing gain. Overall, we're looking forward to wrapping up 2010 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We're keeping an eye on the economy, particularly as we start putting together our plans for 2011. And while car loading activities certainly drives the direction of our earnings, cash flows and returns, we are committed to creating value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. With just a couple of months remaining this year it's probably safe to say that we are on pace to make this a best ever year for our railroad. As the economy continues to grow, we are ready to safely and reliably haul more freight. The infrastructure investments we have made over the last several years enable us to operate more productively and with greater reliability. With that comes better service to our customers which increases UP's value proposition and financial returns.</p>
          <p>The men and women of Union Pacific are dedicated to serving our customers, delivering the goods that are vital to our nation. That's been our business for almost 150 years and we look forward to continuing that success in the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, lets open it up to your questions.</p>

          <p>Terrific quarter. I just wanted to get a little feel for the financial impact of Hurricane Alex. It sounds like it was pretty disruptive down along the Mexican border. Would you care to share with us how much that may have impacted the operating ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly there was an impact on the numbers but it was relatively minor on the cost. The bigger issue for me was maintaining the customer service and commitment to our customers.  when you had that border close we had many of our auto facilities were at risk of closing down because of parts. And our team did a good job though of keeping things moving. We got great feedback from our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So profitability was perhaps shifted from July into August and September?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was probably some shift, as Jack had mentioned, on the auto parts. If you looked at it, auto parts were flat year over year. And, now some of that may have gone highway when you look at it, but again it was relatively minor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then maybe as a follow-on perhaps for Jack. Jack had mentioned that the Intermodal peak seems to be lasting perhaps a little longer than you had originally talked about. There's been a lot written in the press about the peak being pulled forward. Any thoughts as to when that's going to be tailing off and whether or not the retailers have perhaps ordered a bit too much and will end up with overstocked inventories which could potentially slow Intermodal down as we get into the early part of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's pretty early to tell. The jury is still out on whether or not they have ordered too much. What our intermodal ocean carriers have told us is, at least some of them have told us, they expect their ships to be relatively full for as much as another 60 days which usually, by now you're starting to see the percentage of capacity starting to slip down a bit. So that's pretty good news for us and we're watching very carefully in terms of the  inventory sales ratios and things like that. There's certainly nothing there that alarms us and tells us that we're going to be heading on a downturn here. So we're feeling optimistic right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I look at margins the past 5 or 6 years or so, fourth quarter tends to be a little bit better than third quarter. Rob, you talked about some cost headwinds coming in fourth quarter. Do you think that dynamic plays out differently this year and fourth quarter margins are worse than third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, fourth quarter is not always &#x2013; a lot of things can happen in the fourth car quarter to us, weather and volumes obviously will be a key driver. So it's not always true that the fourth quarter is better. I mean, in fact, I think it's probably 50-50 to be honest if you kind of looked at a longer historical ratio. And recall that last year, we had a fairly sizable favorable adjustment on PI, personal injury and asbestos. So we're not making projections in terms of how that's going to play out this year, but just keep that in mind as you look at the comparison versus last year's fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then Rob, also, can you give &#x2013; I didn't hear the breakout of fuel and mix and overall on the business and I'm wondering if there was any negative mix impact in Intermodal. I guess we were just a little surprised that yields or revenue per car was flattish from second quarter, despite putting in some rate increases and some peak surcharges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, overall, we said that fuel contributed to our overall ARC about 5 points, and there was overall negative mix of about 3 or 4 points which is a result of the strong growth in, the overall and Intermodal and some of the mix impact that Jack talked about in our Industrial products line. Jack, I don't know if you want to talk about the Intermodal specifics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Jim. I think you need to look at the chart Jack had in there showing the core price numbers. That really takes mix out of the equation. The fact of the matter is our core pricing numbers were up compared to second quarter. You really do have to watch with mix on an average revenue per car basis but as we commented, our core price was up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you just looked at Intermodal, Scott, the only thing of mix impact is the strength of the international business where we still have a legacy contract impact there and that grew quite well in the third quarter which created some negative mix. But we still had positive price in both our domestic and our international business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. First question is on &#x2013; you guys are doing a great job obviously on the operating leverage side with excellent productivity and I think Lance, you mentioned best in 7 years on the employee productivity. My question is on the sustainability of that and obviously you've run through your furlough pool, you're going to be hiring or potentially hiring new employees that presumably need a little bit more training. What is the sustainability of this operating leverage trend, and do you think that productivity level gets worse with more volumes or stays the same or might even get better with higher volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to take that Lance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As we look forward, Walter, we don't see any reason why productivity can't be sustained. Now, that doesn't mean necessarily sustained at the same rate that we've seen through this year as volume first started returning. But for the long run, we anticipate we're going to continue to be able to use our assets productively both employees as well as fixed assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But some of those ratios could come down as we continue with higher volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's reasonable to expect that the ratio starts slowing down a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Walter, they're still good ratios and I'll give you an example of some of these. We're hiring now for next year. You're going to see more people in the classroom getting trained. It's all in our assumption next year. But, and it's not a linear relationship. The costs in this business are kind of a step function out here. But even though you'll see some of those costs increase, we're still going to have very good leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no that's great. Second question here, I guess Jim on regulation, obviously this is an election year. It's not going to be the re-reg, the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act is not going to be top of mind until this is done. When you look out to 2011, and we know your positive view on rail and all the benefits that that offers, but what is your strategy when this starts to creep back up again in 2011, and listening to what Rockefeller is saying about using regulation as opposed to legislation, can you talk about the railroad industry strategy in 2011 when that starts to resurface again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really no different from where we have been the last couple of years. We are engaged with Senator Rockefeller and the main item is tell the story. By any measure, when you look at the success of deregulating the industry, it's an absolute great story. You look at new investment that's going into the industry.  the private sector, and if you agree the country has an infrastructure problem, there's a lot of private money that has gone into new investments. So keep them engaged, provide great service, keep our customers engaged in terms of where investment is going and also point out if they get it wrong, we'll go backwards. We'll go backwards in investment, we'll go backwards in jobs, so.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I have to tell you, when I think about the problems in this country, I have a hard time saying where the issues in the railroad are in the top 50 list.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about I guess train lengths. I think you've seen some nice expansion in train lengths, particularly in Intermodal this year, and maybe where you're at as you go into next year. Is there still a big opportunity to run longer trains and have a good ratio of volume growth to train starts or how would you think about that as a driver of leverage in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lance, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. Tom, our train length opportunities still exist as we go into 2011. Specific to Intermodal, we still have up side. It depends on where the business comes in terms of the lanes and the quarters that those trains run in. But across the board, across all our product mix, we still have train length opportunities and it still will be an important part of our productivity improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it, let's see. As a follow-up question on the cost side, when I look at comp and benefits, you had pretty big increases on a per worker basis this year. I think a lot of that is incentive comp. But you also have transitioned to a half year impact from a strong wage increase to this COLA period while you're negotiating. How should we think about per worker costs next year when you consider wage and inflation? Is it kind of 2% to 3%, is it a little more than that? Presumably it's a lot lower than what you have seen this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom. First of all, the increase was not a bunch of incentive comp, the big driver. As Rob mentioned, it was of the increase in the third quarter, about 10% of that growth so take it off the table. You obviously are finally cycling, you had the what, 4.5% increase on the labor agreement that's out here. We had a lot of overtime and we've been pushing the overtime curve here in terms of absorbing some of the volume that's out of here. Our healthcare costs have jumped up pretty substantially here in third quarter. You look out to the future, inflation number that we look at is in that 3.5% to 4% range. That's what you have to think about. Now that again, we still have productivity, and our targets, when you work in a railroad and you lead a department as you offset inflation in terms of productivity, that's out here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're saying 3.5% to 4% per worker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to vary on mix. And I'll give you an example. If you look at what Rob was talking about earlier, we increased our hiring in terms in the numbers on TE&amp;Y, train and engine crew employees. They have a tendency to have the highest average earnings if you're out running on the railroad. So you can get a mix impact there that will drive that cost up also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, this is actually Brandon Oglenski. Could we talk a little bit about export grain? I know the Russian moratorium came into effect around mid-August. I was wondering if, looking into 4Q if there was any equipment or port availability that's really going to limit the growth there? And then secondly, we've seen some activity in your grain tariffs. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I caught the beginning, the second part of your question, Brandon, I wasn't clear on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen a little bit of activity in the grain tariffs, and I was wondering if you guys are expecting to monetize a little bit more on the Ag side in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. At this point in time, in terms of equipment supply, those kinds of things, we're pretty well equipped and ready to run. As Lance said, we pulled the C5s and some C4s out of storage. We still have a few more that we could if we need to. In terms of overall port disruption, it tends to be episodic actually. There was a problem at the Port of Houston with an electrical outage for 4 days, some of those kinds of things. But overall, ports seem to be running pretty well. So I don't really see any major obstacles there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although, Jack, it did impact our velocity and look at the customer queuing fees in terms of grain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It did but it is an episodic. And it's not something fundamental or from an infrastructure perspective that I think will be causing us to miss a forecast or not take advantage of the market opportunity. And in terms of the tariff, we're watching that very carefully. We're taking opportunities to increase our rates as necessary and as available to us, and being very careful as we think through our commitments to customers and also what the market is doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just a little bit further on the labor side. I know you guys said you're going to be looking to hiring a few more people next year and I was wondering if you could balance that against the attrition level that you guys are expecting, and maybe give us an idea of how headcounts should be trending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Brad, we're going to lose &#x2013; our hiring this year, we're going to end up with about 1,700 new hires into the company. I would expect our fourth quarter employment levels probably to be up a little bit from where we were. We're flat year-over-year. Next year our attrition numbers are going to run around 3,500 to 4,000. We clearly are going to keep &#x2013; again, let's assume, what are we thinking economy next year. Still pretty cloudy, but I still believe you're going to continue kind of slightly positive, as you think. So we're going to have a pretty strong hiring program, and again if volume is up, we'll probably see our employment numbers up a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So somewhat of a one-for-one match there on the attrition rate then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends. In some cases we're taking advantage of attrition in terms of our productivity initiatives when you look at it. We won't hire again if you think what we're talking about on train size and productivity there. You won't have a one-for-one with volume there. But again, what's your assessment. I'm not going to make a prediction on volume other than I think it's going to be positive. And we'll be up a little bit next year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Have you seen any change in the ocean liners' attitude as far as sending their international boxes inland? And any signal on the horizon that that may or may not change as you go into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, the fundamental change that took place was early in the year when some of the ocean carriers decided the best course of business was to transload at the port and then turn around and send the boxes back. So that happened. Nothing really substantive has changed as we've gone through the year. Some ocean carriers allow their freight to move inland. Others are preferring to transload on the West Coast. We did notice particularly this quarter, a stronger move of empty boxes back, the revenue empties that we moved to the West Coast was much stronger, which said basically they weren't willing to allow the containers to sit and look for a backhaul load. They would rather expedite it back to Asia so they can turn the box again. But other than that, there really hasn't been anything substantive change as we've gone through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you think about the Intermodal investments, you guys have obviously made a number of investments there with the Joliet facility and further investments into Sunset Corridor. But as you think about the next 3 to 5 years, what are the incremental growth investments that you look to make on the Intermodal side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jon, in many ways other than an Intermodal facility, it's all interrelated. When we look at, for example, our Sunset Corridor that Lance had talked about that we are &#x2013; have started back up, are going to do about 16 miles of new rail this year, other products move in that line. So you step back in the network and our &#x2013; when we think the next 3 to 5 years, you have to think kind of holistically, how will all 6 businesses grow. How do you manage the network in terms of the choke points? I'm pretty bullish when I think about the next 5 years for this business, that rail is going to grow its share of total intercity business. And we're going to invest accordingly. The key in this business is service and we want to stay ahead of that curve to provide great service. We see value in terms of our yields for it and great growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any need for &#x2013; that you see again on that horizon, for the significant terminal build out beyond what you've already done, adding on to existing facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well consider, if you're talking Intermodal, we have some targeted areas we are looking at. We are out right now looking at property for the long term. Think about what's happening with property values right now. Now's a great time to be in that market when you think strategically. You can acquire property in some of these locations at $0.50 on the dollar from where it was 3 years ago.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up on the incremental margin question. It seems like there's an assumption that they'll sort of come down from the 60% rate, but yet you still have more business to reprice. And arguably, you could theoretically get more productive. So is there a case for arguing that they actually stay or even accelerate from here? How do you think about the trajectory of incremental margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, our comments on that margin were more related to when you think about the productivity leverage. We clearly have opportunities on legacy pricing. We have opportunities in terms of when you look at demand. But the discussion I was thinking about, and as we're talking through is if you, holding pricing firm, how do you think about productivity expanding or contracting the margin. And as we talked earlier, as you move up that capacity curve, you're going to start to add a few more costs in. That's doesn't take into account what will happen with the pricing numbers. That possibility is clearly there. Go ahead, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, this is Rob. Just one other point to keep in mind. As we performed well throughout as we &#x2013; as the economy turned down, the comparisons get more difficult too, each quarter. That's just something else that is a factor in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, here &#x2013; and there's another piece here. You think about, you start pushing up that in that 190,000 car range or 195,000, what is that saying about overall demand. Which should say that's a better pricing environment overall for our capabilities. So Jack and his team have &#x2013; Lance has the challenge of continuing productivity, Jack and his team have the challenge of continuing to drive prices up that reflect demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that actually leads to the second question, which is you've talked for a while now about accelerating pricing and we saw that again this quarter. When does it sort of peak out? Are we there or is there more to go given the legacy repricing and whatnot to come?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Bill, let me, just to kind of reset the table here. When we talked about accelerating pricing, that was when we had a, like a 3.5% core price in the first quarter. What we said at that point in time, which was the only guidance we gave on pricing, is that we expected throughout 2010 for that to increase. And in fact that's in fact what we've seen, 5.5% core price in the third quarter I think is evidence of the fact that expectation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Solid results. Jack, let me jump on the coal comments you made earlier. It sounds like with your noting some mine downtime, some inventory levels being low. Any chance for increasing coal export on the West Coast first? And then, second, it just seems like your setting yourself up for some pretty improving demand on the coal side. Would you, is that what you'd anticipate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, we're probably going to do about 1.5 million tons in export coal this year. But we are working diligently with potential developers of port capacity, which is kind of our biggest choke point to move off the West Coast. And we're getting some bites there that we think are pretty attractive and pretty interesting. So we're hopeful that we're going to see export coal improve from the Union Pacific franchise perspective. So that'll be a good thing.</p>
          <p>And, yes, secondly we saw the impact that weather could have last winter when we went from 75 days down to basically on plan from a stockpile perspective. But right now the way things are shaping up through the first quarter, our coal demand looks pretty solid, much better than where we were a year ago. And hopefully that'll continue. We'll have a, I hate to say this, everybody in the room will throw daggers at me, but I hope we have a nice cold, long winter and that'll help us again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. Let me just get a follow-up with Lance on the equipment side. You gave numbers for employees furloughed and cars. What about locomotives still in storage? I just want to understand how much you have left. And then it sounded like you were reducing your spend on PTC. Is that &#x2013; I guess maybe for Jim, I'll throw it out there, is this something you're still working with the regulators to say hey, the technology is just not there, we can't yet meet those deadlines? Or do you just keep pushing it back and hope things get developed in time for the 2015 deadline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Lance, why don't you take the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes, in terms of locomotives in storage, we've got somewhere between, call it 850 to 900. I'll remind you that those are our older locomotives. I mentioned in my comments, the average age is 26 years. We've got all of the DPU capable and high efficiency units out and running. But we do have 850 plus that are available to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken, it's Jim here. Keep in mind we did talk about we're looking at maybe acquiring 100 new locomotives next year. Efficiency, emissions requirements long term that's out here. On the PTC question it's a combination of several things in terms of going from $200 million to about $100 million. Design resources, just overall the complexity of the system has slowed the deployment down a little bit. We are doing everything we can in terms of getting this thing to reality. The regulatory discussion or political discussion will, I think, happen more next year when the FRA is going to be required to kind of meet. We're going to all look at certain checkpoints and you'll look at the feasibility of the technology. But unfortunately, we're spending a lot of money to try to get it there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cherilyn, we are not giving guidance on future pricing other than we think we have the capability at real price. We are seeing very good yields on new products we're putting in the marketplace that directly reflect the service that we put in. I'm feeling pretty good about our capability. We have to perform service-wise and, honestly, we need to get the pricing up and returns up if we're going to justify the capital we're putting in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My next question was whether you could just comment briefly on your new ad campaign and what you're hoping to achieve with that and whether you've made any sort of accompanying changes organizationally to sort of deal with the historical criticism that rails are inflexible and difficult to deal with, particularly for customers who aren't big users of rail and small customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did quite a bit of research before we kicked the campaign off and, guess what, we confirmed what you just said. That in a lot of cases, customers have some belief that if they don't have a track outside the warehouse, they can't do business with railroad, or if they don't think they are big enough in terms of doing business with railroad, or we are tough to deal with.</p>
          <p>The goal of the campaign, there's three objectives, one, to really help a very large addressable market, understand that they do have an option for rail. And that's a complete logistic solution. So we feel that there's a lot of capability there. Second, I want to increase the awareness from the local mayor to the state senator about how important rail is in terms of the business we do. As you, probably wouldn't surprise you, many folks, their experience with rail is they're sitting at a sighting and they don't really see the clarity of how important we are. And third, for us, it's employee pride. We've got a lot of leverage going with the service and a lot of our employees are interested in how do we grow, and add jobs into the company long term.</p>
          <p>So those three factors come into play. We have changed the organization. We've got an on-boarding team. We've got a new website called a micro site in terms of what we're doing. Jack and his team have added resources. The worst thing you do is you put an ad campaign out and the customer makes a call and you're frustrated. That's the easiest way to failure. So we're pretty pumped up at it. In fact, some of the earlier calls, it's not just Intermodal when you think about the capability but some of the earlier calls were opportunities in the carload network.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Most of our questions have been answered already but we had a quick question on equipment rents. On a GTM basis it looks like it was down double-digit in 1Q and 2Q and then the single digit in 3Q. Kind of curious, is that supposed to grow more in line with volumes soon or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should go with volume. And you can have a mix effect depending on what equipment it is moving, whether it's equipment that in fact has rents associated with it or whether it's something that doesn't. And of course we're always focused on offsetting any increase in equipment when it's with productivity. But the bottom line is, it will grow with volume but there is a mix effect in there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. I guess this is a 2-part question that I'll count as 2 questions. Operating margins are 780 basis points better than they were in the third quarter of 2007. I think you said car loads are 8% or 9% below that level. So if you can bridge us to where we are today and then look ahead. Price productivity costs were key components of the margin improvement over the last couple of years. How might that mix of those factors change going forward and would you care to bucket them for us historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Anthony, I'm not going to give specific guidance on the pricing although, clearly you go back 2, 3 years ago we had a bigger book of legacy opportunity, so legacy in terms of driving some of the price was greater then than it is today. But again, we still have a nice book of legacy business out there. And as I said earlier, we are seeing very good price capability for the service and the value and the products we're putting in. So it'll be part of the equation going forward here. Maybe a little less than where we were in '07. But part of that is your assumption of where you think volume is going. You get out here 2, 3 years from now, if you believe, as I do, that rail has got to have a greater share of intercity freight and the demand will grow, I think the pricing number could be pretty strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the productivity side, is it fair to say that it wasn't meaningful in '07, '08 whereas right now it's very meaningful or how do you want us to think about the productivity piece of it, going forward?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you may recall, we launched an effort called Project Operating Ratio, and in fact one of the things we think served us extremely well, is we launched that effort prior to the economic downturn. And what that effort was, was we enlisted all 40,000 plus of our employees to tackle everything they do from productivity to adding value to the customer, which we know is important to improve our service and add value on the pricing front. So we felt good coming into that economic downturn, and certainly by the time later half of '08 came around, that was well underway and had a lot of momentum. So, yes, we've made progress compared to that '07 timeframe, but I wouldn't characterize that that was the depth of our productivity either.</p>

          <p>To the extent that it's necessary, we are investing both in boxes and chassis so, and creating universal chassis pools to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the utilization of that asset. So I think we're covered.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds good on that front. And then if I look at the productivity measures, you guys drove some solid improvement on the gross ton mile per employee, even sequentially from Q2. Could you give us a sense if there is anything incremental that was implemented from Q2 or was it just primarily the benefit of the volume leverage?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think a big piece of it is the volume leverage but if you step back a minute, I would also point it goes to things like our unified plan. It goes to our infrastructure investments we've made over the years. It goes to coordination between marketing operation and the products we're putting in. This is a business that levers with volume, to a point. But you can also reach a point that you start to see negative productivity if you overload the network. So the key is managing that network to its maximum efficiency point on the capacity curve.</p>

          <p>Appreciate the time. I guess the final piece to the question, tax rate was a little bit higher than we've been expecting in the quarter. Could you guys comment on what we should be thinking about for Q3?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>By the way in the third quarter the reason it was a little higher was, relates to state taxes and some timing issues within some of the states. But looking forward, I would bank on around a 38% rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Lance, one question for you. Of that 30,000 containers or cars that are still parked, is there any one specific type that you may have more of parked versus another? I think you mentioned you're actually buying covered hoppers and intermodal containers. So I imagine you've got little to none of those parked right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the mix of what is stored right now in terms of freight cars varies, of course. You know with lumber down, we've got a fair amount of cars that are used for transporting lumber. With the automotive finished goods down, we've got a fair number of auto racks that are stored. So you're right, there is definitely a differentiation in the type of cars that we've got stored.</p>

          <p>Hey, George, I think that's a good example when you start thinking about productivity in the future. I think it's a good example where, depending on where the growth comes, you have more leverage than other areas. Look at lumber. As Lance mentioned, we've got center-beam flat cars. Our lumber loadings are only about 20% to 25% of where they were in the peak back in '06, '07. So if you see your lumber business pick up, you should see pretty nice leverage on that particular group. You've got excess equipment sitting around. We have capacity in our yards. We still have our, of our 111 principal yards we've got about 23, 24 that are very much underutilized. So we've got good up side there.</p>
