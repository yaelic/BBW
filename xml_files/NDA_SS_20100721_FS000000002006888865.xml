          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Nordea Second Quarter Report 2010 International Teleconference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this telephone conference. Here from Nordea, we are represented by CEO and President, Mr. Christian Clausen; Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Ari Kaperi; Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Fredrik Rystedt; and Senior IR Officer, Andreas Larsson.</p>
          <p>So please, Christian go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, welcome everyone and I will repeat some of the key messages from today and then we will go through the slides. I am sure you have in front of you. The key messages, we are delivering according to our plans and expectations from the beginning of the year and we want to underline the steady, strong customer business growth, which is bringing in more customers and more business.</p>
          <p>We see lower results from items at fair value, down from very high levels in Q1 and we have improved the outlook. The story is very much about the development of the customer business, because that is quite notable. We have the income in the corporate 10%; the income in the household segment is up 7%. Total income is down reflecting the lower items at fair value. We have a large number of new Gold customers, 73,000 or up 2.5% in the quarter. Lending volumes are up nicely both in the quarter and on year-on-year and we see stabilization on impaired loans and credit quality, in general.</p>
          <p>We've made two changes in the outlook statement. The first one is about the macroeconomic development, where we now clearly see that the outlook for the Nordic markets has improved during this year. We expected that, but that has happened. So, a steady economic growth is now clear for the Nordic markets. The global development is still fragile not the least in Europe, but therefore we have some uncertainties though: cost expected to be inline, cost growth inline with '09, risk-adjusted profit is going to be lower this year than last year, due to the lower income in Treasury and Markets we expected, and then the other change is that, loan losses are going to be lower this year than last year and the credit quality continues to stabilize and that is inline with economic recovery.</p>
          <p>And now I will hand over to Fredrik who will go through the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will take you through the results. Looking at slide seven in your material, you can see that total income ended up at 2.161 billion with a flat or slightly increasing net interest income, record level of net fees and commission, and then a decline in net result from items at fair value.</p>
          <p>Total expenses are in control and I will come back to that. The net loan losses are down in line with our expectations also including the provision for the Danish guarantee package. You can see on the next slide that the currency impact in this particular quarter is quite small, you can see the reported figures and you can also see with local currencies in the mid column.</p>
          <p>So the differences there are quite small but still differences comparing last quarter to this quarter in comparison to 2009 Q2 there the currency impact are still little bigger. So if I take you through the different lines of our income statement, starting with net interest income; as I mentioned, net interest income is up by 1% and we have a very good and solid trend with the customer operations, lending and deposit volumes are up, I will come back to that, and margins are largely stable in most of our market.</p>
          <p>Of course on the back of low interest rate levels, it is a subdued level and we also have lower contribution from Group Treasury in this quarter which is directly a consequence of higher average funding cost, when we prolong or issue new long-term funding at higher spreads in comparison to existing redeemed issues.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 10, you can see the underlying volume trend, a good volume trend in pretty much all areas, as in previous quarters, previous four quarters we've had a good and stable growth in the Nordic household mortgages that you can see and that's also the case for consumer lending. What is a little different this time is that consumer &#x2013;  the corporate lending in the Nordic area has also grown considerably to 2% in the quarter as such and that is a little different to the slow growth that you've seen in the last three quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>So a clear positive trend in the corporate area. New European Markets continue to grow, NFIB and shipping as well. If you look at deposits, you can see that the total deposit value is actually slightly down by 1%. The major reason there is we have some more financial deposit so to speak that has been exchanged versus the short term funding but the underlying new trend in Nordic Households and Corporate is still fine as you can see.</p>
          <p>Looking at the impact in terms of net result, this quarter the profit contribution from volume is strong so you see the impact from the corporate lending volumes and also from the household lending volumes, the margin impact is a little negative particularly still from the household lending margins. This is mainly an issue for Norway, you may have seen from the report that decline is largely due to the so called lag effect, the six week lag effect from the household lending margins.</p>
          <p>Slight decrease also from very low levels on the deposit side in the quarter. We have a positive income or impact from the FX side as you can see at 70 million Nordic Banking or Institutional and International Banking producing good contribution and then others including Group Treasury and there of course the increased funding cost is included leading to a total change of plus 14. The interest rate sensitivity as you are aware of consists of three different components. The structural interest income risk and of course the sensitivity to margin development when interest rates on and then finally we also have an impact with items at fair value from moving of interest rates. And you can see that the impact on net interest income with the assumptions we are making on margins is largely unchanged, a little decline from 450 to 430, and net results from items at fair value is a negative 230 which is slight change to the 100 in Q1.</p>
          <p>I mentioned initially that the result from net fees and commissions is up by 13% as you can see on slide 13. We have good contribution from the savings area and we have &#x2013; remained a strong inflow of 1.9 billion and in fact also during a fairly subdued quarter in financial markets, our assets under management increased in the quarter to &#x20AC;170 billion. We also have a good contribution from corporate advice, which as you know, is in line with our strategy to bring that offering to our customers. So, generally speaking, a very, very strong quarter in terms of net fees and commissions.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on slide 14 you can see the net results from items at fair value down from 548, a very strong quarter in Q1, down to 339. This is largely due to lower contribution of course from Group Treasury and unallocated Capital Markets business, but what is particularly pleasing for us is that the customer activity within risk management product is very, very strong and hence we saw contribution is up by 25% so very, very strong development for the customer business.</p>
          <p>So turning now to expenses, we have had remained or continued strong cost management in the quarter and as you can see on slide 15, the expenses have increased with 3% reported and if we exclude currency we have 0.6% and we also have as you are aware of, we have continued to invest in our group initiatives and the strategic program that we're following and if you exclude those investments the cost development is in fact down by 1.2% in comparison to last quarter.</p>
          <p>So let me leave the P&amp;L and turn a little bit to the balance sheet in risks-weighted assets, you can see on slide 16 that our risk-weighted assets have increased by 3% and of course the main rating for it is the growth in particularly corporate lending. We have a slowdown now in rating migration. So a very small level of 0.3%, but in fact the actual impact of credit policy on this weighted asset is actually positive for us or a reduction of risk-weighted assets by 1% and they said reason for that is that new customers have higher rating than those leaving the bank. The risk-weights are &#x2013; were largely similar, slightly down on the corporate side of 60%. Our capital position is very strong with a core tier 1 ratio at around 10% or 10% as you saw. So it's a minor decrease versus Q2 and of course the high customer activity and the growth in particular on the corporate side were offset by a solid profit generation.</p>
          <p>You are aware of the fact that we are participating in stress tests, which will be released at 6 o'clock on Friday, and as we have communicated many times our capital position is very strong as evidenced by our many external studies, and since we will have no problems with the stress tests, we expect very marginal movement in our ratios there and as you know our ratios are very high. So, again, no problem at all from the stress tests.</p>
          <p>Finally, just a couple of words on the funding operations since we have continued to do successfully very good funding. We have issued 10.5 billion so now a total of 20.9, close to 21 billion so far this year and this compared to redemption for the full year of 18 billion. So, again a very strong and high activity level on the long-term funding side. So we continue to have a high portion of long-term funding and part of the issues you can see on slide 18.</p>
          <p>We have done several good issues mostly consumed when we reopen the market after a period of closure after the Euro crisis. We have continued to prolong the average maturities. So more out of curiosity from the issues we have made on the long-term side this year, the average maturity is six years of that 21 billion. So a very good performance on the funding side and with those words I'll leave over to you, Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. Turning to the credit quality and the main observation is that the credit quality continues to improve in the second quarter, but versus previous start from the growth in our lending portfolio from page 20 just showing that of course in itself, that's also signal of the, in a normal situation in the market, but credit volume has started to go up and as you can see our growth in the second quarter is well diversified between household and then corporate sector, also within corporate sector it's well diversified and then in various geographies as well as between the various industries. So the growth is coming from all fronts, nothing is especially picking up from that growth. And then the new corporate customers, they have, created very strong so that the new customers are very good in the integrated quality.</p>
          <p>Page 21 shows that the loan loss provisions in the second quarter and as you can see and then you've heard the net loan losses were 245 million equal to 35 basis points and if even that figure includes the provision we made for this Danish guarantee scheme of 58 million. So that excluding this guarantee scheme, loan loss provision, we are at a level of 26 basis points on the loan losses. Loan losses are coming down more or less in all countries. The only country was Denmark when &#x2013; where the losses were up in the second quarter and that is especially because of this provisions we made for the Danish guarantee scheme. Also cleaning that up in Denmark also &#x2013; losses in Denmark were down. In Finland, they were more stable but in other areas they were down.</p>
          <p>Next page shows the broken long-term trend of increasing impaired loans. So that the Q2 and the first quarter in long time we saw the decline in impaired loans so that they were down by 1 percentage point and still more than half of our impaired loans, they are performing. As we increased allowances, provisions, that means that then the provision ratio is going up ending 256 percentage points from the impaired loans and as you can see that still the level of collective provisions is relatively high, it's more than EUR 900 million. Then I am shortly talking about few areas of higher pension in this credit area, our credit risk areas, starting from Denmark where we also see signs of clear stabilization. The macroeconomic development in Denmark, of course, will gain ground with a more normal situation. And as you can see from the slide and the graph that loan losses are coming down in Denmark and there you see that the impact of this Danish guarantee scheme.</p>
          <p>Still there are some areas of cautiousness in Denmark, mainly in the small and mid-sized companies as well as some parts of the private sector, which is seems to be very sensitive to interest rate levels. But all in all we think that the situation in Denmark that should be more and more effective with the normal state of affairs.</p>
          <p>The current risk schemes will expire in the next quarter, in the end of our Q3, and there we can see that what is the end result of this scheme to us. In the worst case, we will have to be prepared to provide for additional 50 million in the third quarter, but remains to be seen if that is needed.</p>
          <p>Turning to New European Markets and especially in Baltic's, is the next slide where you can also see that the situation is improving in Baltic's, of course in line with the macroeconomic situation. So that the loan losses are now down in 22 million with this 114 basis points. As you remember, our credit volume in Baltic's is very low in terms of Nordea's total credit, but nevertheless we have seen high credit losses in that area. But now it's clear signs that it's coming down.</p>
          <p>And as you can see that this is the level of loan losses we can leave in the Baltic operations, so that in the second quarter Baltic made already operational profit including these minimal loan losses.</p>
          <p>In Poland and Russia we have not had proclaims in either credit quality during the last year or so, and of course, the situation there is a bit more or less in the same level so that there are no issues in Poland or Russia into credit quality.</p>
          <p>And the last page of this section is rating migrations, Fredrik, already covered that part. But here you can see that now it's even spread between up-ratings and down-ratings in the quarter. Well those all as you can see that there are movements at both sides, so that this is not any kind of static situation. So that we have current all the time rating customers and now in this quarter, we saw the situation that was at many up-ratings and down-ratings.</p>
          <p>That was my comment from the credit quality. I'm turning to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I would give a few comments to the strategy going forward. And we are repeating the strategy and reiterating the initiatives, we are confirming that they are working and we are on track. But first of all the strategy, we said in January, it was all about prudent growth, further risks out there. One of them was the southern debt problem. So it's a capital navigation between risk and opportunities that's the case. So, it's not just three miles ahead. We have to be very prudent in the way we grow. We put up the nine growth initiatives and we have actually, I must say, been very successful in starting them up and they already see the first results. Of course, it's a long journey over the coming years, but there is there, and I'd like to give a few comments as to how it is progressing.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> distribution which is clearly a very big and important project we have before we transform 1,400 branches to a new format, we are working with 14 pilots and it's working above expectations. Good results, high degree number of meetings, more efficiency and customer satisfaction. So I'm quite certain that we will increase that number, maybe around 80 later the year and then we will make it through Q1 a full rollout in the coming period. Starting with the areas where we need to relocate branches or need to change.</p>
          <p>Customer acquisition is clearly working, we have a number of initiatives ongoing on to that and we see the first results. Of course, Finland is well on track. We have hired advisers. We are changing 28 branches to where the customers are. And we are changing them also to new formats in terms of advantage, then a better room for ensuring that we can advise customers in taking out transactions and cash.</p>
          <p>Corporate Merchant Banking, Sweden is clearly working as demonstrated by one of the slides, we see corporation in this very important customer segment, and we increase our share wallet, and had good progress here.</p>
          <p>Customer driven markets business, obviously we see from the figures mostly the commission figures that that is working clearly. Again, we have much more to do here, but I think we have made good progress. And we are catching up on business our customers would have in this area.</p>
          <p>Growth plan Poland is still delivering very well. Income is up 50% in the year and we are now ready to start launching branches at least 40 during the end of the year and probably delivering, continuing to deliver on this. Again, this project is really interesting. Very low risk customers, high income and a very interesting conversation.</p>
          <p>So then on the efficiency and foundation, these things typically take a bit more time. But first deliveries are there on the market platform where we have derivatives and commodities but they already used that up.</p>
          <p>So the initiatives and the strategy are clear. We're going to deliver. It will take some hard work but it will happen and we are quite confident. And Nordea has the potential to actually deliver growth rate at the 10% per year. It will not be a straight line as we are saying in outlook this year, it will be slightly lower but we are sure that over time, we will accelerate the momentum during &#x2013; because of the initiatives.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we can say that the key initiatives is in essence we are delivering according to our plan. We continue to &#x2013; it's very strong development in customer business in all areas more or less, and credit quality is improving. In fact, loans are down and loan reservations are also down and the focus is prudent growth and execution of the Group initiatives.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question today from Geoff Dawes of Macquarie. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Geoff Dawes here from Macquarie. I've got two very quick questions, both on the main banking operations. The first one is at the Group level, you guided for lower loan losses in 2010, can you just confirm is that true for every country in which you operate? We can't help but notice the trends in Denmark and Finland slightly less robust than in Sweden and Norway. The second question is on banking margins, across the four different countries there seems to be a stalling of lending margin improvement this quarter. Is that a reflection that you have simply stopped repricing loans higher or is that just quarterly noise? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our guidance related to loan losses is not to speak to any specific countries. We have &#x2013; we give guidance at the group level so that it&#xB4;s instantly, they triggered to discuss about various countries but we see more or less these trend, these positive trend in all of the countries. In Finland, the situation has been relatively stable but not converse. And in Denmark it's very much related to this daily currency scheme provisions which are needed excluding that impact I think that it will be &#x2013; that also in Denmark we see lower loan losses. That would be my remarks on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As related to the margins we have previously stated that the pickup in margins which has continued for many quarters is a matter of repricing and we have continued to do that. We've also communicated the fact that the two markets where we believe the biggest potential exits is just because of slow repricing is mainly Finland and Sweden and these have &#x2013; these markets on the corporate side have continued to pick up also in this quarter, but clearly it has slowed down. The general trend that we believe it should be still there for margin pick ups going forward although difficult to forecast but the reason, of course, is that most banks are likely to have higher funding spread as we go forward because of regulatory issues. So, we believe that the long-term trend should still be up but we have seen a slowdown this quarter as you have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Great, very clear. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question today from Nick Davey of UBS. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. Nick Davey from UBS. Just one remaining question actually, just wanted to hone in on the capital markets unallocated division as you reported now and the fair value gains line, EUR 60 million I think for this quarter. You mentioned in the comments surrounded in your quarterly report that has been impacted quarter-on-quarter by the challenging environment. Should I read by that, that you might expect returns to increase again in a more normalized environment or should I still be keeping one eye I guess on the returns from that line pre-crisis which were still some way below where you are on a quarterly run rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is as you rightly pointed out something we believe is low this quarter and it, of course, it has been affected by the Euro crisis. Generally, I think that's really important to note that the total market activity is still at very good levels for us and if you look at the average Q1 and the Q2 total markets result is still on average a very good result. So, of course, it has been subdued this quarter because of the Euro crisis but &#x2013; and Q1 was also very, very strong in this respect. So, we expect it to pick up. It is always difficult to have very, very strong quarters like Q1 &#x2013; Q2 was weak in this respect as we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Chintan Joshi of Nomura. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chintan Joshi from Nomura, yeah. I have got three questions. The first question is on the FIRR calculation. On the fair value item you have seen an increase from 100 million to 230 million. If you can just explain in detail why that has happened. Essentially, how I read it is you are reducing your guidance to your rate sensitivity year. The second question for me is &#x2013; is in Denmark you have devoted a slide to show the stabilization in Denmark. But it feels like you are still cautious on the SME sector. If you can talk about the underlying trends there, what are you seeing currently and what your expectations are from the SMEs?</p>
          <p>The third question is &#x2013; is a part of the reason why you've seen weak trading income is according to your report that you're positioned for a positive market outcome. And obviously Q2 has been pretty stressed. I am wondering if you can share with us how are you positioned for the next quarter and kind of related to that, if you see this CEBS stress test from your vantage point, if you see it giving us enough transparency through the disclosures that we get on Friday. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can maybe start with the interest rate sensitivity. And as you rightly point out, it has decreased from 100 to 230 in the line net result from items at fair value. And of course, as we have pointed also in the previous couple of quarters, this is a point of time measure. So it will depend on the position as we have them in any given point of time. Our natural position of course in this area is typically a minus. And the reason &#x2013; simple reason is of course both the liquidity buffer and the inventory we have in our customer trading operation is affected by movement in the interest rate. So therefore we have a negative sign in front of that line.</p>
          <p>Now, if you recall in Q4, the corresponding amount was pretty close to where it was now. So we were geared for higher interest rates at the early part of Q2 or the late part of Q1 as you can see on that minus 100. So it's really a very simple math behind it. It is basically how we position ourselves against the interest rate environment and that maybe ties into your question three which I may ask you more to take the opportunity to answer at the same time.</p>
          <p>We don't normally comment on our position and we should not of course comment on our position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I won't do that now either. But generally, of course, we've provided that explanation, because our macro scenario is, as we point out in the outlook, generally positive on the macro economic scenario. And that should lead to at least in the longer perspective higher long interest rates and et cetera. And of course, that was &#x2013; the opposite direction was actually caused by the Euro crisis. So that's why we actually took the liberty of explaining that in the report but normally we don't comment on the position of course. You have --</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe on Denmark, I would like to elaborate because you also have two questions before. I think it's clear that the credit quality in Denmark is improving. But that is a fairly big tail in Denmark probably among medium and smaller companies. And the reason is that Denmark was hit pretty bad by the crisis. The bubble before the crisis was bigger, and adjustment made in the big companies we saw, quickly in '08 both in Denmark and Sweden and other places, was very quick. And it means that these big companies are ready &#x2013; now are ready to take advantage of the growth.</p>
          <p>The smaller companies, typically sub-suppliers also with a weaker competitive situation, didn't make that adjustment. So they are pretty much still adjusting. And therefore, we and the rest of the traders, we haven't seen it very clearly, but we envision some tail on the small and medium sized exposures. Not of these magnitudes, of course, but there will be a tail of loan losses. And we have not &#x2013; as I've said we are not guiding for each country &#x2013; but I think it's fair to say that where Sweden and Norway and Netherlands have no loan losses right now, or a very small magnitudes, and Denmark will still have some loan losses, but the level will gradually come down, and exactly when that tail ends is more or less impossible to say. Stress test.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; I can start. Maybe you want to comment also Christian. What I think we perceive it as a successful event in the U.S. markets and, of course, a similar approach here also in the European market. And I alluded to it at the outset that we don't perceive this to be an issue for Nordea. We have a very strong balance sheet and we expect only marginal changes in the stress scenarios, include in the stress test. So, we are fine of this stress test. And generally, we also believe that the Nordic market &#x2013; Nordic banks are likely to be fine. It is difficult to comment on the European market. It's important to note that we've gone through a live stress test in the recent couple of years, since we have proven to be extremely strong, made profit in every single quarter throughout this crisis and, of course, evidence, as I said, a very strong balance sheet at this point in time.</p>
          <p>So the stress test, we're typically making ourselves, is more harsh than what we see here -. But generally, I think it's a good exercise, but this is not affecting us now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may just follow up there, I mean, I was more interested in knowing it from your vantage point. You expect that we'll get good disclosures from the stress test or will it be like limited disclosure, 2 page or not or something. I don't know if you have that clarity at &#x2013; from your viewpoint?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And just to follow up on you explanation of the interest rate sensitivity. So what I'm taking away is that, I mean, currently you're probably not positioned for rate hikes and &#x2013; but this could easily change in the future. Your interest rates sensitivity could easily increase if you position yourself for a rate hike.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, this is the point-of-time measure. So it is different in any given point of time and, of course, we have the liquidity buffer and, of course, also we manage the group equities. So we will, of course, adjust according to the scenarios within our mandates, naturally. So, yes, of course, it will change the interest rate sensitivity.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Aaron Ibbotson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi there. Good afternoon. I actually just got a quick follow-up question. Fredrik, you mentioned that you sort of expect corporate lending margins to expand. And I guess, my question is basically why to be honest because interest rates seems to be going up, at least in Sweden and Norway, loan losses are going down and as far as we've heard from the other Swedish banks and DnB NOR the foreign competition is basically at an all-time low. So I'm just curious as to what signs you are seeing for an upwards move in corporate margins and maybe if you could segment between large and small or if there is any regional differences? So that was my first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just a very quick follow-up on this structural interest income activity. I just noticed, as the previous questioner did, that there is quite a big move quarter-on-quarter. And I was just curious if it had anything to do with redeploying maybe some of your excess liquidity, i.e., that you've sort of used some of the fuel there? Anyway, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, I think your question on the margin is very important and I was merely referring to the fact that the current trend that we &#x2013; as we perceive it is clearly from the regulatory side. The liquidity risk here will be a big focus, as you know, in the Basel III environment. And of course, that is likely to trigger longer term funding more generally. And of course, longer term funding as opposed to short-term funding is expensive and thereby triggering a higher average funding cost.</p>
          <p>So the belief on the corporate margin side is merely a reflection of the fact that most banks will likely have to go down. That's relative more long-term funding. Not all banks have to do that. It depends on your starting position and your overall liquidity risk and how much we have done, but you can clearly see in our books that we have done 31 last year and 21 this year so far these first 2 quarters. So generally, the &#x2013; that is where my belief come from but it is of course very, very difficult thing to forecast margin expansion or not, but the underlying reason.</p>
          <p>Your other question on &#x2013; it is basically not excess deploying the excess capital. It is movements that will come from either the liquidity buffer or the inventory within the markets business and of course it is also positioned for gearing from different scenarios on the macroeconomic development. So it will fluctuate over time. There is no structural shift underneath those numbers. It is a movement over time and it will fluctuate also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe I can say one more thing about this. It's not to give anything. You said we will not reveal our positions, of course. But the logic is very simple here. If interest rate moves up, we make more income on our deposits. That's the first line.</p>
          <p>The second line is if interest moves up, we make an immediate net gains/loss on our position in our liquidity buffer because it's a fixed rate instrument which will take a loss. How we hedge that risk in short versus long rates is exactly what will trigger how big the second line is. And that was where we were hit a bit in the second quarter by the financial turmoil because it was expected for long rates to buffer, long rates fell. And therefore, the hedge was, of course, imperfect to say the least. I think many banks, not to say all banks, were hit by this movement.</p>
          <p>So therefore, going forward, you should not seek this like a black box mystery. It's a very simple thing, heavy liquidity buffer. And sometimes we hedge the interest movements towards that. And that is from time-to-time and according to what we think we see fit on how big the risk is. But the first line is very much reflecting the risk or the positive risk you can say of higher income for growth of higher interest rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And sorry, Fredrik, but just to clarify then on the first question. So should I read that then as if you basically see Nordea as more pre-funded so to speak than the main competition, and that therefore the main competition will have to increase their pricing, and sort of increase the absolute price level, but the net impact will be positive for you and then maybe neutral for the others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't want to make that comment. I think it's impossible to compare that. I can only speak for Nordea and of course saying that we have redemptions of 18, and of course we've pre-funded that, so &#x2013; and also of course pre-funded parts of 2011. So I think it's impossible to comment what others are doing. I can only speak for the market in general, and then of course the need for more long-term funding. It will depend on the regulatory outcome of course, but the general trend is there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Matti Ahokas of Handelsbanken. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A question on the deposit margins if I may. I was quite surprised to see that your deposit margins mainly of course in Finland and Denmark are still going down quarter-on-quarter. This I guess is the seventh quarter in a row or eighth. Interbank rates are up and interest rates are no longer falling in the short, and why aren't the margins, deposit margin increasing? Has there been kind of &#x2013; some kind of structural shift in this item as well or is there some technical factor explaining &#x2013; explaining this altogether? That would be my first question. Then second question is regarding the lending margins. As Fredrik pointed out and in the previous questions as well that the lending margins as measured on the Interbank rates would up, but do you expect that lending margins measured against your average funding costs would also go up? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the deposit margin has declined, continued to decline somewhat in basis points, not too much, but I think it's a reflection. First of all deposit margins will vary a little bit depending on the source and what kind of deposits we're talking about. But you can say interest rates aren't moving too much and of course deposit margins are extremely dependent on the absolute level of the interest rates. So interest rates pick up in Sweden for instance is likely to increase that margin for us specifically or especially on the transaction accounts and also to some extent on the household saving side.</p>
          <p>So of course it is subdued, and it is also fierce competition. And one pretty obvious reason for it is that many banks still have a problem in funding their operation on the wholesale market and use it as deposit to fund themselves. And that of course has a competitive impact also on pricing. So I think you should actually see it as both a consequence of this latter part and to some extent mix issues. But it has no, I think, it will move as we see interest rate hikes. And of course this is happening now in Sweden. So that I think is the likely outcome.</p>
          <p>Relating to the lending margins, this is an extremely relevant question. I think the ability to raise lending margins above what the average funding cost will increase in terms of margins, I really will not speculate on. I think that's an extremely difficult exercise or speculative issue to discuss. I cannot do that, but I think, my estimation is of course that it should at least follow and of course those that will need to do a lot of long term funding. And those that also maybe will have to do long term funding at unfavorable rates compared to other banks will of course suffer a little bit more. So, in all the fairness and in the mass rate it should be &#x2013; it should be advantageous to Nordea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I still may follow-up on the deposit side &#x2013; has been kind of fierce competition as you referred to and does this come as a surprise to you or, and has that accelerated during the second quarter or any comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we have to separate between time deposits and financial deposits as we call them and then transaction accounts and cash management accounts and these things. So on the transaction accounts we are very much working on getting them. When we get new customers, we ensure we get all their cash, all their transactions, all everything. There we pay more or less no interest. And if interest rates go up we will make more money. Competition is not there on price. That is competition about the full customer volume.</p>
          <p>The second thing is then financial deposits or time deposits. There we have a market where some customers are very seeking and competitive rate whenever they have a time deposit and so on. That has always been the case, and their margins have never been high. It's always been limited margins. Also, when we go back. Right now, it's more or less negative margins here because as Fredrik says some banks use it as a funding source, because they need to do that. And especially on the financial deposits that we see some movements. It's not really a market we are going to attract it as a foreign funding source because whenever these deposits expire they start new competition around that one.</p>
          <p>So it's always not a stable funding source, it's more like a short term wholesale form of funding to be compared with. So our big focus is on the transaction accounts and getting the cash where we know we have the steady and stable deposit or cash and where we know we have a high interest rate sensitivity, so when interest would go up, rates go up, we can make more money. The other area is one where we actually rather would like to maneuver in terms of just being a little competitive and get some of them but certainly not all as to award to the competition. So I don't think &#x2013; I will call it a bit technical when you see small movements now in the margin for deposits I will call it a bit technical. When we see interest rates move up like 50 or 100 basis points, I think you will see completely different figures especially from the transaction accounts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As you mentioned, the average maturity on this long term funding you've taken up in first half of 2010 was for six years. And if I understood correctly there were like 18 billion maturing also in the first half. Do you know the average maturity of the 31 billion you took in 2009? And if I remember correctly, I think the average maturity for the wholesale funding in total in 2009 was 3.8 years and I wonder what that number is today, if you have one. And my second question is just maybe more curiosity, is that note six in your report, looking at your net loan losses specified there, it's that off-balance sheet item which is quite large and I wonder if you could be any more specific in what that relates to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first question, the just maybe a clarification but 18 billion is not the first half it's the full 2010 redemption so basically we have May 21 in the first half and we have a full year redemption of 18. The first half is much less than 18, so we have pre-funded as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Then coming to your average maturity for the 31 last year, I don't know exactly but I think more relevant perhaps it's the full average maturity for the entire funding portfolio which is 3.8 years, speak of the numbers.</p>

          <p>Before I take your second question this additional not fixed or what was the number so that it's a mainly to reuse this provision, because of this rain &#x2013; it's can't establish on in that line that's the other explanation. The other explanation is that we also are providing for some losses in the bank current fees. We have given it out of our customers and then go back to your off-balance sheet item that's shown.</p>
