        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.</p>
          <p>Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our webcast &#x2013; our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. We also have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we'll be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are also accessible using the webcast link on fcx.com.</p>
          <p>In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>On the call today is Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board. We also have several of our senior operating team here, including Red Conger, Dave Thornton, and Mark Johnson.</p>
          <p>I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation. After our formal remarks we'll open up the call for questions.</p>
          <p>Today FCX reported second quarter 2010 net income attributable to common stock of 649 million, $1.40 per share, compared with net income of 588 million or $1.38 per share for the second quarter of 2009. Our results in the second quarter of 2010 included losses on the early extinguishment of debt totaling $42 million to net income, which was $0.09 a share. And we also had an unfavorable impact of our provisional pounds that were recorded at the end of &#x2013; at March at a higher price that resulted in a $72-million impact or $0.15 per share decrease in net income in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated sales for copper of 914 million pounds during the second quarter of 2010 were higher than our April estimates of 830 million pounds, but as anticipated were lower than the second quarter of 2009 sales of 1.1 billion pounds. The variance to our previous estimate primarily reflects favorable production performance in the Americas and Indonesia, and the timing of shipments principally in North America. The variance to the 2009 period primarily reflects lower copper ore grades at Grasberg resulting from planned mine sequencings and anticipated lower sales from our South America mines. This is partially offset by higher contribution from the Tenke Fungurume mine in Africa.</p>
          <p>Our gold sales of 298,000 ounces during the quarter were higher than our estimate of 270,000 ounces but significantly lower than the second quarter 2009 sales of 837,000 ounces. The favorable variance primarily reflects the timing of mine sequencing at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>Our molybdenum sales totaled 16 million pounds in the second quarter period. They were higher than our estimate of 15 million in April because of improved demand in the chemical sector during the quarter. Our second quarter results reflect improved pricing for our products, all of our products &#x2013; copper, gold and molybdenum &#x2013; compared to the year-ago period. Our realized price during the second quarter of $3.06 was about 38% higher than our price in the second quarter of 2009 of $2.22. For gold, we realized $1,234 per ounce in the second quarter compared to $932 per ounce in the second quarter of 2009. And our molybdenum price averaged $18 per pound, which was significantly higher than the $10-per-pound price in the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>Our unit net cost on a consolidated basis averaged $0.97 per pound for the second quarter of 2010 as compared with $0.43 per pound in the second quarter of 2009. The higher unit cash cost primarily reflects anticipated lower gold and copper volumes at Grasberg and at South America, probably offset by higher byproduct gold and molybdenum prices.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flows in the second quarter totaled 1.1 billion. It was significantly higher than our capital expenditures of just under 300 million. And for the six months ended June 30, our operating cash flows totaled $2.9 billion, and capital expenditures totaled 527 million.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we repaid a total of 1.3 billion in debt. That included the April redemption of our senior floating rate notes totaling 1 billion, and we also made open market purchases of our public debt securities of just under 300 million. Since the beginning of 2009, we've repaid approximately $2.6 billion in debt. This is just over a third of our debt that was outstanding at the time, and this has resulted in annual interest costs savings of over $170 million per year.</p>
          <p>At the end of June, our total debt approximated 4.8 billion, and our consolidated cash approximated 3 billion. Also during the second quarter, our 6.75 mandatory convertible preferred stock converted into 39 million shares of FCX common stock. And our shares outstanding as of June 30 totaled 470 million shares. It was previously announced our board authorized an increase in our common stock dividend from $0.60 on an annual basis to $1.20 per share. And the first quarterly dividend at this new rate of $0.30 per quarter will be paid on August 1.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn the call over to Richard now. He'll be referring to our slide presentation.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Kathleen. The first slide is on page 3, and it has the financial statistics that Kathleen just reviewed with you. There's a couple of things I think when you look at this become apparent about our Company. And that is the significance of our exposure to the copper markets, which was where we want to be because we feel so good about copper going forward because of its essential need in the world economies and the challenges that the industry has in developing supplies and producing current production to meet those opportunities.</p>
          <p>Here we have a quarter in the second quarter of where we had such a substantially lower amount of gold sales out of Grasberg simply because of mine sequencing. We had well over 800,000 ounces last year and under 300,000 ounces this year. Our copper volumes were lower, and yet because of our copper prices, we were able to generate comparable earnings that we did in the first quarter of next &#x2013; of second quarter of last year. And that's even more apparent when we look at the first half statistics where we had much, much lower copper sales last year. We had 1.4 million ounces last year in gold sales and 765,000 ounces this year, 50% less copper volumes. And yet our earnings were more than double what they were last year because of the copper price movement.</p>
          <p>Our cost structure is something that we worked on very hard. We had to do that in the last part of 2008 when copper prices fell so dramatically. And now as we're taking steps of resuming curtailed production, we're doing so in a way that preserves cost savings that we were able to achieve during that period of time. And during the quarter even with the significantly low gold credits we have out of Indonesia, we were able to finish the quarter with less than $1 net unit cost. This is consistent with what we had in the first quarter. And this unit number will vary as we go forward with different amounts of copper &#x2013; or with gold prices and volumes and molybdenum prices. But it for our overall Company was roughly 4 billion pounds of copper sales &#x2013; very attractive to be able to produce copper at a net cost of less than $1.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the slide, you can see just how significant the issue in Indonesia was. Last year we really benefited during a time when we really needed it because we were at the highest grade section of the Grasberg. Now we're sequencing into lower grade sections. We'll be moving back to higher grade during the second half of the year. But real pleased with these financial results given those circumstances.</p>
          <p>Copper markets, as I talk with our marketing guys, the comment that came back to me in preparation for this earnings call was that the physical markets really are stronger than economic indicators in the United States. The issue of falling exchange stocks, an issue with scrap markets, trucking, and so forth, we see our order books filling more strongly than we have in some time. There's still of course a lot of weakness in the U.S. economy. But overall the copper markets that we're seeing them on the ground day-to-day in the U.S., Northern Europe, to some extent in Korea and Japan, are stronger than we've seen them in some time.</p>
          <p>And China, which is &#x2013; everyone's focused on the steps they've taken to control the growth in their economy and to try to deal with inflation -continues to be strong. So we are optimistic about copper markets. We think it is important for the future of this industry to think about having a price this strong today above $3 in a world in which we read about economic problems everyday in the media.</p>
          <p>So we continue to feel very, very positive about the outlook for copper longer term. Have to be prepared for volatility, but we like where our Company is positioned in these marketplaces. We benefit from the high price of gold, and molybdenum has similar characteristics to copper, a smaller market. But the fact that we're the world's largest producer of that product and the world's lowest-cost producer and have such growth opportunities makes that a very attractive asset for our Company.</p>
          <p>Development projects, we talked at the first quarter about how we were taking some steps to move forward with resuming curtailed production, curtailed development activities that we had put in place at the end of 2008 at our flagship Morenci mine here in Arizona. Red Conger and his team are working very effectively. We've restarted the mill which we had shut down. It averaged 28,000 tons per day in the second quarter. We're moving up towards a rate of 50,000 tons per day in 2011.</p>
          <p>And we're increasing the mine rate, which we had basically cut in half. The statistic here on the slide is in metric tons. Morenci has typically talked about short tons in its operations, and we're moving up from 500 short tons to 700,000 tons with our plan. This is stripping additional ore. Stripping to get to additional ore has some effect on cost, but at these price levels its very, very attractive. We're doing this in an organized systematic way to control our cost. But we do have the opportunity of further increasing our rates, and we're studying that and moving &#x2013; and potentially moving forward with that as the market warrants.</p>
          <p>In Arizona here east of Phoenix at the historical Miami mining activity, we've now begun stripping to mine ore in connection with our reclamation activities. We're ramping that up using some existing equipment, and that'll be generating revenues to help contribute to our business. At our Safford mine near Morenci, we have resumed construction of a sulfur burner that had been deferred, and this will have very positive benefits from a cost standpoint and logistics standpoint for our Company.</p>
          <p>In South America and Peru at our Cerro Verde mine, we are now completing a project that involved expenditures of about $50 million, which will increase our current mill's capacity from 108,000 tons per day to 120,000 tons per day. That'll add 30 million pounds of copper at very low cost. The real story there at Cerro Verde though is that opportunity for a major expansion. This is a mine that is situated so that a major expansion can be undertaken in a straightforward way. As always there are power and water issues to deal with. We're working towards those and are confident that with the resource we have there, the physical location and the footprint of the operations, that we will be able to move forward with a major expansion.</p>
          <p>We're working on the feasibility study now. That will be completed no later than the first half of next year. The size of that is the real question and water resources really will be the determinant of that. We think at least a doubling of the current production is in the cards, and we might have a chance to increase substantially more than that as we deal with the water issues. A great resource there, we continue to drill it, continue to find ore that could be profitably processed.</p>
          <p>In Chile, at our El Abra mine in Northern Chile, since the mid-'90s or earlier, the operation's been mining oxide ore. That is currently depleting. We have a very significant sulfide resource. Initially we're looking to move forward &#x2013; we are moving forward with a leaching project we call Sulfolix. That will involve some changing in processing, but it would extend the life of this mine about 10-plus years, making it a world-class producer &#x2013; continuing as a world-class producer at 300 million pounds per year. And this involves capital of about $725 million through 2015.</p>
          <p>But there's another page to this story. The sulfide resource has grown significantly since we combined our company with Phelps Dodge, and now we're studying about how potentially to take advantage of that resource through a milling expansion. One avenue we're pursuing is the possibility of a joint undertaking with Codelco and its nearby mine. And we've got a feasibility study looking at whether we might do something jointly there from a mill standpoint. Of course, in that location water is a major issue, but potentially we could build our own mill or do something in conjunction with Codelco. But that's a very significant opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, in addition to the great Grasberg pit, which is now looking forward to a completion of the pit mining, we're studying whether that's going to be in 2015 or maybe two or three years longer than that. But we have these very significant underground reserves, which probably if you look at it within the industry is the most attractive development opportunity for a copper company in the world because of the significant reserves and its cost structure.</p>
          <p>We have shown since the early '80s that we can block cave very effectively with this ore. Grasberg, currently the DOZ mine is operating at a sustained rate of 80,000 tons per day. We're developing a smaller high grade mine called the Big Gossan. But the future of this Company lies in the Grasberg block cave, which is directly underneath the pit. It's just an extension really of the ore body that we've been mining there since the early 1990s.</p>
          <p>The DOZ has significant expansion opportunities. Our current plans look for this to be a very large operation when we move totally underground, with mill rates of 240,000 tons per day with attractive long-term volumes in cost structure.</p>
          <p>In Africa in the second quarter we sold 55 million pounds of copper and 4 million ounces of cobalt. We had a operating issue in April, and during May and June we operated higher rates than that average. At full rates the current operation generates 250 million pounds of copper annually and over 18 million pounds of cobalt, more than that in the early years.</p>
          <p>Cobalt processing facilities has had startup problems involving the SO2 plant and the cobalt circuit. And we have developed plants to address that, which we think we will have dealt with by the end of this year. The mill, which was originally designed to operate at 8,000 tons per day, is actually capable of operating at a higher rate, and we're going to take advantage of that. We're spending a small amount of capital, about $20 million, for mine equipment so that we can mine the high grade materials, take advantage of this excess mill capacity. We think we can get up to 10,000 tons per day at that in 2011. And so without really expanding the operations, we can increase our copper production from 250 million to 290 million a day &#x2013; 290 million pounds per year.</p>
          <p>We continue with our exploration activities, we've been drilling oxide targets so far in 2010, which will provide the basis for further expansion. And we're doing some deep drilling to get arms better around the sulfide opportunity, which is really the long-term opportunity there. We've got a number of feasibility studies going, and we will be reporting on those, but they have the potential of increasing copper sales to the 300 to 400, 500 million pound per year range.</p>
          <p>We continue to work with the government. We're operating under our contract, and so we have a fiscal regime for paying taxes and royalties. We believe we have &#x2013; are closing in on the completion of these discussions about our contract review, and we're trying to work with the government to get a basis for dealing with some administrative issues that keep coming up there.</p>
          <p>At Climax, Dave Thornton is here, and we are really taking steps so that we have the optionality of restarting the Climax project. It's not in our budget numbers now; our Board has not formally approved startup. But we're doing a significant amount of work this summer in Colorado so that we will be in a position of reaching that decision. Watching the market. This is a project has a capacity of 30 million pounds per year. It could be expanded beyond that. We have about $500 million to spend to get it started. We're spending 60, $70 million this summer to position ourselves to make that decision so that we could be prepared to go in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Story of our Company is the reserves of copper that we have &#x2013; over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves under SEC definitions, 100 billion pounds of long-term reserves that are there are now as reserves. But beyond that, we have done sufficient drilling around our existing ore bodies to be able to find resources that are not yet qualified as reserves but that has contained copper at $2 copper that's in excess of this 100-billion-pound number by another 100 billion pounds plus.</p>
          <p>Now what that gives us is the opportunity to really have significant growth without having to have success in our greenfield exploration program or without having to go out and make acquisitions in the marketplace, which in my opinion's going to become increasingly expensive and difficult to do because of the shortage in copper in the world. So we've got a number of projects that we reviewed in the past that are on page 13 that are &#x2013; many in North America, starting up the Chino mine in New Mexico, further increasing Morenci. We acquired the Twin Buttes property that's adjacent to Sierrita, which gives us development opportunities there. We'd mentioned starting Climax. Morenci and other mines in North America, we know have significant sulfide resources. We're confident that we &#x2013; and we're studying the development of mills to process those.</p>
          <p>In South America the expansion of Cerro Verde, the El Abra mill project are significant. In Tenke we've mentioned de-bottling the further oxide expansion, the ultimate sulfide development. And then at Grasberg we continue to find a way that will allow us to optimize and prove the economics of that operation.</p>
          <p>When you add all those together, on page 14 as we see, the Grasberg open pit deplete, the El Abra oxide deposit deplete, we have resources that we're working on right now to replace those depleting production. Then there is incremental new opportunities for us that are significant. We've identified incremental production of annual rates of up to 1.5 to 2 billion pounds a year from these operations in North America, South America, and Africa that are incrementally new production that we have available.</p>
          <p>We are using &#x2013; some of this cash flow, we're generating to increase our exploration spending. Most of that is focused on our existing ore bodies. We are doing some greenfield projects that could materialize to be significant opportunities for us. But our primary focus is in this area of increasing our resources with our existing mines, qualifying those resources and reserves, and identifying development projects out of the reserves.</p>
          <p>Our 2010 outlook is similar to what we had outlined &#x2013; we had laid out in the first quarter with 3.8 billion pounds of copper, 1.8 million ounces of gold. Molybdenum's up a million pounds to 63 million pounds. The cash cost at $0.86 is in line with what we had earlier. At these levels with $3 copper for the remaining six months, we would have operating cash flows in excess of $5 billion. And our capital expenditures that have been approved by our board of 1.7 billion, we're looking for other ways to spend capital, and we'll update you with those as we move forward. So we'll have a very profitable business at these commodity price levels and strong cash flow generations.</p>
          <p>I want to report to you &#x2013; and Mark Johnson is here to respond to your questions. But we've made a mine planning change at Grasberg. For those of you that followed us over the years, you recall that this is a dynamic situation that occurs from time to time. We try to find ways of mining to open pit in ways that are safe. We try to advance metal forward when we have opportunities to do that, and that has been the story that we typically have.</p>
          <p>As we've gone forward with our mining, in the second quarter, we have revised our plans as a precautionary measure because of some geotechnical issues related to the southwest corner of the mine, a pushback 80s. It's a relatively small, but it's a high grade section of ore that was scheduled to be mined at the end of this year and end of 2011. And as a result of these geotechnical analyses, we are going to differ mining this high grade section. Our current plan calls for differing mining so that we can go back to the upper reaches and come down and mine it in a way that ensures safety. This current plan that we had results in a deferral of 130 million pounds of copper and 270,000 ounces net to our interest from the next five-year period to the scheduled end of the pit life of 2015, 2016.</p>
          <p>The ore's still there. We'll still get to the metal. It's just a question of timing. The biggest effect, if you look on page 18, is going to be in 2011, where our guidance as it currently stands for 2011, gold is down 400,000 ounces. We may find ways of getting this quicker, and we're working on that. But at the present time our plan calls for this to be the effect. Now with copper, the copper impact is being offset by other &#x2013; it's smaller. This is a section that has extraordinarily high gold grades, and it's being offset by other operations that we have. So our copper guidance is really unchanged.</p>
          <p>Page 19 shows the quarterly payable gold metal &#x2013; I mean, quarterly metal sales projections. Versus the first quarter, we found ways of moving forward some of the copper production so that you see power production projected for the third quarter coming out of the fourth quarter sales. And then at Grasberg, you can see the step-ups of where we are, as our mine sequencing takes us down to a higher grade section at the bottom of the mine.</p>
          <p>This plan results on page 20 with the sales profile that you see by region. And consolidated unit cost of $0.86 pound, that's at $3 copper, $1,200 gold, and $14 a pound molybdenum for the remainder of 2010. So we'll be able to retain our attractive cost structure.</p>
          <p>21 shows our earnings, our cash earnings capability of our Company at current copper prices, and looking at our $1,000 gold, $10 molybdenum, and our mine plans for 2011, 2012, which includes this adjustment to our gold sales at Grasberg in 2011. You can see at those commodity prices we would have EBITDA of over $7 billion operating, cash flows of over $5 billion.</p>
          <p>The sensitivities of our sales products and certain of our costs are shown on page 22. Our capital program, as currently we have not made changes, we have all the studies that lead to the opportunities to spend capital in the future. But the capital spending currently is consistent with what we had laid out in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate cash, and we continue to generate &#x2013; and to reduce debt. Kathleen laid out some of the steps we took in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with less than $5 billion of debt. And consolidated cash of 3 billion, some of that is tied up in subsidiaries and not available to the parent. But we've got a very strong balance sheet. And that is our goal. We're going to keep our financial liquidity, have aggressive cost management, invest in growth projects. Our board increased our dividend earlier, and the board will continue to review our financial policy.</p>
          <p>My perspective on where our Company is right now is that, given the world that we have and where we are, that we have the right assets. This is the right time to have these assets because the commodities that we have are really essential to the world's economy as we go forward. Over the past three years, we have developed the right financial assets so that now we have the financial capability of undertaking these great growth investments that we have. If something else comes up, we have the ability to look at it.</p>
          <p>We also have the financial liquidity to be able to deal with volatility, which is always a possibility for our industry. We've got really high quality assets, a great operating team. Every day we work to make things better and we solve problems, whether that's dealing with our cost structure, whether it's dealing with expansion opportunities, dealing with our situation of managing our business in countries like the DRC and Indonesia where've had such great success over the years.</p>
          <p>So our business is well positioned in an industry that has a real strong outlook. Because of the tight supply situation, the difficulties of developing new resources of copper, new production, and maintaining production, we see every day that the issues associated with mine planning or grade issues that come out from this industry, in the past, labor problems or problems with governments, taxation problems, or environmental problems, all these things add up to having a tight industry. And so having our Company with the level of reserves, level of resources and production we have makes us feel very good about where we are today with Freeport-McMoRan Copper $ Gold.</p>
          <p>And with that operator we will open the line for questions.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks for as usual very detailed presentation. Obviously you've got a lot of additional projects currently under evaluation. You've got Cerro Verde concentrator, the Tenke expansion, the mill at El Abra, restarting Climax, etc. So my question, is based on what you know today, could you rank or prioritize those projects from most likely to move forward to relatively less likely to move forward based on what you know today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's more of a question of timing. I really believe all the projects that we've mentioned are likely will be done, and it's just a question of timing. The one thing that we'll be able to do, I mentioned just briefly this Chino operation in New Mexico. It was a very old mine, 100-year-old mine that we curtailed. But we're taking the steps now, and that will bring in 150 to 200 million pounds of copper by restarting this operation.</p>
          <p>In terms of major expansion projects in the copper business, Cerro Verde is the project that's &#x2013; the word slam dunk comes into me, in my mind. But we live in a world where you don't want to go that far out. But it's a straightforward major project to double or triple production there. And unless something really turns down I this world, that's something we'll be announcing within the year to go forward with.</p>
          <p>Climax is another project along those lines. It would be the best molybdenum mine in the world. And absent some major change in the marketplace, we'd be prepared to go forward with it, production in 2012, 2011 depending on how far we go about this.</p>
          <p>We're going to be prudent about timing because we want to get out ahead of the marketplace. But given marketplace, then those things will happen.</p>
          <p>Tenke Fungurume is a project that has the physical opportunity to expand. Besides the markets, there we got a deal with some of these governmental issues that's conditioned on our doing that. We believe we can do that, but it's got the resource to go forward.</p>
          <p>What we want to do right now is work hard to be ready to pull the trigger on these things, not making the decision that you're totally committed to do it in terms of a specific timing, but go forward.</p>
          <p>We're really excited about the mill prospects in North America, particularly at Morenci. It's a huge resource, and to be able to build a mill there and to have a modern mill that could handle large volumes of ore and produce large amounts of copper is very exciting. Three years ago we looked at El Abra and we thought we saw just the oxide and Sulfolix. Now we see the potential for a mill there. So we have to work on all the things that go into converting reserves to projects and that involves &#x2013; that involves permits; it involves water, power issues, personnel issues, and so forth. But what we see here is, looking forward, a whole string of these opportunities that gives us a chance to grow based on resources we already have in-house.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, perfect, thanks. You mentioned Tenke. Just as a quick follow-up, then I'll pass on to somebody else, I was wondering if you could give us an update, if there is one, on the negotiations that you've been having with the DRC government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tenke had a very important event that happened on June 30. It was the &#x2013; the country did in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was the 50th year anniversary of their independence from Belgium. And that was a big deal for this country. And the King of Belgium came to Kinshasa, and there were a lot of big events. So the government has really been focused on that activity then. Recent conversations have been very positive about going forward.</p>
          <p>And as I said, it's a question of where we have a contract, we're operating everyday under that contract, and we get encouragement from a number of sources within government that our contract's not going to be significantly &#x2013; they're not going to take a position of changing our contract. Our position is we're not really negotiating; we're &#x2013; we have a contract and we're supporting that contract. We're working cooperatively with the government. We want to be responsive to issues they have. It's always going to &#x2013; when you're going into it, it always will be a complicated place to operate. But you can see by our &#x2013; our numbers speak for themselves there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You guys have done a great job at showing us the great assets that you have. But I just wanted to say congratulations to the entire management team on the fabulous job you did on cost. Especially in North America, that's just superb results.</p>
          <p>My question though is on your guidance for 2010 on production. I mean, your guidance &#x2013; you beat your guidance in both copper and gold in the second quarter by 10%. It was pretty wide level. And you upped your guidance for the third quarter, yet keeping the guidance for the full year. Is that just being very conservative, or is there something that's changed in the mine plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, thanks for the comments. Just with Red and his operating management from North America and South America, and we look back on history and look at where we've come with these operations, we've had six straight quarters now of meeting our targets. And these are hard targets to meet with mines of the nature that we have in history. And the guys are all &#x2013; all of our guys are so fired up about the success we're having in dealing with costs. We got a lot of confidence after going through 2008 and 2009. And we just got a great team, and momentum is going very good.</p>
          <p>One factor in this issue about guidance that you talked about is that we do have some lower volumes coming out of Grasberg because of this 8 East situation, and so some of the better than expected performance out of the remainder of our operations is making up for that. And Grasberg itself has outperformed its targets from that. So some of that is an offset for.</p>
          <p>And then as you mentioned, as we look forward &#x2013; or historically we've tried to be not overly optimistic. We'd rather under-promise and over-deliver on situations, and that's been our history. So we're going to work hard. And with this Grasberg mine plan, our team's working on issues so that we can do better than the mine plan for 8 East. And we talked about, but want to make sure that the investment community knows an outlook that we're confident in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Tenke, you mentioned in the presentation that you could expand it or double it, I guess, from 250 to 500. And I assume that's under the current logistics where you're trucking the product out. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, Mike. It is a logistics challenge. It's costly because we are trucking this product in certain of our inputs by 3,000 kilometers. But that system would handle a doubling of where we are now, and we have studies going on then for the longer-range opportunities to build this up to a world-class mine, which would require rails. And we're working with the government, and there's some regional things going on with other countries. Historically there was rail systems there, and we think that ultimately the country will get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you had agreement with government and you did find some rail connection out of Tenke, could you just give us an idea of the scale of Tenke's production? Would you be able to quadruple it or more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, from our current level that's the range that we've talked about. We've talked about the ability to double with oxides and then double again with the sulfides. But that's order of magnitude type of deals. We still have to do some core drilling and exploration analysis. We have some mixed ore that's of significance there that will require some metallurgical work to deal with. But that's the order of magnitude opportunity that we see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one last question, just on the balance sheet, and you have very conservative balance sheet. You've paid down almost all of the Phelps Dodge debt now in a very short period of time, and you've recently doubled the dividend. Even though you have a number of organic opportunities and you seem to be leaning away from the external because the organic is so attractive, you still have what looks to be a lot of excess cash or cash flow capability. Could you comment on the potential for share buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you just look at the traditional and the history of our Company, our board has a tradition of being shareholder-oriented. And as we look forward, we think &#x2013; I think you see these across businesses everywhere. Now is the time that businesses are being conservative with cash positions. But our tradition has been not to retain excess amounts of cash. We really want to invest it. I mean, that's the best thing we can do for shareholders. But to the extent we have excess cash, our  Board's tradition has been to return cash to the Company. We've paid strong regular dividends. We've paid special dividends and have bought stock back. And all those things would be considered &#x2013; are considered by our board at each one of its meetings.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, and good job in the quarter. I guess just first off on Tenke, can you remind us on &#x2013; my understanding previously was that the feasibility for Phase II would be around now. Can you just remind us on the timing there and what the milestones look like as far as your discussion with the government? Does that need to move forward by the end of the year? What's the point in time where you would look to commit capital to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've been very clear with the government, and it's just common sense to say we're not going to commit extensive capital until we get all the issues related to our contract discussions and our ability to operate in a reasonable fashion behind us. In the meantime, we have advanced the feasibility studies. We're looking at several alternatives. The feasibility studies are not going to be the time constraint for going forward. We're going to be prepared to go forward when these discussions with the government are completed in a mutually satisfactory way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that takes place first, and then you'd address the feasibility of Phase II after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we'd execute on expansion. We're dealing with the feasibility studies right now. I mean, we're working, and we got several alternatives. They're wrapping up. I mean, we got a lot of data and things of that nature. It's really the question you had about committing capital. So we're meeting all the requirements for our contract in terms of doing the studies and so forth, and we're not slowing down the study aspect of the work. In terms of saying we're going to start ordering equipment and doing construction work, that's what's pending resolution of these discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. I see, okay. Just one follow-up, as far as your position on the U.S., would investing on a larger truck fleet be something that you would consider as a way to further improve your costs? Is that an attractive investment, or is there too much parked equipment at this time to consider going to larger size trucks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because one of the issues that's on all of our minds is there's currently an issue with delivery trucks and that sort. But with mining trucks, that's an interesting question. We're working right now &#x2013; we had, in round terms, 100 haul trucks that were idled when we cut back, and we've been using those. We've been using some of those in our restarted operations. We're going to use some at Climax. We use some at Chino. We sent some to South America, some to Indonesia.</p>
          <p>And now we're seeing some opportunities of reworking &#x2013; as we watch how the industry is changing its truck fleet situation from one manufacturer to another, we're seeing some opportunities maybe of acquiring some used trucks and reworking them and doing &#x2013; and that would give us capacity on an ongoing basis. So it's a real dynamic thing.</p>
          <p>We have a large-scale operation. It's large part Cat 793 trucks. Some other operations are going to different trucks, different size trucks, different manufacturers. And that's making some trucks that fit in particularly well with us available, and we are moving to take advantage of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Just a quick question on El Abra Sulfolix project. I thought that you mentioned about an opportunity to do milling and concentrate over there since you have found larger reserve. Does that mean that you were going to do it instead of Sulfolix, or Sulfolix will go ahead as planned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Sulfolix is going ahead as planned. We have the infrastructure there. We have to make some changes. We had this dynamic pad that we've been using for the oxide; we're changing it. But this would be &#x2013; the mill opportunity is incremental to the Sulfolix. Sulfolix is underway and will operate regardless of the decision we make on the mill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, I mean, it's really too early to say that. But concentrated mills for a project with this grade, there's standards that we'll look at in the alternative &#x2013; in the studies. Right now we're in kind of a prefeasibility, our study phase with that. And a lot of this will depend on how we work through our potential opportunity to do something jointly with Codelco.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sal, with something &#x2013; it's like at Morenci. You don't do a small mill for a large low-grade deposit. It has to be a mill that has substantial capacity because you need the economies of six scale to make something economic. Good news is we've got resources to even think about this.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me just comment on the size of these sulfide projects. I mean, it's come up in four or five questions here. Just don't forget that the Morenci, which of course is a world-class plant already &#x2013; but the sulfide ore at Morenci could be up in the 5 billion pounds, which is 2.5 billion pounds more than we have at Grasberg. Obviously the grade is going to be less. With the <mark type="inaudible" /> that you have at Morenci, you're still talking about something that's going to be over half <mark type="inaudible" /> copper.</p>
          <p>And of course you got the same size at Cerro Verde. That has the outside based on our exploration drilling of being a 5-billion-ton ore body. So that's again twice as big as the Grasberg, obviously lesser grade again. With the copper and product <mark type="inaudible" />, that'll be over 0.5% copper. And in El Abra, it's probably in 3-billion-ton range, which is again bigger than Grasberg in size terms, in size <mark type="inaudible" />. Once again it'll be lower grade, but based on the deep drilling we're doing there, it could be up in the 0.5% to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So as we talk about these things, I just thought if we put it in perspective, we've already talked about the size of &#x2013; possibility of a quadruple at Tenke. So when you throw those kinds of numbers around, obviously as you said, with the lower grades you've got to have the big mills. But when you take the Grasberg at 2.5 billion and you take the potential of Tenke, being able to quadruple the ore there because of the size of that, and then Morenci and Cerro Verde, El Abra, we're talking about five world-class properties that have tonnage. We've got enough exploration and exploitation drilling done that those are not just the numbers we throw around; those are likely targets.</p>
          <p>So I hope that kind of puts a perspective around this whole envelope of what we call brownfield projects, that are really Greenfield type size and that we've got in our hip pocket to develop as the market allows us to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Jim Bob mentioned something, too. Currently there is just a miniscule molybdenum component to Morenci. As we'll go deeper and look at these mill opportunities, there's a more significant &#x2013; much more significant molybdenum possibility there. But these mill sizes, when I talk about a standard, it's 150,000 to 200,000 ton per day mill that would be needed to deal with ore bodies this size.</p>

          <p>My question is on the transition to the block cave at Grasberg. Every now and again somebody asks you how your cost structure might change as you move from the open pit to the block cave. And I'm wondering if you can update us on your current thinking.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a very, very attractive situation that is very dependent on the price of gold, as it has been in the pit. But a combination of price of gold and kind of the price of diesel because when you move underground, we're going to be idling like 140, 50 big haul trucks, or maybe it's more than that now. Mark, how many &#x2013; it's...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...160 because we don't have to mine the waste that you do out of the pit. And so at various combination of gold prices and diesel prices, our unit costs have actually been lower underground then they have been in the pit. In broad terms when we think about, say, gold at $800 and oil cost at say 70, $80 a barrel, you end up with something in the kind of net $0.40 range where the pit would have over its life been around $0.20, sometimes lower. But it's within those ballparks, but it will vary significantly depending on the relationship to the price of gold and the price of diesel, but...</p>

          <p>Okay, and presumably that's all the mining cost. I mean, there's probably some economies of scale as you go to 240,000 tons per day in the mill, but that would be relatively immaterial.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and then there are some issues that we'll face over time. Certain of our ore bodies will have to have some additional processing because of the nature of the ore, and so there will be some things. Initially though it's going to be real similar ore to what we have now. I mean, it's the same ore really. It'll go deeper, and then with the DOZ mine, over time we'll have some additional processing. But we're talking now 2020 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me just be sure that everybody keeps in mind that when you talk about underground mining, you have to remember the elevation of it. I know everybody's aware of the fact that we have gravity working in our favor. We wouldn't be talking about block caving. That's why this thing, as we just pointed out, can have these kind of low cost numbers on the horizon because <mark type="inaudible" /> you have sometimes a lot of the new stuff that's being looked at, people are talking about deep underground mines, but they're talking about mines where they can't block cave; they're going to have to have gravity working against them.</p>
          <p>So the unbelievable geometry of this ore body in Grasberg where we went up at the 13,000 elevation and built that open pit and mined the open pit. And yet at the mill level, you still have the advantage of going underneath the big ore body. And as we said, you don't have to move the waste. But not do you not have to move the waste; you don't have the hazards of the open pit that we've had at the Grasberg up there and goes out to high rainfall, with fog, etc. etc. Fortunately there's no fog underground; there's no rain underground. So not only are you getting rid of trucks, but you're getting rid of a lot of hazards that you don't have to deal with.</p>
          <p>You have your own hazards underground with the block cave, but for any of you that have you been up to the Grasberg and been there during those heavy rainfalls, that fall with those big trucks driving up and down, getting in and out of that open pit &#x2013; so there's lots of things to consider. And that's why the cost structure always fools people. People think that underground mining is going to be more costly. But with the surveying in the conditions, the weather conditions, it has a huge impact for us to be underground block caving.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two quick questions. First of all, I'm just trying to clarify on your sale profile over the next few years where you go from consolidated production of 3.8 billion pounds to 4 billion pounds, what's in there. If I got it right, we have the small Cerro Verde expansion, Miami, Tenke at the 250 level going to 290, Morenci, but no Chino, no Tenke double expansion, obviously no big Cerro expansion. So effectively those four or five offset 100-million-pound decline at Grasberg and the decline of El Abra. Is that sort of way it works in what you have there, and all of the other is optionality going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, that's more than sort of. You got it nailed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, just for accounting at Tenke with the cobalt credit &#x2013; and I recognize there's been some challenges in the cobalt plant &#x2013; you have this little number that says byproduct credit, which is the cobalt revenue and freight. But can you just go through how much is freight, how much of it is that you're just not getting good cobalt right now and therefore, if you get the cobalt problem, that guidance you have of byproduct credit might actually go up? Can you just go through what's actually in that calculation and how it might unfold over the next couple of years if you get the cobalt plant working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're selling a &#x2013; first when we look at the cobalt price, the market price, we're not selling refined metal. We're selling a hydroxide product that's...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...priced &#x2013; the price structure is similar to like you would have concentrates in the copper industry. So the price that we receive is a discount to the market price and it generally &#x2013; it varies depending on what the price is, but generally somewhere in 65% plus or minus range of that price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not a discount; that's the price what we receive. So it's like a two-thirds, 70% of the selling price, is what we realize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on top of that, so the realized price that you see in the press release reflects that number. And then on top of that we have freight cost that we pay, which is in the $2 a pound of cobalt range currently. The freight costs currently is higher than it will be when we get some of those issues resolved because we're shipping a product that has higher water content, and so that freight will come down. And then we've also got our processing costs that are netted in that line item for the byproduct credits.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Another question on Tenke cost structure. Looking at the release, it looks like you're talking about for 2011 cash costs of, say, $0.80 a pound at $12 cobalt. That's higher than you previously talked about. My recollection was last quarter you were talking about some of the run rate costs being $0.50 a pound at $10 cobalt. What's the difference, and is that kind of &#x2013; is the new cost structure expected to remain in place in perpetuity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to work hard to get it back down. With these grades we're going to work to get the cost back to some of these previous estimates to get with &#x2013; this is just where we are right now. We're having &#x2013; there's some sulfuric acid costs that are higher than anticipated. Some of it has to do with the material that we're now planning on running through to get to the higher throughput rates. There's some transportation cost issues with that.</p>
          <p>Overall transportation costs are higher than we anticipated. We're going to &#x2013; some of this has to do with some government fees we're having to pay not only just in the Congo, but through some of the other countries we're going through, and we're working on dealing with that. We've got about I think it's around $0.04 that we've identified that has to do with some of the legal and administrative costs that are facing us because of some of the issues we're facing not with the contract review, but with an administration with the government. And labor costs are a bit higher.</p>
          <p>So we just had a session with our team. We're focused on this. But you're exactly right. This is where we are right now. And again that's guidance we're giving, but we're going to work to get the cost down. As the project expands and we get the benefits of scale, we deal with some of these cobalt issues and some of the other issues, we would think that our cost would come down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, great, thanks. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen and team. With your Indonesia guidance, if I look at your back-half production, it's looks like volumes are going to be up about 11%. Yet with your revised site production numbers, it doesn't look like costs are going down that much on a unit basis. Anything changing there in the back half versus the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let's see. Let's get those unit costs because they will be coming down substantially at Grasberg. Give us a second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kathleen will give it to you. Our cost structure is gosh there, if you look at the top-line cost number where &#x2013; before you get to the byproduct credits, it's really very attractive. And they've been &#x2013; nothing from a cost standpoint's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because I was just looking at &#x2013; full year it looks like on a site production delivery basis, you're guiding to $1.57 and best one first half it averaged $1.58, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And copper volumes are not significantly different. Where we're &#x2013; if you look at the gold byproduct credit, we're well above &#x2013; we'll be $0.14 for the year. And last time at this quarterly call, we were estimating $0.25 for the average for the year. So our costs are actually better in Indonesia than we had originally forecast, and that's being driven by these higher gold credits. Our copper volumes are actually down from our previous forecast for Indonesia. So that's resulting in the higher site production and delivery costs compared to where we were previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So because of the mine plan &#x2013; the mine plan changes. When you look at Indonesia alone, we've got lower volumes. That's being offset by some higher volumes in our consolidated numbers, and that's partially what's driving what you're observing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then at Climax, Richard, I didn't get what the total dollar spend that you said you were going to be doing over the summer &#x2013; 6 to 7, or is it 60 to 70?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say ballpark $60 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is this money that you're spending going to be part of the total CapEx of 700 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, this is cost that going into the year we were planning to be spending next summer. And we made the decision to go ahead and start doing some work this summer. For those of you &#x2013; I think most of you know this is located right on top of Fremont Pass in the Colorado Rockies, and so there's a summer construction season that you have to take advantage of. And so what we really did is we advanced some things we were planning on doing in the summer of 2011 to this year. And it's in all of our numbers, and it would be part of the $500 million cost to complete that we're disclosing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then at Morenci, I think you mentioned that, as you go deeper, the moly content does go up. Does this influence your decision on when you would want to go forward with Climax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. No, no, it's a &#x2013; Climax decision will be earlier than this. We're doing studies at Morenci now. It'll be a major capital project to build a big mill and so forth. I just wanted &#x2013; as Jim Bob referred to, it adds to the economics of looking at the expansion at Morenci, but it won't affect Climax.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. And I'm sorry the questions never end. Just quickly, I was a little bit surprised on the Tenke coming in a little bit higher than the average. I think we addressed some of the cobalt issues and the moisture and things like that. But you would sort of stand by a kind of $0.50 net cash cost range for that division in 2011 regardless of if you do a second phase expansion. Is that kind of the ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. no. Our guidance is $0.80 at this point. We're going to work towards driving that down. But when we look at a combination of our historical, the cost that we've been incurring, as we now have been operating this &#x2013; we began a year ago and ramped up copper &#x2013; when we look at what we're actually spending, when we have the issues that &#x2013; we'll deal with some of the issues with cobalt, but some of those will be with us for awhile &#x2013; when we have these issues with the government plus some incremental sulfuric acid costs, right now we're looking at the guidance of $0.80 for 2011 with an understanding we're going to work to get it lower.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, that really hasn't affected us. We haven't &#x2013; Mark, as far as I know, it's just been normal rain, even maybe a little less.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had normal rainfall this year both in the first and the second quarter. We don't have a monsoon season like some of the rest of Indonesia. First quarter we'd see marginally higher rain. We saw that; wasn't substantially high. And the seismic activity that you've seen is &#x2013; it's off the northeast corner of PNG. It's a long ways from us, not even felt out at site.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just last quick question. Any impact from the Frank &#x2013; sorry, Dodd-Frank Legislation that's going through that's requiring additional disclosures for companies dealing in the DRC. They named a bunch of minerals; copper wasn't one of them. But any impact there that could relate to additional disclosure in doing business out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the metals they're talking about are the ones that are being mined in small operations in Eastern Congo. It's coltan and other metals like that. It has no impact on us. And another thing, the disclosure issues about payments you make to the government that's in that bill were really modeled after the international effort to disclose payments that we're already complying with. So there's nothing in there that really affects us.</p>

First of all, when we've been in Peru, Cerro Verde, I guess the thing that really surprised me was to hear a possibility of tripling of the size of those operations there. Is it because you're so comfortable with the water availability, the electrical, and power availability and you've got a workforce that's located right there in Arequipa, and all of those capabilities are reasons, along with the resource of course, why you feel even more confident to talk about those kind of numbers today?</p>

          <p>Let me be clear. The resource, the mineral resource is there. The ability to expand is there. The water resource is a question mark. And, Red, fill in here if I go too far. We feel real comfortable about our water resource. Got some work to do, but we feel real comfortable about our water resource that would allow us to double.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. And, Tony, we've been very successful there working with the local community on additional reservoir capacity. That was a big part of the first mill project that we built. We think we have opportunities to partner with the government and the community on additional projects like that in the future. And it's those kinds of things that we're working on and would open up a bigger window of production capacity for us there.</p>

          <p>All right. All right, excellent. And then just a follow-up question on &#x2013; thank you, Richard. It sounded to me as if &#x2013; I know it's been a long process in this whole review. And you've got the existing contract, and you continue to adhere to the parameters of that. But you sounded much more comfortable on the margin. Is that a fair portrayal on how things are developing there, the support that you're receiving?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me say we've been with this over a two-year period. We've been very close on a couple of occasions during that period, that we thought we were within a matter of days of having this completed. And for whatever reason &#x2013; government changes, other things &#x2013; have come in the way. I think throughout the period, you can describe our situation as being cautiously optimistic. And sometimes maybe what you hear in the tone of my voice what's going on at a particular time we're talking.</p>
          <p>And right now the discussions have been very good. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As I said, we're operating every day. We're going to work to get our cost down, to improve our volumes. And right now we're recapturing investment. I mean, cash is coming out of this, back to repay the advances that we've made over time. The key to going forward with developing this to its full potential, which would be a great event for this country &#x2013; it would be very positive for all the stakeholders involved, and we keep saying that &#x2013; is getting these discussions out of the way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Wayne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very impressed by your list of projects that you can develop. Do you have the staff? I mean, this may sound like an impolite question, but do you have the staff because you're talking about expanding just about every project, and it's going to take a huge amount of engineering work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I tell you we've got a great team. And that was one of the great things about the combination of our two companies, was being able to put these two groups together, and a lot of the young people &#x2013; one of the great things, Wayne, that's been fun to watch over time is seeing how our Indonesian national staff has developed. We actually have Indonesian nationals working in the DRC, in South America, here in Phoenix. And so all of that's good.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, we're going to be out looking for people. This is a very attractive place to work. We're hiring people, and we'll continue to do that. So we've got development. We're very comfortable internally with what we do. Two years ago the big issue at this very moment in time was dealing with outside equipment suppliers and contractors, and that's going to be an issue going forward, as to the outside services. But I'm very comfortable with what we can develop and handle in-house.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now you have a huge list of very attractive projects. But in the past, management's been very excited about the rest of Indonesia. You have Block A of course, which you've got a good handle on. But we've seen a number of huge potential projects that you could identify and develop in the rest of the Indonesia. And I realize you had to pull in your exploration teams a few year ago when there was some reasons to do that. What's the status of your exploration work in the rest of the country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim Bob, you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Wayne, obviously the big projects you're talking about are the ones we identified early on when we went in and did the aeromagnetic survey. And one of the things that we haven't been able to do, we did as you know find a gold project at Walu to the north, one of those big aeromags where we still haven't been able to get the size of it, to the point even with these gold projects that we have, if you can justify a road as far north as we'd have to go to get to it.</p>
          <p>Probably the biggest frustration we've had is there's a big aeromag that you're remembering at <mark type="inaudible" />, which was about 100 miles west of the Grasberg. And that darn thing, the aeromag looked just like the aeromag at the Grasberg. So we had some high hopes that there was some shallow drilling down there that had seen some indications of some good copper and gold. And we got in there, and we drilled what looked like the identical spot on the aeromag that you'd have at Grasberg type ore body. and we had one or two hits, but we just couldn't confirm the size of the ore.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot more work to be done in there because these aeromags are so big. As you know, you don't want to miss the sweet spot. But every time we had gone in there to try to really get going, we had some kind of security issue because of the problem with our economy situation, etc., etc.</p>
          <p>So we just have to stay tuned on that. We still have some trouble dealing with <mark type="inaudible" /> in particular is a prospect you'll remember that we had hoped by now we would have done enough drilling that if there was a Grasberg-type ore body out there we'd see. But we just haven't been able to get into &#x2013;  have a continuous program like we had in Block A.</p>
          <p>And of course the reason for that is in Block A where Grasberg is we don't have any issues as far as a camp and having to have people out there in the rural areas without the infrastructure to back them up that we do on the exploration that we do at Block A. So that's why we've been so successful extending the bottom of Grasberg east and getting the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the big <mark type="inaudible" /> and those kind of things defined.</p>
          <p>But you just stay tuned on that because <mark type="inaudible" /> is still out there. And lurking in that jungle somewhere could be another Grasberg. The aeromag says it ought to be there. We just haven't been smart enough or lucky enough to get the drill holes in the right place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up in addition. I was just down there at Arequipa last week, and another copper company is very concerned about water. They've drilled some wells and they found water. But it's unbelievably dry down there, as I don't have to tell you. And they were concerned about local pushback because, without the irrigation, people just can't live down there. So do you feel pretty good about water? Would you use wells, or take it out of the river because they seem to feel there was a lot of risk that the locals might get pretty feisty if that weren't handled correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Wayne, this is Red Conger. The water supply that we have at Cerro Verde now is renewable. It comes from a reservoir system in the high mountains above the operation. In the expansion, we did to build the current concentrator, the water resource that was created by building a new reservoir was split equally between the community and Cerro Verde. So the things that we've done have been in partnership with the farmers, with the community. And we look forward to doing more of those kinds of development projects there in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're not &#x2013; what we're looking to do is not compete with the local community, but do things that would be incrementally beneficial to the local community and provide water for our operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you maybe could beef up your reservoir, and then that would bring some water in and maybe share some more with them and then use it yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, or build a new reservoir. That's one of the things we're looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it seems like it's quite a distance &#x2013; maybe 50 or 100 kilometers to bring water in from a reservoir. Do I have that right or...</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations to the whole team on a great quarter. I've had the opportunity to meet a number of your operating personnel, and I know they're best in class across the board. But especially to you, Richard, congratulations for doing such a great job steering the company over the last two years.</p>
          <p>I mean, my question's probably not a big surprise, and I think Mike was alluding to it earlier. But I think to say that you have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity in cash flow maybe understates the issue. At the pace of the first half of 2010 you're going to be showing net cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year. And I understand that you want to be conservative, but my question is this. In a more normal or stable environment, macro environment, what do you think is an appropriate level of leverage on the balance sheet? And how do you think about something like a special one-time dividend to re-lever the balance sheet versus an expanded share repurchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are issues that our board considers, Peter. And no question, the times that we're in and the uncertainties and so forth lead to different sorts of analysis than you would be if you were in different times. We have an issue just from a cold-blooded economic analysis of debt levels in that we don't get tax benefits for debt like some other companies would. And that has to do with the fact that we pay such large taxes in our overseas operations, particularly Indonesia, which has no need for debt because of where it is.</p>
          <p>There's all this big discussion right now about the foreign tax credit and so forth. Freeport is in the mirror image of what a lot of U.S. companies are, where they have low foreign taxes and high U.S. taxes. We have higher foreign taxes than we do in the U.S. So one of the issues about leverage your business school students would normally look at is the tax deductibility of interest. And we only get about 15% of our interest that's deductible. That's just one factor that goes into it.</p>
          <p>In terms of what we'd be comfortable with, you can almost go back to the point of the Phelps Dodge transaction, the way we structured what we paid for it. At that time, we were comfortable with having 6 to $7 billion of long-term debt, which is more than what we have now. So we could be comfortable with more debt than what we have now. It's a question that's the boards going to be talking about. It's their decision. And they will look at &#x2013; I mean, as I've said, we all wanted to invest. I mean, that's the first thing we want to do. And then we look at things like the regular dividends, special dividend, and, as Mike mentioned, stock buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess as a quick follow-up, I mean, if you look at the current price deck of metals and just make the assumption, which I know isn't any body's base case, but if you think it hangs around sort of plus or minus 10% of where we are today, you guys should be generating close to $4 billion of free cash flow even with the dividend, maybe a little bit below that, in that type of environment. And as you alluded to or as you pointed out very clearly, you've got as much of six world-class mines that you could be sitting on if you fully gut them out.</p>
          <p>If you're to &#x2013; to get there, I guess I have two questions. What kind of volume would you be looking at? And would that require spending all of that cash flow if just using round numbers, or which you still have surplus cash flow? It seems to me &#x2013; I can't get the numbers to add up. It seems to me like you're still generating cash &#x2013; or I'm sorry, you're still accumulating cash on the balance sheet given the timing of these projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No question. And we have access to credit now that's comparable to what we had before the downturn. So we have a lot of financial flexibility. We'd be very comfortable in financing these projects using some debt. They're going to be over periods of time. But as we look here right now, you're going to see a company that will have the opportunity of returning significant cash to shareholders as we invest in growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And outside of the internal CapEx programs, share repurchases, and changes to the dividend, are there any other uses of cash that the Company and the board are evaluating, or is it all on the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's all on the table. I mean, if you notice in our financial statements, we do spend money on reclamation activities. But one of the things we're really committed that's going on behind the scenes &#x2013; we don't talk about it at earnings conference calls &#x2013; is we've got a very active program solving problems. We've been settling these issues, reaching conclusions, spending money in advance to get problems behind us. But that's just all normal cost of business.</p>

All these things that we're considering are not in there, neither the costs nor the revenue &#x2013; the volumes. So when a project gets approved, it goes into those numbers.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to taxes, I think there are some real important things here to focus on. In Indonesia we have a contract of work. We've had two since the mid-'60s when this Company started there. And that sets for the life of the contract the taxes and royalties that are payable. And that's never been changed. And even though &#x2013; and today in Indonesia their corporate income tax is actually 30%, and we pay a tax of 35%. So whatever Indonesia decides to do from a policy standpoint &#x2013; and by the way, Indonesia as a country's done very well. And they're talking about decreasing taxes to encourage business. But our situation is fixed there.</p>
          <p>In Chile we and the other members of the copper industry have recently been engaged in discussions with the government about a revision to their royalty payments to in effect advance some royalty payments so that they would get some funds to deal with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. That fell apart for political reasons. And right now our situation in Chile is fixed by our agreements that we have there.</p>
          <p>In Peru &#x2013; South America's had very attractive tax regimes and royalty regimes compared with world standards. And that's one of the reasons Chile and Peru have just done so well. We use them as examples in other parts of the world &#x2013; that if you do have attractive taxes and royalties, you encourage investments.</p>
          <p>So Peru, there has been some steps to have what they call voluntary payments that we've been involved with. We constantly have discussions with them about tax issues.</p>
          <p>But the whole industry, our ICMM organization and our chair was very concerned about what Australia was doing. We've seen this case in other countries like Mongolia, which has had difficulties in getting contracts approved. And in the DRC, they have indicated they're moving towards a new mining gold there that would provide for higher taxes for new projects. It wouldn't affect our project because we have an existing contract.</p>
          <p>But this whole issue of resource nationalism is worldwide, and it's another one of those factors that's going to make it more difficult from an economic standpoint to justify new investment in copper mining operations &#x2013; that, along with environmental concerns and at the fact that resources are underground, the cost structure, etc., etc., etc. So, yes, it's an issue.</p>
