          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Amanda and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instruction] Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we're making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted property EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. We also want to let you know that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website for your use.</p>
          <p>With that, let me please introduce our chairman, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you should have seen our press release and related earnings materials which are available on our website. Joining me in the call today are Mike, Rob, Chris and Ken. As the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and the company's chief strategist, I'm focused on delivering growth and maximizing shareholder value. I think our company assumes these goals in four key areas, one, organic growth in existing properties; two, development growth that's within our reach today; three, development of integrated reserve locations new to Las Vegas Sands; and four, return of capital to shareholders through growing annual dividends.</p>
          <p>So point one, our organic growth at our existing properties. I would like to go through some highlights for the quarter in Macao where our industry-leading scale and infrastructure investments are creating impressive results in the largest and most profitable gaming market in the world. Our quarterly results in Macao reflect company records in virtually every category and we expect our operating momentum to continue in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our market share of the gross gaming revenue in Macao was 19.3%, up from 14.3% last year. That is a 35% growth in market share. At this growth, I'd also like to mention that our EBITDA numbers surpassed any one of our competitors at any market share. I just want to mention that in reports that we saw this morning, our market share gains in October in Macao was in excess of 20%.</p>
          <p>Again, demonstrating that we're growing faster than the market, as our investments and strategies produce results. Our rolling book &#x2013; rolling volume was up 45.5% this quarter to a record US$36 billion. That represents VIP market shares of approximately 17% of rolling volume for the quarter compared to just 11.4% one year ago. If you remember at that time, I said we were getting back into the good graces of the junket reps and this 49.1% increase in market share and rolling volume will attest to that. Rolling volume was up 54% there in the quarter, while the general Macao market was down 1% for the same period. That is really spectacular. While everyone else is experiencing declining volumes in their VIP business, we're delivering strong growth. Equally impressive is our strong organic growth and momentum in the mass segment in Macao. Due to its higher margin structure, this segment is even more important to our future cash flow and bottom-line results.</p>
          <p>Our non-rolling table win in Macao for the quarter was up 36.4% to more than $658.4 million, another accountable record. Our table productivity also improved meaningfully this quarter with win for a mass table across our portfolio of properties expanding year-over-year by 26% to reach nearly US$8,700 per table.</p>
          <p>Remember that we have the largest footprint in Macao. That's because we took our original strategy, call for us to take certain risks and the risks worked out far beyond our expectations, except for Sheldon Adelson's expectations. I thought it was going to be a grand slam home run. I was wrong. It was a grand slam home run, the World Series of Tennis not to mention ping-pong and the Super Bowl. I can't be right all the time. Our table productivity is also improving this quarter, with win per mass table across our portfolio to $8,700.</p>
          <p>Now I'm turning to Singapore. We <mark type="ph" /> had bad luck (6:19) this quarter with Singapore at just 1.79%. That was really a low hold. It cost us about $105 million in EBITDA during the quarter. So on a hold-adjusted basis; we would have produced EBITDA at just over $365 million this quarter from Singapore but who's counting.</p>
          <p>As Singapore continues to progress as the destination for business and leisure travel and entertainment and our marketing programs with the Asian region mature, our business at Marina Bay Sands will continue to grow. We're implementing new marketing programs to both the premium mass market and VIP markets, beefing up our sales force and investing in aircraft. The customers we are targeting with these efforts will come from the areas surrounding Singapore: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the wider Southeast Asian region as well as from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan, and Korea. I think I missed Vietnam. We're getting a significant amount of business from Vietnam.</p>
          <p>Point two, development growth which is in reach today. We will generate substantial growth on our results in Macao, as Sands Cotai Central ramps up and as we are able to develop the Parisian on site III.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sands Cotai Central, mass table and slot business &#x2013; so turning to Sands Cotai Central, mass table and slot business reflected meaningful growth this quarter. Total mass win per day increased by 15% compared to the partial quarter ended June 30, and reached $1.56 million per day. We see strong operating momentum continuing in the quarters ahead, particularly as the addition of hotel dining, shopping, entertainment amenities of Phase 2 of Sands Cotai Central begins to make their contributions. Because those amenities were open only 11 days during the quarter. They had minimal impact on this quarter's revenues.</p>
          <p>As a remainder, since April of 2012, we have opened more than 3,660 hotel rooms and two new casinos in Macao. In addition, we will open 2,000 new hotels rooms in January 2013. That's great. I'd also like to say that our concept in bringing in international brands us paying off this year. We're running at very high occupancy rates in the hotels. We're bringing in business. People questioned Holiday Inn, but Holiday Inn is running at extremely high rates. The Conrad has more demand than it has supplies and the Sheraton just opened recently last month and we're doing splendidly at the Sheraton. We still have one more tower to go which will open, I suspect, within the next 90 days. The strategic advantages of the scale in critical mass of our portfolio of products on the Cotai Strip, including the air-conditioned and people mover pedestrian bridge which will open in December, connecting Cotai Central with The Four Seasons and the Venetian on the west side of the Strip, will benefit all of our confidence on Cotai and strength in our retail mall business. As the Macao market continues to grow, we can see a time in the not too distant future, where Sands Cotai Central will have the opportunity to produce financial results that rival those of the Venetian Hotel.</p>
          <p>The Parisian Macao will add another integrated resort property to our portfolio on the Cotai Strip. We're targeting it in late 2015 or earlier. We've already submitted our design plans to the Macao government and pending their approval, we hope to begin tunnel work in the very near future.</p>
          <p>Point three, development of integrated resort locations new to Las Vegas Sands. We're committed to identifying and executing on new development opportunities in Asia. We have teams working every day in these locations to pursue this strong in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Travelling behind a little bit is Taiwan, which will take a much longer time and we still don't have a partner at a lot of those sites. We're also been investigating opportunities actually around the globe, including in Europe, North America and South America.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, we acknowledged the government of Madrid that we've selected the City of Madrid as a new Las Vegas Sands developmental location as opposed to choosing Barcelona. As I've said on numerous occasions before, we will only consider projects with returns in excess of 20%. As the company's largest shareholder, I have a vested interest in going after only the highest valued projects that would maximize shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Point four, return of capital to shareholders to growing annual dividends. It gives me great pleasure to announce that our Board of Directors has approved an increase of our recurring quarterly dividend in 2013 by 40% to $0.35 per share per quarter or $1.40 per year.</p>
          <p>Let me add that we have every intention of increasing the dividend in the years ahead as our business and cash flows continue to grow. I can only say one thing about that, "Go Dividend."</p>
          <p>Lastly, I wanted to point out an answer to the company's great value that people in the community may not have been focusing on all the time, our retail mall business.</p>
          <p>We generated over $100 million in revenue at an 84% margin. In this quarter alone, that's a 16.9% increase over the results from a year ago. We believe that our retail assets are among the most valuable in the world and, <mark type="ph" /> at cap rates for similar assets in Asia (13:24), could easily approach between $9 billion to $10 billion in value and that's not including additional retail, we're going to put in in Lot 3, more retail than we put in Cotai Central. And as I said in my previous call, that we're approaching the government to turn the tropical garden into the Tropical Garden Mall. Our designs indicate a potential of $800,000. So that's a trigger that we could pull at any time to fill our coffers, and an important part of our fundamental business strategy. With these proceeds, we <mark type="ph" /> could easily wipe out all that debt (14:13), easily, without building any more retail than what we have today.</p>
          <p>In closing, our financial strength and <mark type="ph" /> expanding (14:22) cash flow are evident in our results. As we have said in the past, our cash flows and balance sheet strength will allow us to both increase our return of cash to shareholders, and retain ample liquidity to invest in future growth opportunities, both in our current markets and in other emerging jurisdictions around the world. With our strategic position and a strong experienced leadership team we have in place to execute our strategy, I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of the company. I hope I made my point with emphasizing our four components of future growth but let me be crystal clear, we will always be a growth company. Now for Mike &#x2013; let me turn the call over to Mike for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon. In the interest of time, I'll take a few minutes to add some specific additional color on our developments, the situation in Singapore, Las Vegas and Bethlehem markets. Rob will cover Macao, and Ken will cover the earnings and balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about a little more details about our development strategies and where we are, as we continue to fill the pipeline with promising development opportunities around the globe. The Parisian Macao, the structure has been submitted to the Macao government, the designs are practically finished and we're ready to go just awaiting government approval. As soon as government approval comes, we will put piles in the ground and begin the construction period which will last a little bit more than 30 months, and hope to be opened in that property by the end of 2015.</p>
          <p>We will also reveal to the public all the designs and the plans when government approval comes. In Asia outside of Macao, in Japan, we are awaiting legislation, which is supposed to be submitted in April to the Diet. After that, there will be an approval process for a year or maybe two as it goes through the Japanese procedures. We're looking at sites in both Osaka and Tokyo and we continue that investigation and have people hired on the ground working on our behalf. In Korea, we have met with government officials at the federal government level, as well as the city levels in Seoul and Busan, Korea where we're interested in attractive sites for our business. I want to emphasize in Korea that we have non-negotiated tax rates, that it's also a must that we have some kind of local play available to us in order to pursue our Korean activities and we expect to have a situation where we have presented a Singapore type of restriction on local play, so that we can in fact get into the Korean market.</p>
          <p>Vietnam, we have looked at numerous sites in Vietnam. We continue to work with the government there. Our eyes are on Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Progress is being made. However, there's a longer way to go there at the present time than in the other areas.</p>
          <p>We've also been on the ground in Taiwan. We are not interested in islands offshore. We're interested in the mainland in Taiwan. We haven't made much progress there, but there is some interest going forward.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our operation in Madrid for the Euro Vegas Strip continues. We continue to meet with the government. There continues to be activity in the area of grants and incentives, in the areas of the tender for land acquisition as well as the financing. We are expected by the government to present our plans in some detail in early January, and at that time we will also have more information on what the legislation is that will be passed in our favor.</p>
          <p>In North America, we are working with the Ontario Gaming Commission as far as a potential downtown site in Toronto. We have decided on the location. There are lots of things in the way at this point, including the approval of the Toronto City Council. We don't know where that project is going to go at the moment, but we're ready to pursue it as soon as the project is released and our conditions are met. As Sheldon mentioned, the return on our investment is critical, particularly in the North American locations. At the present time, there's lots of talk in New York, particularly in Queens. Rob Goldstein and I have had numerous meetings in that market already. And we are continuing this week &#x2013; I'm sorry, next week to go back to see if that &#x2013; we can pursue an opportunity in that particular area. Once again, subject to tax rates, subject to all of the other conditions that would make our product successful.</p>
          <p>In South America, we have had people on the ground in Brazil, both S&#xE3;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, looking at opportunities there, and we have started initial investigations in Argentina. So we're very busy. We have a full development department working in these areas and we expect that over the next year or two many of these situations will come to fruition, either fit our model or will not. Once again I should emphasize as Sheldon said, if it doesn't meet &#x2013; any of these don't meet our return hurdles, we certainly will not pursue them.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Singapore for a moment. After an unusually rapid ramp-up period, our VIP volumes and mass table business have now been stable for all of the last four quarters. VIP volumes have been between $11 billion at the low and $13 billion at the high in the roll in each of the last four quarters. Mass table revenue has also been steady at between $260 million and $280 million over the last five quarters. Slot revenue has decreased by 8% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year because of a decrease in local play. This concerns us and we are putting strategies in place &#x2013; you'll hear some of this from Rob &#x2013; in terms of how we can replace that business with additional business that we're after. The hotel room and MICE businesses have performed exceptionally and are operating at near capacity. There is rarely an empty room in the Marina Bay Sands these days. Retail has also grown meaningfully and we are in the process of developing additional dining and entertainment offerings in our mall.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our greatest opportunity for growth lies in attracting new premium mass and VIP customers from outside Singapore. These visitors from around the region, including from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Mainland China, Hong Kong, as well as Japan and Korea, will provide the growth.</p>
          <p>In Las Vegas, our business has been stable. We held very well this quarter and the bright spot in Las Vegas continues to be strong growth in play from Asian visitors to Las Vegas, and we have the air capacity to continue that business. We had some group cancellations since last quarter but the volume of group bookings for 2013 looks quite a bit stronger.</p>
          <p>Sands Bethlehem, a simple comment there, continues to grow effectively and we're quite pleased with Sands Bethlehem. As a matter of fact, during the recent storms, Sands Bethlehem's electronic capability was still on board because of the generators that we had in place, and we actually sold out in the hotel 'til the last four nights, and were one of the few places in Bethlehem that had power.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Ken, I want to give a special thanks to Ed Tracy and his team at Sands China. In the last few months, we have opened 4,000 rooms, three hotels, two casinos, numerous food and beverage and retail facilities and meeting facilities in a situation where up employment is full. Macao runs a 2% employment rate and I want to commend those people for the great job they've done in getting us to-date. Plenty of growth to come, but the openings have been superb.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ken who will take you through some of the financial situations. We look forward to your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Revenue expanded 12.5% despite low hold in Singapore. Hold-adjusted property EBITDA was $950.7 million, down a little less than 1% compared to the quarter last year. Our strong growth in Macao was offset by a smaller contribution in the VIP business in Singapore compared to last year. Our hold-adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% remains healthy and reflects our higher market share in Macao of lower margin VIP business. We expect hold-adjusted EBITDA margin to expand as our mix of mass and non-gaming revenues in Macao grows with the ramp-up of Sands Cotai Central.</p>
          <p>Hold-adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.53, down $0.06 from last year's third quarter. The decrease in earnings per share was driven by increased depreciation and amortization expense related to the opening of Sands Cotai Central, higher minority interest, and increased share count. Lower EBITDA had a $0.01 unfavorable impact, but was entirely offset by the favorable impact of lower interest expense, income taxes, and other items.</p>
          <p>Our cash balance at September 30 was $3.75 billion. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA was also $3.75 billion and our net debt is approximately $5.7 billion. Our debt outstanding is both long-dated and cost effective, with only approximately $100 million coming due in the remainder of 2012 and 2013 and at an average borrowing rate of approximately 2.9% this quarter. Our net debt-to-EBITDA on a consolidated basis is approximately 1.5 times. This is a very comfortable position for us and supports the decision to increase our recurring dividend by 40% for 2013 while retaining ample resources and liquidity to pursue future growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we would be very comfortable with a net leverage ratio of up to 3 to 3.5 times if we were fortunate enough to have several integrated resort projects in development simultaneously. As those projects come online and begin to generate cash flow, the ratio would naturally decrease. So again, our strong balance sheet gives us tremendous financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We maintain the flexibility to utilize additional strategies to enhance shareholder returns in the future. The Board focused principally on increasing the recurring dividend at the last meeting. Share buybacks and special dividends will continue to be on the potential list of future alternatives but will be weighed against the requirements for future investments in growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ken. In Macao, we're generating exceptional growth momentum in every gaming segment, mass table, slot, ATGs, as well as VIP. We're earning $8,700 per table per day versus $6,900 in last year's numbers in the mass table segment. The additional hotel inventory of 1,800 Sheraton rooms came online in September. An additional 2,000 rooms will come onboard early next year, and they should boost our growth as well. Slot and ETG volume was up 29.4% this quarter. Rolling volume was up 45.5%, while total VIP market in Macao was flat.</p>
          <p>Our mass table revenue including same-style ETGs increased 48% plus to reach a record $669 million and that represents a market share of 26.4% in the most important segment in the Macao market from our perspective. If you look at mass table, slot and ETG win, together, we're winning $8.5 million a day in the third quarter across our property portfolio which is up about 35% from a year ago. We are the market leader in mass win per day.</p>
          <p>So looking ahead, we expect the lion's share of market share growth to occur in Cotai, with the majority of the market's sleeping rooms, shopping, dining, entertainment amenities are located. We should be a primary beneficiary of that growth. The ramp at Sands Cotai Central is visible in our results today. Our mass table win &#x2013; our mass win per day increased 15% in this quarter compared with the April to June 30 period. Our rolling volume per day increased 13% in the September quarter, compared to the June quarter. Our hotel occupancy is also strong during the quarter and has continued to ramp during the current fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Operator, may we have the first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we're ready to start the Q&amp;A session now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Mark Strawn from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Rob, you mentioned some initiatives you're undertaking in both Macao and Singapore to re-accelerate same-store growth in those markets. With same store growth in Macao flattish and turning negative in Singapore over the last two Q's, where do you see that those kind of same-store growth rates can go over the next couple quarters? And what are the real key initiatives you're putting in place that will drive those levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, Mark, like I said, our strength is in Macao. If you look at the portfolio now as opposed to individual properties, the way I view this market for us &#x2013; the portfolio market versus Four Seasons versus Venetian versus Cotai, I think what happened here is, as you know, the mass revenues are booming in Macao. Think about $8.5 million a day, 45% margin business is pretty extraordinary. I think we'll continue to accelerate for the simple reason of capacity, hotel sleeping rooms, the retail and once that bridge is completed in December, I think we end up with a 9,000 room hotel in Cotai. I can't imagine &#x2013; we're not going to do a whole lot more than continuing what we're doing now which is fill the hotel rooms, fill the retail and watch the market share increase. I think David Sisk has to be singled out for what he's done in the junket segment, we were, as you know, a few short years ago non-competitive in that segment and now we're very comfortable in going with that. But the real story in Macao as everyone's aware of is the mass table side, the mass &#x2013; in ETGs and slots. We see ourselves growing, gaining more share by the quarter <mark type="ph" /> and couldn't be more pleased we're heading there (28:54). Our same-store sales, I'd rather speak to same-portfolio sales. I think they're going to be double-digits from our perspective on the mass side.</p>
          <p>Singapore is a different story. As you know, we are flat and the VIP segment in the last four quarters. We had an exceptional year-on-year quarter this time last year. That business is no longer there.</p>
          <p>VIP is a challenge today versus &#x2013; on the growth story because we've seen ourselves softening up. We have increased our event side significantly starting this quarter. We're seeing a very, very strong event last week and again this week. We're doing more special events at the high end targeting the rolling customer. The obvious challenge here as you can see from the numbers is on the mass slot and table side. Singapore's been a growth story at 4.2%. Well, it started at 2.3% a day. It went as high as 4.5% a day since we opened. That is a challenge. I think Mike and Sheldon both referenced, we have a very different approach there and that's going to be targeting premium mass customers, not rolling customers, but $10,000, $20,000 customers from Jakarta, KL, Bangkok, Tokyo, Seoul, et cetera. We're putting a team on the ground, incentives on the ground to try to drive more of that premium mass customer into Singapore, more tourist-driven and we think it's going to be very successful. We have started that a few months ago. We're looking to put a lot of boots on the ground and our belief is that's the growth in Singapore in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's helpful. One follow-up on Macao. Any update on when you think you'll get the additional tables at Cotai Central and if and when you get those, do you plan to move tables back to the existing properties there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike just came back and he believes January is the right date for the additional tables on Cotai. What we continue to do and I think Ed and Dave and that team is &#x2013; every day is examining the highest yield per table, be it Cotai or Venetian. We have a good problem. We have a lot of business over there and even downtown, even on the old Sands continues to do some pretty good numbers. So our goal is to maximize yield per table, property per table, <mark type="ph" /> gross up (31:07) the hotel it's in. And as you see Cotai ramping up our dilemma. It's a wonderful dilemma, can we get to $10 million, $11 million, $12 million a day of table ETG wins? And so our goal is not to identify a property but whatever, wherever that table performs best is where it will go.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. Just one follow-up question on Singapore. How much of the declines in rolling chip volume in Singapore would you say is intentional or by design? Just as a proactive way of maybe managing credit risk and being careful with expansion of credit versus it being more of a demand-related issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, unfortunately &#x2013; or fortunately, depending on your perspective, we're not managing it to go down. We're trying to manage it up. And we just &#x2013; the demand on the back end &#x2013; it's consumer demand was softer. It has been in the $11 billion to $12 billion per quarter range. I'd love to see it go back to $16 billion. Obviously, we're managing our reserve more aggressively, looking at aging of our accounts, but it wasn't by design that the demand was soft. It was by customer demand or lack thereof. So we'd love to go there back to a $15 billion &#x2013; our goal is to get back to a $15 billion, $16 billion roll quarters and collect the money as well, but it wasn't &#x2013; it was consumer demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you look back at the third quarter by month and maybe what you've seen so far in the 4Q, would you say that year-over-year trend that's negative on a year-over-year basis, that it's stabilized? Or has it bottomed, are you seeing any degree of improvement or stabilization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's stayed pretty flat. I mean, if you look at Q2 of 2012, we did $11.5 billion, $11.8 billion this time. We had that exceptional third quarter 2011 at $16.7 billion, but unfortunately or fortunately depends on your perspective, Singapore looks like a $45 to $50 billion annualized gold market at this time. I mentioned earlier we want to be much more aggressive on the event side, doing some very strong special events to drive that. But the margin counts as well. We don't fear the credit side. We just would like to see more demand in the right kinds of customers. So our bigger challenge, very candidly, is going to be to make sure that premium mass growth returns again. That's the margin 65% plus we'd like to get back to and that's the segment we're really focusing on as far as we think there's short-term appreciation hope.</p>

          <p>This is Sheldon, Joe. What I want to say is that the VIP market out of China is reputedly slowing down in Macao, although we're not experiencing that, but again we have a pretty big footprint in Macao. I think the same thing is happening in Singapore, that the Chinese are adverse to uncertainty. They don't know what's going to happen when the new  government comes in either this month or next month, but before the end of the year. And so their issue of uncertainty will be resolved if people go back to their normal habits. I for one, having discussed this with the Chinese people and behavior, everybody said &#x2013; everybody I talked to &#x2013; said the same thing; they lie low when there's uncertainty and they become more high-profile when the uncertainty is lifted. And the uncertainty &#x2013; the only uncertainty that people can look at is from their own internal viewpoints in the BRC, how is the new government going to treat Sands? And once those issues are moved into the certain column, I think we'll see a lot more VIP business coming back.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Sheldon. Sheldon, the last few conference calls you've spoken more and more about retail mall profitability and we've seen some improving trends there. What are your thoughts on &#x2013; I guess this would relate more to Macao, what are your current thoughts on monetizing that, whether selling part of it or spinning out part of it via an equity spin. How do you look at monetizing, because you do look at these very low cap rates. And you're probably not getting that equity value currently and if you were to monetize it, you certainly could demonstrate those low cap rates out there. That's all for me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I look at this, Joe, I do. The &#x2013; it's a very grueling, enticing and stimulating matter. I mean, I've been saying that our business model is unlike any other business model in any portion of the hospitality retail business ever. We build these non-core assets, we sell them, we've paid for the entire cost. We've got about $9 billion to $10 billion today. And I'm not going to sell Macao until we finish the bridge which is next month, in December, and we let in the cross traffic. It's a unique bridge. It's not like the bridges in Las Vegas where they're outdoors. They're exposed to the weather. This is fully covered, fully enclosed, fully air conditioned, and fully equipped with people movers, moving sidewalks. People in markets saying they're just going to go up just for the experience of going over the bridge on the moving sidewalks. So we'll see how that impacts. If it does impact it well, I think we could probably reach another billion or maybe more.</p>
          <p>But we're looking at whether or not we should turn that over now or we &#x2013; I mean, in terms of monetizing it, or we should wait until we get the approval for the Tropical Mall and we put the &#x2013; the new retail in Lot 3. So we're still in the midst of that in any event. This is a good turn. There's a good cap rate. Remember the time there wasn't a good cap rate. And we just have &#x2013; we haven't focused on that so much because from my standpoint, I focus on a dominant strategy, and so I came up there planning to do the 800,000 square foot mall. That will add a couple more billion dollars. So it won't work if you're just keeping development. So all we know is that that money is out there to be gotten without any interest. So it feels very good <mark type="ph" /> to have that friction (38:13).</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>We also have 26 more stores opening in the Four Seasons, 43 more stores opening and five in Cotai Central, and as Sheldon said, the potential of an 800,000 square foot, 300 store mall next to the Sheraton on the Tropical Garden space. So there's a lot more retail to mature for us to essentially maximize that retail facility. And at the 23 new stores in the Venetian will open &#x2013; in the Four Seasons will open in November of this year, actually next month.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the ramp-up at Cotai Central. It looks like obviously from the market share statistics that some of us see that the debut so far since September 20 has been &#x2013; it looks like it's starting to be a little bit more successful. Rob, could you give us a little bit of your thoughts in terms of how you guys are beginning to utilize some of the hotel rooms, how you feel about the gaming side? Is it mass or is it VIP that you're attracting into Phase 2? And then lastly, what you think about margins at that property because they were down a little bit sequentially, but I imagine they can be a lot higher over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess from the way I look at the properties, first of all, we're very happy with the junket segment. I couldn't be happy with what's happened on the junket side. The team there is &#x2013; that segment is doing very, very well and we &#x2013; to be blunt about it, we're surprised just how well it does, so quickly out of the box. We have growth against our weakest performer right now on the mass table side, and part of the reason why the Venetian is so damn strong. And so is of course The Four Seasons, although much smaller offering at tables. But I think our growth potential both from a margin and EBITDA perspective, M&amp;As from the ramp means more hotel rooms. The retail gets opened. As we get up to $10,000 &#x2013; our goal is $10,000 win per table like the Venetian did this quarter. When we get there, you're going to see the Sands Cotai Central &#x2013; I believe it deals with mass product, growth in that market. What they've done in the junket segment surprised me, how well it's doing. So if they get the mass table win up to $10,000 a day and get all the ETGs pumped up, that's where the growth opportunities are for the Sands Cotai Central to start pushing up against the Venetian in 2013 and 2014. The marginal move with the mass, let's be honest, 10%-11% junket segment is still challenging on the margin side. The ETGs in that building along with the slot, it had a slow start. It's all coming together and as we get the mass, the premium mass side cranking, and we get all the rooms open in early first quarter of next year and that bridge gets complete, I don't think there's any reason to doubt that this property should be a billion-dollar property down the road. So why are we confident? It's the right property for the market in Macao today. Lots of sleeping rooms, lots of retail, lots of food, a great gaming floor. I feel &#x2013; while we always feel confident that Sands Cotai Central would rival Venetian once it's fully operational.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really helpful, Rob. And then, I guess, secondarily, I'd just like to ask a little bit about the dividend announcement. So we've obviously gotten very good feedback and it looks like depending upon where the stock opens tomorrow, you'll be right around a 3% yield. Ken, could you talk a little bit about just what you'd be comfortable with in terms of a payout ratio over time, and just kind of any additional color on how much we could think about potentially increasing that? Would possible double-digit percentage increases be on the table in the future? That'd be helpful for investors. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A little bit of a loaded question there. I appreciate that. So I think, what I can tell you is when we went to the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. And so when we went through the deliberations on the dividend, we were really trying to focus in on kind of right-sizing the dividend and getting it to around a 3% yield, which is what you articulated. And that's really where the lion's share of the discussion focused in on. I think depending on what conditions are going forward, our focus is obviously on increasing that over time. So as to what the percentage of the increase is, it really is a function of what we feel is the right-sized dividend at that point in time that decision's made. But that's the way we look at it, more so than really on a payout ratio because we've also got to take into account kind of what the horizon looks like from investments and future growth. And so we have to factor that in and make sure we're in a balanced situation. But for right now, the right size of the dividend, we felt, was at 3% and that's where we generated the increase of 40% to get to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Rob, you guys have given us a lot of detail and we really appreciate that. And clearly, the quarter was affected by hold and even adjusting for that with the provision in Singapore, you did come in a little bit below our property EBITDA forecast. So I'm just wondering on a hold-adjusted basis, were there any properties &#x2013; you talked about Sands Cotai, what's going on there, but were there any other properties where you might have expected to see better flow through?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, looking at the Sands Cotai numbers are good, but they can be better. Again, the margins are hurting a bit due to the premium mass, a lack of premium mass. But I think Venetian did very, very well. The Four Seasons, it's a junket-driven property. So it's always got that challenge. But no, I think the Sands Downtown was great. Obviously, the large reserve in MBS hurt us, but that's just a reference of aging in some of the accounts. But overall, I think it's all there to see. We laid it all out for you so I can't add much color to that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Yeah, that's correct. I've just been trying to figure out where the disparity was with our numbers. And then is it &#x2013; Sheldon, is it a little too early regarding the Parisian to talk about the incremental number of tables you think you might get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can only hope what the government has said publicly. No, I don't want to start this off by saying publicly. We've asked for the minimum that we think we need to open 20%. I see other people getting more. The government has said &#x2013; that they've indicated publicly, that they will get more tables to the people, who are building more non-gaming. They're not going to allow the total space to &#x2013; the matrix to come down to 25% casino and 75% non-gaming.</p>
          <p>They want it down to 10% or less, which means that the guys who are going to build a casino and hotel and a couple of restaurants, they're not going to get many tables. They only have like 2,000 tables to give out. I don't think it would be surprising for them to say the guys who build 25% or more casino will get the same number of tables that people who build 10% or less. Our business model says that we build &#x2013; actually, we have the largest casino in the world in the Venetian Macao and it's only 4.5% of the total amount of space. And all of our plans for all of the lots on the Cotai Strip would have amounted to, if we were able to build them all, 2.5% of total. So we're setting &#x2013; we're setting the precedent to build. So in our case, I'm pretty sure that if the government follows what it said publicly, that we'll get at least the number of tables that we ask for.</p>
          <p>I've since increased that because publically I've increased it at 500 but we could live with 450. Because the other guy's saying, their chances are they want 600 and NPL, another says they want 500 but they're not going to build the entertainment, the shopping, the MICE space in particular. And as you know, we're focused a lot on MICE space. So, they want people that are going to give the tables to the people, they say, that are contributing more to the leisure, the business travel objectives.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a simple one. Jon, the way we view this is we're in a different place than anybody else because we have three distinct segments. We've got super premium which tables winning $20,000 plus a day, probably that's less than 5% portfolio, 15% would probably be devoted to what I'll call premium mass. And the lion's share, the bulk, would be in the pure mass business. But we're in a unique place, let's be frank. We've got more capacity than anybody else by a lot. We've got more sleeping rooms, more retail, more food. So the idea this is it's probably the single greatest opportunity I've ever seen in any market anywhere. I can see a day when if we're able to do it just by 8.5%, how big does it could get? Depends on obviously, if we're going to grow faster than anybody because we've got the capacity in the sleeping rooms to grow. Our buildings are built for mass, premium mass, super mass. We're very focused on it. We think we've done a terrific job of upping the junket segment, but our focus and our profit margins, obviously, reside in this segment. I think one of the unique things about our buildings is that we can talk to the customers not betting just HK$1,000 a day. We can talk to people betting less.</p>
          <p>We can offer them things no one else can offer. So we've had a multi-faceted strategy to all three segments. But our biggest single opportunity, obviously, is those tables that we can drop minimums down and get that customer. We think ETGs are a very important part of that. How big can it get, Jon? I don't know. I read your reports and I believe you, I can get very, very, very big. And I think you're right, I think the growth opportunities are enormous for us because we're in the sweetest part of the market where the margins are 45%, 48%. I don't &#x2013; I see a day when we can, on the ETG slot side surpass a billion dollars not too far down the road. I think mass tables can be staggering. I really do. I mean, in the market, the mass tables, all of us are dumbstruck about how well it's done, but the biggest beneficiary is this company and that's where our focus is. And how big can it be, I don't know.</p>
          <p>I like to believe you're right, that it can grow double digit for the foreseeable next few years, and we're the biggest beneficiary.</p>

And I do think with the bridge connecting 9,000 keys, all that retail, I don't think $10,000 in a cost portfolio is that ambitious. I think it's is very achievable for us.</p>

It is an extraordinary success story. Look at the Venetian doing $10,000 plus per table per day currently. Where does it go? I don't know. It could be $11,000, $12,000 a day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. A question for Ken. The $1.40 of dividends from LBS, that's a 40% increase in payout, but you've not really made any commitments with &#x2013; on Sands China dividends of $0.58HK for every 6 months. How should we go about thinking about that? How are you sourcing that incremental $0.40 per share payout? Are you taking that from Singapore and if you are, could you help us think about how should we model the tax implications of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. A couple questions in there. The Sands China Board will need to make a determination as far as what the dividend will be coming out of them for 2013 and that decision hasn't been made yet. But I think if you just look at it from a cash flow standpoint, I think the way that, I'm kind of thinking about funding the LBS dividend, which is about $1.2 million, a little bit less than &#x2013; I'm sorry, $1.2 billion. So it's probably close to about $1 billion coming out of Sands China Limited and that would be net of the minority interest piece that would get paid out. So that $1 billion would be flowing up approximately from them. And then the balance would be sourced from either cash from Marina Bay Sands or cash that we have, either in the U.S. restricted group or at the parent level. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about it. No final determination has been made relative to that. And then it's all really any money that we bring up from Sands China Limited or from Marina Bay Sands is very tax-efficient, because we would be offsetting any taxes that would be owed on the repatriation of dividend with foreign tax credits that are generated in our Asian activities. And so for all intents and purposes, that money comes up on a tax-free basis.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, this is Sheldon. Obviously, we're going to have to get some money out of SCL and we've got to share it proportionately. And so we've got to, to the extent that we upstream the amount of money. We just got the okay from the Board the day before yesterday. So we haven't talked to the SCL Board, but obviously we're going to have share the good fortune. And by the way, we're happy about that. We get 70.3% of that.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Could you just discuss the new development opportunities? Maybe Mike, you could speak to, what you're envisioning in New York? And then when you talk about the opportunity in Madrid, I guess I'm intrigued, because you &#x2013; on your slide, you go through six steps that you're looking for, but the bottom one is that you need to see some changes in the economic conditions and that &#x2013; that almost seems secondary now, when I'm looking at the slide versus just a few months ago when that seemed to be more paramount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Steve, the economic conditions really during the course of this &#x2013; the meetings with the Spanish government, and the course of our meetings here, if something would have deteriorated significantly in terms of the euro, what have you, that's just the caveat that we're watching that. This is a process that will go on for a number of months as we go through the process of legislations, final site selection, a tender, land acquisition, et cetera. But if something turns dramatically negative in the short term, that's simply something that we would look at and we'd want anybody to know that we'd be making a judgment on that basis. So I think that's on the chart, just to keep aware that something could happen. We feel good about looking at the investment at the present time and looking at the future and basically if all things come in order, they could all come in order. But if something dramatic happens in the economic environment that causes us real concern, we'd just &#x2013; we'd very much hesitate to go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if Spain stays the way it is right now, then you would go forward from an economic perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if everything else worked according to our plan, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to understand that one of the biggest triggers in the entire matrix is the fact that we build a sensitivity analysis. I don't want to say this publicly, but our gaming tax rate &#x2013; it's well known over there &#x2013; is going to be significantly lower. So we can make significant adjustments to end up with our EBITDA percentage by the tax rate. We make a 33% EBITDA rate in Macao with the tax rate and forward. We make 50% to 55% EBITDA of revenue in Singapore with a much lower tax rate averaging about 15%. We get below that, which I'm confident we will significantly. And we have certain things to achieve there to get below that. Then we no way would earn as much money and by any measure, wins per unit per day of either tables or slots. So we might end up with the same amount of money with only 70% of the amount of business then it would take to do that in either of our other locations. So, you can't compare apples &#x2013; you can't compare apples to apples. They're two different calculations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In New York, basically Steve, we have been having some conversations about Willets Point in Queens. We'd previously looked at Manhattan. Most of the noise we get in Manhattan is that it won't happen. We think there's a potential. There's been some press about Willets Point. We've looked at it, continue to look at it. We're testing that market and talking to the owners of that situation about that kind of development. And once again, that would very much depend upon what kind of arrangements we could make there, as well as what the tax rate would be. And there's lots of rumors and lots of things flying around, but we think that's a viable market and we're under investigation there now.</p>

          <p>All right, sorry, guys. The question was for Rob. You talked a little bit earlier about your mass business, your premium versus your regular mass, and obviously the 45% margins in your regular mass business. Could you guys maybe quantify a little bit the differences between the margins of that premium mass customer and that regular mass customer to the extent that there are any in Singapore and Macao?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Macao, it's not that material, Carlo. If you think about it, it blends at 44%s, up to the high 40%s. I don't think there's a lot of difference. We're not &#x2013; mostly if it's complimentary, it's room comps, it's meals, but the spread is not great. It really isn't. Singapore, I'd say the same. It's pretty consistent, high 60%s, slot, ETG, mass table. The margins grow obviously, the win per table in both markets. The win per tables can &#x2013; we're getting$20,000 per table out of the Venetian. Some periods it may ramp up, but frankly, there's not a whole lot of spread that I can tell.</p>
