          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. And good morning to all of those dialing from the Americas. This is Joachim M&#xFC;ller from Investor Relations. And on behalf of Deutsche Bank, welcome to our second quarter conference call.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying that our Co-CEOs, J&#xFC;rgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, have decided to join this call to give you a firsthand update on our ongoing 100-day strategy review and discuss some of the key themes emerging from that process. To be clear, this is still work in progress. We will give you more detail of the results in September.</p>
          <p>Anshu and J&#xFC;rgen will then hand over to our CFO, Stefan Krause, who will lead you through the Q2 results and take questions relating to those results, as usual.</p>
          <p>Please understand that if you have questions on the longer-term strategy, there will be an opportunity to put all of these in September, so we suggest focusing your questions today on the second quarter results. Please note the cautionary statements with regard to forward-looking statements at the end of our presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over to our Co-CEO, J&#xFC;rgen Fitschen.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:40) Second Quarter Results call. Anshu and I took charge 60 days ago. We are just over halfway through the 100-day strategy review, which we launched on June 1. The process is going extremely well. It has included broad involvement of employees and other stakeholders. At the 100-day mark, on schedule, we'll have significant progress to report to you on many fronts. So today, we are pleased to announce the Investor Day on the 11 of September in Frankfurt to which you are cordially invited.</p>
          <p>As you also know, Anshu and I have a division of labor of the CEO task between us. It's agreed that the CEO dialogue for the analyst and investor community will be led by Anshu. Accordingly, I suggested that Anshu gives you an interim progress report on our strategy review.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to him. Anshu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xFC;rgen.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is our first communication with you since we took charge in June. This is obviously a critical relationship for us and we take our responsibility towards you extremely seriously. For me personally, today marks the first step of a long-term partnership and dialogue with you. J&#xFC;rgen talked about our 100-day strategy progress, which is now just beyond the half-way stage. To be clear, I'll review has focused both on the need for a clear strategic direction and on immediate actions. We've made a lot of progress. Today, out of the many themes you expect us to grapple with, we want to update you on three themes which are the most on our minds, and I dare say on yours as well, and those are: culture, operational efficiency and capital.</p>
          <p>So let me start with the all-important theme of culture. We are aware of the need for a change of culture in the banking industry, especially in investment banking. That debate is intense and entirely justified. Let me be explicit, we recognize a change is imperative. The time for vague promises of culture change in our industry is long gone. We understand that not only you and our investors, but also our clients, regulators, governments and the public want to see change. We don't underestimate the complexity of the task nor the time it will take, but J&#xFC;rgen and I are totally determined to act quickly and decisively.</p>
          <p>In our strategic review so far we have focused on two key levers, the first is compensation. The need for culture change has many dimensions; the need to change the compensation model is the most important of all. We've already reduced compensation significantly over the past few years. Now we need to further address both the absolute level of compensation and the relative balance between rewards for shareholders and those for employees. Our compensation processes need to become less complex and more transparent and compensation must be clearly and visibly aligned to sustainable performance.</p>
          <p>We are confident that our strategy review and our drive for higher operating efficiency will decisively address all of these issues. Let me be clear, we will stay committed to attracting and retaining the best talent. Our clients expect that and so do you. But we firmly believe that the industry as a whole will have to change its compensation model, and we are absolutely committed to being at the forefront of that change.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will continue to emphasize that our practices and our codes of personal conduct must be in line with this bank's long tradition of doing business to the highest standards. Those practices must also be oriented towards sustainable long-term partnerships with our clients, other stakeholders and society at large. Standards are changing, and where we need to make adjustments we won't shy away from doing so. In an organization of over a 100,000 people, can we guarantee that there will not be slippages? Of course not. But we can and we will ensure that the tone at the top is crystal clear, maintain first-class compliance in risk management systems and do our best to root out bad behavior.</p>
          <p>So then let me turn to the issue of costs and operational efficiency. In our strategic review, we've been relentlessly focusing on the cost issue. Put simply, our cost base is too high. As of this interim stage, we have clear visibility on approximately &#x20AC;3 billion of cost savings versus our run rate for the first half of 2012, that is net of investments we will make to support business growth.</p>
          <p>While we go through our strategy review and focus on longer-term initiatives, we have also identified immediate measures we need to take. Our &#x20AC;3 billion target includes contributions from both. Of course, challenges exist. Regulation and legal issues put upward pressure on our cost base. There will also be a substantial cost to achieve these savings. However, we are determined and confident that we can achieve this target.</p>
          <p>We'll make these savings in four ways. First, by making changes to our business and revenue model. Second, by scaling back some of our business ambitions in certain regions and countries. Third, by implementing a reengineering program aimed at achieving world-class operating performance with flexibility, quality and robust controls. And, fourth, by completing the measures in Postbank we've already announced and which will contribute &#x20AC;500 million of savings to the &#x20AC;3 billion total.</p>
          <p>In the past, some of you have expressed skepticism about our delivery of cost reductions, which we are confident we can deliver. In all our most recent major programs, further integration across the Investment Bank, Postbank integration and our complexity reduction program, we are delivering on or ahead of target.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I would also like to announce today some immediate actions which have been in progress for some weeks now. We are proud of our world-leading investment banking platform, but we are continually calibrating the size of our platform to the market environment. Consequently, we are reducing head count by approximately 1,900 people. Of that, 1,500 will come across the investment banking complex and related infrastructure and 400 in other areas. All of these reductions are predominantly outside Germany. These measures will contribute savings of approximately &#x20AC;350 million of the overall &#x20AC;3 billion target on a run rate basis. We're connected to transparency with regard to our cost base and we'll come back to you with more concrete details in September.</p>
          <p>And finally then let me turn to capital. We recognize that you are very focused on the capital issue, for the industry and for Deutsche Bank. Let me start with two statements. First, we have always managed our capital to be comfortably above all regulatory thresholds, even in stress scenarios. Our current capital ratios are well above all regulatory thresholds, and our capital plan will continue to deliver a substantial cushion.</p>
          <p>Second, it is important to look at other measures of stability. Some of you have rightly focused on risk-bearing capacity &#x2013; that is, our capacity to absorb severe stress <mark type="ph" /> loss (8:44) across our portfolio. Here, we're in line with the best in the industry. Stefan will discuss this measure in more detail. Furthermore, just as important to Deutsche Bank's strength and security is the stability and reliability of our liquidity and funding positions, both of which remain top class.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we recognize that strengthening Core Tier 1 capital is a priority. So let me now share with you the immediate steps we're already taking to address this critical issue. First, we remain confident that we can meet our published stimulated guidance of Basel III Core Tier 1 ratios, even in the event that net income projections need to be further adjusted downward due to continued market turbulence.</p>
          <p>In response to lower second quarter performance, we've identified &#x20AC;29 billion of additional risk-weighted asset reductions and capital build measures beyond those we've already committed to and communicated. We've already delivered on some of these, including the exit of certain legacy positions which are capital intensive under Basel III. Therefore, we continue to expect that at the beginning of 2013, our Core Tier 1 ratio, including phase-in, will be approximately 9%. That is equivalent to 7.2% on a fully-loaded basis. Stefan will talk in more detail about this.</p>
          <p>Second, we are working on a complete range of initiatives that will be realized very rapidly over the next year or so. These will enable us to reduce risk and build capital organically. They include managing down legacy positions in both the Investment Bank and Postbank, and taking decisive action on specific sub-performing assets. We're also continuing to roll out advance rating models across the bank, particularly in PBC. Within our capital toolbox, which Stefan will talk about in more detail, we have additional measures, all of which we're looking at very carefully. Crucially, we will implement these initiatives while simultaneously supporting growth in the real economy.</p>
          <p>Taking all these factors into account and even given the possibility of lower performance, we have an ambition of the Basel III Core Tier I ratio of approximately 10% on a phase-in basis, equivalent to at least 8% on a fully-loaded basis by the end of the first quarter 2013. We aim to continue to grow this ratio throughout the rest of the 2013 and beyond, while investing the necessary costs to achieve a cost-reduction program.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me remind you that, like other banks, we're making these statements when rules are still being finalized by legislators and regulatory guidance and implementation is incomplete in many ways. Nevertheless, this is our current reading of what is expected to come and a clear commitment to meaningful further improvements in our capital ratios. At our Investor Day in September, we will provide you with details on our capital roadmap. For today, I would only like to emphasize that there has been no change in our approach. We aim to apply all the capital levers at our disposal before coming to investors to raise the equity.</p>
          <p>So, now let me conclude. Difficult economic conditions in financial markets, increased regulatory oversight and litigation are well-known headwinds for us and the industry. These headwinds don't excuse us from growth, they necessitate a more efficient operating model. Growth is an imperative. We must grow without losing our competitive edge. We must maintain our ability to deliver seamless service to our clients, but we also must grow in a manner that's sustainable and responsible. We aim to strike the right balance to serve all our stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our clients, as well as society.</p>
          <p>We reaffirm our commitment to a universal banking model. We are convinced that this model is best for our clients as we seek to help them grow, manage risks and operate wherever they need to across the globe, and to deliver that integrated service cost-efficiently. As we take stock, J&#xFC;rgen and I recognize what a remarkable platform Deutsche Bank has built over the past two decades.</p>
          <p>We have a unique global network, a very strong brand, leadership positions in most core businesses and deep relationships with clients. We are firmly anchored in the home market, which is Europe's largest and most successful economy. Very few competitors can claim all of that. More importantly, I very much doubt that any new entrant can come close to it in the foreseeable future. That represents an enviable competitive advantage. Our mandate is to steer this unique institution through what will undoubtedly be a difficult time for the industry. We have no illusions. It won't be easy. But we're totally committed to the challenge.</p>
          <p>So let me now hand over to Stefan Krause, who will walk you through our second quarter figures and take questions on those results. I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible in person, hopefully, at our Investor Day in Frankfurt. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Anshu. And also good afternoon or good morning from my side.</p>
          <p>I'll obviously have the task now to walk you through the second quarter results, as usual. And I would like to begin on the third slide.</p>
          <p>It should come as no surprise to you that it was a difficult revenue environment in the second quarter. Whereas, if you remember the first quarter benefited substantially from an improvement in confidence as a result of the <mark type="ph" /> ITRO (14:05), the European sovereign debt crisis again intensified in the second quarter, I guess this is no news to you. Given our strong franchise in Europe, we continued to be negatively impacted. Client risk aversion due to ongoing uncertainty led to lower client activity across most of our major businesses. Our corporate and institutional clients are delaying strategic actions as well as essential hedging and market issuance.</p>
          <p>Our Retail Bank is generally facing lower interest income and lower brokerage-related revenues as clients move towards cash and capital protection-type products. In contrast, the persistently low interest rate environment is a headwind in our Transaction Bank as well, whilst in addition to suppressed asset flows, margins in asset management are pressured by the ongoing mix shift towards cash programs.</p>
          <p>For the group, revenues declined just 6% from the second quarter 2011 despite a meaningful deterioration in client activity levels and in investor confidence over the course of the year. The current environment continues to reside in significantly lower levels of client activity, both on investment banking as well as certain parts of our retail business, and we expect this to continue into the second half of the year. We intend to continue to run low levels of risk in light of this environment and maintain tight reins on expenses while remaining focused on servicing our clients in the best possible way, as Anshu alluded.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide four. The Core Tier 1 ratio continues to increase quarter after quarter despite the market difficulties. At 10.2%, we were well above the EBA required minimum mandated for second quarter end. The tick up in leverage ratio is primarily attributable to rounding. It was virtually unchanged. Also, we continued to run with very high levels of liquidity reserves, more than &#x20AC;200 billion at quarter end. We feel it's prudent to carry such high reserves given the market volatility.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to page five. CB&amp;S EBIT decline is attributable to the lower revenues and CB&amp;S revenues are obviously more correlated with the health and growth prospects of the global economy. So while revenues are down 11% year-over-year, when we take into consideration our reduced risk profile, muted client activity and the overall macroeconomic difficulties, the revenue result is in line with the opportunities presented by the market.</p>
          <p>Our Asset &amp; Wealth Management business was impacted by the sale process and the ongoing industry headwinds. This quarter there is approximately &#x20AC;90 million of non-operational costs booked in Asset &amp; Wealth Management. Beyond this quarter's results, you should know we are committed to Asset &amp; Wealth Management and will manage asset management and wealth management in a more integrated fashion in the future.</p>
          <p>PRC is forging ahead in its integration. The synergies we identified in the Postbank Deutsche Bank integration are beginning to materialize, especially as it relates to our new state-of-the-art banking platform. The change in profitability is primarily attributable to higher costs to achieve related to the integration.</p>
          <p>GTB continues to demonstrate revenue growth across all products and regions. In the second half of 2012 we will enter the final stages of integrating our commercial banking business in the Netherlands. We expect to begin to realize the cost synergies from this integration beginning next year. As I mentioned, total net revenue decreased by 6% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Our brokerage-related revenues are the most elastic to the deterioration in investor confidence. As you can see on our net revenue page on page six, further the low interest rate environment has been a persistent headwind for many of our revenue sources. Effects from currency translation impacted revenues favorable and partly offset the aforementioned revenue reduction.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide seven. Our risk provision profile continues to be favorable. In CIB we saw &#x20AC;159 million of provision largely driven by commercial real estate financings belonging to our portfolio of IAS 39 reclassified assets. Compared to the same quarter last year, this means an increase of &#x20AC;32 million, which is in line with our expectations and thus not indicate a weakening of our corporate portfolio. The increase in CIB in comparison to the same quarter last year was more than offset by lower charges recorded in <mark type="ph" /> peak on (18:50), where provisions reduced by &#x20AC;76 million.</p>
          <p>Postbank contributed a reduction of &#x20AC;75 million compared to the provisioning level in the second quarter last year. However, this is largely attributable to our releases of allowances for acquisitions recorded. And in <mark type="ph" /> peak on (19:10) excluding Postbank, provisions were on the same level as in the second quarter of 2011. Similar to 2011, we may experience a moderate uptick in provisions as we progress into the year. I will also detail our asset quality with respect to our PBC loan book later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses, as you can see on page eight, are up 5% year-over-year. Compensation-related costs were almost unchanged versus the prior year's quarter. Lower performance-related compensation was offset by increased deferred compensation from prior years, higher severance payments and salaries. Non-compensation expenses increased by approximately &#x20AC;400 million, primarily due to the increased litigation-related expenses and higher operational losses, increased IT costs, as well as adverse FX rate movements.</p>
          <p>Move to slide nine. You see that net income for the second quarter 2012 was &#x20AC;661 million compared to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the second quarter 2011. The effective tax rate in the current and prior year's quarter was 31%.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we show our usual capital ratios and risk-weighted assets charts. And you can see that we finished the quarter with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.2% and a Tier 1 ratio of 13.6%. As projected already last year, Deutsche Bank well exceeds the 9% threshold set by the EBA for June of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let's review the capital and risk-weighted asset developments this quarter in more detail. Let's turn to slide 11, where we show both. The Core Tier 1 capital increased by &#x20AC;0.8 billion from &#x20AC;37.0 billion to &#x20AC;37.8 billion. For the quarter, we saw about &#x20AC;600 million capital formations from net income, as I explained, along with offsetting effects of dividend accruals, lower capital deduction items, FX  movements and a one-time Postbank effect as a result of the approval of the domination agreement that we are seeking by their shareholders. On the risk-weighted asset side, the net increase of &#x20AC;4.2 billion was largely due to FX effects partially mitigated by a reduction in credit risk.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to the usual discussion on our business division's result and let's go to page 13. Here you will see the overview of our businesses and their performance, and I would suggest that we move &#x2013; go through this in segment-by-segment, and I'll start with CB&amp;S on page 14. Again, a challenging background &#x2013; backdrop, as Anshu already alluded in his speech, CB&amp;S delivered a solid revenue performance underpinned by the strength of our flow businesses and the ongoing demand for client solution.</p>
          <p>The second quarter saw a continued uncertain macroeconomic environment leading to reduced client activity in many areas. We continue to manage towards low-risk, client-focused business models. In fact, in the first half of the year we've experienced only one negative trading day, and VaR is down 25% year-over-year versus a Sales &amp; Trading revenue decline of only 7%, resulting in a significant uptick in return on VaR, which, in my opinion, shows you that we are maintaining a very impressive return on VaR.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, our expenses continue to be pressured by increased legal and regulatory costs, and in the second quarter of 2012, we saw a significant headwind from FX movements versus the prior-year quarter. CB&amp;S compensation costs were down year-over-year due to the lower head count and lower compensation per head.</p>
          <p>On page 15, we saw the Sales &amp; Trading debt and other products. Our Sales &amp; Trading debt revenues were resilient, down only 7% year-over-year despite a much lower risk profile. In FX, we continued to be the market leader for the second quarter in a row, DB had record client volumes although competitive pressure on margins resulted in slightly lower year-over-year revenue.</p>
          <p>We have now had record FX volumes for three out of the last four quarters. Rates revenues were higher year-over-year due to solid client activity, while Money Market's performance was in line with the prior-year quarter. We are deliberately &#x2013; as you know, deliberately running with lower inventory levels in flow credits due the current market environment, while demand for client solutions has held up relatively well.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to page 16, where we'll show our Sales &amp; Trading equity. Those revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, as you can see, a very good achievement. Our market-leading franchise in Europe means that we are more exposed to the European-centric crisis. Cash equity revenues were up significantly year-over-year despite the lower market activity. Year-to-date, we have grown our cash equities market share across all regions. Our prime brokerage franchise remains strong, driven by increased client balances and higher year-over-year revenues in Asia and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Origination &amp; Advisory had a solid quarter in a period marked by slower activity, as you can see on page 17. We maintained a top-five global rank as well as a solid number one rank in EMEA. On a product basis, we had good relative performance with top-five ranks in four products. Key deals in the quarter included the U.S. Treasury sell-down of its stake in AIG, ABB's &#x20AC;3 billion acquisition of Thomas &amp; Betts, and representing Nestl&#xE9; in the &#x20AC;9 billion acquisition Pfizer's Nutrition business. Our pipeline remains reasonably strong. ECM and M&amp;A are both in line with last year, as deals continue to get pushed and delayed, while LDCM is much stronger. The quality of the pipeline, I can tell you, continues to also be very good.</p>
          <p>On page 18, we turn to over GTB businesses. Business will continue to benefit from the strong business momentum, with broad-based strength across all major products. Revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to &#x20AC;970 million. Despite the deteriorating economic outlook, trade finance demand remain strong and we continue to increase customer volume, especially in Europe and Asia, where we benefit from our brand and quality product offerings. Trust and security services also benefited from higher balances and increased fee income, especially in the corporate trust and alternative funds business in the U.S. and U.K.</p>
          <p>Cash management on the corporate as well as the financial institution side is a beneficiary from the flight to quality trends, resulting in higher deposit volumes. Provisions for credit losses were up 54% year-over-year to &#x20AC;47 million. These were mainly related to the loan portfolio acquired in the Netherlands. Overall, after an outstanding first quarter, GTB showed another solid performance despite the higher LLPs and costs related to the business activity and integration.</p>
          <p>On page 19, you'll see the development of the Asset and Wealth Management business that obviously has had a very difficult quarter. The asset gathering industry, as you know, continues to be pressured on several fronts: increased regulation, changing industry dynamics between producer and distributor, and general negative investor sentiment. For DB specifically, Asset Management is obviously suffering from the uncertainty caused by the strategic review of the Global Asset Management division initiated in November of 2011.</p>
          <p>Over the last few years, we've developed a very capable M&amp;A team that has closed over 60 transactions in the last 30 months, so we also worked very hard to complete this transaction, but we were unable to agree on acceptable terms for the sale. And it was never our intention to sell at a business at any price, only if it realized a true value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to the future, we are committed to our Asset and Wealth Management business. The two business divisions now have a single management structure, a single executive committee, and are working together as a unit. Our franchise is still intact, and we are in the process developing an integrated business plan for the division that will be part, obviously, of our strategic announcement.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page 20. I go now into Asset Management. That was clearly impacted by the sale process. However, the market environment for Asset Management has also been extremely difficult and is a primary driver of this quarter's poor performance. The confluence of a pessimistic economic outlook, market volatility and generally downward trending indices <mark type="ph" /> helped cause (28:20) investor confidence in both equity and bond capabilities to suffer. The continued mix shift towards passive strategies and increase in the <mark type="ph" /> all for (28:20) cash products is pressuring revenue margin.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense would have improved year-over-year, if not for charges related to the strategic review. The majority of the &#x20AC;50 million we identify this quarter relates to increased legal and consulting costs. The second half of this year, we expect some additional expenses related to the strategic review.</p>
          <p>The inability to pitch for new business during the transaction process obviously magnifies the net new asset outflows. This quarter, approximately &#x20AC;3 billion of the &#x20AC;6 billion outflow was from cash product.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to Private Wealth Management. Actually, Private Wealth Management had a quite a mixed performance this quarter. Obviously, we're disappointed with the profitability level. But weaker revenues were primarily attributable to the non-recurrence of positive realignment changes booked in the second quarter of the previous year related to Sal. Oppenheim. These effects offset the positive business momentum, particularly in APAC and the Americas. Non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by about &#x20AC;40 million of specific items relating to litigation and business taxes.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, the business attracted over &#x20AC;6 billion of fresh inflows this quarter, bringing the first-half year results total to just over &#x20AC;8 billion, or a 6% growth rate of the year and invested asset base. The asset base increased in the first half of the year to &#x20AC;284 billion, with the majority of the increase driven by the flows and the positive <mark type="ph" /> ForEx (30:07) offsetting the negative market effects.</p>
          <p>Our lending initiative continues to gain traction, increasing 21% year-over-year to &#x20AC;33 billion. The loan book growth should generate good levers of future profitability.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on our Retail Business. Let's start on page 22. PBC continues to show a resilient performance despite market headwinds, with low interest rates and muted client investment activity. The deposit base developed solidly, particularly <mark type="ph" /> site (30:27) deposits, which increased by 13% compared to previous year's quarter.</p>
          <p>The loan book continues to grow. German mortgages increased by more than 5% in the past 12 months, and the second quarter was one of the best quarters in the mortgage production. I guess we all Germans are running into buying homes for not knowing where to put our money.</p>
          <p>In Advisory Banking, Germany with an increase of 180% compared to the previous year's quarter, we had very good result. The reported pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;398 million is down 13% versus the second quarter of 2011 on a reported basis. The decrease in profitability is primarily attributable to the Consumer Banking Germany business unit, where the pre-tax profit fell from &#x20AC;229 million in the second quarter of 2011 to &#x20AC;165 million in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>There are two effects to take note of here. Firstly, this quarter we recorded lower results from the sell-down of assets in the non-customer Postbank book, while in earlier quarters we realized benefits from the accelerated amortization of the PPA. Secondly, the asset sell-down is resulting in excess liquidity, as you can imagine, which is currently invested in low-yielding assets, pressuring interest income. The core business of Consumer Banking Germany is performing very well, by the way.</p>
          <p>Advisory Banking Germany and Advisory Banking International pre-tax profits were flat versus the prior-year quarter. In Advisory Banking Germany, the balance sheet business, especially mortgages, continues to grow, and LLPs are trending downward, which partially offsets the continued drag from lower brokerage revenues.</p>
          <p>In Advisory Banking International, we have been successfully repricing the loan book. However, deposit margins continue to be under pressure.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are pleased to announce this quarter saw the first rollout of our state-of-the-art Retail Banking platform. We've migrated the first 5 million saving accounts on to the new system. The new IT platform will drive the delivery of approximately 70% of the synergies we expect from the Postbank integration.</p>
          <p>So finally, to what you've been waiting all the time, some few key current topics. Let me start on page 24, that I know is your favorite chart. As you already know from our ad-hoc, we continue to see our Basel III simulation at 7.2% for 1 January 2013 fully loaded, unchanged from our simulation communicated last quarter. So let me walk you through this, our newest and latest version.</p>
          <p>First, we still conservatively include the &#x20AC;12 billion risk-weighted assets growth item introduced in our simulation in the first quarter of 2011, as you may recall. Then we show &#x20AC;119 billion in relation to Basel III. The increase of &#x20AC;14 billion compared to last quarter's simulation is purely technical, with no net impact on the Basel III Tier One ratios. You will note a correspondingly lower risk-weighted asset impact shown under application of 2019 rules. And there are also, not so visible, further entries on the capital side.</p>
          <p>All said, we believe this better reflects how the 10% to 15% rule under Basel III will be applied. However, important for you, there is no net impact on the Basel III Ratio with phase-in nor the fully loaded ratio. It is a pure presentation matter. If you would have further presentations, we can walk you through or I can walk you through this after the call.</p>
          <p>What is new is the inclusion of a set of additional management actions. We currently execute the compensate for the lower net income projection for the second half of this year as well as the second quarter net income, which came in below previous market estimates. As of today, we had already executed about 20% of this additional management action. Whilst we included some potential cost in our simulations we did, by the way, to-date not incur any measurable costs for what we did so far, and we are selling these assets at our marks.</p>
          <p>All said, our simulated pro forma Core Tier 1 ratio with phase-in is now 8.9% as of January 1, 2013, marginally better than we previously indicated. And on a fully-loaded basis, which means under the 2019 rules, we again arrived at 7.2%, in line with what I indicated to you in April. Let me remind you that this simulation does not consider all of our management actions nor our full management action potential, but only what we do directly in relation to Basel III or in the context of the initial additional &#x20AC;29 billion of management action we have now triggered given the net income development.</p>
          <p>We understand that market participants generally look at Basel III Core Tier 1 on this fully-loaded basis and we will continue to provide updates accordingly despite our misgivings around comparability from bank to bank. Please keep in mind that there is a high degree of interpretation required to calculate a fully-loaded view. There remains a lot of uncertainty, as you know, in the final rules that will be written and then applied. However, I want to remind you, from a regulatory view, at no point in time will we ever be anywhere near to reaching our required capital minimums even under stress scenarios. We've had extensive talks with our regulators and are comfortable with the required thresholds for the transition to Basel III.</p>
          <p>When managing capital as it refers to risk, we also look at other KPIs, and particularly, very importantly, the risk-bearing capacity. As defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital available to absorb a severe stress loss across the bank's portfolio, our current mark is just above 200%. It tells you that we have ample room to deal with risk within our capital and I think this is what we should focus on. In fact, our mark shows that our lower risk carrying business model and the higher quality of our asset base allows us the comfort to operate at a lower Core Tier 1 ratio than some of our peers.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to page 25. And let me begin by saying we share your frustration that there has not been an absolute reduction in the reported cost base despite several successful cost initiatives. Looking at our second quarter 2012 versus second quarter 2011 cost development, non-interest expenses increased by approximately &#x20AC;350 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. On a net basis, the increase mainly reflects the impact of the weakening euro on currency translation. Expenses for litigation and regulatory requirements, including related IT spend, increased by approximately &#x20AC;200 million. This was almost completely offset by lower performance-related compensation and net savings from cost containment measures.</p>
          <p>Turning to the half-year comparison, the headwinds are more stark. Performance-related compensation decreased by approximately &#x20AC;900 million. Our savings from prior cost containment measures, such as complexity reduction, have been reinvested into our ongoing PBC integration projects. The only increases in our first half 2012 cost base resides, therefore, from nearly &#x20AC;430 million of additional litigation and regulatory-related IT spend and approximately &#x20AC;600 million of FX translation headwinds. In fact, on an FX-adjusted basis, our cost base has decreased by &#x20AC;300 million versus the first half of 2011. The next slide provides some more detail on our performance-related compensation expenses.</p>
          <p>So turn to page 26. And as you already know, our shift towards higher deferred compensation complies with regulatory requirements and better aligns the shareholder and employee interest. That's the intention. The unintended intention is shown here on this chart. The portion of the compensation accrual that we control in the current period is down 27% year-over-year. But while our overall compensation expenses are flat year-over-year, the negative impact from this amortization of prior-year deferrals masks our effort to reduce cost in the current period.</p>
          <p>As this image demonstrates, our quarter-on-quarter cost flexibility has therefore just implicitly significantly decreased, especially in CB&amp;S. And as Anshu explained, management has taken decisive action in short-term cost reduction measures that have been introduced. In addition, we will carry out an immediate restructuring program in the third quarter to reduce our CB&amp;S and related workforce by approximately 1,900 people. This will begin to bring the cost base more in line with our near-term revenue opportunity.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the summary. As you can see, the results in the second quarter reflect a challenging market environment. Client activity levels in Europe remain very low. We are confident there exists a political resolve to solve Europe's structural issues. However, in the near term we expect activity levels to remain low and the interest income headwinds will persist. As Anshu produced of our strategic thinking, you can trust that the bank is certainly not standing still. We are in the final steps of formulating the strategic agenda that will set our path for the next few years.</p>
          <p>Before I conclude, I would like to make a special statement here as well. As you know from our financial disclosures, Deutsche Bank is one of a number of banks and financial institutions that are subject of various industrywide investigations relating to the interbank offered rates. The bank has received subpoena and requests for information from certain regulators and governmental entities in connection with setting interbank offered rates for various currencies.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Bank continues to cooperate fully with regulators in investigating interbank offered rate matters. The review by the bank is a comprehensive and is being overseen by the management board and the supervisory board. The bank can confirm to-date it has found that potential wrongdoing was limited to the action of a small number of individuals acting on their own initiative who have since been sanctioned. Please understand that due to the ongoing investigation we will not say not say anything further to the LIBOR matters.</p>
          <p>With that, I conclude my remarks and I certainly welcome all your questions now.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question is from Derek De Vries of Bank of America. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I actually have a few questions, but I'll start with some simple ones. The &#x20AC;3 billion cost target, that takes us to a cost base of &#x20AC;24.3 billion. When do we get there? You didn't quantify a time for that. So that's a pretty straightforward one. Also, the big risk-weighted asset run-off that takes place in Q1 2013, can you give us a little bit more detail on that?</p>
          <p>And then, finally, on compensation, I think you're the only European investment bank that doesn't give us the awarded not yet expensed variable comp at the end of each year. But if you make some estimates based on what you do give us, I actually thought the awarded not yet expensed variable comp was down 2011 year-end on 2010. And I realize there is not straight-line accrued.</p>
          <p>But I'm wondering if you can just maybe give me how much has been awarded not expensed as of the second quarter 2012 versus second quarter 2011? Because I have to admit, I was caught out by the 12% increase in the amortization of deferrals. I would have thought that number would have been broadly flat. So, a few questions there for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So thank you for your obviously good and pressing questions. But on the first two I'm going to ask you have a little patience with us for the next couple of weeks. Six weeks we're going be able the detail more about the strategy, as Anshu said. We've made a decision not to provide more disclosure or details other than what you heard on the call because that's going to be the context and the content of the announced Investor Day. So, sorry, but I have to ask you to bear with us for a while.</p>
          <p>On the compensation issue, the award not yet expensed expense in the second quarter 2012 versus the second quarter 2011, where you would have thought that it would have been flat instead of an increase of percent, I'm going to defer that, honestly the &#x2013; it's the view we take on accruals is that, obviously, they have significantly increased over the last couple of years. And the deferred portion, as you know, we were quite aggressive on deferral versus industry in our view has increased. So, I will have to do the math to compare to your numbers to see how you came up with it. But, generally, as we have reported previously, obviously, the amount of deferred compensation has increased and is quite high for Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you're saying is the absolute off balance sheet liability, if you will, so the absolute level of awarded not yet expensed compensation today is higher than it was 12 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it has gone up. Yeah. And I need to see your numbers...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...and actually compare. I didn't do the math. But the expense clearly has gone up because when I look at the deferral ratios that we have applied to the different compensation levels, they were quite significantly higher in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Jeremy Sigee of Barclays. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, actually just quickly a follow on just on what you were just discussing. The percentage deferred of the budget pool went up from 49% to 61% I think in 2011. Do we assume or do you assume a constant 61% deferral proportion in 2012? Is that how you're accruing? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, obvious question, could you comment on the cost to achieve &#x2013; you're flagging a sizable restructuring charge presumably in the second half. Could you comment on that? And, thirdly, I understand you don't want to talk about your future actions, but could you talk about the &#x20AC;29 billion additional management action that you've told is now well underway? What sort of assets are you getting rid as part of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeremy, thanks for the questions. First of all, it was our market view. We took a big leap of deferral last year. I would not see this number to certainly increase our deferral. And I would rather see that we might be a little bit more conservative because our competitive information indicated that we were certainly the bank that was quite aggressive in terms of our deferral ratios, yeah.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; we think that we'll be slightly down, that's what we're currently accruing to. And then we'll see how &#x2013; we usually make this decision based on competitive information that we get. And as you know, we do these decisions towards year-end or at the turn of the year or at the beginning of the new year. But currently the trend would &#x2013; certainly we were maybe a little bit aggressive on that last year.</p>
          <p>So, on the kinds of assets, I'm sorry that I'm also going defer to the strategic review in September. It's part of the package and detailed explanation we'll provide you on our path to get to the numbers that Anshu announced. Obviously, we're aware that you're going to &#x2013; that we're going to generate a lot of questions for all of you with our announcements and, therefore, I know that we &#x2013; I have to ask you for some patience on that.</p>
          <p>We would prefer to give you all the details in September so you can have a comprehensive view because I'm sure your next question after where the &#x20AC;29 billion comes from is going to be how we further move down the path. So please have some understanding.</p>
          <p>And by the way, I've got from the team planned deferral rates were around the 50% mark, so to give you a view that we currently are planning down. But I caveat this by saying this will obviously be year-end decisions based on competitive information we get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the restructuring charge, that's also part of the wait-and-see things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is part of the wait-and-see. But I think on the head count reductions, that, again, I'd like to clarify. You know, as we've said, it's 1,500 in the Investment Bank and 400 in other areas of the bank. And I'm giving you that disclosure so you can kind of apply what your guess what the covenant ratios are going to be. We're going to give you a more detail on the numbers and specifics in September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jon Peace of Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have two quick questions please. Firstly, just to clarify on the restructuring of the Asset Management business, do I understand now that the potential sale is completely off the table so that business is being retained? And would you be able to size potentially any hangover from revenue or cost impact in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on capital adequacy. And I take your point completely that you've always been in excess of minimum capital standards. But we've seen in Switzerland, for example, recently that as the Eurozone environment has deteriorated, the regulators have put pressure on the local banks to improve their loss absorbing capital. I just wondered what you thought, whether you thought the German regulator might take a similar stance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Let me start with the Asset Management sale. We had started one process which was the strategic review of the Asset Management business that we have concluded. Yeah. We have said that, obviously, as you know, we were not able to agree on acceptable terms for our shareholders with potential buyers. And, obviously, we then had also the reorganization of our Asset Management and Wealth Management business and, therefore, we stopped that process.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, all our Asset Management businesses become part of the strategic review that's the review of the entire bank and will be treated equally to any other either opportunity of challenge that we have to address within the context of the next couple of years' strategy and then you will get an update on what is going to be the future of the Asset Management business in September as well.</p>
          <p>But I confirm that the attempt to sell the &#x2013; our mainly North American Asset Management businesses, that that project is concluded and closed and we are kind of finalizing. That's why I alluded to the costs that the division had to carry around it. And, obviously, we have concluded that process. Yeah. But I hesitate to make comments about the future because, again, that we will answer then within September.</p>
          <p>So let's talk about the capital adequacy. Today, honestly, I feel more comfortable in making some of the statements because we have some more clarification as we move along in terms of what expectations are and will be. And I can only reiterate that we feel very comfortable that with phase in of Basal III, assuming the numbers that we've provided to you and assuming what we know requirements will be, we will be at all times comfortably above regulatory minimum. So if we are reacting to more capital needs, clearly, it's not driven by our view that we need it from a regulatory point of view, but it's needed just from a market viewpoint, and from an explanation on how the phase-in targets will be achieved.</p>
          <p>Now obviously in Switzerland, the story is quite different. The increased pressure on capital in Switzerland has something to do with the big impact of these banks on their economy, and therefore, a reaction obviously of the Swiss to protect their economy, to protect their taxpayer, and to protect, obviously, also the Swiss wealth management business that is so core to these banks. And wealth management there normally doesn't carry that high of capital charges, and it's logical that there was some specific adjustments based on these things.</p>
          <p>These things do not apply to Germany or to a bank operating in Germany, so our answer to you is it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. It just doesn't apply.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for further capital ratio increases, Anshu laid out in his speech, I again ask you to bear with us until September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Good afternoon even. Right. Surprise, surprise &#x2013; slide 24. Just a question on the &#x20AC;119 billion of net RWA additions. If I go back to  October 2010 and I think last June, when Anshu gave his presentations on the Investment Bank, you were talking about &#x20AC;90 billion of mitigation.</p>
          <p>Within that &#x20AC;119 billion, what have we got now for a mitigation? In other words, can you give us a clue as to what the gross number is? And then perhaps within that &#x20AC;119 billion, how much of that gross mitigation you hope to have achieved by the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a good question you ask. You know, we've started with &#x20AC;90 billion, and I honestly was prepared to get this question, because we've seen this number increase. And that's, if you remember, in my text, I alluded quite in detail to this change.</p>
          <p>We actually had a step in between, which was our &#x20AC;105 billion number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't remember if you were asking the step between the &#x20AC;90 billion and the &#x20AC;105 billion. But at the end, it has no &#x2013; we've had no real material change in our total Basel III. As regulations clarify, it's timing difference. We were able to move some of the effect into this bucket while we reduced obviously the additional effects. So it's just technically moving components.</p>

          <p>Yeah <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:42) Basel 2.5, which just passed us. So the &#x20AC;105 billion was the number after the Basel 2.5 update that we put in. And obviously, the reduction amount depends on the ultimate rules, and obviously, the same action may give us a bigger or smaller benefit.</p>
          <p>What really matters to us is that we are very comfortable in hitting the net number we have to achieve our ratio, as shown here. And that's the way it is.</p>
          <p>There is significant management action still coming, but you see us being still very comfortable with, because we agreed additional &#x20AC;29 billion of management action that we are very confident to be able to deliver in the near future.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, hi. Thanks for some of the restructuring details. I have two questions. The first one relates to old slides to put in context of what you're announcing now.</p>
          <p>At the CIB Workshop, Anshu indicated a pre-tax ROE of 20% to 25%. Clearly, there's an indication that the world has changed, probably more than at that time expected, which was in 2010. And I'm trying to get an understanding of what does it mean in terms of pre-tax ROE for CB&amp;S going forward? Is something like a 20%, 25% still achievable in the new world with these measures that you're taking?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to your legacy risk-weighted assets that Bill Broeksmit outlined, &#x20AC;70 billion plus is at Postbank. On top, I think, you have another &#x20AC;15 billion left plus C&amp;I. So I get roughly &#x20AC;90 billion of risk-weighted assets that are to rollover, over time.</p>
          <p>And if I look at one of the slides, you outlined &#x20AC;15 billion to &#x20AC;20 billion rollover in 2013. Is that included in your 8% Basel III fully-loaded Tier 1 number? And also how much of the &#x20AC;29 billion is related to those legacy risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I'm going to make Anshu work here for the first time because he made the statement. And then I'm going to take your risk-weighted asset question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Kian, thanks for your question. And again, we will be giving you some fairly detailed guidance on how we expect the ROE to develop across the group overall and across each of the divisions in September.</p>
          <p>But I think it's fair to say that our prospects and our future view on profitability is different today than it was in 2010. There's no doubt that the European crisis has developed closer towards our more grim scenario than our better case scenario over the course of the past two years. And that's the point I made about making the decision to recalibrate our head count.</p>
          <p>So yes, we will guide you lower. Precise details to come in September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then to your second question. Honestly, we still have significant room to free up risk-weighted assets from legacy positions. And yes, a portion of that is in the second half of 2012 actions, as well as in the Q1 2013 actions to get us to the 8%. But it's not just that. And there is obviously more thereafter, as we're going to disclose then later in the September. But of course, for example, part of this &#x20AC;29 billion package is legacy asset-related.</p>
          <p>And in terms of roll-off, of course, some of the roll-off assumptions might be changed because we end earlier. But at the end of the day, we also continued to have a significant roll-off, as we have described previously, at later dates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give us a bit of an idea of roll-off versus sale versus kind of mitigations &#x2013; i.e., model changes or other ways of reducing risk-weighted assets for  better netting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I don't have this number here with me, so I couldn't give you a relationship. But let's &#x2013; we promised to be detailed in September so you'll understand the relationships between the different measures we're taking, and we'll finally shed light into our famous tool box. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Philipp Zieschang from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Three questions if I may. Just coming back to the &#x20AC;3 billion of identified cost savings, you're writing in the release that these include changes to the business and revenue model. So, should I assume the &#x20AC;3 billion are net of potential revenue losses?</p>
          <p>Second question is, again, coming to your capital ratio guidance or simulation timeframe from first quarter, end of first quarter next year, towards the end of next year, do you &#x2013; because you don't talk about full year 2013 &#x2013; would you expect the capital ratio also to benefit from lower deductions, i.e., the amortization of some of your DTAs? I think Credit Suisse lapped around a &#x20AC;3 billion reduction in deductions next year, which are obviously helpful to capital ratios.</p>
          <p>And the third point, coming back to Anshu's opening remarks also on compensation that is at the heart of the current profitability protection. And should we read into that that you will accelerate the amortization of deferred comp for a specific period, in order to get ahead of the curve with respect to cost flexibility? Or would that be rather unlikely, given your necessity to strengthen the capital ratios organically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for your questions. You guys are really relentlessly asking us about the strategic information we'd like to provide in September.</p>
          <p>I need to clarify, the &#x20AC;3 billion are net of revenue growth reinvestments. And obviously, as I told you, more detail will follow in September.</p>
          <p>Then at the end you asked a question about if it is a benefit from lower deductions from DTAs. Yeah, we will also provide you details, but amortization of deferred here follows obviously plan rules and accounting rules, and that's what we put down.</p>
          <p>We estimate that our DTAs will continue to decline organically because obviously we have assumptions that we will be profitable, which we will talk to you about also in September, and &#x2013; but obviously not to the tune of &#x20AC;3 billion, like some of our competitors. Our capital ratio obviously will not benefit from similar technical effects like the re-classes on DTAs that they have shown.</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry, I did answer your question on the deferred comp that each year we have to follow our plan rules and we have to follow accounting guidelines in terms of how we can apply. That's not a discretionary change every year, because otherwise I would get in trouble with our auditors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, if you were to decide to take a larger chunk of the amortization of deferred comp which hasn't been expensed yet, that wouldn't be at your discretion and it needed to follow through the deferred -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, you can change the plan into the future, you can make assumptions into the future that you will change your compensation structure, but then you still have to follow the accounting rules of what constitutes in a specific annual cost and needs to be allocated to a specific service or what's its future service. The accounting rules are pretty clear here, and therefore, obviously your ability there is very restricted, yeah?</p>
          <p>And especially for the old plans, don't forget that commitments to employees are on the old plans that we obviously had to maintain. And that's where we have taken accounting decisions on how to accrue for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I had two questions, please. Firstly, is there any technical issue that stops you selling these 1,250 risk-weighted securitization positions?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the costs, you've disappointed for two quarters in a row. So I guess using the first half cost base as your reference point, so the &#x20AC;2.5 billion ex the &#x20AC;500 million Postbank cost cuts gives you quite a high starting point. So that &#x20AC;2.5 billion is now less than 10% of your starting point costs, whereas some of your peers are up to targeting 15% of costs. So I guess my question is is that a preliminary cost figure? Could that number still grow by the time we sit down in September? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart, hi. It's Anshu, I'll take the first question, first half of your question. Stefan will take the second half.</p>
          <p>No, there is absolutely nothing stopping us. It's completely management discretion.</p>
          <p>As Stefan made out earlier, what we are doing is navigating a very careful road where we are trying to estimate continually the price at which we can exit these positions, the cost of doing that, the opportunity cost of holding it versus the capital accretion. That's then a dial that we've been managing over the last two years, and we continue to do that.</p>
          <p>What's been interesting &#x2013; and you might have seen this with the Maiden Lane sell down of assets in the U.S. &#x2013; is the appetite for this now is fairly robust. There's a number of funds which are set up to participate. The liquidity is actually &#x2013; of all the asset classes which have suffered, this is one place where liquidity is better today than it was a couple of years ago. Nothing is stopping us, but we are continually calculating to see whether it's in our best interest, net of all of those considerations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing that worries me is that, if you sold these things with a loss, would that invalidate some of your staffs' bonus conditions, in terms of the claw-backs that kick-in if the CB&amp;S division makes a negative EBIT? Is that a consideration which could preclude you from doing this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking very specific questions, Stuart. Rest assured that what we do will be in the shareholders' best interests, and any employees who are adding value to the shareholders will not be prejudiced as a consequence of that.</p>
          <p>So we will &#x2013; those are all management controllables. That's an internal decision for us to take. If we think it make sense for the bank, we'll do it. And employees that are helping us to do it will certainly not be prejudiced for it. But I can't get more specific than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question was, obviously, the attachment point for our cost cutting, which is a good question. And we debated it also quite a bit.</p>
          <p>Because at the end, the reason we used this one is to give you a guidance. Because at the end, the first half-year <mark type="ph" /> cost of this debt represents, in part (1:08:16) as you know. And you saw the increased legal and the increased obviously regulatory costs. And the FX <mark type="ph" /> the more FX runs, (1:08:28) better represents the cost of the current platform of the bank overall, yeah?</p>
          <p>So therefore, we decided if we provide you this as a basis, and you're assuming some annualization of the first half year, and implying, obviously, some of the seasonality effects we normally have, that would give you a reasonable assumption of what the starting point of this number is.</p>
          <p>And it was just making a decision that this <mark type="ph" /> speculative currency environment because the (1:08:55) exchange rate we are tied to. Because we had such a big difference to our, for example, in the exchange rate versus previous year. And obviously as we now have started to implement the Basel III requirements, we have IT and other regulatory costs reflected in our cost base. So you have a better indication of what the comparative would be.</p>
          <p>And for the rest, I'll just ask you again to wait until September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Kinner Lakhani from Citi. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I had a few questions. Firstly, just on the &#x20AC;2.4 billion of latent losses that you have on your reclassified portfolio, how you're viewing this, given the statements you've made today?</p>
          <p>Number two, just on your unprovisioned litigation, which seems to be going up from &#x20AC;2.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.5 billion this quarter, at what point the number is large enough that you feel you need to take larger litigation charges?</p>
          <p>Number three, just coming back on the other point on comparability that I think you made earlier between banks and Basel ratios and so on. Just to get a better sense, if your risk-weighting methodology was not point-in-time but through the cycle, where would your risk-weighted assets be? Because this is one of the obvious differences between Deutsche and most of the rest of the universe that I'm trying to figure out.</p>
          <p>And finally, just a point in clarification on these cost measures for just my understanding. But should I think of them as being &#x20AC;3 billion off a &#x20AC;27-billion type run rate &#x2013; i.e., a go-to level of &#x20AC;24 billion? Given consensus is broadly around &#x20AC;25 billion for the next couple of years? Or should I be taking off &#x20AC;3 billion off whatever the Street is expecting over the next couple of years in thinking about this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for your questions. So let's walk through one &#x2013; the one or the other one.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the &#x20AC;2.4 on our IAS 39 re-class assets. The way that I look at it, you know regretfully we IFRS filers have been forced to report this number. For most of our competitors that file under U.S. GAAP you would have never seen this. <mark type="ph" /> We reclassified (1:12:00) assets, we have to report both the accrual basis and their value basis in terms of market basis.</p>
          <p>But we do not see this as a potential loss, because in our view it's &#x2013; as we reclassified these assets and intend to &#x2013; in the original intent of selling and trading them, and now we put them on the pattern to sell them based on the best time of exit for these. We just don't see these losses coming through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this number is volatile because every time the market weakens and liquidity disappears then obviously the gap increases. But in most of the assets we have seen, if you look at the starting point, which was above &#x20AC;5 billion, you have seen how the convergence of our book value with the fair values that we have to assess under the different methodology. At the end, some of these assets we may hold to maturity, and then they will move back to par, and therefore technically they will have no losses.</p>
          <p>Again, if at the inception of these assets, we would have just taken this different decision that we didn't want to trade them but we didn't want to hold them for maturity and sell them, this issue would not even have appeared. As you know, we had a couple of lumpy exposures in there. One of them was Actavis that we have sold, that we are in the process of selling to give you an example. So now, what this portfolio enables us to make quite reasonable decisions at what point we want to sell and at what cost, if any, we have to sell.</p>
          <p>The second, the increase from the &#x20AC;2.5 billion reserve reporting to the &#x2013; from the &#x20AC;2.1 billion to the &#x20AC;2.5 billion reserve, the evaluation of this so-called reasonable possible losses above reserve is an appraisal at the end of the quarter on a case-by-case basis of material and significant cases that are disclosed in our financials.</p>
          <p>In every quarter some cases experience obviously movements in their inherent risks, such as like increases or decreases of payments to claimants, and additional cases may be included that were not previously. So the increase from &#x20AC;2.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.5 billion is just partly due to new cases that have just got in, I caution, obviously this number in this current litigation environment may be subject to changes.</p>
          <p>To the point-in-time versus through the cycle question, at this stage we would currently not see a meaningful difference that would arise from using through the cycle or point-in-time default measures of risk-weighted assets. Also let me add that the loss severities anyhow estimated on longer historical datasets and hence it's an important factor of Basel 2.5 and risk-weighted assets is largely the same in either concept, whether it be Basel 2.5 or Basel 3.0. In other words, we don't see this as a black or white issue indicated in your question and we certainly see the differences to be quite minimum.</p>
          <p>And then to your fourth question, if I got it right, Anshu had mentioned that the &#x20AC;3 billion savings are net and that they are anchored, as we had said, to our run rate for the first half of 2012. And I just explained why we chose that starting point because just thought that that's the best reflection of our current cost base which is current footprint and its current exchange rate and its currently significantly increased regulatory cost requirement and we felt that this was the better attachment point to quote to you.</p>
          <p>But, again, just bear with us until September and I am sure we will provide you some more granularity at that point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question is from Fiona Swaffield of RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, on the cost base or the currency impacts, I wondered if you could give us something similar for revenues because I assume there would have been a big impact from revenues? So how much did the weaker euro impact the revenues Q2 Q2 or half on half? I'd be interested in that number.</p>
          <p>The second is the euro periphery loan book. I haven't had time to read over detail yet but I wondered if you could just talk us through what's happening on credit quality there? Because it doesn't seem to be much rise in the loan losses in the KBC International. So could you comment on Spain and the conditions in your book there?</p>
          <p>And then the third is the <mark type="ph" /> polish your models (1:16:45) for market risk versus standardized and the fundamental trading review. I don't know if you've got any further thoughts on how that could potentially impact your risk-weighted assets over time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Fiona. Okay, let's go &#x2013; I'll give you some detail. So if you have your pencil in hand, I will give you some of this. The revenues in CB&amp;S was plus &#x20AC;300 million and it's now the exchange rate effect, and on the group it was &#x20AC;440 million the impact positive, negative in LLPs of each &#x20AC;10 million, yeah. And the non-interest expenses in CB&amp;S were negative &#x20AC;265 million and on the group, as we disclosed, &#x20AC;360 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the first half, do you want &#x2013; we can provide you the first half numbers, too, if you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The revenues are &#x20AC;570 million positive for CB&amp;S, &#x20AC;775 million for the group, the LLPs are the same, &#x20AC;10 million negative. And then, obviously, non-interest expenses were &#x20AC;440 million in CB&amp;S and on the group were &#x20AC;600 million. So, this is for that question.</p>
          <p>The second on the credits quality, our peripheral loan book has seen some really modest upticks in loan loss provisions. You don't see it because it's not that big of a book, but just some modest upticks. But when we look at our loss absorption ratio that takes into account our pricing for new business, that actually has developed favorably. And you'll see that over the last couple of years we've done some quite &#x2013; some good work on improving the quality of our non-German European credit books and that we have had some really favorable development in this overall. Also, we do see obviously a slight uptick in delinquencies in some of these markets.</p>
          <p>And then your last question was the models. No, we are still assessing the latest Basel review of the trading book. This is obviously something we will monitor, but we fell at this stage that the ultimate outcome is so uncertain that we don't think that to give you any impact at this time is appropriate, because we still have so much uncertainty around <mark type="ph" /> and there is so much discussion  (1:19:15) with our regulators. We are an advanced bank and have to move to a strong percentage of modeling throughout the rest of the half year, and maybe as we do that we might be able to give you a better number.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jayla. This concludes our second quarter conference call. I would like to thank all of you for your interest in Deutsche Bank. Let me emphasize that we understand you have many good questions around our initiatives and statements and we really promise to you that we will, as usual, provide full transparency around those. It was very important <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:04) to provide you with an update on our strategic review today, so please bear with us for another six weeks until Investor Day.</p>
          <p>And with that, good-bye and see you on the road.</p>
