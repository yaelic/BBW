          <p>A warm welcome to all investors and analysts.  You have dialed into the Earnings Conference Call with SingTel Management in respect of SingTel's Financial Result for the Quarter Ended 31st, December, 2007. My name is Yang Fong and let me introduce panel members on the call.  Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Francis Heng, Group CFO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Ms. Jeann Low, CFO Optus, Ms. <mark type="inaudible" /> CFO Singapore. And joining us from Sydney, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Warren Hardy, MD Consumer; and <mark type="inaudible" /> of Regional Operations.</p>
          <p>Before we start rolling in the questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning to everyone.  We reported our results for the quarter ended December 2007, and the group continues to deliver strong earnings growth.  For the quarter, we are reporting revenues up 11% assisted by double-digit revenue growth in Singapore and aided also by the appreciation of the Australian dollar.  Underlying profits grew 22% to $931 million and the Singapore revenue growth came through from strong growth in both telco and IT businesses.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margin was up 6% to $482 million.  In Australia, we saw a revenue growth of 4% in A$ terms and that is a good performance considering the decline in termination rates and also our deliberate decision to exit from fixed line resale.</p>
          <p>Optus managed to maintain its EBITDA and the margin though slightly lower, reflected in acceleration in customer acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The associates continued to deliver a very strong earnings growth and on pre-exceptional basis earnings were up 31% and we now have 172 million mobile customers in the region.  Very quickly on the year-to-date basis, we have performed in line with the guidance provided for the group for the full year, revenues for the full year are also up 11% and EBITDA is up 6%. Net profit for the full year is up 3% for the nine months &#x2013; sorry, up 3% to $2.9 billion and excluding the additional quarter of <mark type="inaudible" /> results in the prior period, the earnings growth is at 19% to $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>So with that, I hand over to Yang Fong to organize the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Sock Koong.  I would like to remind participants that this call will last for about an hour. [Instructions].  Our operator will now assist you to put through or to cancel your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question we have Sundeep Bihani Lehman Brothers, Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you for the call and congratulations on a great set of numbers.  My questions are related to Singapore.  First question, you mentioned that the operational EBITDA excluding strategic growth initiatives is expected to be comparable to the previous financial year, however, if I see the first nine months, this number is up 6% year on year.  So in terms of guidance would you expect it to be raised here?</p>
          <p>Second question is that since the strategic initiative costs so far have been very minimal, how do you see that trending over the next few quarters and would that pose a further risk to the Singapore overall margins if you look at the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>My next question is on Bangladesh, with the number of operators in the region getting GSM licenses from the CDMA existing licenses from the regulator whether it's Hutch in Vietnam, or Reliance in India, would you also look at that option given that that market is predominantly a GSM market?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll let Allen go into a bit more detail on what we're doing on the strategic initiatives, et cetera.  But I should just start off by saying that the group as a whole, we have reaffirmed the guidance for the full year and if you look at our nine months' performance I know we are well on track.  There are no changes that we are putting through for the full year's performance for the various businesses, and before Allen jumps in maybe just on Bangladesh.  I think clearly the market is still under-penetrated, we think that there is further growth, and at that time when we invested in PBTL the CDMA opportunity was the only opportunity available.  We are focused on growing the business and obviously we see opportunities to rationalize the business with the GSM operator, that is something that we're looking at, but that's not the primary focus.  The primary focus is still on driving customer acquisitions to get to a breakeven level, and we're executing well on that strategy.  So, with that let me pass to Allen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sundeep, with regard to our strategic initiatives, I think you can see from our MD&amp;A what the impact is for Q3 and for the nine months.  I think going ahead we expect our strategic initiatives to have a further &#x2013; to further impact our operational EBITDA margin, primarily because as we shift more of our revenue towards content-based businesses, the costs related to content will start to impact our overall EBITDA further.  There are also some additional strategic initiatives related to the business segment such as managed services and the rollout of our global, sorry, regional IP-VPN, which will also start to impact more significantly in the quarters ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  Next question Christian Guerra, Goldman Sachs, Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  I've three questions for you.  Firstly, in Singapore, obviously a fantastic performance at the revenue line.  I'm just wondering whether you could comment please on the economic sensitivity of the Singapore business particularly the IT and engineering side of things.  Secondly, again on Singapore, I am just wondering if you could give us some color please on the cost growth that you are expecting in 2009 fiscal, I'm just wondering whether that will again be in the sort of mid-teens region we've seen in the first three quarters of this year.  And thirdly, on Optus, a very disappointing performance in terms of broadband net adds for the quarter.  I think you actually lost 2,000 customers.  Just wondering, sort of what happened and what you're planning to do about it given sort the key product launch of Fusion last year.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Allen to take the Singapore question and then after that Paul can talk about broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The first question on Singapore is regarding the impact basically of the IT and engineering business, which is a much lower margin business.  I think with the focus, or with the balancing of the revenue in Singapore towards IT, as IT becomes a greater part of our overall Singapore revenue, then you would expect the overall EBITDA margin for the Singapore business to decline because IT basically is a much lower margin business as you can see from our MD&amp;A, 7% margin versus our operational EBITDA margins on the telco business that's in the mid-40s.  But I think this is an inevitability as we move from being a pure telco to being a provider in the business area of more than just telco and provider of ITP services.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the cost growth I think I can't give you a forecast going ahead with regards to our costs, all I can say that I think in Q3 as is typical, it's seasonal, and a lot of the cost growth is due to subscriber retention and acquisition costs, and that is related to the record number of mobile net adds that we've had for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just back on Singapore, Allen can you please make a comment on how sensitive the Singaporean business is in total to economic conditions and in particular how sensitive the IT and engineering side of things is to economic conditions both in Singapore and in the Asian region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is an impact, the impact used to be a lot more closely related in the past.  I think these days the impact is not as closely related, but obviously for our IT and engineering business as you can see from the MD&amp;A a significant part is coming from overseas, and depending on what's happening in the economies outside of Singapore, will have some kind of impact on our IT business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, on the broadband question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sock Koong, we are just going to get Warren to talk to it because it's really the consumer and mass markets that it talks about, but, Christian, as Warren will show you, actually there is a very different story below the numbers when you look at the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul.  Well consistent with the strategy that we've articulated in previous briefings, we have said very clearly that we will exit the resale market for broadband in this country given that financially the effect is the equivalent of spinning wheels for us in our business and we will focus very much on our on-net footprint. And the dynamics that you are now seeing come through in our net adds, is totally consistent with what we had flagged in previous briefings to the point where we have now grown our on-net net adds to be virtually 76,000 for the quarter, and the exiting of the resale market is now starting to see the net adds of that resale market go down.  So those figures there are absolutely consistent with our strategy, and our strategy is about focusing on-net, and in the markets that we operate in, we're very confident that we're gaining share, and the margin benefits of implementing that strategy you can see now flowing through in terms of our margin in the fixed side of the business.  So those dynamics and that market <mark type="inaudible" /> absolutely consistent with what we have presently flagged and we're very confident that the strategy we're implementing is working exactly as we had planned it do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, just to pick up on that, what we flagged is that our top line revenue growth and our market share will look like it's slowed down. However if you look at the profit line, we would expect Telstra is going to be not reporting any extra profits as a result of the potential pickup of these customers because of course we have been effectively subsidizing them under the unprofitable resale arrangements.  So you will see that dynamic at the top line, but at the profit line as Warren said, in fact we're going to show an improved profit position because we now refocus our sales and marketing engine on acquiring customers and loading them up where we have network, rather than diluting them with resale.</p>
          <p>Just to add to that, as we roll our HSPA network out more widely across the geography and develop our products -- opportunity for us to look at opportunities to migrate or to pick up potential resale customers and instead, to put them on the wireless broadband network, and that's something we are looking at very actively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're already doing it with Virgin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And indeed, we have already launched that product with Virgin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I was, I mean I'm obviously pretty sort of comfortable with the strategy.  I guess I was just a little bit surprised that the customers that were churned off the network was actually greater than the net adds for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well we've always said, Christian, that the reality is that even with 366 exchange areas combined with our HFC we would only cover around about 50% of the market.  So there's always going to be a significant number of customers that we simply can't put on-net.  So what you're seeing right now is that we have put some price increases into the resale base for customers who -- where there's a customer who is in an area that we can't migrate on-net, then that's a customer that we take the view that we're reluctantly but -- and better off losing because at the moment, they actually dilute our profitability and we can't service them.</p>
          <p>So, whilst it may look like it's a negative trend if you are looking purely at revenue or market share.  If you actually get below it and look at the EBITDA line, it's actually profit and EBITDA growth for us to refocus where we're on-net.  And likewise, that I would expect for our competitor, it's a bit of zero sum game because they'll now have to acquire and service those customers themselves rather than having us doing the billing and customer care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir.  Next, Raymond Tong Australia, Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I've got three questions. Just number one, can you give us a feel for what the bundling rates of mio TV are with fixed line services there in Singapore? Number two is for Optus, of the 76,000 on-net adds, how many of these are from migration of resale customers and how many were actually new customers?  And number three, for Optus again, what proportion of fixed line customers do you expect to be migrated on-net and when this does occur what kind of margins do you expect to get?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sock Koong here, I think on the new <mark type="inaudible" /> it is still very early days for us yet, so we will hold off on disclosing those numbers until we have more meaningful number to indicate what trends are like. So maybe with that I pass over to Paul to talk about the on-net adds in Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thanks, Sock Koong.  Again, because we are quite careful about the disclosure side I don't think we've have actually broken that down historically that way.  But what I will do is I'll ask Warren if he can just talk a bit about two things, one is what are the channels that we refocused on the areas where we are on-net, and second of all, what's the sort of the level of activity and the timeline associated with the migration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. In terms of actually our ULL customer growth, you've seen that grow very, very strongly over the preceding quarters, and that's been through a combination of both sales and also migration. So obviously we showcased our Fusion product with our ULL on-net offering and that has been very successful for us in driving sales onto our ULL network.  At the same time, we have also increased our distribution network particularly in the door-to-door channel and that has been firing very strongly for us as well. Obviously in terms of the resale base that we are migrating to the ULL network, that activity has been continuing apace the previous quarters and you could expect that the bulk of those migrations will be completed by the time we get to about halfway through this calendar year.  And so, we will obviously be growing out through our exchange build out which gives us further network footprint, through expansion of our distribution capability and through continuing to make sure that we put very exciting innovative and disruptive offers into the market.  We will be growing our new sales onto the ULL network over time, and you'll see a slow wind down of the migrations and that pool essentially is exhausted by that halfway through this calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to say that most of the on-net net adds are from the migration of resale customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think it would be fair to say that at all. In fact, as I said, we've put some very exciting offers into the market in the previous period.  The Fusion offer was quite groundbreaking in this market.  It really exploited the incumbents' dilemma very strongly and has proved to be extremely popular with our customers and has been driving significant sales activities for us through our on-net sales channel partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  Next Navin Killa Hong Kong, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks for the call and congratulations on the good results.  I actually had three questions.  First, I just wanted to understand your strategy with respect to your stake in Far EasTone in Taiwan.  It's obviously a very small amount and does not fit into your overall strategy of having reasonably meaningful stakes in your affiliates.  So what's the plan there, do you intend to sell the stake or do you intend to increase your stake over time? If you could throw some light on that.</p>
          <p>Second, if you could also please share with us a little bit on the financial performance of Warid Telecom.  Obviously, you had a $12 million negative PBT contribution.  But you also mentioned that the EBITDA margins were positive.  So if you could share some numbers there to help us kind of forecast that business going forward.  And the last question is any update that you have on the next generation broadband initiatives in Singapore.  How do you plan to position SingTel in that, that would be helpful.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="inaudible" />. I think when we looked at our investment in NCIC, we feel very strongly that some form of rationalization had to happen either in terms of fixed line consolidation or fixed mobile consolidation.  Otherwise, on a standalone basis with the deteriorating regulatory situation we didn't think that the business was something very very attractive.  So further upon negotiations and discussions with our partners we have gone down the path of working towards fixed mobile consolidation and we had swapped our shares in NCIC for a stake in Far EasTone and as a result, I think the Far East group now has better control of both the fixed and mobile parts of the business.  So the resulting stake that we have in Far EasTone is only 4%, it is a small stake. And we are evaluating our options. Clearly I think there is a lot more flexibility with the Far EasTone stake than an unlisted NCIC stake.  We have not decided what we want to do with the shares but clearly you will see an improvement in the position from the loss-making <mark type="inaudible" /> stake. We now have the shares in Far EasTone which pay very healthy dividends. I will get my colleague to talk about Warid Telecom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is <mark type="inaudible" /> by the way. I think that some of you may not know him by his full name, since he's called &#x2013; referred to as <mark type="inaudible" />. <mark type="inaudible" /> will talk about Warid Telecom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think for Warid, which is in Pakistan, if you look at the market situation, it is a low penetrated market, so the first thing to do in the operator is really to go aggressively roll out the network and in a situation like that if you look at it, Warid is currently expanding rapidly trying to get as many customers as possible. So if you look at the 12 million losses really, a lot's got to do with the deprecation, high depreciation, high marketing expense. We continue to see this to happen in the next few quarters as they continue to grab more and more customers to have higher penetration in their market. The thing to notice really is they are already trend, EBITDA positive in the quarter and the December 2007. So I think they will continue to improve on these operations, we will see this trend continuing for a while.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Navin. I think as far as NBN's concerned, I think that the &#x2013; first thing is that the submission for the bids close in early May. So right now at this stage SingTel is talking to a large number of different consortiums with regard to the role that SingTel can play. And number three, I think as everybody is probably aware, we have been pre-qualified with a SingTel only bid and a SingTel consortium bid with some financial partners. I think all I can say at this time is that &#x2013; you know, should there be any changes to the two pre-qualified bids that SingTel has, we will make a public announcement, but I think right now, we are in active discussions with a lot of different players.</p>

          <p>Yes, Thank you for the call. Just a couple of questions from me, one is just on the status of the OPEL funding, when you actually expect to receive the money, and whether the delay in receiving the money will change your June 2009 network completion target. And secondly, just wondering if you could provide us with mobile broadband customers in Australia and Singapore given some of your competitors actually disclose those numbers. Thank you.</p>

          <p>In both Singapore and Australia, the broadband consumers have been grouped under broadband and we &#x2013; those are not counted twice in broadband and in mobile. So just to clarify that &#x2013; but in both Singapore &#x2013; in Australia have we given the numbers?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. In both Singapore and Australia, I think we have not separately provided the mobile broadband numbers yet. I think we would let a few more quarters pass before we start updating you the numbers. They are not very significant now, but certainly in both Singapore and Australia, we are seeing very good growth. On the OPEL funding maybe I could get Paul to take the question.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Sock Koong. Just Daniel, thanks for the question &#x2013; and actually to be fair to the government, the OPEL funding has not been delayed as and of this stage. When we signed the contract with government, there were two conditions that needed to be fulfilled in order for the funding to actually flow. The first of those was the government approving the commercial agreement between the joint venture partners. And we see that as a very uncontroversial item, very much a mechanical item. The second issue was that we were required as partners to submit a detailed implementation plan right down to neighborhood and street which showed that we would meet the obligations that we are committed to in the tender. And obviously that took us quite a few months to prepare, because it is very detailed; it involved using a number of different coverage models in the Australian marketplace, so that we could make sure we had a point of triangulation to satisfy any queries. And you will have noticed as well that we acquired the AUSTAR WiMAX spectrum just early in the new year in order to make sure that we would comply with our obligations.</p>
          <p>We submitted our plan in early January and as was always slated from when we signed the contract, the government has got a period of weeks in which to consider the very detailed plan and to revert. So we are currently going through that process. I would expect that we would hear back from government sometime in the coming quarter. And our expectation is of course that we have complied, so we are expecting that to be that we will hear back from them and that funding will flow.</p>
          <p>In the meantime because of the timeline you mentioned, we are working very hard to ensure we are well placed to meet it. We have about 80 people in Optus today who are working on getting that roll out underway and then making sure we are well placed. Likewise, we are doing a lot of work at the local level to ensure that we have the infrastructure required for areas such as backhaul. So I think you'll hear a lot more about this over the coming quarter, and my expectation is that we will be able to give you a lot more detail on specific coverage once the government has approved a plan and we can release all of the math. Hopefully I have given you enough information there to answer the question.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Yes, thank you, Paul. Just one follow-up; does the plan include mobile WiMAX or fixed WiMAX?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've indicated &#x2013; and I think there's been some inaccurate coverage on this in Australia lately, in fact I clarified it on the media call today. We, as part of acquiring the AUSTAR spectrum, agreed that we would meet certain obligations that AUSTAR had to Unwired when they did a spectrum swap a couple of years ago. We are satisfied that the rollout we proposed, which would initially be at a D-standard, and then migrate to an E-standard, would meet those obligations. It's not one of our proposals at this stage that that would be a mobile network although it would comply with the E-standard. So I think maybe there's been some confusion on those points -- hopefully my comments clarify that &#x2013; and as we understand it that meets and provides sufficient support to the obligations that AUSTAR has.</p>

          <p>On the earlier question about the mobile broadband customers, I had meant to say that the numbers are counted under mobile customers but my colleagues here said that I said that they are counted under broadband customers. So for the avoidance of doubt I just want to be very clear that both in Singapore and Australia, the wireless broadband customers are counted under mobile customer numbers. And, so we don't double count them in that you don't see them counted under broadband and mobile. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot for the call and congrats on a good set of numbers. My questions actually pertain to NBN in terms of &#x2013; I mean given the plans of IDA to kind of implement the NBN now, I just want to hear from Allen potentially on what impact it has on potentially your fixed-line business, where you seem to have over 95% market share. And also more so on your broadband and corporate data business. I mean, what kind of impact do you really foresee? Are you going to just shift to the NBN platform, or do you think it will continue as an alternative to the NBN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Suresh, In terms of the NBN, basically it will be a competitive fixed-line network. I think in terms of competition to our fixed-line business, I think for the business community we already face competition in a lot of areas from StarHub because they've got their own network, from AT&amp;T, British Telecom and other global service providers. So I think what NBN does is that it extends the competition out in not only the business areas, but also into the residential areas as well. So I think the ability for somebody to do that in the residential area to sell just raw bandwidth is somewhat limited because in the residential areas they don't just buy three or ten meg; they want a service to be provided. So I think the ability for SingTel to stay ahead of the market and provide stuff like pay TV which we're already doing, provide applications to consumer customers and to some of our small business customers is essential rather than just being a commodity seller. So I think we are well prepared for the advance of NBN. As you can see, we're already moving beyond just being a provider of carrier services to providing applications for our small business and for our consumer customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think one quick follow-up, Allen, if I may is &#x2013; obviously the content exclusivity that is currently there in Singapore, is probably preventing you from making a lot of inroads into the pay TV market, I mean, with NBN would you expect that to change at all? Because I think part of the reason NBN is coming in is because I think they are trying to get more competition I would assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think NBN already gives ability for multiple service providers to get content. I think we are putting this on two fronts; we have lobbied the MDA for a period now with regards to exclusive content and the ability of certain key exclusive content being held by dominant players to preclude competition. I think where MDA decides to go with that very much rests in their hands, but we've made our perspective on that very clear. I think more importantly for SingTel is that we have a pay TV product out there, that we think has got reasonable content, certainly it doesn't had the breath of StarHub, because StarHub has been there in ten years and it has locked up some significant content. But from SingTel's perspective after operating the service for six months, we really do know what is some of the key content that we need to acquire to make our pay TV service successful and a credible competitor to StarHub. So, I think, as and when some of these content exclusivity end, and they all have either three or five year terms, we will be in there in front of these content providers with what we feel will be a credible financial offer to make sure that we will be able to win over some of the key exclusive content.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Next we have Mr. Tim <mark type="inaudible" /> over to you, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. A question for Paul O'Sullivan and for Warren, just looking at the fixed line business, clearly coming back to some of the earlier questions, it looks like we've seen a significant decline in broadband resale numbers in the December quarter. Now, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the customers were notified of the price increases back in May. We saw some churn of the base through the June quarter and more significantly in September. But then we've seen a massive uplift in those declines from 28,000 lost resale broadband subs to 78,000 in the December quarter without a corresponding uplift on the ULL front. And I guess I'm just trying to understand in a strategic context given you got the OPEL network potentially being built. You've potentially got a new FTTN network being built. Isn't it a cheaper strategic proposition to hold onto these customers rather than actively churn them in the short term?  And then next question just coming back to the issue on OPEL, I'm just wondering are you concerned, Paul, that the window of opportunity for OPEL is actually closing given there is real potential of a new fiber to the node network within say four years. And I just wanted to check on your comments around the AUSTAR spectrum and that you'd acquired it &#x2013; my understanding was that purchasing the spectrum is conditional on sign off from the government on the funding for the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sock Koong if you're comfortable we'll take those questions down here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes please.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Paul O'Sullivan: Okay I'll pass it over to Warren to talk to the first and I'll come back and talk about OPEL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim you'd be right, we had previously indicated in earlier sessions our strategic intent to exit the resale category. And we do have to go through a process of customer notification and also channel notification. So there is a lag impact that follows from that, from notifying your channel within contractual terms and then also notifying the customers. You've then got some prices rises that were put into that product category as well, which then washed through to the <mark type="inaudible" /> cycle. So again it is entirely consistent with what we had planned and expected that in fact the churn impact from those activities would actually be most severely felt in the quarter that we've just had as opposed to the quarter beforehand.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question about would it be more economic to actually hold on to them ahead of fiber to the node, as opposed to exit the resale category today. Honestly the economic on those customers, those resale customers was very challenging for us and it would &#x2013; and fiber to the node timeframe at this stage is somewhat of an unknown. So that proposition would involve us as a company holding on to those customers and continuing to destroy value for some quite time into the future until there's full clarity on fiber to the node, which is not a particularly attractive business proposition. Importantly though with the build out of our 3G network, we now have an opportunity with the new technologies to go and attack those resale markets with a new technology base on our own footprint. And without having to engage in resale economics. You can see that we've already done that as a company through our subsidiary Virgin Mobile and you can expect to see Optus utilizing that technology in a way to attack that market wirelessly with fixed substitution products in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Warren, just on that, I guess this is the issue for investors. You're saying you've got the opportunity to drive it through the Virgin broadband in a box and the InZone product. But you're not disclosing actually that those numbers are -- are you asking investors to take a leap of faith?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I would point to a comment that Sock Koong made a bit earlier in the briefing that we'd like to get a few quarters under our belt of that to actually stabilize the trends and what have you so that we can disclose to you something which is quite meaningful and based in a reasonable timeframe rather than actually just in a short-term view of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you're disappointed? Because given Virgin &#x2013; Matt Davey's had that product out there for over six months. Does that mean it's not delivering or I would have thought after six, seven months you'd have a pretty clear idea of the attractiveness of the offering and now you've also launched InZone would also support that thesis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tim it's Paul. I'll take it up seeing as we're taking about another business unit. I think the reality is that Virgin is a relatively small scale. So you can't really emulate the distribution that the Optus brand has when you look at Virgin and it's also a brand that tends to have an appeal to a couple of really particular segments. I think we will expect to see some different trend lines when we go above the line with Optus offerings and in Optus distribution channels.</p>
          <p>But I think also to come back to &#x2013; make sure we properly communicated on the broadband. Us providing fixed line resale has proven to be a real dud over the last couple of years. You can't control the customer experience, your call centers end up continually on hold trying to deal with Telstra call centers and on top of all of that you don't make any margin out of the product. And so even if you were &#x2013; even if you were taking a view that you might want to hold on to them for a while for some new network, actually the cost structures and the lack of profitability are really quite severe. That's why we believe that our strategy will actually perhaps give Telstra some better number they can report at the top line. But actually in a profitability sense I reckon it will be at the very best for them neutral and it may even be slightly negative because they are going to have to take on costs now that we've largely being subsidizing . So I think that's really what's behind our strategy and why we're executing as we are. And I think you will see that our market share in areas where we have network, which is about 50% of the footprint. You will see that that is where we are able to report gains and significant gains over the next couple of years. Warren did you want to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should just say, far from being disappointed we know that the result, the dynamic washing through the market at the moment is people place shift and time shift their lives. And so the demand for Internet access on the move as a product category is growing very, very strongly. So we're to the contrary being very energized by the performance of the mobile broadband product category and you can expect us to be even more active in this product category going forward as we roll out more and more different flavors of that technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I should have stated as well the Virgin product has surpassed our initial expectation so that's probably worth qualifying. In terms of OPEL I think the two questions you asked really were first of all in terms of the window of opportunity that relates to the OPEL Network and second of all exactly what's the contractual situation with AUSTAR. On the window of opportunity for OPEL I'd split that network into two components, one is the DSLAMs and the other one are the WiMAX tariffs. On the DSLAMs even in an FTTN world we'd expect that the DSLAMs still play some role and that is that those living within a close enough distance of the exchange will be getting quite high speeds initially using ADSL2+. So it's our expectation and indeed it's our recommendation that in any fiber to the node rollout the prioritization of rollout would go to those who are furthest or who are not close to exchanges and who are not able to get the ADSL2+ today. And then you come back to fill in those areas subsequently. So I think there is an extended window for DSLAMs under an FTTN rollout.</p>
          <p>In terms of WiMAX and I realize that the comments I make here are not always supported by others in the public domain. But we believe it's quite compelling to you that wireless technology for the less populated areas and thirdly the numbers that we look at and the economics that we've done show us that it's very challenging under any scenario to try and provide fiber based broadband once you get outside the main population centers. So we are quite confident that there will be a role &#x2013; a key role for WiMAX moving forward. And I think what's been interesting to see is that we have seen some softening of the rhetoric on this in recent times from those who were originally very opposed to it. Of course the fact that we acquired the AUSTAR spectrum, the fact that we are now committing to go out on spectrum which will be of a global standard with a wide range of CPE and with a wide range of equipment means that some of the initial critics we've clearly listened to and we've actually amended our rollout take account of their views.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the relationship with AUSTAR it is a binding contract between us. So we are in a position to acquire that spectrum if and when we are ready but you are quite right in that we made it a condition of the contract that we would make it a precondition that the government funding had come through. Because naturally we wanted to make sure we covered all the bases but that's just us being our usual considered and cautious selves and I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we have that conditionality so naturally for disclosure reasons we wanted to be very public and very transparent about it. So hopefully that's answered it, Tim is there anything you wanted to follow up on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Paul, just on the WiMAX front, were you thinking in terms of technology platform that it has to be aligned with Unwired's technology plan because I guess we've seen the CEO of Unwired has commented about his aims or I guess the distance that the WiMAX offering would cover seems to be contrary to the Optus strategy. So I am just trying to understand is it going to be an aligned technology platform or could we see two separate platforms adopted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's in the interests of both parties to have platforms that are aligned in the sense that they work to the same standard and that people can use the same CPE for getting broadband in their homes off that network. But I think I have been very explicit and clear in saying we do not plan at this stage to build out WiMAX so that it is capable of being a mobile network, it's not intended for that purpose and so just to be really clear on that we would expect that we meet any obligations AUSTAR has to Unwired by building out on the DNE standard with a network designed to provide very good broadband in the home and indeed to be nomadic. If someone wants to move down the road and reuse the network that will also be possible. But I think to be really clear we are not intending at this stage to roll out a network which has a seamless cell handover of the quality that customers would expect today from a mobile phone network. And to be honest if you wanted my view of the technology and the industry I still think that's quite some years away.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning I have three questions please. Firstly, just for clarification with regards to the NBN network, have you &#x2013; am I right in thinking that you have applied to participate at both the network level and the operating level? That's the first question. Secondly do you see a possibility that the government's plan for the national broadband network will lead to a degree of overinvestment in Singapore because after all you and your major competitor StarHub already have advanced networks and you already have your plans to upgrade them further. And thirdly, could I check please your definition of net debt to EBITDA? Is it consolidated balance sheet net debt relative to EBITDA including the contribution from associates? And if so is that really an appropriate measure given that your consolidated balance sheet net debt does not include obviously any debt from the unconsolidated associates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Allen take the questions on NBN and then Francis can talk about the net debt &#x2013; definition question that you had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay with regards to firstly your clarification I think SingTel has been pre-qualified for both the NetCo as well as the OpCo. I think in terms of the OpCo's RFP is not up yet, so we will wait for that to come up before we talk about participating further in that process, but certainly as I mentioned earlier in the NetCo process we are going along with the process and we are very much talking to everyone. In terms of your second question will there be a level of overinvestment in the Singapore fixed network as a result of NBN. I think if we look at the business <mark type="inaudible" /> today there already four if not five different networks. So I think one more network is not going to make a big difference in that area. I think in the residential areas there is certainly a question of whether it is overinvestment bearing in mind SingTel's ducts are already in there. SingTel doesn't have fiber to every home but we do get to within one to two kilometers of most homes. I think we will go through this process with the government and we will see depending on the outcome whether we do in fact have more than one network going to the residences. I think this remains to be played out but as I've mentioned earlier SingTel is certainly at least at this stage participating actively in the NetCo part of it, where we believe we do have our ducts extending to a large &#x2013; to almost every home in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Francis Heng. Yes, I &#x2013; the net debt figure that we have is the consolidated net debt and the EBITDA number that we have includes a share of our associates' earnings. Now this is the typical convention of aggregating our earnings from our associates so it's not an unusual treatment. Is that okay, Andrew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that makes sense. Maybe just to follow on very quickly, it's just it's interesting because if you do the calculation net debt to EBITDA based on operational EBITDA excluding the contribution from associates your net debt EBITDA is more like 1.5 times, which is much more the sort of efficient level would you agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">

I'm just looking at the EBITDA improvement of the consumer division and just wondering what the &#x2013; what sort of differential in margin you think there is between an on-net, so say a Fusion customer and a resale customer, an off-net customer.

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do &#x2013; I do actually, the second question was on Optus Business, very strong performance there and both in revenue and EBITDA. Do you have a feel for what your market share is today and what's happening in terms of trends in the markets? If I remember well your market share a few years ago used to be in the mid teens. And last question on OPEL I'm just wondering in the context of the government's plan for a nationwide FTTN, so including a regional rollout, would you seriously consider spending a material amount of money before the outcome of FTTN is known? And when I say material amount of money that is through OPEL and so if you could explain how the government's plan for a nationwide FTTN rollout affects your &#x2013; maybe the timing of your OPEL rollout?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, <mark type="inaudible" />. What I will do is I will ask Warren maybe to cover off the first issue and then I will pick up the other two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="inaudible" />. In terms of the, I think the question was the margin differential between our Fusion product and an off-net equivalent. We don't disclose that information on a very detailed basis like that, product versus product. However, I think it's fair to say that the margin is significantly better than the resale economics and that is basically what underpins our decision to make the investment in the first place. Obviously most of the value in a resale customer is translated straight back through the resale agreement to the incumbent whereas obviously under this arrangement the margins &#x2013; obviously the network piece comes through the P&amp;L, through depreciation so obviously at the gross margin level you immediately get rid of those resale payments to the other carrier so that obviously has a significantly beneficial impact on the gross margin at a product basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, Warren, you disclosed previously that there was sort of a kind of theoretical case that the on-net margin you were seeing were about 25, 30%. Now you've got actually some track record and some real numbers are the margins you are seeing on an on-net customer around that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around the same level as the resales, did you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, around the same level you previously indicated which was sort of a theoretical sort of around 25, 30% EBITDA margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on a per customer basis obviously we are growing this base very quickly and we are getting to scale and obviously as you get to scale a lot of your fixed costs to support that base dilute as you get bigger and your margins improve. So it's fair to say we are well on the way on that journey to actually achieving those margins that we'd previously predicted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warren, sorry let me just intercept here. I think if you look at the ULL on-net the cost to us really is the cost of the unbundled local loop which is 17.70 that we face today although you know we believe that when the ACCC finally rule it will be a lower rate than that 17.70. I think when you look at the resale, what we obviously pay to Telstra is a lot more, which is really pegged to our ARPU in terms of cost of sales, so I think that's where the economics stack up between on-net and off-net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will pick up on your other two questions. On Optus Business, in terms of market share in aggregate it is actually quite hard to get a metric and we do various amounts of sampling but there has been so much flux in the industry in the last couple of years it's hard to be definitive on a number. But if you look at the actual growth rates we've been turning in, which as you complimented us on our latest result, but actually we've been growing very strongly now over the last year and half. If you look at that, we've clearly been taking share from the incumbent and so our overall comment would be that clearly we've gained share and fact that we've been able to gain the share and improve the margin, we see as a real positive.</p>
          <p>Now there is reasons for that, we've actually recalibrated the commission and the sales rewards as well as our targeting of customers, about 18 months to two years ago, so that we were focusing more on-net. In many ways it's sort of an early version of the strategy you're now watching Warren execute in terms of broadband in the consumer market. And so by refocusing on customers where we can carry a higher percentage of their traffic off our own network rather than Telstra resale or leased lines and that's driven a lot of the improvement.</p>
          <p>I could give you some areas where we probably, good examples of where we've made good inroads, and of how we target. We typically target customers who are data-heavy as well as voice-heavy. And who are clustered around good points where we can aggregate their traffic on-net as opposed to a whole range of smaller points. So a good example of that would be in Canberra the fact that we do Medicare or that we do immigration. If you look at some of the state governments, we have had some big wins and big inroads with the Victoria and Queensland state governments. In terms of the verticals, we've been very strong and I believe we've gained share in banking and finance, in logistics, in insurance. But within all of those areas it is a case that we've very much re-qualified and refocused on who we go after and how we go after them.</p>
          <p>The other trend we're seeing is that by putting the IP-based products in front of the CIOs, they know they are up for disruption, even if they stay with their existing supplier. So therefore they're far more open to a change and they're therefore picking technology based on best of breed and that's why Evolve which we just launched is so important to us.</p>
          <p>To come to your third question on OPEL. Absolutely we're very mindful of making sure that whatever we roll out has a long period in which it can generate a payback and make sense for us. Really OPEL has probably two important components for us. The first one is a backhaul network which we see as being important and valuable to us even in an FTTN world, because we would want to aggregate traffic as early as we can, or as close as we could to the last mile and carry it as much as possible on our own networks. And obviously we can also share that backhaul for the mobile network or for corporate customers. And then second of all there is the access network and it's the access network that's probably more sensitive to any rollouts in FTTN. So that is a discussion that we're clearly having with the department and we'll make sure that anything that we ultimately roll out we've properly understood the economics and that we have had the appropriate dialogue with government. Because I don't think it's in our interest to either roll out something that won't have a long life or indeed in the government's interest to be funding something which ultimately might be rolled over. So you can be quite confident those discussions are happening at the government level.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've just got a couple of questions, first of all is just &#x2013; I just want some clarity actually just looking at the Optus accounts, the net debt at the end of the MD&amp;A which actually excludes I think intercompany debt has actually risen despite the fact that actually the Optus free cash flow for the year is like plus 500 million. So I just wanted to get some clarity in terms of actually what had actually gone on within the balance sheet of Optus. The second question was it looks as though from the media conference there has been talk about obviously now withdrawing from a Ghana bid, obviously that follows on from Kenya as well. I just wondered if you could give us some brief comments in terms of obviously the offshore international expansion strategy, whether that is going to take precedent over some sort of capital management as we go through the rest of the year?  Just those two questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Jeann talk about the debt situation in Optus, but maybe let me take the question on the international expansion. Our international expansion strategy has not changed, we continue to focus in Asia and we will certainly continue to be disciplined in our investment approach and in regards to capital management and making investment as mutually exclusive strategies, clearly we will look at the investment opportunities available. We have a fair amount of flexibility in our financial position and if there are deals that we think are value accretive, we'll be happy to do that. But if &#x2013; in the absence of such deals, we'll be happy to look at various capital return options for shareholder, objective is to get to a capital structure that is as optimum as possible but provide management with sufficient flexibility.</p>
          <p>I think the Ghana bid et cetera, I think those are very specific transactions, which we as a practice do not comment, but &#x2013; and I'll leave it at that. I'll let Jeann talk about the debt situation at Optus. Though I should highlight that as a wholly owned subsidiary debt and the liability management is looked at on the group level, looking at tax, looking at tax planning as a one of the key consideration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think I should just highlight the two key components in our cash flow, which is on page 52, clearly one key component is the free cash flow which for the quarter is 134 million, for the nine months is about &#x2013; it's in excess of 500 million. This is the first key component, the second key component, you will know is that you know we have made a loan to STI which is an intercompany. As Sock Koong mentioned the debt management is really held at a consolidated level. So if you look the loan to STI that is also somewhat funded not by the free cash flow, but also by increase in bank borrowings of 157 million. So if you look &#x2013; if you reconcile that for the increase in net debt, you would have an appreciation about the movement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Ian Martin, ABN AMRO Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question, a quick question for Paul O'Sullivan. Paul, can you give us an update on the 3G HSDPA network rollout and maybe the timetable that you're working to there? And whether with the decision by Vodafone to also roll out high-speed 3G whether that's raised the prospect that you might go back into extending the 3G network sharing agreement to this new high-speed network. And did you decide in the end to use 900 megahertz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Ian. A couple of very good points there. The first one is that we'll have covered 80% of the population by June and with regards to the full 96% of population that we cover with our 2G network today, we will have covered that with 3G and HSPA by December of this year and that's about 18 months ahead of schedule. So we've accelerated that rollout and we've done very well in terms of being able to achieve fast and good execution of it.</p>
          <p>We've seen Vodafone's recent announcement and at this stage we haven't entered into any discussion with them about extending the arrangement. And obviously, I'll leave at this stage no further comment on that aspect. But probably the other important thing that has happened in the quarter is our selection of Huawei as a vender and it goes to your third question, which is around frequency. We believe that by bringing Huawei in we've brought in a vendor who provides a very aggressive roadmap in terms of future evolution of HSPA and we did indeed make the decision as part of our selection of a vendor to work at the 900 megahertz level on 3G as well as 2100. Now we will use 900 selectively, we'll use it in areas where there may not be as much traffic and we want to get extended reach out of the base station.</p>
          <p>One of the advantages of 900 is that we're now seeing a number of other carriers select it overseas and indeed in New Zealand Vodafone have selected it, which we think will give us a better range of handset availability and allow us to avoid some of the challenges that we know our major competitor has had as they've tried to work on 850 over the last couple of years. So you can expect to see some strong competition going on in the regional markets over the next couple of years as we provide a clear alternative for mobile broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, just a further question, are you branding it the same way or will there be a standalone brand for high-speed 3G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've already got a degree of branding on it today, we call it Turbo G, but I think if you look at the overall approach, we've put the branding and very much related it to the delivery of wireless broadband rather than try to brand the network overall. We see the Optus brand as being more appropriate for what we sell in terms of the overall voice and mobile package, but in terms of the Turbo brand that's used to try and communicate to people who are thinking about a broadband solution, that they can get high-speed in the HSPA network.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Sachin Gupta, Morgan Stanley Australia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually most of my questions have been answered, but, Paul if I can just ask a very general question, given what we are seeing in the wireless broadband market in Australia at the moment, prices are coming down with Vodafone and Optus and Hutch's plan <mark type="inaudible" /> recently. Do you still expect wireless broadband to substitute to fixed-line broadband or do you actually see it as a complementary service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I might pass that to Warren to take it but before I do, full marks for opportunity, Sachin. Clearly because &#x2013; never waste a moment to get a good question in. But I'll pass it over to Warren to pick up and I think the &#x2013; if you look at the way we're executing the product, clearly we see it is both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Paul. I think in answer to your question, both of those characteristics exist on this product. Certainly, if you look at some segments of the market particularly people who maybe move their address quite frequently, maybe the younger demographic who change their addresses, they would like to have a broadband account that they can take with them when they change house. So that would be largely substitutional for a fixed-line that they may have previously got before. But quite clearly in this market, there is also demand from people who have already have an existing fixed broadband service but they also expect to have the utility of the mobile aspect of the broadband service and they will buy a secondary service which is incremental and complementary to their existing fixed-line. So I think both those dynamics exist in the market and we're seeing this product category obviously drive some very strong and exciting growth in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, there should be a degree of feeding off one another as well because if you know that you can get an application wherever you are then its utility increases so it actually makes the relevance and usefulness of some of the applications you can access on broadband at home quite useful outside. I think I'm probably a good example too, I have broadband at home and I have an Optus wireless Turbo card because I need to be able to use it when I'm at airports and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I made the comment a bit earlier, people are place shifting and time shifting their lives so they're doing the same things they used to do, but they want to do them at a different time now and they want to do them in a different place and wireless broadband is the perfect vehicle to facilitate that. And we're seeing that dynamic wash through in demand for this product.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Andrew Levy, Australia, Macquarie Securities.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations guys on a good result. Just one more question on Australia. On the mobile business there's &#x2013; your market share and your margins have been in decline for a while now. What can you do to relieve that and when do you expect it to stop or turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I might lead off and I'll let &#x2013; Andrew, and I'll let Warren jump in with some additional information on the consumer market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I think if you look at our performance, first of all if you look at the margin what we've flagged for a while is that as we restarted the engines in postpaid, particularly with Black &amp; White, you would expect to see us ramp the level of customer acquisition. And indeed last quarter and this quarter we were back very strongly into positive territory on the postpaid net adds, over 50,000 this quarter. And that of course because we expense our acquisition cost upfront has a dilution effect initially on your EBITDA. Even more so with the Black &amp; White campaign because what we we're picking up are higher value customers than we would off a normal acquisition campaign. In fact, we see that has been a fairly successful program at picking up some of Telstra's higher ARPU customers. But they come at a slightly higher cost because the higher the customer spend, the higher the handset subsidy you usually incur and the commissions et cetera. So that's part of the trend line you're seeing wash through the numbers at the moment.</p>
          <p>If you look at the market share, I'm not sure you can necessarily conclude at this stage what's been going on in market share without full disclosure from all the carriers. One of things that I would very much like to encourage is that each of the carriers discloses not only net adds but also its revenues and its margins so that we can understand exactly what's going on. That way, it's easier for you as investors see are people merely buying market share, or are they building sustainable business overall. But if you look at us, certainly in terms of where we've been traveling and we look at relative numbers to others, our view is that in terms of revenue market share and sustainable profitability we've actually been putting in a stronger performance on the voice side than many of our competitors over the last 12 months. Wireless broadband hands up, I've said it before, we're still in the process of rolling out and catching up in that space but certainly on voice we think we've been putting in a fairly strong performance. Warren, did you want to add anything to that and then we'll give Andrew a chance to come back if he's got a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think clearly we have carved out a very, very strong and market leading position in the prepaid product category which is a product category which tends to be dominated more in the youth demographic. And you can see that in our marketing activity of late we're actually now working very hard and very diligently to carve out a very market leading position in the young adult segment and you can see our Wireless Broadband Unplugged, you can see the execution of that product in the market is very much targeted at the young adult segment. So that we can take that leadership position that we have in youth and then roll that into the rest of the market as that target grows older. Black &amp; White we've been very successful, as Paul said, in doing that comparative advertising and we've again just recently launched a new version of our Black &amp; White to actually build on that campaign and again do that comparative advertising to demonstrate the great value that we deliver in the postpaid market.</p>
          <p>And on top of all of that, we continue to expand our distribution, both within the metropolitan areas and also within the regional areas as we build out our network footprint. And together with our transformation program which is increasing our online sales and service capability we just recently turned on the ability to obviously buy and provision those prepaid services and mobile services over the web. Effectively, we now have increased our distribution quite substantially because we've now got a point of distribution on every single PC screen in Australia.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

          <p>Well, as I've said, this is a product category that is driving strong growth in the market and obviously I think you'll see we're very visible in the marketplace at the moment in executing that product. And you can expect to see us to continue to attack that market segment in very innovative and challenging ways in the near future and in a way that differentiates ourselves from our competitors but also delivers great value to our customers.</p>
