      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for Grupo Mexico's first quarter earnings conference call. I am joining this conference call by Octavio Ornelas, Chief financial Officer of Ferromex and Ferrosur, Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations and other executives of the company. On today's conference call, I'll be briefly commenting on copper prices to next highlight Grupo Mexico and Southern Copper financial results and Octavio Ornelas will cover in detail the results of our Transportation division, and afterwards we'll be happy to answer any questions you might have.</p>
          <p>With respect to metal prices, as you all know, the world economic recession have severely hurt commodity prices with significant reductions in the price of copper, molybdenum and zinc. The London Metals Exchange first quarter average copper was $1.56 per pound, 56% lower than the $3.54 per pound average for the first quarter of 2008 and 12% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. Major drivers for this low copper prices have been demand contraction in the developed economies and inventory build up.</p>
          <p>However, we believe that demand is growing particularly in China. Clearly this country has finished a destocking process initiated last year and have come back to the market with significant demand for copper. On the supply side, during the last quarter, we saw the following factors influencing the price; more production cuts and higher cost mine operations, refine copper production cuts driven mainly by shut downs in smelters due to sulfuric acid stockpiling and reduction of copper scrap. We expect copper prices to start appreciating by the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>With regard to molybdenum, the average price in this quarter was $8.75 per pound. That is a decrease of 74% year-over-year and 40% quarter-over-quarter. In the first quarter, our total consolidated revenues were 824 million, a decrease of 53% year-over-year but a 15% increase when compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This reduction is mainly attributable to lower metal prices.</p>
          <p>In the railroad business, there was a 17% drop in terms of dollars but an increase in terms of pesos, which Octavio will explain in detail. Cost of sales for the first quarter was 517 million, a decrease of 23% on a year-over-year basis and 21% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. This reduction is mainly explained by lower prices in several of our key inputs. Fuel cost decreased 19%, electricity cost went down 32% and spare parts and maintenance materials decreased 21%.</p>
          <p>Under adverse economic circumstances, our company will continue its effort to reduce cost, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline with the objective of strengthening our position as one of the world's leading low-cost producers. For 2009, we anticipate further price reductions in several of our high consumption inputs particularly electricity, where we expect a downward trend to continue. EBITDA in the first quarter was somewhat north of 276 million with an EBITDA margin of 34%.</p>
          <p>However, EBITDA was 12 times higher than the fourth quarter 2008, as negative effect of provisional sales adjustments in the Mining division was reverted. Net income for the first quarter was 19 million a decrease from the 90% from year-over-year and an increase 111% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter 2009, Grupo Mexico increased its ownership stake in Southern Copper to 80%. It was achieved through the direct purchase of 16.7 million shares and as a result of Southern Copper's repurchase of 4.9 million of its shares. All repurchases at both Grupo Mexico and Southern Copper's level totaled an expenditure of 674 million. Given Grupo Mexico and Southern Copper's attractive share price, the buybacks were generally geared and creating value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In addition, the increase to 80% stake in Southern Copper provides a tax consolidation benefit at the Grupo Mexico level. Total CapEx amounted to 135 million in the first quarter '09, representing an increase of 38 million year-over-year. 118 million were spent in the Mining division and 70 million in the Transportation division. This increase in CapEx is largely related to the construction of the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a SX/EW plant in Peru. However, Southern Copper has continued a careful review of full capital expenditures and meet cutbacks to previously budgeted project. We believe this discipline is required to respond to the current scenario of weakened commodity prices and economic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt at the end of the quarter was little south of 1.7 billion. With a cash balance of almost 1.4 billion. This equivalent to 286 million net debt. Grupo Mexico maintains a lot debt; I mean a low debt level and healthy long-term debt amortization schedule. This allows the company to face the difficult economic times from a solid financial position. Between 2009 and 2014, average debt amortizations will be 83 million per year.</p>
          <p>Our cash position will support our operation needs and our expenditures program. With respect to dividends, last quarter, we paid on February 27, a stock dividend of one share for every 75 Grupo Mexico shares outstanding. It was equivalent to approximately 61 million. For the first quarter of 2009, the company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend payment inclined for one share for every 100 shares outstanding which will be paid from May 11, 2009.</p>
          <p>I'd now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper and will try to keep this brief as Southern Copper already had its conference call. In the first quarter, Southern Copper's net sales were 622 million compared with 450 for the fourth quarter 2008. Cost of sales was 375, a reduction of 28% year-over-year and 19% lower than the fourth quarter 2008. EBITDA was 225 million with an EBITDA margin of 36%. And the net income was nearly 79 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's this quarter 2009 copper production was 120,000 metric tons, 6% lower than the first quarter 2008. It's important to note that excluding 12000 tons of Cananea production obtained during the first quarter 2008, Southern Copper's operating unit La Caridad and Toquepala have increased the production by 4% in the first quarter 2009. La Caridad and IMMSA copper production increased by 11% and 10% respectively. Peruvian open-pit operations increased copper production by 1%. Smelting production was 2% higher in the first quarter of 2009 than the previous quarter of 2008 that is for the first quarter 2008. Southern Copper is in track to achieve its 2009 copper expected production and sales of 470,000 tons, which is the guidance that we have provide previously.</p>
          <p>The company's first quarter '09 cash cost before byproducts was $1.40 per pound, $0.10 lower than the $1.50 per pound for the same period of 2008 and $0.09 lower than the $1.49 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Southern Copper's cash costs included the benefit of byproducts was $0.60 per pound in the first quarter of 2009. The very competitive cash cost was obtained under the severe reduction of both product credits.</p>
          <p>Given the companies increasingly tight cost control and expected benefits from our lower input prices, we believe that Southern Copper is well prepared to manage due to the current downturn of the commodity cycle. We believe our cash cost can improve in 2009 ensuring that the company continues to generate attractive returns in all of our assets.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now pass the call to my colleague Octavio Ornelas, who will discuss the main financial highlights of the railroad and infrastructure division. Octavio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much Daniel. Good afternoon to everybody. I'll now turn to the main results for the first quarter of '09 of the Transportation division represented by the subsidiary ITM, Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico whose was main subsidiaries are Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, which is one that owns Ferromex and of course Ferrosur. Load volumes transported during the first quarter of this year measured in net tons kilometer accounted &#x2013; amounted to 8.59 billion and compares to the 9.16 billion of the first quarter of 2008. This is a year-to-year decrease of 6% as a result of a slowdown in the industrial activity in Mexico and reduced international trade with the United States of America.</p>
          <p>For the whole year of 2009, we continue to estimate load volumes of 38.4 billion net ton kilometers, which will represent a 6.9% decrease over last year's figure. First quarter net sales amounted to 199 million, which represents a 17% annual decrease, mainly to the lower load volumes and the impact of the Mexican pesos depreciation on sales denominated in pesos. I should mention that between 60 &#x2013; 65% of total sales in the Transportation divisions are denominated in pesos.</p>
          <p>The cost of sale was 135 million in the first quarter, which represents a 9% decrease on yearly basis. This reduction was possible due to the containment of cost denominated in pesos including diesel, which is one of the major cost component. It represents around 30% of total operative costs. Ferromex was able to improve its diesel cost per ton- kilometer in dollar terms due to improvements in operations and a favorable effect in fuel efficiency of the new locomotives in spite of the fact that the price of diesel increased 29.5% on yearly basis in peso terms. As a consequence of the above, operating income was 36 million in the first quarter of '09, which represent a 37 yearly decrease and representing on operating margin of 18%. EBITDA during the first quarter of 2009 was 56 million, a decrease of 31.6% and was equivalent to 28% of net sale. The decline was due to the higher sales adjustment over the cost due to the impact of the peso currency devaluation.</p>
          <p>Net income during the first quarter reached 20 million compared with 30 of the last year, which mean, it is 35 lower than last year. Total capital expenditure in the first quarter of '09 amounted to 17 million compared to nearly 40 million last year did represent a 57% fold. As new -- no new locomotive have been acquired during the whole this year.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, CapEx spendings have been mainly for the rehabilitation of rail tracks enlargement and new sidings and the acquisition of railroad equipment, which have increased train velocity, improved operating safety and produce savings in diesel consumption. For 2009, we continue to estimate capital expenditures of around $100 million, which means it's 43% lower than last year's figure. I will now briefly discuss the results of our other subsidiary, Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate with ITM.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of '09, Ferrosur total revenues were 50 million, a decrease of 12% on annual basis. This decrease is mainly attributable to the negative impact of the peso currency devaluation in peso denominated sales by the fact that the load volumes transported increase 8.5% during this period, measure in net tons kilometers for a total of 1.64 billion.</p>
          <p>The improvement in load volumes is mainly attributable to the increase in the agricultural segments as a result of a reduction in maritime load tariffs that trigger more load move by sea, arriving at the Port of Veracruz instead of entering through the U.S. border. Ferrosur operating income was 8 million in the first quarter of '09, a decrease of 1% as compared to last year. EBITDA during the first quarter reached 14.9 million from 15.1 million a year ago, which means a 2% reduction with an EBITDA margin of 28%. The decline was due to higher cost and to the peso currency devaluation impact. Net income during the first quarter of '09 was 5 million compared with one million in the first quarter of last year. Total capital expenditure in the first quarter of '09 will amount -- amount, excuse me, to one million compared to eight, which is a reduction of 85% as compared to 2008. For this year, we estimate capital expenditures to be $22.6 million representing a 25 annual increase over last year.</p>
          <p>With this, I finish and I will now return the call to Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Daniel, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jorge, perfectly thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just mainly follow-up on two of these points you touched upon. Could you clarify the expected tax benefit that you see from consolidating PCU now at 80% ownership and explain if there is a certain threshold that you cross and what would be these tax benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Thank you, Jorge. Well this is a very lengthy matter in terms of and getting into the nitty-gritty of the tax laws and what have you. What I can, let me just put one example that is very clear and will make people understand. Americas Mining is a U.S holding company of Southern Copper, which is another American subsidiary. So at Grupo Mexico level, we have, we receive dividends that go from the U.S. Southern Copper to Americas Mining and then to Mexico. So having 80%, we consolidate Southern Copper at Americas Mining level. That allow us to save approximately 7% of all taxes that were received or were paid at Americas Mining Corporation level. So in a nutshell, 7% of all dividends will be received tax free from now on and that's simplifying the complex actuals. I don't know if that's kind of clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And it is the move that over, once you get to over 80% of a subsidiary that allows you to do the join consolidation, is that the trigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, what if you get under U.S. tax laws? Once you reach 80% of a U.S. subsidiary, you consolidate that subsidiary for tax purposes. And that &#x2013; and when I say consolidate for tax purposes that gives you the whole broad spectrum of consolidation in the spectrum of law &#x2013; of tax law. This is one of the examples and this has been one of the reasons to, for Grupo Mexico to acquire just 5% in addition of what it had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, you said that you would save 7% on the repatriation of dividend. Is this something, which would also affect your marginal tax rate, of your consolidated Grupo Mexico? In other words your -- let's say your current rate in '08 was 35%, our effective rate we're looking for in '09 is around 36. Would this change in consolidation have any impact on your future tax rate at the GMEXICO holding level or are you simply saving the cash flow tax on the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are saving and the example that I explained, we are saving the tax, the cash flow dividend at the AMC level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will have any impact on your Holdco GMEXICO level tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not with the example that I used, no, the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I just found again just this legal update here that you provide, could you also try in a few sense and in a nutshell explain, where we are because what it seems to be saying on page two and three of your press release is if your reorganization plan is backed by &#x2013; which is backed by the asbestos litigants ultimately is accepted by the ASARCO credit securing committee then there could be some important reversals in the direction of certain of the lawsuits, which right now, I guess they have a deal that they would not be, the credit securing committee would not pursue a lawsuit against Sterlite for reneging on their initial deal, obviously if they end up acquiring it. But if they don't, and you guys acquire it then, then you would have the option to sue Sterlite for 2.6 billion, for example. And could you also qualify just if there is any other sort of upcoming dates that are sort of critical to where this process is going either in terms of the fraudulent conveyance lawsuit or the Chapter 11 reorganization plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me start from the last. That they are going to file the plan, it is May 15. We're working on our plan and as you know or you just explained to everybody, our plans will be competing with Sterlite. Also as you pointed out, we have entered into an agreement with the Asbestos Committees, which will allow you to have this 524(g) and that is &#x2013; of an important difference to Sterlite Vedanta's plan if you will.</p>
          <p>We believe that our plan is much better and that it would &#x2013; should prevail in the bankruptcy. If a plan prevails then a protocol will emerge at Chapter-11 being clear from a liabilities and the litigation against Sterlite Vedanta that's an issue that there, Jorge, we sold, and that we will definitely consider it than having.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where would that leave you with the fraudulent conveyance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, that will make their former companies smooth. Because we will &#x2013; and &#x2013; I mean, one of the requirements for our agreement is that we settled the fraudulent conveyance.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, thanks for fielding the call. A quick question, on your press release, you guys estimate that in the case and when <mark type="inaudible" /> falls back into your hands, they would cost 50 to 60 million to get it up and running in about three months. Could you give some more clarity as for the estimate you used for those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jordi, thank you for the question. I mean, just I'll let the rest of team answer in more detail, but I can tell you this that is a rough estimates. And what we're trying to convey is at least the numbers we have now so that you all understand what kind of numbers we're taking about. In the previous press release we put out did not have a particular number, and we understand fully the concerns, because people were not understanding whether we were talking about 100s or we were talking about 1 billion.</p>
          <p>So the idea, which included in the press release, was to kind of give you our rough estimate at the moment. And that is a rough estimate in dollars and that is a rough estimate in terms of timing. Of course, I mean, this still need more work and I'll let either Armando or Jorge expand this comment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can. Thank you, Daniel. I think you're right. This is just an estimate. We put a rush to provide a ballpark figure for the better understanding of our contingencies, and our technicians and experts in general thought that until we enter into the mine and we get into the reality of what has happened there in. We will be able to provide a certain figure right now, it's just that an estimate, and we have to wait till we regain the control of the mine.</p>

          <p>We have had almost on a daily basis a so called emergency team together with people from the union entering to the mine. But what they do is they provide a report that is just a rough estimate of what has happened in one machine or in one equipment or whatever. We have not had a full team of experts entering to provide an analysis that would be more founded. That is what we have. We have a set of reports that allow us to provide the ranch of this figure that we estimate and can be the total of this strike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I say that in revenues the percentage is around &#x2013; between 30 and 35. In the case of the costs components, it is around between 15 and 28% depending upon the month, and they are related mainly to maintenance of locomotives to the &#x2013; all the rentals that we pay for equipment, which are denominated in dollars and the leasings.</p>

          <p>Wait a second. Yeah, I will you give you the figures. I will read it &#x2013; the figures in pesos. The figure in pesos that we &#x2013; respect to having something around 8% higher than the one that was registered in 2008, and because of &#x2013; there has been a lot of movement in dollars in the exchange rate.

          <p>We've seen a lot of cost reductions as I just pointed out in terms of electricity, maintenance, materials et cetera. I mean, we're seeing a lot of volatility in the market. We're happy to see that there was, as I said, restocking in China and that the copper has been performing better than we've expected.</p>
          <p>As you remember, we've &#x2013; our guidance was based on $1.75 per ton of copper in average. So, we're happy where it was. I know that was $1.56 for the first quarter is pretty much on track on what we had. But the outlook is positive.

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And your next question is a follow-up question from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, Jorge with Deutsche Bank, again, sorry. Just to follow up, I know I asked you this question last quarter but to clarify again, the treatment of this one peso, its right now one peso &#x2013; one share per 100 share dividend that you're offering, this would in no way impact your shares outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No this time, it will. So this time, it's coming out of our treasury stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on your the front cover, you're saying that you have as of March 31, I interpret 7.61 billion shares outstanding at GMEX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so if you issue a one for 100 share stock dividend would we expect then your share count from this number to rise to 1%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is this in terms of dividend policy, I do note that both PCU and GMEX in the last few quarters are switch to paying more stock based dividends after the recent buybacks and obviously the conserved cash. Do you see this GMEX is sort of being a temporary measure, and would you see reverting back to a cash dividend, or is this now maybe for 2009 a more favorite way to pay dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, that has only happened at Grupo M&#xE9;xico level though at PCU still has been paying the dividends in cash and the idea of the Board was to be consistent and to try to even go in the hardest times to keep up with your dividend efforts at the Southern Copper level.</p>
          <p>At Grupo, you could expect this &#x2013; I mean, it's been analyzed every quarter and this time it was shares as you just pointed out, couple of quarters earlier as well. I cannot pretty much confirm that this is going to be the future trend. I think once the copper prices start to yield cash flows might turn out to be again cash. This is something that the Board analyzes every quarter Jorge in the projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your comments earlier about &#x2013; I thought I heard you say that you are bullish on second half copper prices, and on the Southern Copper call, I learned that PCU is unhedged going into 2009. So I just wanted to collaborate that sort of the house view from your company that you want to stay unhedged because you're very optimistic about second half copper prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are unhedged, I can confirm that for 2009. As you know we hedge for 2008 but &#x2013; and 2009 we have not hedged yet. And we are very optimistic and I think, our expectations at this moment have proven to be correct. We're still bullish as you just said for second half of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And sorry, lastly, can I just re-clarify some of the dollar amounts on this lawsuit and restructuring plans, basically your plan as in the press is about 1.3 billion to repurchase effectively ASARCO's assets. That 1.3 billion would go into a fund to basically payoff all of the claimants that are settled thus far with the exception of the Asbestos claimants, which have agreed to go with your plan but you have not disclosed the dollar amount. So in other words, is there a possibility that the actual all in cost of ASARCO would be 1.3 plus the Asbestos settlements whatever that ends up being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Let me try to clarify this, I know it is very complex and, and the whole Chapter 11 and all the conveyance, and the way they interrelate and what have you at greater confusions in the market. Let me just sort of clarify that, I mean we're not repurchasing the company because we own 100% of the equity. So in a way, what we're doing is, we're between $1.3 billion into ASARCO, if you will, that just where to ASARCO to have that 1.3 plus the 1.3 cash position they currently have that's 2.6.</p>
          <p>In order to be able to pay out their liabilities and including investors, environmental and all the other creditors that that are in registered in the bankruptcy. So, that means that we are going to prepare waterfall so that the &#x2013; I mean the way they call it and which is how our plan will distribute this resources for this cash. Is that &#x2013; there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry I forgot to mention the cash at ASARCO, but in other words then you would look at the cash within ASARCO as being able to take down or have you saying cascade and pay for these Asbestos undefined publically defined specified liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then assuming that just to throw out a number if the magic number comes out at 2 billion and you can settle all claimants with that amount then there would still be 600 million of residual cash inside ASARCO, and then ASARCO itself would have some kind of an enterprise value off of its EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the assumption, the way would work it is correct. We believe that creditors are entitled to be paid in full, not a windfall. However, the number you just said they were examples. I mean the way -- the way it works is -- at this moment where we only have is the plan of ASARCO and Sterlite and Vedanta which really have a waterfall with different numbers that you just used, but any ways, I mean the example is correct. That's the way it should work. If there is anything left, it should be residual value for the equity owner. And as you know, we're 100% owners of the equity of ASARCO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry I know this is dragging out, but it does seem like just that the two opposing or sorry the two sides of the claimant's equation are kind of far apart. It does seem that the creditors and environmental have tended to side with Vedanta's restructuring plan while the asbestos claimants are siding with your restructuring plan. Would that be a fair characterization and is there a risk that that would kind of impede except in one plan or the other because it does seem that you need kind of uniformally all creditors to accept the plan, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is a fair characterization. We've reached an agreement with asbestos. We have not reached yet an agreement with the other creditor. They've supported the plan that was filed previously. But that is what we have now. That's why we are looking at our plan and I apologize I cannot disclose the details of our plan until we file it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Claudia Madina with Banco Ita&#xFA;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, how are you? I have first question is what -- I don't know if it's a bit, if it's pertinent or not, but, what -- are there any security measures or any particular cost associated with the flu epidemic at the mines or facilities? And secondly, is there any plan to increase ownership in PCU?</p>
          <p>Because I don't know maybe I am fantasizing a bit here, but just thinking that in the worst possible weird scenario where GMexico is forced to give away 30% of PCU's shares, and for some reason, ASARCO ones are being sold to Sterlite, I am guessing that having 1 or 2% additional ownership in PCU would just ensure that GMexico would not have to face any issues regarding consolidation or de-consolidation or sharing ownership with somebody else. Is this accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; I'll let Armando answer the swine flu epidemic in the mines or Jorge. But let me just answer the latter part of the question, Claudia, and that is I mean certainly, we have now, it is a judgment we're going to appeal. We believe if worst comes worst, as you just pointed our after appeals and all legal remedies we have available because we don't agree with the judgment of Judge Hanen. If worst comes worst, stock would be transferred to ASARCO, at which point ASARCO would be solvent, and it have to, and it will emerge out of Chapter 11.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we will end up having a solvent company out of Chapter 11 and owning roughly 29% of Southern Copper to ASARCO and the rest 51% through American Mining Corporation. So we, at this moment, we don't envision the scenario that you pointed out. This is the way we look at the scenario and that's what we have on hand. Plus if you think about it from the Chapter 11 or bankruptcy proceedings, we do believe also that our plan will be successful and that it is a better plan than the competing plan. So in both scenarios, you will end up with ASARCO moving out of Chapter 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then I should by no means expect any increase whatsoever on GMexico's ownership on PCU, current 80%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think what &#x2013; I think what you are asking is something that I cannot confirm.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what we can -- what I can tell you is that we are happy with the consolidation, and we feel very strongly about our legal remedies available in the ASARCO Chapter 11, and fraudulent conveyance issues.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>And with regard to the flu emergency, I simply can state that we are following the orders of our authorities. At this juncture, we are not anticipating any production impact at any of our Mexican mine facilities. And as you may have seen, we are trying to wear masks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know again, I'm thinking as people are afraid of having too many people together in an enclosed space, well I can't think of any better example than that &#x2013; than a mine. So do you believe that at any point, there could be an instance where the authorities just say, you know what guys, close the mine for whatever I don't know two weeks, or do you think that being possible at all?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>More importantly, Claudia, one thing to remember is that most of the production of copper comes out of an open pit mine, which is, I don't know if you've been to an open pit mine, but it's very different of what you just pictured in your mind, which probably applies to underground mines, if you will.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. My question relates to the fraudulent conveyance ruling. And one of the concerns of the credit rating agencies for Southern Copper was the possibility of pressure on their balance sheet. And they commented that the Group would have put up a certain amount of money for an appeal bond.</p>
          <p>So my question really is, do you have any information on the amount of this appeal bond? Is this something that will happen soon or can you delay it until after your ASARCO Chapter 11 plan filing? And maybe just any other measures you might take to maintain Southern Copper's investment grade credit rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, first of all, we do believe that the investment grade of Southern Copper will not be touched, if you will. And second, our lawyers are currently actively working with the court in terms of how the appeal processes could be guaranteed, if you will, but we don't envision any kind of debt or any other thing that could impact on the investment grade rating of Southern Copper at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Does that mean you're in touch with the rating agencies on what would trigger this and you'll make sure that &#x2013; that you &#x2013; that company doesn't reach the sort of, let's say increased indebtedness levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I mean is that the judgment against us or Judge Hanen &#x2013; Hanen's judgment against us was totally expected &#x2013; unexpected because we believe it went far away, if you will. And we have, since then, we've been working with the rating agencies as well, yes that is right. I can confirm that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Marti Murray with Babson Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I have a couple of questions about the fraudulent conveyance litigation in ASARCO. Is it your view that the 1.3 billion that you've offered to put for ASARCO, is that enough to pay off all the creditors in full or is &#x2013; or is that more a good faith deposit that you're putting down to back up your plan of reorganization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me try to clarify that again. Basically, what &#x2013; what the other competing plan was a payment of $1.1 billion in cash, was a note in nine years. What we've done is we are offering and we're working on the plan, what we publicly disclosed and filed and told the court that we're willing to put $1.3 billion in cash. So that is plus the cash on hand at ASARCO. And that will be distributed according to a waterfall which is what I referred to, which is the way the 2.6 billion will be distributed among creditors, and we're working on the details of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And my question was do you &#x2013; is it your view that that 2.6 billion in consideration is enough to pay off all the creditors in full?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view is that what we currently &#x2013; as you remember, most of the liabilities or some of the liabilities I should say have not been determined yet. We've been asking for determination. What we know now is what the other plan and the waterfall of ASARCO and Sterlite-Vedanta have on the paper. Do we believe that our plan at the end when we file it, we will be able to pay everybody in full, yes.</p>
          <p>That is correct. However, we are working on the details. It's not done with the 2.6 will suffice or I mean we're working on details and we're talking to constituencies in order to determine a way that everybody is paid in full. But you've got to bear in mind that liabilities have not have been determined yet by the court.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then with respect to the appeal on the fraudulent conveyance litigation, are you appealing the liability part of it or just the damages or both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're -- we're appealing all. I mean we think there &#x2013; their judgment wasn't correct and that we are appealing on all -- on all three counts, which damages are tied together for the three counts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there a timeline by which you're going to know whether you have to post a bond and in what amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working on that as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you think that you would be able to just put forward the stock in Southern Copper as the bond as opposed to cash, or would it have to be cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that's what we're working on. We're hoping that we don't have to put either. I mean we are a very solvent company and we don't believe that we have to put either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Alejandro Luciano with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just had a quick question. Can Sterlite in any way sort of submit a new plan where they increase their offer? And are they &#x2013; under your agreement with the asbestos committee, are they allowed to negotiate with them or is your agreement basically final?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I think Sterlite-Vedanta can file whatever they want anytime they want. I'm not sure, and I obviously don't know what they are going to do and what they are planning. What I can tell you is that we have a reading agreement with the &#x2013; the asbestos currently and that that has an exclusivity among us with the 424 &#x2013; with the 534G. So that is what we can disclose at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right thanks. And just going back to sort of the appeal bonds and the questions that have been asked, so in terms of cash at PCU, you do not intend to use any of that cash to, or basically any resources at PCU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, PCU is not a party to the litigation, and we don't intend to use any cash in PCU. I mean PCU has its own Board and their own projects, their own CapEx, their own dividend decisions. No, the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick questions. In how long are you expecting a decision of the Judge Hanen in the brownfield trial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the decision of Judge Hanen has been already issued. Our appeal is not in Judge Hanen's court. That is in a separate court.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then how long do you think that we are going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, in terms of our litigation proceedings, it is very, very hard to predict. It could take &#x2013; it could take some months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And one more, how much of the CapEx of GMexico and Ferromex is focused to the maintenance CapEx?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's infrastructure, which is maintenance. It is transportation in order to build better yards. It's in security, it's in telecom basically that's where we're going to spend the money.</p>
