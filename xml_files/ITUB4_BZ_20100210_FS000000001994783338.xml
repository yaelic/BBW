        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and good afternoon for all of you.  I would like to start this presentation talking about some of the highlights we had this quarter, starting with the earnings.  We had strong earnings, 2.8 billion of recurrent net income which shows ROE of 22.6%.  Our final net income was 3.2 billion and I'll talk more about that explaining the differences.</p>
          <p>But most of the extraordinary items were related to the payment of the federal tax law, which gave incentives to payments, and we took advantage of that.  I would like to mention, and we will see also this along the presentation that we had not used any of the anticycle provisions that we have on our balance sheet, so this was a very strong recurrent earnings because we are not really using any of the provisions we have done previously, and we will talking more about that.</p>
          <p>One of the important things on the quarter was the NPL ratio which have improved, both 60 and 90 days, and this is a trend as we are now in the third quarter that will remain for the year and also we'll talk more about that.</p>
          <p>I'd like to go to page three and I won't read the number, you can see that most of the numbers, I'll basically talk some of the cycles that we have there.  First, I would like to show, to call your attention on the ROE of the quarter, 22.6% very strong and very stable along the year, which shows our capacity to deliver an ROE along these levels in different scenarios.</p>
          <p>We have also done improvement in our efficiency ratio.  If you look our number in 2008 was 45% and now it's down to 42.4, so a good improvement and also taking advantage of ideal synergies of our merger between Itau and Unibanco, and also we introduced this risk adjusted efficiency ratio, which also that takes into account in addition to the costs, taking to account the losses on risks. And it was &#x2013; at the end of the day, we increased the losses but we could manage this with revenues and cost cutting for the final, the final ratio was basically the same year-to-year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next screen, we see how the extraordinary effects, where the quarter as I mentioned we had this new law that allowed us to avoid taxes that were <mark type="inaudible" /> had incentives to pay that, and those taxes was on litigation with some incentives, but since we had provisions, we had a positive impact in our balance sheet for that.</p>
          <p>On Page 5 and we can see the P&amp;L, for the quarter, for the year as compared to previous quarter and previous years.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in the quarter, we had not used any of the provisions &#x2013; additional provisions for loan losses, this was the first quarter that we had not done that in the year.  So, if you look on the column of the year, you can see that we had used 1.6 billion of provisions that we had on our balance sheet in December last year.  It was not the case of the last quarter, showing how strong was the results of the quarter.  I also would like to mention the growth on our service fees, 9.8 in this quarter, which reversed the trend of the year.  Quarter was strong and we have overcome some of the restrictions that was imposed by Central Bank and adjusted some fees that we were charging clients and we are not able anymore to do it, but now this was in the beginning of the year.  Now we are more, in a more current, recurrent level of income, giving the doubt for the quarter that had some seasonal volume.</p>
          <p>But we don't have any restrictions now to face ahead, so we see a more normal playing field ahead.  Provisions was the highlight of the quarter, strong reduction on provisions, we are talking about 600 million reduction in provisions, which were very much welcome and well anticipated for us when we had the last call.</p>
          <p>Recovery of credit is also improving, as you can see. This is natural again because of the cycle that we are now going through; it's a positive cycle, so we will have strong recoveries in the coming quarters, given the provisions and losses that we have had in the previous quarter.  And, now we are on the good part of the cycle, given that the economy will grow like 5.5% for 2010, this is our expectations.</p>
          <p>I think this, on the expenses side, we have &#x2013; I'll talk more about that in the coming slides, but I just show you that for the year we have a 4.1 growth on expenses, below inflation, so that we are already seeing some of the benefits of the merger, of the cost cutting, synergies that we had expected.  As I mentioned when I commented with you the efficiency ratio, but I'll talk more about that on the presentation.</p>
          <p>The long evolution was positive in the last quarter of the year. It was the stronger quarter, also giving the cycle of economy and also the seasonality of the year.  We had a strong growth in credit cards during Christmas and end of year parties, and also in small companies.  So these we should -- our total growth for -- to 3.6% and for the year 2.4. But when we talk about Itau loans which had a much more stronger impact in revenues, we are talking about 5.7 growth in the quarter and a 14% growth for the year.  In the year that was not especially strong given the recession for part of the year.  Going ahead, we can see that non-performing loans improving.  We are reducing NPLs ratios and as I mentioned we have not used any of the additional provisions that we have in the balance sheet on this quarter, coverage ratio stayed almost stable.</p>
          <p>And in next slide we can see in a different way that expenses for provisions are increasing when compared to the credit portfolio and also in the next page we are seeing the funding in asset under management that the bank manages -- the total number has improved for the year, 13% with some highlights in the last quarter and especially in savings deposits and demand deposits, which are lower cost deposits.  And also you can see that for the year we have reduced institutional investors.  We have reduced market deposits from banks and secured insurance, which are more expensive cost of &#x2013; expense are more costly for us.  So we're giving our very liquid position today.  We are emphasizing more the low cost products for the bank.</p>
          <p>As you can see on Page 10, our liquidity ratios are very comfortable.  So we are in this stage of not really having to go.  We're not going to the market to fund the bank.  We're basically it on the client base and we're very comfortable with this current situation.  When we see the fee revenue on Slide 11 we can see good progress in this last quarter.  We have some seasonality, but also we have as I mentioned the economy push has helped the numbers.  For the year we had some problems at the beginning of the year, given some restrictions, as I mentioned, from the Central Bank and Justice -- but now this is over.  We are back to growth on the revenues, fee revenues.</p>
          <p>With expenses on Page 12, we have important figures here, I would like to &#x2013; point of view I would like to share with you.  First, although we had a 7% growth in the last quarter, we had only a 4% for the year.  The 7% growth has a lot to do with two things, which are very seasonal in our case.  One, is the personnel expenses, which grew 9% most being the 7% increased salary that we had for all banking system personnel and also given the fact that ERMs we have extra hour payments given them more intense use of banking and the economy activity that was more intense in the last quarter.  We have more extra hours payment.  So this explains a personnel -- increase in personnel expenses.</p>
          <p>On the side of other expenses, we had marketing expenses usually at year end are more intense,  so this explains most of the numbers there, but I would like to show you when you look on the quarter, left of this screen you can compare, although it grew 7% compared to last quarter, it  decreased when we compare to last quarter of 2008.  So it was a 3.8% decrease when we compare year-to-year quarter, so which give the picture more clear about the seasonality and things like that.  So this was a good improvement I believe. And when you look those orange bars on your right side, you can see that quarter-to quarter, the last two quarters were better than 2008 quarters.  Although the beginning of the year was higher and they were higher basically because during the 2008 year, both Itau and Unibanco they were in growth mode, so we end up in a running rate expense in 2008 much above the beginning of the year of 2008.  So this change in level of expenses explains why we had this first quarter 2009 and 2008 growth, which was not the case when we compare year-end quarters.</p>
          <p>This can be better observed on page 13 with this improvement on the efficiency ratio.  When we talk about the risk adjusted efficiency ratio, you can see that we are floating around one at the same level, which shows our capacity to manage the higher level losses during this crisis periods.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratio on the Slide 14 have kept strong, we are very comfortable with the numbers that we are going at this moment now.  And you can see that we have a lot of room for Tier 2 capital which we are not using at this moment.</p>
          <p>When we talk about segments on Slide 16, we can see that we have the three major segments of our business, very good and decent, RAROC ratios.  And this was given the very complicated year and very good year at the end of the day given all the numbers and all the segments that we have &#x2013; we could manage in all the three segments good results.</p>
          <p>On Screen 17, I would like to share with you the numbers that and how the Porto Seguro impacted our results.  As you can see a very small impact on our net income, almost negligible change, although line to line numbers, there is some impact there that you can see on this screen.  And importantly that was a very small impact on bottom line.</p>
          <p>On Page 18, we gave you our view and guidance for year 2010.  We are expecting 5.5 GDP growth.  This would imply a good growth in credit.  We are talking about between 15 and 19% growth on credit.  But I would like to call your attention, this is the number for individuals.  But I would like to call your attention for numbers 19 and 23 that are in the same line in parenthesis, which talks about the performing loans.</p>
          <p>Performing loans would grow 19 to 23%, so higher than the number that you see in balance sheet.  And this is due to the fact that we are expecting a lot of write-offs during the year, write-off of loans that has already been provisioned, so this will not have meaningful impact in the results.  But you have impact in the growth comparing the balances of credit between one year and another.  So we have a big difference in this number.  This difference is even higher when you look for the number of small company credit growth.  On 2.1 number here in the page, we have a much higher growth when we talk about performing loans than when you have comparing the numbers of the balance sheet, this is due again the write-off.</p>
          <p>NPLs, we believe that will decrease from current levels, the delinquency will improve along the year even though we are expecting some increase in interest rates we still believe that NPLs will decrease during the year.</p>
          <p>Banking fees we expect to grow between 10 and 15%.  When we talk about expenses excluding credit card and Porto Seguro, we are talking about 3 to 5% growth.  But if we do not include expansion costs, which means costs that actually related to new point-of-sales which means new branches, new platforms for small companies, new point-of-sales in partnerships that we already have like Americanas or <mark type="inaudible" />.  We are opening new point-of-sales.  This would have subsequent <mark type="inaudible" />.  If we do not include the cost of the new point-of-sales, we are talking about expenses growing between zero and 3% which clearly shows some improvements and it's a result of our synergies in other values.</p>
          <p>I would like to finish this presentation at this point and open up for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone.  Thank you for hosting this call.  I have two questions about the guidance that you have presented for 2010; first, could you talk us about Itau Unibanco's outlook for the growth for the Brazilian banking sector overall?  Do you anticipate that Itau Unibanco will be able to maintain its market share post merger?  And secondly, on fee income growth you talk about a level of 10 to 15% now that you've seen a normalization in the regulatory environment and the adjustment that we've seen on individual pricing for fees, can you talk about what kind of fees should be driving this growth.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason.  Well, we expect as I mentioned, 5.5% growth in the economy.  And we, the numbers we are showing here as the guidance are numbers that basically have in some lines some gaining market share, like small companies for instance, and some others stabilization of market share.  We are not &#x2013; and we are following these numbers closely, we are not expecting any loss of market share in 2010.  Regarding the fees growth, we are basically expecting growth coming from volumes.  We are not really implementing here in these numbers any major change in the pricing of our services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow up on the fees, is the fee income from the investment banking operations driving a signification portion of that, they were quite strong already, we saw some reasonable revenue already there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Marc is here, so he can talk something about investment bank perspective for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just looking specifically at the investment banking side of the equation, I mean, we do expect overall a fairly supportive market in 2010 versus 2009.  As you know half of 2009 was basically a write-off as we had a very strong third and fourth quarter in terms of investment banking business.  So I mean, in terms of perspective I think we are &#x2013; we sort of have a positive bias I would say and as such I think the contribution if you will of investment banking fees to the overall fees of the group should continue to remain strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jason, also like to call your attention that this number, 10 to 15, is also highly impacted by credit card fees, which credit card we expecting to keep the same level of growth that we have &#x2013; we have had last years, about 18 to 20%.  This are the numbers that the market are expecting for credit card growth, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Roberto.  I think you mentioned in your presentation that you expect, as most people, interest rates to start rising in the year.  Could you elaborate and give us some color how do you see that impacting your margins and top line income.  In 2009 we ended up having a pretty solid top line income in large part because your treasury operations contributed very nicely.  How do you see things playing in 2010 now that you widely, most people would say interest rates would start to rise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Daniel.  Thank you for being with us this morning.  Well, we are expecting the interest rates to increase as the market appoints.  But we do not expect any meaningful at all impact of this directly because of the increase in interest rates.  We expect margins to come down a little bit.  But &#x2013; and I say a little bit because this will be in the different way -- rates will be increasing, so margins will not come down as much as they could if rates were not increasing but they will still come down somehow.  And also what else &#x2013; you mentioned a third item on your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Treasury contributed very nicely in 2009 but it was really the interest rate environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right.  Treasury was a great contribution in 2009.  We do not expect and we do not count on this for 2010 and '11, and I think the levels of gains on markets were very high, we're not expecting to &#x2013; we're expecting some decrease in that line.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.  I have two questions.  The first one is on expenses for the fourth quarter, if we add up your personnel expenses and administrative expenses, they grew roughly 12% quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us some color on if there were some one-timers there. Obviously, the seasonality in the fourth quarter implies stronger growth, but it seems that the growth was a bit higher than the seasonality is.  Was there any one-off that we should expect to see going forward?  And the second question is, you are talking about volume growth of around 15 to 20% year-over-year, so I am assuming that on average, growth is going to be closer to 15% for the year with some pressure on margins, as you mentioned, and a much lower trading environment.  Are we talking about financial income growth closer to 10%, maybe for the year?  What's your expectation for that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, good to hear you here with us this morning.  I am not sure your numbers on expenses because the numbers that I am showing on the page 12 shows 7% increase on costs. So you mention something like 12%.  If you have the slides -- we are adding all expenses all together including personnel, administrative, other operating expenses, tax expenses and this adds up to 6.7 billion on the fourth quarter, so I'm not really sure what numbers have you mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm just looking at personnel expenses plus other admin expenses.  Personnel expenses grew 9.4% and admin expenses grew 14% quarter-over-over and those two jumps are the ones I am trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, personnel expenses we can explain very easily.  We had a 7% increase in salaries for the whole banking sector in Brazil on June, September.  So the last quarter has really the impact of those expenses there.  In addition to that, we have extra hours payments in the last quarter given the -- which increases always in the last quarter, given the more intensity at periods of active of the economy in this last quarter.</p>
          <p>So this probably explains most of the variation on personnel expenses.  On administrative expenses, we have marketing expenses which usually has a seasonal expending higher -- the expending is higher in the last quarter.  So this explains part of it.  In addition, we have like I mentioned, more intensity. So mainly like energy water and everything is higher and also some services that we have, services that we closed the year and we have to finalize some contracts. Not sure if Silvio wants to mention anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think you covered everything. Just remember, Jorge, we have more number of transactions during the first quarter.  It means that the cost higher is related with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding my second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was your second question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is I am just trying to understand when you put together your guidance for long growth plus a margin contraction, plus much lower treasury operations. What's your expectations for financial income growth, obviously before provisions?  If you just do a quick math, you probably end up with somewhere around 10 to 12% growth in financial income. Does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not giving any guidance on growth on total revenues as we were mentioning, but we will have some growth.  Okay we are not hiding -- these numbers, I don't have a clear number here to give you but we will have growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me.  Our next question comes from Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody.  I want to understand the dynamics on your net interest margin of changes in rates a little bit more fully.  You, maybe Silvio you can help us here, but if you -- as I look at your annualized margin this year, excluding treasuries, it actually increased over the course of the year 10.3% fourth quarter of "08, 6% fourth quarter '09, even as rates have come down.  And if I look at the components, that is because the annualized rate on spread sensitive transactions increased meaningfully even more than offset the impact of lower rates on rate sensitive transactions.</p>
          <p>All of which would seem to imply that as rates go up, that net net is more of a negative for you in terms of your net interest margin, which is a little bit contrary to what was said earlier that higher rates will actually stem the declining in net interest margins.  So can you just help us understand how you think about the impact of higher rates on your margins because it looks like lower rates actually benefited you net-net in 2009?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what we saw that our financial margin, net interest margin show us increase 90%.  The reason basically is because we have some increasing spread during the year, even consider that the interest rate is reduced, but we increased spreads because of the increasing delinquency.  It was basically the reason because we had this impact that we have very good result relate with the treasury, you saw that.  When you see the movement in the future interest rates, we mentioned that we are not impacting the net interest margin.  We will suffer any movement during 2010 just because we have the &#x2013; the lower of the portfolio, that the duration is about 20 months, this will not impact it material for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Silvio, just the duration on your loans is roughly about 20 months? Is that what I heard from you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, basically, it's just a higher lending spread gradually impacted the -- over the course of the year the spreads on your spread sensitive transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Yeah.  This will not happen immediately.  It will have some -- take some time this to appear in the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And second question is just also a follow up on the treasury results. I think in the past conference call, you know, I asked, kind of, how to think about a more reasonable run rate for treasuries and I think the floor -- I think it was mentioned that the floor on treasury income on a quarterly basis may be in the neighborhood of 4 to 500 million per quarter.  Can you just help us understand what is in that treasury result and kind of how to think about what's more of core recurring revenue stream and what's more, a little bit more volatile in a quarterly basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we put in best line, all the transaction that we do with market, counterparts market and well it's, they had to talk about a number there.  I can tell you that this year the number was much stronger than the usual number that we would expect for that kind of line.  The numbers can vary a lot and we believe that this was a very strong number for the year of 2009.  If you compared 2009 to 2008, you can see that 2008 was 2.1 billion and 2009, 5.6 billion, so was a major increase.  I think these numbers of 2009 above the expected number that we can put -- we can expect for 2010, much above.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone.  I have two questions, the first one regarding the growth in your -- individuals portfolio.  Can you elaborate a little bit more on which segments are going to drive the growth, more specifically if you could mention also the vehicle financing segment.  And the second question is about the Hipercard. What are your plans for Hipercard going forward, I mean do you still see them operating independently full integrated model, or you think at some point it would make sense eventually to have Hipercard integrated, at least the acquiring business into the Redicard platform?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the side of the growth on loans, we have divided into consumers and companies.  Companies, we have already mentioned that small companies will outgrow big companies.  We expect growth for big companies, but much higher growth for small companies, as we put on the Screen 18.  On the side of consumers, we believe that credit cards to be one driver, important driver, and credit to conciliado will be another driver.  Those will be the two ones that will be pushing the number for consumers.  We have also mortgages which will be important number.  Will grow a lot, although the number comes from a very low base and will have a small impact in 2010.  And the other question?</p>

          <p>Yeah, good morning.  I had a quick question, a follow-up on the prior question, regarding Redicard.

We are very happy with the investment that we have there.  We believe that's a big company.  It's a lot of potential in Brazil to grow, but I will not talk specifically about our Redicard operations in this call.</p>

          <p>Hi.  I had a question about insurance income in the quarter.  I noticed that the net results of insurance operations was higher.  I know some of that's probably due to the loss ratio in Q4 being lower, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about it and also how the Porto Seguro transaction will effect that line item going forward?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Porto Seguro transactions as you know we -- it will affect our numbers because we will be consolidating 30% of Porto Seguro in our balance sheet.  We will not consolidate 100%.  We will consolidate under Brazilian laws 30%, which is our participation in that investment.  As we have on Page 17 the numbers and how they impacted our quarter line by line, so you can -- these are the numbers for the quarter.  As you know, we started consolidated Porto Seguro in this last quarter.  So there is not &#x2013; since there is no previous influence on the numbers. So you can see line by line how it impacted our P&amp;L.  We believe that Porto Seguro is a great company.  We are very positive on the -- this deal, we think the integration is going well.  We have already selected the people that is moving to Porto Seguro, so things are moving.  We are very positive on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But -- so going forward I guess in the summary income statement, the net result of operation insurance pension plan capitalization, that line item, that's going to -- you didn't provide guidance on that.  So is that going to grow roughly inline with other fee income or is it going to be moving a little bit differently?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  Just two questions from me, one, on asset quality and looking at the implication on the improvement in asset quality, which we see from your guidance, is that corporate credit is going to improve more rapidly than that of the individual credit? Is this a market thing or is this because you have been &#x2013; Itau Banco has been -- shall we say more cautious or more conservative in terms of marking down corporate credit during the weaker part of the cycle.  So is this something of non-performing loans going back into performing?  And secondly, on personnel expenses and operating expenses generally and looking at the expansion plan.  Do you -- I just want to confirm, I don't think you do &#x2013; do you capitalize any of those expansion costs of new branches or will you put those all through the P&amp;L?  In other words are all those costs in the 3 to 5% guidance that you are giving?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- in the first question, we are expecting as you could see on -- our guidance for 2010 has same kind of growth on the balance sheet for consumers and companies, although when you look on the side of companies you have higher growth on the small companies and when you look on consumers, you have higher growth on credit cards and conciliado.  So -- but basically, at the end of the day, it's much more a market opportunity than we see than any other thing.  I will not &#x2013; I don't have a opinion of if you have been more conservative than others or not. I think it is very difficult to mention anything on that area.  And your other question was related to &#x2013; no, we do not capitalize any kind of expenses.  In the year 2010, we are expecting to expense or to have expenses given the merger and the branch unification program, we expect to have additional expenses of R$550 million.  This is the net effect of taxes of the program of unifying the branches.  And this is already included in the numbers that we gave you on expenses as guidance for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Sorry, coming back to the first question, I didn't explain myself very clearly, you are sort of implying by the guidance you give on the accrual -- on the accrual basis for loans that asset quality is going to improving more quickly in corporates and in SMEs.  Is that because you have been more conservative in your book in terms of writing down corporates?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or it's just -- it's just a product of the cycle, the returning cycle and improving growth?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victor, just to remember, the biggest companies here, you have talk about big, big companies in Brazil.  They are utilizing more the capital market to get funding.  They are <mark type="inaudible" /> operations and that's one of the reasons, because if you look the service fees, you will see that our commissions increasing within the quarter.  And they do have two effects in this line, in big corporate loans.  First is related with the appreciation of the Real that's the -- one of the reasons because the portfolio decrease.  The second because the demand is more related with the capital markets.</p>

          <p>Hi gentlemen.  Well, a great part of my questions were already answered, but I would like to know if Itau already start selling Porto Seguro products on its branch network.  And if not when it will start?  And what is your expectation of commission revenues per year with that?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not started as -- as a whole.  We are testing some alternatives of how to offer clients the insurance that Porto Seguros is managing.  We are creating the shell of interaction.  We are testing it and indeed during this year we will be fully serving clients with Porto Seguro's product, which is not the case so far.  But this will happen along the year.  I'm not sure exactly the date, but we have -- and also because we are testing.  In the case of revenues, we will have commissions of around 30% of premiums of the insurance that we sell on the branch side.</p>
