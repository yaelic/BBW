          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2012 Fourth Quarter and Annual Results Conference Call on January 17, 2013. Throughout today's introduction, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Go ahead, please, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, is Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO; and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>As the operator suggested, the subject of today's call is ASML's fourth quarter and annual 2012 results. This call is also being broadcast live over the internet at www.asml.com, and a replay of the call will be available on our website for approximately 90 days.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Security Laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at www.asml.com, and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filled with the Securities and Exchange Commissions.</p>
          <p>The length of the call will be 60 minutes and, before we begin the Q&amp;A, I'd like to turn it over for a brief introduction by Mr. Eric Meurice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Before we begin the Q&amp;A session, Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary as usual.</p>
          <p>Peter will start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. We'd like to comment on the short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with a brief status update on EUV.</p>
          <p>So Peter, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. Our fourth quarter results are very much in line with expectations that we set at the end of the third quarter. Our fourth quarter sales results came in just above our guidance. This quarter's sales again remained largely skewed towards the foundry/IDM sectors, which was 87% of total and that included non-critical KrF systems, which supported capacity additions. The combined memory represented the balance of 13%.</p>
          <p>By the way, we are now reporting memory sales bookings and backlog as one total value due to decreasing transparency around system allocations between DRAM and NAND. The ASP of all systems recognized in Q4 was EUR 22.5 million, a decrease of about 10% from the previous quarter affected by an increased percentage of used systems. Service and field option sales hit a record level of EUR 257 million this quarter, which I will come back to in a moment.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net bookings came in at EUR 667 million for 32 systems, excluding EUV, with booked ASPs of EUR 20.9 million versus EUR 25 million in the third quarter. The quarter's bookings ASP was impacted by a higher percentage of KrF and used systems, clearly not indicative for future bookings, which will reflect the secular trend of higher value technology buys. Our order backlog at the end of Q4 was EUR 1.2 billion including 46 systems but excluding EUV and the backlog profile at quarter's end remained very similar to that at the end of the prior quarter with a slight further movement in favor of foundry and IDM.</p>
          <p>Regarding our fourth quarter and total 2012 income tax charge, I'd like to point out that we released almost EUR 120 million of our accrued tax liability during the fourth quarter as a result of the favorable conclusion of tax audits in various tax jurisdictions outside the Netherlands and this resulted in a nearly complete offset of total income tax due on ASML earnings for the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding share buybacks, we completed our EUR 1.1 billion program during Q4 with the repurchase of approximately EUR 4 million shares, reducing our total share count to about 407 million as of the end of the year.</p>
          <p>As a result, ASML has now returned more than EUR 4 billion in cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends since 2006. Furthermore, due to ASML's strong financial position and operating cash flow prospects, we intend to continue our policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. However, for regulatory reasons, ASML will not announce any new share buyback program before Cymer's extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which will be held on February 5, 2013.</p>
          <p>ASML intends to again increase the dividend by 15% compared to last year; therefore, we will submit a proposal to the 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders to declare a dividend in respect of 2012 of EUR 0.53 per ordinary share compared to a dividend of EUR 0.46 per ordinary share paid in respect of 2011.</p>
          <p>As to the outlook, we currently anticipate the sales levels for 2013 to come in at an approximately similar level as in 2012. However, second half 2013 sales will be higher than first half sales, largely due to the timing of next node investments of our foundry customers. Therefore, we anticipate Q1 total sales coming in at about EUR 850 million with a gross margin of about 38%. The gross margin in the first quarter is temporarily affected by the under absorption of our fixed production cost due to the lower sales level in the first quarter and on top of this the under absorption is fueled by the EUV production infrastructure which will only start seeing cost coverage once we start shipping EUV, which will be in Q2.</p>
          <p>The impact of under absorption accounts for approximately 2.5 percentage points of gross margin. We expect our gross margin to recuperate in the coming quarters when sales volumes increase and EUV shipment starts ramping. R&amp;D for the quarter will be about EUR 185 million with other income, which consist of contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program, of EUR 16 million. We intend to spend a total of between EUR 750 million and EUR 850 million on R&amp;D in 2013, with our co-investment partners contributing EUR 200 million in cash, thereby fully matching our incremental R&amp;D spend on a cash basis.</p>
          <p>However, as explained in previous quarters, as a result of the required accounting treatment for the co-investment contribution, the effect on our statement of operations will vary based upon the business volume of one of the key co-investment partners. The contribution of this partner will be included in the gross margin whereas the contribution of the other two participants will be accounted for as other income under the operating income line.</p>
          <p>Actuals of the co-investment contribution to R&amp;D will be reported at the end of each quarter and SG&amp;A will continue at the slightly elevated level of EUR 63 million as we anticipate about EUR 6 million in additional expenses related to the pending Cymer acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now going into 2013, we see sustained demand for the logic sector for continued 28-nanometer node ramps. We also recognize the strategic importance of the transition biologic makers to the litho intensive 20-nanometer and below nodes and the associated requirements for a minimum critical capacity, which should be installed by year-end 2013.</p>
          <p>This, along with our EUV system delivery plans, up to 11 NXE:3300 systems, allow us to confident to &#x2013; to confidently plan our 2013 business as being very similar to 2012. This includes a very low level of demand from both memory sectors with &#x2013; however, with the possibility of upside in NAND systems, that demand could occur later this year and that is not yet reflected in our current assessment of the 2013 potential sales levels.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would also like to highlight the high level of service and field option sales as we saw in the fourth quarter. Enabled in large part by the continued adoption across the installed base of our performance enhancing field options, including throughput and overlay upgrades, this level of service sales will continue through 2013, supported in large part by our holistic lithography product with some customers beginning to implement our integrated metrology and feedback loop solutions, providing a much-needed higher level of process control at the 20-nanometer node and below.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to turn it back over to you, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So let me talk a bit about EUV, but first about Cymer. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire the light source supplier Cymer in a cash and stock deal. We're currently awaiting several international regulatory authority approvals, while clearance has been granted by CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the German antitrust authority. In addition, a vote on approval of the deal by the Cymer shareholders will take place on February 5.</p>
          <p>We expect that this acquisition will therefore be completed in the first half of this year after having obtained the necessary approval in the U.S. of the antitrust authorities and in the different remaining foreign jurisdictions. In the meantime, we are continuing our long-term close collaboration with Cymer and of course working on EUV. Both on the source and on the scanner, we moved ahead significantly in Q4 towards our 2014 production ramp goal.</p>
          <p>Firstly, progress has been made towards confirming what we call the source proof of performance as we were able to double the source power in tests and simulation up to 60 watt with no indication of performance degradation. We, of course, need to reach our long set target of 105 watt, which is equivalent to about 69 wafer per hour, but we are very encouraged, of course, by the data produced this quarter on 60 watts.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have operated the first integrated EUV source with a stable exposure power up to 40 watt with due &#x2013; with good dose control enabling full field exposure over an extended period of time, again a fairly good piece of information here.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we have completed the integration of our first scanner machine, the NXE:3300, and have now met a number of significant overlay and imaging performance milestones. We have achieved imaging down to 14 nanometer and mix-and-match immersion to EUV overlay results of below 5 nanometer. These three areas of progress underpin our confidence to reach the 105 watt or the 69 wafer per hour target for 2014 production ramp, and these areas of progress support the preparation for shipment of our 11 production NXE:3300s. These 11 production units, I remind you, are not specified to reach immediately the 69 wafer per hour target specification achievement but will ship when assembly can be completed.</p>
          <p>Regarding the production planning phase, our goal is to ship about 8 to 12 systems in total in 2014. We have already booked four of these NXE:3300 production systems and intend to book several more in the next few months as the requirements for our customers for EUV are becoming clearer with each performance progress step being made.</p>
          <p>DRAM manufacturers, for instance, currently suggest a potential need for imaging for up to four layers, which is a bit better than, we believe, before, to be dedicated to EUV at high 1x nodes, and the logic device makers may require between five up to 17 EUV exposures at the nodes sub 14 nanometer. So parallel to EUV, which remains the only cost effective imaging solution for customers to do the next generation IC scanning anyway, we're developing 450 mm wafer form factor exposure tools.</p>
          <p>As Peter mentioned, our Customer Co-Investment Program is indeed enabling this &#x2013; enabling this huge investment in normal business, investment in EUV, investment in 450 development. The 450-millimeter system's timing is targeted for 2016 pre-production, with production systems targeted for 2018 if, of course, customers confirm the ramp interest in an agreed upon timeframe.</p>
          <p>So with this update on the technology and the product with Peter, we are &#x2013; we would be pleased to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session, but beforehand I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get in as many callers as possible.</p>
          <p>Now, operator, could we have your instructions and then first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, Mr. DeYoung, thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Ramel. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Ramel from Exane BNP Paribas. One question, Eric, how do you see the installed capacity for the 28-nanometer node? And going forward, how do you see the size potentially in terms of wafer starts per month for the 20-nanometer node?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. These are very good questions. So we estimate that with the shipment that we are supposed to do up to Q3 of 2013, the total customers will reach about 320,000-ish wafer installed base of the 28-nanometer to 32-nanometer node, which 320,000, 340,000 wafer per month-type capacity is a good node, on the high side but not exceptional. What surprised us and the reason why we've been bullish this year and this is first year in eight years or so, nine years, we've guided the full year is indeed, to your question, we are now seeing the buildup of capacity for 20-nanometer, 20 &#x2013; 22-nanometer in the same environment &#x2013; in the foundry logic environment and this is starting earlier than we would have expected in the first place. We can discuss later about the drivers of that. We expect the numbers of wafers to be installed with the current forecast that we have to be in the area of about only 60K wafers &#x2013; well, I would say it's 40K to 60K wafers &#x2013; will be installed by the first quarter of 2014. This is very important. First, 40K, 60K is not a very large number, but it requires a lot of lithography machines because each wafer of 20, 22 nanometer requires double numbers of lithography machine and a significant amount more of holistic lithography products, which is good margin products, to make the same numbers of wafers. So you have a factor two here, which is again why we've said with some confidence that although we do not see good business in the PC arena, we do not see a pick-up of the memory business at this time. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but today we don't see it. There is no signal. But the only thing we see is 20, 22 nanometer and this is good and the multiplier intensity force us to guide that, in fact, the second half of the year will be so good that it compensates for the beginning half which is slow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just maybe a follow-up on EUV. What's going to be the maximum capacity of shipment you will have by 2015? Are we talking about 24 units?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 2015, our simulation say that the market will probably need about 30 to 36, so we will have the capacity for 30 to 36. We could always do a bit more, but we don't think it will be necessary to overheat on that one. And then we will go towards a capacity of about 60, 66 in the 2016, 2017 range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. St&#xE9;phane Houri. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, St&#xE9;phane Houri, Natixis. The first question I would have is on the visibility that you have on the order because you have rebounding sales starting in Q2, if I understand well, and the next version in H2 because of the 2014 nanometer transition. Given your lead time, is it fair to assume that the orders should rebound as early as in Q1? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely the orders will pick up in Q1. In our opinion, with Peter, we don't think the orders will pick up as much as they should. In other terms, the customers who we know, of course, will be somehow putting the orders within lead time. This project that we're talking about is such huge strategic project that we are building on commitment and on request. The PO buildup is more the administrative process that will go with it. So indeed there is going to be a pickup in Q1 and we expect this to continue, but again as &#x2013; you will not be able to easily use a standard lead time of six to nine months to guide to know what the revenue is going to be. The POs will be coming, in fact, late to the ramp and because the ramp is so obviously discussed, committed, planned, agreed, that the PO has become a bit irrelevant on these one or two fundamental projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you've been talking about 8 to 12 EUV tools in 2014. Can you help us with the price that will be sold or that might be sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bit early because these tools will have a huge amount of options because you are talking about first production tools and in this situation usually the customers will be very customizing the content of them. It &#x2013; I would say EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million could probably be an acceptable range, but unfortunately I won't be more precise at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it could vary from customer to customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Gareth Jenkins. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Gareth Jenkins, UBS. So just a quick one on EUV again, coming back to the 8 to 12 tools for next year. I just wondered if you've seen any changes in terms of logic adoption of EUV or whether we should still expect the vast majority to be DRAM and, if so, what's changed for logic. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. No, in fact, we may have started to hint last quarter, if I remember, that DRAM was also keen with EUV because there is no choice. They absolutely have to have at least one layer on EUV, just as a feasibility statement. So DRAM is always hot. However, logic has overpassed, I would say, DRAM in the sense that first, they also have now a need which you have realized, which is a minimum of, as we said, five layers to seven. They all know &#x2013; so see that they have an economic issue. So there is now another incentive to go from 5, 7 to 17 and they have also a huge business attraction meaning logic is, in fact, doing good at this moment. And they see themselves going in another node after the famous what we call 20 nanometer, but which will be called 14-20 that node will then be followed quickly by a node which will be called something like 10-11 or something and that is EUV node and there is going to be, or at this moment the customers believe that there is, an economic wave that will drive this. So logic are becoming hugely interested and putting most of our attention now on logic. But DRAM will get in, and if DRAM's business becomes more attractive, the PC business basically gets back and put some attraction there, we could see DRAM trying to still be three, six months ahead of logic because they do have a need indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I just follow up on that, then? The production on the 10-11 nanometer nodes, UV. Is that a 2015 production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so you will see the chips, the die, the wafers in 2016. The buildup of the capacity of the factory will happen a year before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, JPMorgan. Quick question for you, Eric. Would you say at this point that you are now more confident about doing the 69 wafers per hour production tools by the middle of next year compared to, say, six months ago? And what has essentially changed in terms of what you've seen in terms of the R&amp;D done or development done internally to make you feel that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. So in fact, we did miss the targets of the summer. If you remember, I said in the summer we will have some factual data that puts us in the comfort zone. We didn't, and we didn't not because we hit a science problem, we didn't because we hit a engineering problem: The different set-ups did not work. So we took a bit of time to put them to work. So what should have happened in the summer has happened in the winter. And we now have two &#x2013; three fundamental sets of data. The first set of data, which we expected anyway, it's not a big surprise, is the 3300 machine works and it works very well. So in fact, if today you wanted to be in production with an EUV machine without a source, we would put you into production now. So if any of you is interested, by the way, we'll take some orders.</p>
          <p>The second bit is, what the piece of data that was successful these last three months, in fact that excites the engineers more than me as a businessman, and you will understand why, is now they are getting stability of exposure at 40 wafer per hour. So in other terms now...</p>

That means that the machine can be put into production and work at 20 to 30 wafers per hour in a stable way. That's a very important statement. Now it's not great economically wise, but it starts to be interested and usable.</p>

          <p>And six months ago, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:02)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it was not stable. We were difficulty during the day, each of the wafers had irregularities, et cetera. So we've done a significant amount of engineering.</p>
          <p>The third aspect to know that's what excites me as a businessman and not so much the engineers &#x2013; but this is the difference between a good engineer and bad engineer, I guess &#x2013; is we have some 60 watt capability data. What is a capability data? It says that theoretically we needed to be sure that we would not discover a problem by putting more power in the system. More power means more heat, more stress, more et cetera. By doing this, you kind of shoot a bit in the dark, which is why EUV is, in fact, dangerous because you &#x2013; we learn something and what you learn may take time to repair.</p>
          <p>And the way that we've moved to 60 watts, we've been able to justify and comfort our simulation systems. And our simulation system, our models now are comforted up to 60 watts and, in fact, it can be easily now projected towards the 105 watts even if we cannot prove it yet, the models are proven, checked at 60 watts. So, first, 60 watts is nearer to 105 watts and, secondly, it is very good theoretically. It has proven our model. So therefore, we absolutely strengthen our point that 2014 production should now be much higher probability than ever, indeed enough that the customers are, in fact, continuing to discuss with us this order placing for 2014, which are meant to be between eight and 12 in total, which by the way is a good number. We don't need more &#x2013; the customers don't need more anyway, that would be the normal ramp of that technology.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Just one follow-on to that. You're talking about a 60-watt having being shown in your labs. Is there a substantial technical difference between a 60-watt laser and a 105-watt laser? I mean, based on gas or what power it has to be &#x2013; I mean, power clearly is different, but from any other elements, which are substantially different, which could cause a risk from moving from 60 watt to 105 watts?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not. The concept is now going to remain the same up to 205 &#x2013; 210 watts, which is that, that architecture that we just talked about. So from 60 to 210, we should not change the concept.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So that &#x2013; like I also said in the introduction, the other part of the contribution which I'd say one of the key contributors to the program will be in gross margin, and that will vary upon the business volume that we have them, because that's for the particular accounting treatment that we have to follow. So this other income is only for two of the participants. The other contribution will be in gross margin, which will be &#x2013; we'll clarify at the end of a quarter based on the actuals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you say that the gross margin contribution comes a little late in the second &#x2013; more in the second half for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it fully depends on the timing of when the shipments happen. So basically it's &#x2013; because that particular customer is also very large, is a larger shareholder than the others, and that means that the accounting requirements state that you have to allocate that contribution to the business that we have with them. So if we start shipping tools, that means that those tools will get a &#x2013; let's say, a lift-up of the contribution that was intended to be the coverage for the R&amp;D cost. And so per system, you will have an extra margin. So you will &#x2013; and that is the way it is going to be accounted for, so it means that depending on the business volume that we have with that customer, we are going to now recognize the &#x2013; accounting wise, we are going to recognize the contribution of the customer. Cash wise, there's not going to be an issue. Cash wise, it's going to be matched. So you will have &#x2013; you could say, for some time you could have a deferred accrual account, a deferred revenue account, on the balance sheet, which will then be released to income in the next quarter when the shipments happen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first one would be regarding EUV shipments for this year. I think the plan since last year was to ship 11 machines this year. If I read the statement this morning, it sounds a bit shaky, like it's going to be 11 at best. Does it mean that there is some risk of delay into 2014? And also if you could confirm that some of those shipments &#x2013; for some of those shipments, also revenues will not be recognized this year. That's my first question. I've got a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Peter will address the revenue recognition because I don't understand anything on this. So I will address the shipment part. So the machine itself, as I said, has been purchase ordered on a as-is basis. So we will ship when they are ready, finished assembled as I said in the speech. The machines themselves, the scanners, the certainty of being available for next year is very high. I mean, we don't see a problem achieving that, but the matching the scanner to the proper source could be still the risk of execution. Whether we ship all of them or we miss two or three or four depends, in fact, what we are going to choose to do with the sources. We can ship them here and test them and qualify them, but then that takes more time to ship later to the customer. We can decide to what we say drop ship the machine to the customer, meaning you ship the machine &#x2013; the scanner on one hand and the laser on the other, but then you have to recognize &#x2013; well, in fact, I'm starting to answer your question &#x2013; the machine when they are tested at the customer so that may take more time. So we are a bit less in control of what we want it to be in the first place as to the logistic of this and then Peter will have to put the economic view to this, which is the recognition of revenue to the logistic nightmare that I just described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it's what &#x2013; as a shipment for us is defined as the shipment of the &#x2013; of you could say the metal that could be in two ways, that could be like Eric said being the intubated metal from Veldhoven from The Netherlands or, because we are late, customers could say please save time, don't ship everything to Veldhoven, integrate it there, test it and then take it apart and ship it to us, so please ship the scanner separate from the EUV source, which we would call a drop shipment of the source. Which then means that the integration and showing that it works can only happen at the customer side, which then also means that the revenue recognition takes place at that moment in time and since we aren't completely sure as to what customers want and what particular configuration of the source that they want, there is a risk from a revenue recognition point of, in our view, some of those shipments may end up in the first quarter of 2014 and that might happen. So there is a bit of caution there, so you notice that. And as a matter of fact in our guidance we took account of that, so we took a conservative number for the EUV shipments to be recognized in 2013, because it will always be a possibility that while we have shipped it, that we are still in a process of putting it all together and qualifying at the customer side, which might then happen in Q1 instead of Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that is very clear. Now I've got a question for Eric, if I may, about EUV in 40 nanometer, especially because, Eric, you said that 40 nanometer <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:32) there could be like 5 to 17 EUV layers per chip. So basically how much will be left for immersion and what would be the share in your view of EUV versus immersion and all the other 14 nanometer when it ramps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the real question you have: is it going to be growth for us when we ship EUV because immersion will still remain important? The answer is yes. I think we said it two or three quarters ago that when EUV is introduced within its normal activities there will be EUV, there will be immersion, there will be dry and in this environment we think we are going to have to go to another plateau of sales. And I said, by the way I would give you the new plateau when we are solid on EUV, we know for sure what we ship, but yes it will be bigger than the plateau that we have over the Dutch, which is the 5.5-ish. We think we'll get to another level of sales because yes, immersions will remain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when we ramp EUV, I think we also said it before in 2015 and 2016, that EUV is &#x2013; that will be in 2016 is going to be significantly over half of our sales in terms of the value and in 2015 it could easily be up to that half level. So yes, the EUV shipments when we are ramping are going to be the most significant part of our sales numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So immersion goes down basically compared to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what Eric said is that the total sales will go up. So yes, we will cannibalize some of the leading-edge layers, clearly, but don't forget that we also see that if complexity increases, which it does, the number of layers also goes up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The total will increase. Oh, okay, sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes, it could be lower, but not that &#x2013; but it would be very strange if it was more than half the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:43) back to where we are today. So we will be lower, but it's going to be manageable, and on top of that we see the resales.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Barclays. I was interested in &#x2013; if you could provide a bit more detail around the visibility being provided by some of the foundry customers at the moment. You've clearly indicated your expectation for revenue there to ramp in the back half of the year given the 20 nanometer buildout. I think looking at the way the foundries are communicating at the moment, one is being particularly vocal, the other perhaps slightly less so given a customer shift. But how much of your expectations for that second half ramp are being driven by that one who is being more vocal relative to the other one or you assuming within your guidance that there is a strong ramp across those two leaders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; in our current guidance where we said we are at this moment identifying about the same level of sales in the year, we are only inserting one large 20-nanometer buildup and the rest are being very, very, very small. So in other terms, our point has always been to be conservative. So if the other players were to try to move to their natural market share versus the current one who is driving, we will sell much more units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Also, just a quick follow-up. Peter, regarding tax, we've seen in the past when your sales dropped to these kind of levels that the tax rate increases. I was just wondering if you can give us any sort of steer as to how we should be modeling that for 2013, in particular the early quarters when revenues are lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as a matter of fact, at these sales levels you are referring to times when sales were really dire, you would talk about the first six months of 2009 and then you would argue that the effective tax rate had no relevance at all, which at the levels that we're talking about in Q1 is not the case. I think the fact that we have currently a resolution on the tax issues that were outstanding in particularly Asia means that we can now confidently recognize taxes in that area on a lower level, which means that going forward for 2013, we guided you at about 12% tax, you could take 2 percentage points off, so around 10% &#x2013; 9% to 10% would be a good number for the total year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. From Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of them. I guess one of the customers that has indicated this very strong ramp of 20-nanometer has also indicated that their capital spending will be heavily first-half weighted, with two-thirds of their spending in the first half. From your commentary, it's clear that you're expecting a second half that is stronger than the first half. Could you perhaps explain why there might be a bit of a difference in terms of what happens to you versus what they're saying for their CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are a conservative bunch, maybe that's what I can tell you. Maybe also, remember we do not represent 100% of the CapEx and, if I'm not mistaken, there is some brick and mortar into the pie which means there is potentially upfront thing that is done before we start shipping machines. But though I would not see, I know also be realistic, we just finished, the world finished &#x2013; not even finished &#x2013; the world is in process of finishing 28 nanometer. It would be a bit aggressive for me to say that we now ship hundreds of millions of 20 nanometer today. That would not be natural, but for the customer in question, they may have to have significant CapEx to prepare the situation before the machine comes in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was thinking about one of the slides you showed on your presentation which talked about the integrated metrology that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:44). Could you talk a little bit about what that is doing to &#x2013; if you could quantify, that would be great, to the ASPs of the immersion systems as we go from 28 nanometer to 20 nanometer? And from a process flow standpoint, it is &#x2013; what exactly is that metrology doing? Is it replacing an optical 3B metrology that your company will have bought from another equipment supplier or is it in addition to other equipment that the chip companies are going to be buying from metrology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me answer the first question first and Peter will discuss the margin impact of these type of product. No, we would not say that it directly replaces metrology. Metrology, the segment metrology as it is known in the industry is a diagnostic metrology segment, it's &#x2013; every day or so, you take a wafer, you make extremely deep and that is as you understand what the recipes' impact are, you change the recipe, so it's an involved diagnostic, long lead time, deep involved process capability. We don't have that. What we insert are machines which are able on the fly to correct a process failure by resetting the numbers of knobs into a scanner. We call it metrology because indeed you have to measure and correct but the real term should have been a closed loop systems. Before, they didn't need to use closed loop because the machines did not need to be corrected, but now the processes are so tight, the window of processes are tight, that they need to be expounded and they need to be controlled, and therefore there is a new activity that is called closed loop and we are happy to be a big player into this.</p>
          <p>And it is true that we've done in the past year or so a very small amount of business in that segment, in total I would say with &#x2013; up to EUR 200 million or so in total business of this type of activity, EUR 200 million, EUR 220 million. Now it's real, so in other terms, there is going to be a significant impact as we go and when the business goes from 20 nanometer &#x2013; at 20 nanometer, it's already big and at 14 nanometer it's going to be even worse or better for us. So we will go north of EUR 400 million in due time. So this is real additional business which indeed have an impact in margins. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, when you talk about the ASPs and not so much margin, because there are higher margin products. When you look at the picture slide that you are referring to, where you see these two machines, there's kind of a long side and you've got to go the YieldStar metrology to at the other side, you have to remember that it is not one single tool that we are selling, it is hardware plus a lot of software. So it's a combination of products that we are selling. But if you would have a fully loaded 28-nanometer machine compared to a fully loaded 20-nanometer machine, which would include this YieldStar and the feedback loops that Eric gave, you would look at, depending on the customer and the application, a difference in list price of between EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million between the two. Now of course, that depends on the customer contact that you have, the volumes that we are taking, what discounts that they're getting, but that is the kind of the difference that you need to think of.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sure, just a quick follow-on to the last line of questioning on the holistic lithography and the upgrades and the revenue contribution. I think you said that you expect to stay at this EUR 257 million level in terms of service and field options. But wouldn't it make sense that, that would increase as you get this 20-nanometer ramp coming into the back half of the year? In other words, why would you expect that line of revenue to be flat or is it &#x2013; does it just come into the system sales revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have look at it in the complex of that, that the fourth quarter was the highest ever. So I mean, this indeed in the fourth quarter shows some incidental extra revenue but when it would be &#x2013; when you take the average from 2011 and 2012, we are significantly lower. Now I think that is &#x2013; that average will go up. So that is basically what we are saying and that's where conservative in a sense because, like I said earlier, EUR 7 million to EUR 10 million addition to the sales price from a list price point of view is almost something that customers need to get their hands around and basically need to realize that they need it. We think that they need it but we feel we can on average keep to EUR 250 million level per quarter which is a record.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just staying on these features, is this something that your competitor &#x2013; your main competitor in the space has available or is this entirely different than what they can offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as we know, that's not available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally when you talk about the 11 EUV tools that were &#x2013; that are expected to ship this year and the contribution of EUR 700 million, you also mentioned that perhaps you've slipped some of that EUR 700 million into 2014. Can you tell us how much you're expecting for 2013 and how much for 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. We have and what we've told you as sales levels for 2013, we took a conservative amount of about EUR 250 million off the EUR 700 million to come to the sales levels, 2013 similar to 2012.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Piper Jaffray. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the previous one. Two questions, Eric. So first, if you look at your sales guidance for 2013 and given the foundry war, which is ongoing, and the capital intensity that is happening given that there is going to be at least 1.7 times more intensive compared to the prior nodes, your guidance seems to be a little bit kind of soft. Is it a fair assessment that you are being very conservative here? Can you talk about the puts and takes? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, our philosophy and style is not to bet and have an opinion and then say it's a gutsy opinion or it's not. We try to guide you only on factual data that we have and the factual data is we have one segment and a half, which one segment is you've all guessed it and the 20 nanometer leading company, and then you have the percentage of our 11 machines and Peter was nice enough to tell you exactly which percentage he talked about. So you take these big account of 20 nanometer, it was our own understanding of how many units you really need to do to do this 40K wafers. You add this x% of the EUV machine, you add under the standard business that we have and you come up with about the same sales level, so that's what we guided.</p>
          <p>When we saw that number we said we have to guide you because it's a true statement, it's true number. So you can translate my point by saying there is indeed upside opportunity. The first upside opportunity is that the other logic people will not consider this acceptable to leave only one and &#x2013; one of them take over the majority share of 20 nanometer so early in the game, so that's an upside.</p>
          <p>The second upside, which we mentioned in the press release, is that if the PC business does pick up a bit due to the new form factors, you will see immediately a reaction in every people who do microprocessors, who will benefit from that and memory. DRAM will start benefiting, but then you are reserve a multiplier in the NAND business for the people doing and successful at solid state drive, because solid state drive will be multiplied by the PC to new form factor performance. So again, that is not in the numbers and this is an opportunity. Okay, so that will be if you are &#x2013; want to hear from me, the upside.</p>
          <p>The downside is that we are in a business now which is extremely granular, that is if we make a mistake in judgment, it's a big one and it could be a big one because like fab is late by three or six months, just because the concrete did not pour or the contractor to the foundry business with whom we're working is having nightmares and et cetera, something bad has happened, and in which case we have a negative to those items. So again, we don't want to put any judgment to the upside and the downside, but I hope by doing this they can be description of what is in our numbers and how we built it up. You, yourself, in fact, should make the number for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful, Eric. So as a follow-up, I just want to get an understanding, in terms of the DRAM customers, what is the sense of urgency are you seeing for the DRAM guys to be looking at EUV, given that the industry has somewhat consolidated and it's in their best interest to see pricing continue to get better for their own profitability? What is the sense that you see that in terms of them trying to accelerate EUV at this point of time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess DRAM business or the memory business because it is more and more emerging somehow in there, is looking for a differentiative activity. So they have results probably, the &#x2013; as you call this, the consolidation. I guess that they have numbers of players which have reached some kind of an equilibrium, so none of them would want to continue losing money. Why they continue losing money and the prices may &#x2013; took time to get up because &#x2013; by the way the DRAM prices are getting up in the last three, four weeks. So there is an upside coming on, something's happening at this moment. The reason why they, however, had another bad six months or so is because the PC business, in fact, was surprisingly weak. If you remember, we started the year last year where everybody's thinking that the PC business would grow by 5% or 10% and then it happened to be flat or shrinking. So that created a problem that they are trying to resolve.</p>
          <p>So what is happening now is a one will not continue driving the business with the same method which is overinvesting so that they try to take the other guy out of business. I don't think they will do this any longer. But I start seeing more interest to differentiate themselves with the way they do their chips, which also include a bit of process. This is very visible in the NAND business. You've noticed that in the NAND business they have gone now to trying to differentiate on the design of their chips, on the numbers of bids per sale, on the software drivers, et cetera. And you can start seeing this in the DRAM. So if you have a DRAM idea and EUV shrink capability, it not only costs, but it's also an enabler of something like power consumption, speed of access, et cetera, then you could show some huge interest.</p>
          <p>And we've started to see some of that, but I must say, I don't have specific to tell you that you should consider them, I mean, I have &#x2013; there is something in there. I don't know. I see here questions which leads to this idea.</p>

          <p>I think we, ladies and gentlemen, have time for one more quick question. We'll try to squeeze another one in. If you didn't get through and you have remaining questions, of course, feel free to call the Investor Relations department and we'll be glad to get back to you as soon as we possibly can. So operator, can we have the last call, please, or last question?</p>

          <p>Of course, Mr. DeYoung. The last question comes from Mr. Lee Simpson. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. It's Lee Simpson at Jefferies. I really just wanted to try and ask a question around DFM risk. If you look to a lot of the EDA suppliers, they're talking about increasing DFM risks around advanced node development such as at 20, 22 nanometers and more so at 14. Things increasing like DRC rules and the complication with fill flow for new features like FinFET. I suppose history tells you there's always the speed of design progression for new nodes, but I wonder if you could shed some light on what might be different this time and how this, if at all, really transfers to a slowdown in development of chips at each node and whether or not that has a onward impact to the ramp of the 20-nanometer node up to, let's say, 320,000 wafer starts per month similar to 28-nanometer node?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you put a tough responsibility on me because you really when you close a call, you want to close on good news and you come up with the possibility for me to say something negative. Now I'll try my best. The negative part of your question is really at the end of the day it could create an inflation of cost. You mentioned issues, design manufacturing issues, which require, in fact, investment. So there is indeed a pressure on cost on all of us. Our customers, but us, are trying to solve that problem by bringing solutions to the market, which do not add an inflation of cost. So that clearly is a pressure.</p>
          <p>But let's conclude with a positive news. We see this as a huge business opportunity. The discussion we just had on this metrology closed loop is exactly your point. It has triggered the possibility for us to grow from EUR 100 million to EUR 200 million to EUR 400 million potential sales of these high-valued product. Secondly, at the moment when the world is too big, EUV comes up, and EUV does reduce the need for these complicated situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So ASML is hugely well positioned to resolve the complexity that you just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean this goes back to an earlier question, I think you got that holistic lithography should probably increase, betting aside that perhaps Q4 was the high tide so far in that sales level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And don't forget, when you talk about the DRAM version, the holistic litho products have two elements. You should look at our presentation. One is to widen the process control window in your preparation for manufacturing, which really addresses your design floor manufacturing issues, that has, that in rolling this out we also discovered the second element, which is basically the control of your process parameters while you are in manufacturing, so it has two elements to it, and I think that is, the latter is more a, let's say, a finding of the last few years, while the first part, needing to find a solution for the design floor manufacturing issues, that was really why we did the Brion acquisition, but it evolved into the latter with the YieldStar product and the closed loops.</p>
