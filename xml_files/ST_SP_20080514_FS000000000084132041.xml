          <p>Thank you for joining us today for SingTel's results for the quarter and financial year ended 31st March, 2008. I am delighted to report that our results for the financial year showed strong revenue and earnings growth. We are also purposing to raise SingTel's ordinary dividend payout ratio and to increase our final ordinary dividend.</p>
          <p>During the year the Singapore business achieved the strongest revenue growth in the past five years.  In Australia, Optus recorded strong customer additions and maintained profitability in a highly competitive market. The associates continue to deliver strong profit growth. In this presentation, we will also focus on trends for the most recent quarter and lastly, we will set targets for the next financial year ending March 2009.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to estimate our targets for the financial year ended 31st March 2008. Revenues were up 11% boosted by double-digit growth in Singapore and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Underlying earnings per share increased 17% to $0.23. In Singapore revenue grew 11% driven by solid growth in both the Telco and IT businesses.</p>
          <p>Operational EBITDA rose 3% to almost $2 billion. In Australia revenue increased 4%, a strong performance despite a decline in mobile termination rate and exit from consumer fixed line resale. Optus maintained profitability with operational EBITDA of A$2 billion.  The group and its associates now have 185 million mobile customers. The regional mobile associates continue their impressive performance with a 29% growth in earnings before tax and exceptionals.</p>
          <p>The board is recommending a final ordinary dividend of $0.069, together with interim dividend of $0.056 per share, total ordinary dividends amount to $0.125 per share or 54% payout ratio. Including the proposed final dividend, our cumulative payout since 2000 will be $22 billion or 82% of net profit after-tax. We are balancing our desire for an efficient balance sheet with financial flexibility to make further investments.</p>
          <p>Operational EBITDA for the Group grew 6% driven by strong revenue growth.  Contribution from associates rose 25%.  Net profit rose 5% to almost $4 billion. Excluding exceptional items and IDA compensation recorded in the previous year underlying net profit grew 14% to $3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Underlying EPS grew faster at 17% because of the capital reduction exercise in the previous year. Excluding the extra quarter of Globe's results recorded in the last financial year, underlying net profit will have grown 16% and underlying EPS will have grown 19%.</p>
          <p>Foreign currency movement had a slight positive impact on earnings, mainly because of the strong Australian dollar and Indian rupee largely offset by a weaker Indonesian rupiah.</p>
          <p>Now let me run through highlights of the fourth quarter. The success of international expansion has created a diversified earnings base. Overseas operations contributed 77% a proportion of EBITDA. In Singapore, we've registered another quarter of record mobile customers growth, adding 244,000 subscribers. In the quarter, SingTel also announced that it is investing in a submarine cable project with five other partners. This will help boost connectivity and redundancy of SingTel submarine cable network.</p>
          <p>In Australia, our strong focus on mobile attracted 135,000 new mobile customers.  Optus delivered strong on-net customer growth, we ended the year with 705,000 on-net broadband customers. Our regional mobile associates registered another quarter of impressive growth of 14 million mobile customers.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, growth momentum was sustained and revenue rose 11%. Operational EBITDA was up 5%.  Recurring earnings for the associates increased by 15%, although dipping by 2% against the December '07 quarter mainly due to aggressive promotions at Telcom cell. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an exceptional dilution gain of $153 million from new investments into Bharti Infratel.</p>
          <p>The group's prior year's earnings included 60 million of tax savings from the reduction in corporate tax rate. Excluding the impact of exceptional items in IDA compensation in the prior period, underlying earnings rose 9% to $968 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let me focus on our Singapore operation. The Singapore business exceeded its objectives for the year. Revenues grew 11% to $4.9 billion.  Operational EBITDA, excluding strategic initiatives of close to $2 billion, was 5% higher. Telecom margin was 46.5% and overall margin was 40.1%. CapEx was $432 million or 9% of revenues. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Singapore operations registered double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter this year. Operating expenses increased 18%, selling and admin expenses increased 40%, due to the higher number of customers acquired and higher unit cost for customer acquisitions and retention.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales grow 13%, attributable to higher IT and equipment sales. Staff costs were up 12% reflecting increased head count to support the business growth as well as a tighter labor market.</p>
          <p>Operational EBITDA rose 1% to $469 million. Singapore business margins, which excludes international business and group corporate cost, was 37.4%. Telecom margin narrowed to 42.5%, reflecting the acceleration of marketing activities and the impact of strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>We had revenue growth across our telco and IT business. Data and Internet revenue was up 12% backed by strong corporate data and broadband growth. Mobile revenue increased 15%, another strong consecutive quarter supported by growing customer base and higher ARPUs from both postpaid and prepaid customers.</p>
          <p>IT and engineering rose 16%, driven by higher contribution from systems and network integration projects. International telephony revenues grew 3% assisted by Singapore's good economic performance.  Others grew 8% due largely to higher equipment sales and higher satellite revenues.</p>
          <p>SingTel continues to set the pace in the mobile and Internet markets.  We added 19,000 new broadband customers this quarter and retained leadership position in Singapore with 54% market share.  Our Wireless@SG service also attracted 496,000 customers since its launch, of which</p>
          <p>203,000 do not currently subscribe to SingNet's residential broadband service. We achieved yet another record quarterly net add of 244,000 mobile customers. We extended our lead in both the prepaid and postpaid segments, adding 207,000 prepaid and 37,000 postpaid customers. Despite the record net add, ARPUs were up 2% for postpaid and 16% for prepaid.</p>
          <p>International telephony revenue was up 3%.  Outgoing international traffic grew 65%, as free IDD promotions and Singapore's strong economic performance drove higher usage. Collection rates declined 35% due to the increase in free IDD traffic. National telephone revenue declined 8% reflecting lower dial-up Internet and payphone usage and mobile substitution.</p>
          <p>Our market share remains stable at 95% and second line penetration was down by one percentage point. The number of customers on the SingTel's Mio Plan and Mio TV grew to 67,000 and 44,000 respectively as at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Last week, SingTel submitted a bid via the OpenNet consortium to bid on high-speed broadband network using fiber-to-the-home technology. Upon its completion by December 2012, the network will support the development of more advanced and innovative services.</p>
          <p>Now, let me focus on our Australian operations. Financial year 2007-08 was another year of intense competition in Australia. Optus turned in a strong performance and met its targets. Revenues increased by 4% while operational EBITDA rose 1%.</p>
          <p>Mobile customer acquisition was strong, although mobile revenue growth was affected by reduced mobile termination rates and Optus' later entry into wireless broadband.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure was A$1.1 billion with significant investment in the 3G HSPA mobile network, D-series satellites and customer care systems. Free cash flow was $903 million, up 22% reflecting strength in underlying operations.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Optus achieved revenue growth of 5%, a credible performance despite a 25% decline in mobile termination rates and the impact of exiting consumer fixed line resale.</p>
          <p>In mobile, Optus had another quarter of strong mobile net additions, with 135,000 new customers including an encouraging uptake in wireless broadband products.  During the quarter, Optus continued expand is 3G HSPA mobile network which reaches 68% of the population as at March '08 and is on track to reach 96% coverage by December '08.</p>
          <p>Last week, Optus announced it will further expand its mobile network to reach 98% of the population by December '09. In business and wholesale fixed, Optus gained profitable share in data and IP.</p>
          <p>In consumer &amp; SMB, our on-net focus in growing ULL customer base delivered seven percentage points margin expansion to 15%. Growing on the net revenues partly mitigated the impact of consumer fixed line resale exit.</p>
          <p>Optus achieved another quarter of strong customer acquisitions supported by promotion of its innovative wireless broadband products and targeted capped plans. Mobile postpaid customers increased 87,000 driven by both data and voice products. Mobile revenue grew 7% with outgoing revenue growth of 7%.</p>
          <p>Optus continued to lead in the prepaid segment with outgoing service revenue growth of 11%. Prepaid ARPU was stable but postpaid ARPU declined 4% to $67 from the preceding quarter due to seasonality and the increased mix of lower price plans.</p>
          <p>Data usage accounted for 29% of ARPU, up three percentage points year-on-year. The proportion on non-SMS data revenue grew to 6% of ARPU compared to 4% a year ago. Mobile EBITDA margin improved three percentage points on the sequential basis to 35% despite high acquisition costs associated with customer growth.</p>
          <p>Business and wholesale fixed division again delivered market share gains with revenue growth and double digit EBITDA expansion.  Overall revenue increased 10% driven by the 12% growth in Optus business fixed revenue.</p>
          <p>In Data and IP, the revenue grew 12%, underpinned by growth in the rapidly expanding Internet market, IP VPN, and higher broadband usage.  Optus continues to leverage IP to grow market share through key strategic initiatives such as Evolve, a market-leading suite of IP services.</p>
          <p>Major corporate renewals in the quarter included St. George Bank, Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship and Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Optus business voice revenues fell 2% with fewer business days in the quarter.</p>
          <p>ICT and managed services revenues grew 40% with continued demand for converge business applications and strong execution by Alphawest. Satellite revenues were stable, reflecting the high utilization of current satellite capacity. Optus is on track launch its third D-series satellite in 2009.</p>
          <p>Wholesale revenues grew 6% as growth in data and IP mitigated decline in voice revenues. Margins improved two percentage points to 24% reflecting on-net growth. Consumer on-net revenues increased by 30%, partly mitigating the decline in off-net revenues.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year on-net broadband customers increased 271,000 to 705,000 while off-net broadband customers declined as Optus executed its strategy to exit unprofitable fixed line resale business.</p>
          <p>ULL customers grew by 52,000 during the quarter to 317,000 at end of March. The growth in ULL customers and our on-net focus delivered margin improvement of seven percentage points to 15%. The contribution from regional mobile associates comprising six mobile businesses across Asia continued to grow.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you a quick overview of each of our six mobile associates. Bharti is the number one cellular operator in India with 62 million customers.  PBTL is the CDMA operator in Bangladesh, a market with a large population and under penetrated in telecom services.  Telecom Cell is the leading wireless operator in Indonesia.  Subscribers grew 32% to 51 million. In the past year, we completed acquisition of a 30% stake in Warid Telecom in Pakistan, which is a key challenger in the Pakistani market after just three years in operation.   Globe is the second largest mobile player in the Philippines with 21 million customers. AIS leads the Thai market with 25 million customers.</p>
          <p>Reaching the mobile associates earnings expanded 18% this quarter, accounting for over half of SingTel Group's pre-tax profit.  Telecom sales earnings were up 18%, a resilient performance despite intensifying competition and reduced prices. The Sing dollars' earnings were impacted by the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah.</p>
          <p>Bharti registered strong earnings growth of 38% as it continued to acquire subscribers at a fast pace. The Sing dollars' earnings were also boosted by the stronger Indian rupee. Globe's earnings grew 2% as operational performance was affected by inflation pressures.  The Sing dollar earnings were up 11% offset by the stronger peso.  AIS earnings grew 54% due to improved operational performance and recognition of interconnect income for the first time. Warid posted a $19 million loss due to depreciation expense and cost incurred to support its network rollout.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet with significant flexibility for further investments. The group continues to generate strong free cash flows. Dividends received for the year rose 65% to reach the $1 billion mark. This represents 58% of the associates' profits over the same period.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased to $7.3 billion as at March 2008. Leverage ratios remained comfortably within our targets. The average maturity of our borrowings is 4.5 years. We have also reviewed SingTel's dividend payout ratio and have raised it to 45 to 60% of underlying net profits, up from 40 to 50% previously.  It will retain significant financial flexibility for further acquisitions and continue to review our capital structure on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>As in previous year, we want to set targets for investors to measure our performance.   The global economic outlook has turned more cautious reflecting uncertainties in financial markets and in inflation pressures.  This has moderated the growth forecast for the Singapore, Australian and regional economies.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, the government is forecasting 4 to 6% GDP growth for 2008. In Australia, the official GDP forecast is 2.8%. In countries where the regional mobile associates operate GDP growth rates are expected to be at mid to high single-digit levels. We expect penetration to continue to grow in these countries. Our guidance assumes no deterioration in this condition.</p>
          <p>In the current financial year, the Singapore business has successfully embarked on a number of key growth initiatives. Revenue is expected to grow at mid single-digit level as we build on the momentum achieved in mobile market and in the corporate segments. EBITDA margin for the Singapore business is expected to be approximately 40% while EBITDA is expected to grow. To reinforce our market leadership in support innovation in the Group, we'll continue to invest in new capabilities and infrastructure in the next financial year. Capital expenditure as a percentage of overall revenue is expected to rise to mid-teens level, as we expand our mobile capacity and upgrade the fixed-line network.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, excluding dividend from associates is expected to decline slightly as a result of higher capital expenditure. Optus continues to be focused on delivering sustainable revenue and profit growth. In the next financial year, operating revenue is expected to grow at single-digit level, driven by mobile and wireless broadband services, which more than offset decline in consumer fixed-line resale. EBITDA and free cash flow are expected to grow in line with higher revenues. Capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue would be at mid-teens level and includes mobile coverage and capacity expansion as well as Optus' D-3 satellite.</p>
          <p>The Group is cautiously optimistic on its outlook for the next financial year barring a severe economic slowdown. We expect consolidated revenue in EBITDA from the Singapore and Australian operations to grow. Earnings from the regional mobile associates will continue to grow at double-digit level but at a slower pace due to increased competition in the Indonesian mobile market and share of higher setup losses from Warid. Six months, the Warid results were included in FY '07, '08. We are committed to an optimum capital structure while maintaining financial flexibility and investment grade credit ratings. Our ordinary payout ratio is raised to 45 to 60% of underlying earnings. Our medium term objective is to deliver double-digit growth in underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude. We are uniquely positioned in our region, the group is delivering strong earnings growth, and robust cash flows for shareholders.</p>
