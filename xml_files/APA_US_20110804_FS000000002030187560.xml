          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corp. second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers (sic) [Alfonso Leon] (0:10), Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers (sic) [Leon], please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We got the old script. This is Alfonso Leon. I'm Vice President of Planning Strategy and Investor Relations. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This morning, we reported second quarter 2011 net income of $1.2 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $1.3 billion or $3.22 per diluted share. Cash flows from operations totaled $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions: Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer, is actually on jury duty today.</p>
          <p>We have prepared our usual detail supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we use, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alfonso.</p>
          <p>Despite what we're seeing in the broad market today, at Apache we're very positive and proud of the quarter we turned in. I know you probably know that we had record production of 749,000 barrels of oil equipment a day, which was up 2% sequentially. We posted our second highest quarter of adjusted earnings ever of $1.3 billion, record cash flow of $2.6 billion. And actually, the only quarter of earnings we've ever had better than this was in the second quarter of 2008, when commodity prices were in the $140 range.</p>
          <p>Clearly, our results in the second quarter were strong, and really were driven by our portfolio of strength in the asset and the way we returned focus to all Apache. We had notable discoveries in a number of our regions during the quarter. And in addition, we took important steps forward in future growth projects which include Lyell or Lucius in the deepwater, Deadwood, Wheatstone LNG, and Kitimat LNG.</p>
          <p>The quarter underlines the strength of our cash flow generation. Our $2.6 billion of cash flow was up 44% from the same period a year ago. So if you analyze that, that's probably less than it is today with our share price going down today. If you analyze it, it would imply a share trade price at about four times our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash flow is our firepower. Our cash balance has grown to $1.1 billion at the end of June, which puts us in a good position to take on new projects or asset investment opportunities if and when they arise. We're very careful with our cash, and staying focused on rates of return has served us well over the years, and that's not going to change in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Rod Eichler is on jury duty, so I'm going to give you a little highlights from the operating side. In the Permian region, production increased 9% sequentially, which was driven by the absence of weather disruption we experienced in the first quarter, a very aggressive drilling program in the Wolfcamp at Deadwood, our horizontal drilling results and our legacy waterflood units, and prior-period adjustments. We operated 24 rigs during the quarter and drilled 146 wells, 13 of which were horizontal. We completed 137 wells as we continue to ramp our frac spread capacity to catch up with our drilling activity.</p>
          <p>Our horizontal redevelopment of the Permian legacy waterflood units continues to yield very positive results. The TXL South unit, one of the six out of 28 waterflood fields in which we have initiated horizontal redevelopment, hit 3,500-barrels a day, which is a 23-year record. This field has been under waterflood for 43 years.</p>
          <p>So far this year, we've drilled seven horizontal wells in the unit. A big driver in the second quarter was the TXL South unit 5210, which is a horizontal well testing at 531 barrels a day and 450,000 cubic feet of gas a day. These wells are increasing the recovery from the field by contacting unswept reserves that would otherwise be left behind. And the results we've seen in this field and a number of other fields gives us tremendous potential in all of our waterfloods in the Permian.</p>
          <p>We ran 11 rigs and drilled 57 wells in the Deadwood field. We're concentrating our activity this year in the Wolfcamp due to land retention requirements. Gross oil production in Deadwood exceeded 5,000 barrels a day and 14 million cubic feet of gas a day at the end of June, which is compared with 2,000 barrels a day and 6 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year. Our gas volumes have potentially plateaued in this area due to midstream constraints, which the recently announced Crosstex joint venture will address in early 2012. We expect to drill 160 wells in Deadwood this year. And at this point, we have an inventory of an additional 575 vertical locations there.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we completed our first Cline horizontal in the Deadwood area. It tested at 77 barrels a day, which was less than our expectations. We intend to change our frac design on our second well, which is currently drilling.</p>
          <p>We continue to address and build our inventory in all the other plays on our 3 million acres in the Permian which include the Yeso, the Empire Abo, southeast New Mexico, CO2 floods, Sprayberry, and we have a couple of new venture plays that we're working on.</p>
          <p>Apache has built a strong portfolio in the Permian really throughout a consistent contrarian approach over many years. And today, we have decades of attractive opportunities ahead of us. We have already identified 7,500 drilling locations. And if we stop today, we'd be able to drill wells for several years in the future.</p>
          <p>In the Central region, production increased 7% sequentially, which was driven primarily by the increase in our oil production. And notably, oil production in the region has increased 60% year to date alone. The region ran 10 rigs during the quarter and drilled 21 wells, almost entirely horizontal. The focus of our activity was in the Granite Wash with ten wells; three oil plays in the Cherokee, Cleveland, and Hogshooter, with five, four, and two wells respectively. Average well results across these plays continue the meet or outperform our expectations. And we expect to at least maintain our current level of activity across these plays on a multiyear basis.</p>
          <p>Some individual highlights per play during the quarter included a Cherokee well that stabilized at 577 barrels of oil a day and 900,000 cubic feet of gas a day; a Cleveland well that tested at 717 barrels of oil per day; and a Hogshooter well that flowed at about 1,150 barrels a day and 4.5 million cubic feet of gas a day.</p>
          <p>Production in the Gulf of Mexico shelf region was down 2% sequentially due to the level of activity constrained by permitting issues and natural field decline. We operated five rigs in the region during the quarter, reached TD on six wells with 100% commercial success. And we remain on track to drill 41 wells this year and really look forward to resume our normal pace of 60 wells next year as we begin to exploit the upside associated with our 40% acreage expansion, and underexploited assets acquired in the Mariner and Devon transactions in 2010.</p>
          <p>All Apache Gulf of Mexico production affected by tropical storm Don last week has been restored. And if you look at that on a quarter basis, it only cost about 162 barrels a day, so it wasn't significant.</p>
          <p>In the deepwater region, production declined about 3.5% sequentially due to the timing of projects coming on stream. During the quarter, a successful well test was conducted in the Lucius field, which is operated by Anadarko. In addition, the unitization of Lucius with adjacent acreage belonging to Exxon's Hadrian partnership was finalized. These steps position Lucius for an investment decision this year, with first production in 2014. The capacity of the facility is expected to be 80,000-barrels of oil a day and about 450 million cubic feet of gas a day. Apache holds an 11.67% interest in the enlarged Lucius complex.</p>
          <p>We continue to progress Heidelberg and a number of other projects. Importantly, we have now received approval on two out of four exploration plans we have submitted year to date. We have 110 exploration blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We're eager to get after an active exploration program to expand our position. Hopefully, somewhat <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:30) we've done in the shallow waters, we're dominant player there now.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf Coast onshore, production was up 10% sequentially, on the back of an active drilling program and recompletion program. We operated four rigs during the quarter and drilled 21 well wells. We continue to build opportunities in this area, a tremendous hydrocarbon rich region. It provides an excellent fit with Apache's exploitation capabilities and contrarian philosophy.</p>
          <p>In Canada, production was down 1% sequentially, mainly due to weather, wildfire, and pipeline disruptions; in addition the normal reduction in activity after spring breakup. We operated three rigs in Canada during the quarter and participated in 12 wells that reached TD. In the third quarter, we are currently projecting approximately 1,800 barrels of oil per day in unscheduled production disruptions due to pipeline downtimes and ongoing flooding in some areas.</p>
          <p>To change gears a little bit, the Kitimat LNG project, which Apache operates with a 40% interest, has taken important steps forward. We're near the conclusion of the hearings for the 20-year export license. And we recently announced the acquisition of an industrial site near the project's current LNG site &#x2013; plant site. And this additional site has a large amount of land which hosted a paper mill and marine export facility in the past. Due to the timing of feed work, we are now targeting a final investment decision in the first quarter of 2012. We remain committed to a target date for first production in late 2015.</p>
          <p>Kitimat LNG is a landmark step, not just for Apache, but for the industry. We are very excited about leave leading the charge on this project that if sanctioned will generate large, predictable cash flows for shareholders for decades to come.</p>
          <p>Moving to Egypt, despite what you read in the papers, Apache has no interest in entering the Israeli gas markets. I don't have any idea where that came from. Some of our joint venture folks did meet with the Israeli Minister of Petroleum, but that really had nothing to do with investing in that country. Not that we wouldn't invest there, we're very happy in Egypt and we intend to stay there for many years.</p>
          <p>We operated 24 rigs in Egypt during the quarter. We drilled 53 wells with a 91% success rate. I might say that Egypt production on a gross basis was actually up slightly, but was down 7% in net terms due to timing of our cost recovery and higher oil prices.</p>
          <p>Our exploration program delivered broad-based success across the region during the quarter. Eighteen exploration and appraisal wells yielded 13 new discoveries. Five of our discoveries were in the Faghur basin. And we made two discoveries in the each of the Matruh, Abu Gharadig, Shushan, and Beni Suef basins. These discoveries have also furthered some of our new plays, as two of them encountered the Paleozoic, one which was a deliberate stratigraphic target in the Matruh basin. We're still testing some of them. Each discovery potentially opens up a population of future locations for our inventory.</p>
          <p>We should be at 26 rigs in Egypt over the coming weeks as we ramp up our activity in oil and unconventional plays in the country.</p>
          <p>In Australia, production was up 8% sequentially, reflecting improved FPSO performance in Van Gogh, stronger than forecasted performance at Pyrenees, and the contribution of new wells onstream in our Stag field. We operated two rigs in the region during the quarter and drilled three wells, yielding two significant new discoveries at Zola and Balnaves Deep. Our Halyard development commenced production in June and averaged about 45 million cubic feet of gas a day and 819 barrels of condensate for the month. The Halyard/Spar will continue to ramp up through 2013, with a peak production of 110 million cubic feet of gas a day and about 2,000 barrels of condensate as processing capacity becomes available at Varanus island. Apache has a 55% working interest in this project.</p>
          <p>Van Gogh production averaged 8,700 barrels of oil per day net to Apache in the second quarter, which is up from 3,800 barrels a day in the first quarter. Production was halted on June 10 for an essential maintenance program and resumed on August 2. Frankly, the downtime and unreliability of this third-party vessel remains a serious concern, and we are currently working on a potentially longer term shipyard remediation program in 2012.</p>
          <p>We continued to progress our project pipeline in Australia. During the second quarter, we sanctioned Balnaves oil development project, which is expected to deliver initial production of about 30,000 barrels a day in 2014. And Apache has 65% working interest in this project.</p>
          <p>In addition, last week we announced Wheatstone's LNG execution of a major gas sales agreement with Pepco. This is an important milestone for our efforts to reach final investment decision this year. Wheatstone LNG, which is operated by Chevron, will produce 8.9 million tons per annum starting in 2016. And Apache has a 13% interest in the overall project.</p>
          <p>Turning to the North Sea, production was up 22% sequentially, driven by truly outstanding drilling results, reduced pipeline downtime, and the consolidation of our interest with Nelson. We operated two rigs in the Forties field during the quarter and drilled six wells. Two wells to highlight are first the Charlie 4-3, which started production at 12,567 barrels a day, which is the best initial production of any well in the feel since 1990. And the second, the Delta 3-5 commenced production at a rate of 8,781 barrels of oil per day, which wasn't too shabby either. These wells' result really stem from a combination of improved 4D seismic imaging, refined drilling practices &#x2013; we've been there a number of years now, and better performance in our well completions.</p>
          <p>Forties is the largest oil accumulation in the UK North Sea with 5 billion barrels of oil in place. We produced about 2.5 billion of those barrels. We expect many years of continued profitable investment opportunities in the field.</p>
          <p>We're installing the new Bravo Charlie production pipeline, which when commissioned in September will restore the remaining 4,000 barrels of oil a day of production shut in due to the pipeline issues. We are currently experiencing a field-wide five-day production shutdown, which we expect to end tomorrow, as the operator of the Forties pipeline system removes World War II ordinances found in the area.</p>
          <p>One last note on the North Sea is that one our rigs is now on location at the Bacchus development project, which we expect to come onstream in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Argentina, production was up 10% sequentially, driven by an increase in premium priced Gas Plus contracts. We operated six rigs in Argentina during the quarter. We reached TD on seven wells, five Gas Plus and two vertical oil producers. Other wells that have not reached TD yet include four important exploration wells and a significant horizontal oil test that could open up a number of opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>Unnatural gas realizations in Argentina increased from $2.18 an Mcf in the first quarter to $2.74 an Mcf in the second quarter. It was driven by second quarter Gas Plus volumes of 77 billion a day with an average price of about $4.93 per Mcf. Gas Plus production is subject to a 12% royalty.</p>
          <p>One of our Gas Plus development highlights was the first horizontal multi-frac drill in Precuyo tight sands, which is flowing over 10 million a day after more than two months of production. We're going to follow up this concept with additional wells later on in the year.</p>
          <p>We have completed fracing the first horizontal multi-frac well targeting a shale formation in Argentina. We're currently opening up some of the fracs and recovering frac fluid.</p>
          <p>On a final note in Argentina, during the quarter we gained entry into a fourth basin in the country, the Noroeste basin, through a 50% interest in a 516,000-acre block with conventional and unconventional exploration opportunities. Our partner is Gran Tierra, and we expect the first well to be drilled there in 2012.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everybody.</p>
          <p>Apache turned in another very solid financial performance in the quarter, reporting earnings of $1.24 billion or $3.17 per share for the second quarter, up $125 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results such as foreign currency fluctuation and deferred taxes and merger, acquisition, and transition costs, we earned $3.20 a share, up 11% from the prior quarter. Higher daily production combined with significantly higher oil prices increased cash from operations 18% over the first quarter of 2011 to $2.6 billion, our best quarter ever.</p>
          <p>As Steve indicated in his remarks, our portfolio continues to deliver excellent results. Our oil and liquids volumes currently make up 49% of our total production, but account for more than three-quarters of our total revenue of $4.3 billion. This is driven by the fact that the majority of our international oil production is indexed to Brent crude price. And over half of our U.S. oil production receives significant premiums to WTI prices.</p>
          <p>Our average price realizations increased 7% over the first quarter; and despite pressure on costs, our cash and pre-tax margins also increased by 7%. Cash margins rose to just under $47 a BOE. And pre-tax margin, which includes DD&amp;A, rose to $31.29 per barrel oil equivalent. You can find the details of these in the financial supplement located on our website.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on operating cost, which manifests itself in our bottom line margins. In that regard, our total cash cost for the balance of the year should remain in the range of $16.50 per BOE current strip prices.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter, our debt to capitalization ratio was under 23%, down slightly from 24% at the end of last quarter. Higher prices and production plus the sale of a small Canadian property package drove free cash flow generation, enabling us to reduce debt by $308 million to $7.85 billion and increase cash on the balance sheet by $750 million to $1.1 billion. As we indicated last quarter, most of the free cash on our balance sheet is currently located outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, our second quarter effective tax rate was 41%, on par with our first quarter. And our deferred tax percentage was 34%, in line with where we expect to see our deferred rate for the year. The previously announced UK supplemental tax increase became law when it received royal assent on July 19. The 12 percentage point increase, which takes our effective rate to 62%, is retroactive to March 24 of this year, and will result in a non-recurring charge of approximately $230 million plus a catch-up charge of approximately $60 million for the year to date through June, both of which will be reflected in our third quarter earnings. Absent the impact of foreign exchange movements and the corresponding impact of our deferred tax balance, our worldwide effective tax rate should average around 45% for the full year, primarily driven by the UK tax rate increase.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we had a very solid quarter and look to continue to build on this momentum. Our focus remains on margins and returns as well as cost and production growth, which allows us to achieve our balance sheet goals.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to comment very briefly our progress year to date as it has truly been an exceptional first half.</p>
          <p>After a very active 2010 in terms of capturing opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and expand our long-term growth horizons, the digestion and integration process could not be going much better. Our first gas production was up 20% from a year ago. And as you heard, it's heard driving exceptional financial returns. Stout first half cash flow this year of nearly $5 billion is higher than we planned, enabling us to meet our debt reduction objectives, increase our planned capital expenditures by some $600 million to $8.1 billion, and build our cash balances rapidly now. Growing our production and having excess cash flow with which to pursue opportunities for continued profitable growth really gives us a true competitive edge.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio approach and earlier contrarian decisions are also paying off. Tom commented on how our ample weighting of oil production is driving our financial results. I'd just like to note that while our North American prices in the first half on the oil side rose $20 to $94 a barrel, our international realizations climbed $32 to $107 a barrel. And on just over 200,000 barrels of oil per day internationally, that generates meaningful additional cash flow.</p>
          <p>In international gas, along the lines for not being exposed to North American natural gas markets, it's also beginning to see its day in the sun. While North American realizations declined in the first half from a year ago, our international gas prices climbed 25% to just over $3.60 per Mcf. This direction is likely to continue and make an even greater impact in Apache's future as our international gas volumes rise along with international gas prices. So rising production, strong cash flow, and a deep inventory of drilling opportunities, all that puts Apache in a very strong competitive position from which to deliver continued profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Steve, do you want to wrap things up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger.</p>
          <p>I'd like to conclude our prepared remarks by thanking all of you who attended our Investor Day in New York. Actually, we had more than double the number of people as we anticipated. Obviously, we appreciate your time and your level of engagement.</p>
          <p>We're very conscious that it's not easy to model the full value of Apache and the diversified growth enterprise we are. We have ten global regions and a broad portfolio of projects and plays. We're making every effort to bridge that challenge. At the Investor Day, we had our current inventory of projects over the next five years and the full economics of all of them. We have more opportunity today than any time in our six decades as company. Honestly, at the end of the day, it's actually putting money in the bank and making good investments and not just how good you tell a story.</p>
          <p>We may be headed over the next two or three years into some of our best years we put back to back in several years. If you want to look at our future, the best way to do that is look at our past because if you look at our last five years of growth or five years before that, we've had significant profitable growth over a long period of time. We continue to be a driven company, and we truly are just getting started.</p>
          <p>With that, I think we'll turn it back over to Alfonso.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions on the strong rates that you saw out of the Faghur basin in Egypt and the two wells in the Forties field. I think that represents about 12,000 barrels a day in Egypt and about 20,000-plus in the North Sea. The questions are: first, how many additional similarly looking opportunities do you believe have been derisked by these wells? And second, should we expect to see a jump in production in these two areas, or has that already been reflected with the quarterly results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with Egypt because &#x2013; honestly, we've just now scratched the surface in the Faghur basin because each one of those wells are either the exploration well on a separate fault block, or if it's not the first well it's a second appraisal well, and we have a number of projects to do there. Our biggest constraint for a little while is going to be, if you recall about a year ago or year and a half ago, we put in some oil facilities to add the oil that we got at Phiops, and also some gas facilities because we were starting to get more gas in this area. The fact of the matter is we are going to be pretty full starting in about September again for a while until we expand those facilities.</p>
          <p>In terms of our sequential growth in Egypt, you've got to be careful watching the quarter. I wish we could post both our gross operated as well as our nets because just depending on what happens at the close of the quarter, our cost recovery affects our nets differently each quarter. But we expect to continue to grow our oil production in Egypt. It's still a very immature play, Brian, so we have tremendous opportunities there.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, it really has been startling. We just finally processed here I think about eight months ago the 4D that we had shot and got final processing on our latest 4D. Obviously, the evolution of that technology gets better and better and we get better at it. I think we probably have 50 prospects, but I could have said that. It's a little bit like the Granite Wash horizontal well. We have had 50 projects for the last three or four years. So I would expect &#x2013; right now we are constrained there a little bit with respect to facilities. We are putting in a satellite platform. I think the guys went over it. You guys went over it when we had the Investor Day. We're putting in &#x2013; I think it's going to have 18 slots that we can also not only drill water injector wells, but we also have facilities to increase our oil production. And both of those have potential of increasing from where they are today. Yes, and that's both of those plays. Thank you, though.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And then lastly on Egypt and Argentina, can you just talk about demand trends that you're sea seeing, I guess particularly for Egypt, where I know they haven't been disrupted at all. But I wonder if you've seen any changes in the pace of demand growth, and then in Argentina as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Argentina I will tell you they are &#x2013; I've got to be careful. They need gas because they are importing gas from Bolivia and they're also importing LNG cargoes pretty significantly at prices above our current price that we're selling it at. We've had indications that we will be able to produce into that Gas Plus market whatever we put into it. That remains to be seen, but we're taking them at their word and we're continuing to try to increase the Gas Plus volumes.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, frankly, we have seen no downturn in demand because of the activities that have gone on over there. They've grown their demand about 12% a year for the last five years. And frankly, they still burn about 135,000 barrels of diesel there. So the gas prices, like the gas prices in most parts of the world, are significantly lower on a BTU year equivalent in Egypt as they are anywhere else in the world. So I don't see that demand for gas abating. Our biggest problem is takeaway again. We have now run our intelligent pig and the pipelines to the south. It has some stats in it that have 80% line loss, so we've had to cut that back a little bit. We now have enough data to be able to go in there and fix that, which we intend to do. And we should able to ramp that up significantly, honestly before the end of the year. So we have the potential to increase our gas production in Egypt also.</p>

So just to be clear, how much of the 300 million a day that you currently have, I guess, behind pipe do you think you'll be able to release once that pipeline is fully repaired to the level of integrity the you're happy with?</p>

We had the U.S. Egyptian Business Council meeting there. We had 24 major companies, not just oil companies, U.S. companies that made that trip: Google, Microsoft, Citibank, Exxon, a number of companies that are obviously much larger than us. And talked to a number of people, obviously they have &#x2013; things have changed. Certainly, I will tell you the enthusiasm there is as great as I've seen it since we've been over there for 15 years. People are generally very positive. Most of them are very positive about what's going on. And they all recognize that they have &#x2013; it has taken a while from an economic standpoint. But obviously, I'm optimistic because we drill wells for a living. But I don't see any real concern. We're sensitive to it but not concerned I guess is the way I would put the words.</p>

Given the extent of the success that you're obviously having on Forties and I guess the fact that Shell has been sitting on their hinds for quite a while on Nelson, any update you can give us in terms of progress of maybe increasing that stake or getting more involved, more active in the actual redevelopment plan, if there is such a thing?

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were just up there. We had a quarterly review up there and spent a day and a half. I tell you we have a lot &#x2013; the thing I most &#x2013; it's short term because I'm excited about a number of things. I think short term is when you look for either oil or liquid-rich gas, you can find it, which I was &#x2013; and our folks in what we call the K-Bob area have got some zones that have got some real potential. Some of the offset players are drilling and making dang good wells. But we've got a huge acreage position in there and starting to drill some wells in there.</p>
          <p>I think we have two or three. The Provost oil play, that's 3,000 feet but it's oil. We've got probably 1 million acres in there. All of it is not going to be productive, but it's a huge acreage position. The good thing about having acreage is you've got lots of chances to win. We have a huge acreage position up there. And whether it is the Montney liquid-rich, we've got a bunch of acreage in there, we have in the Cadomin play. We've picked up an awful lot of good acreage from BP that we didn't even put value on it when we did it, frankly. We didn't need that value at the time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're back on. I don't know what the production was today. I think it's a little over 20,000 barrels a day gross in the Van Gogh field. We expect to &#x2013; if everything is working right, we hope to get it up to about 34,000 to 35,000 barrels a day. We have 52% in that. And it's not &#x2013; let me tell you. That is a &#x2013; it's a beautiful permeable salt, which is great when you get rigs out of it, but it will decline, not unlike any of the deepwater stuff in the world. But it has been very hit and miss, frankly. I don't know if you follow it, but we had a swivel problem. We had to fix that. We had an anchor problem. We had to haul it off and fix that. So the last 45 days or thereabouts, 40 days, the boat owner took it off the location and did a major overhaul of a number of components, and we are just now back online the last couple of days. So it's not costing us anything other than lost production.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I tell you, that's the $64,000 question. I will tell you we're starting to see &#x2013; I'm talking about not our activity level as much as the industry's activity level because it's &#x2013; our expectations were by the end of this year we ought to be in pretty good shape with exploration permits, et cetera. I think it's slower than everybody expected. I think it is becoming more clear as to what you need to submit and your timeframes. Basically, we just had a quarterly review on both shelf and the deepwater here about a week and a half ago for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the permitting of whether it's a well or development well, whatever, we just pushed the clock back three to six months from the time period it used to take, which means we're going to have to do better planning, not only in the deepwater but on the shelf, and get our ducks in order and try to do it a little more systematically. We used to be able to drag a rig out there and drill away.</p>
          <p>In terms of it being a significant driver for Apache, honestly it's going to take three years. I think what has happened on Lucius and Exxon's well, maybe I'm not supposed to say that. They announced a 700-foot column, but it indicates the kind of things you can find in the deepwater. We built a staff around the Mariner folks. But we're also building &#x2013; we have a technical group that is a strong technical group. So I would see us over time increasing our interest in blocks that we've gotten from Mariner and also drilling some wells as the operator.</p>

          <p>I don't have in front of me specifically the numbers. I know we are putting on some gas like Halyard's on it at a higher price. But our legacy contracts really will start rolling over in 2013 and 2015. We're also in the midst of negotiating some contracts for Mastodon, which we're a non-operator, but that ought to come on in 2013. And the operator is BHP there, but the contracts are in the $7 to $8 range. So you're going to see not just the last two quarters; over the next two or three years, you're going see our gas price in Australia change significantly.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, okay. I guess sticking with Australia, I just wanted to get a sense of what is else is on the docket this year in terms of larger exploration wells you guys plan on drilling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me think. We've got &#x2013; we keep extending &#x2013; probably the best thing we have is the stuff around Zola. I think we're scheduled, and I'm not sure if it's the end of this year or the first quarter of next year. We've got an appraisal well at Zola which is going to be a big gas find for us. We can't tell. We're going to have to appraise it. But the good thing about that is, is that if we go to FID with Wheatstone, we have the potential of putting significant more volumes of gas into Wheatstone, which is the whole purpose of that is not just Julimar. The whole purpose is to expand our gas markets in Australia. We drilled a dry hole at Emerson, which was off of 356. We had a totally different kind of a strategy, a rapid play off of &#x2013; 356 was the Julimar area way off to the east. I think right now, I can't think of anything in front of us, this year anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, okay. And I guess clearly guys just announced a couple of nice discoveries in Egypt; just curious as to how many other wells you have left to drill on the exploration side in Egypt this year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've probably got 14 more wells to drill this year on the exploration side. I'd say probably, actually appraise, let me put it that way. Some of them are probably drilling right now, but we haven't seen the results yet. What we found is, frankly, two things we found that I would comment on. One is the Faghur basin area is oilier. And we see the Safa, oil Safa, which is really a plus for us over there because it's not &#x2013; the AEB, which is the upper part of the zone, lower Cretaceous is great production, but it declines quickly. And what you see out of the Safa is it's got more staying power.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I would say is we have been pleasantly surprised with what we found on the stuff that we acquired from BP because when we talk about being able to pull gas out of Qarun, we're to the point when we get the pipeline fixed we're not going to have to pull any gas out of Qarun because we're finding it on the Abu Gharadig acreage that we got from BP, which is a real plus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess just to make sure I understood that, are you guys saying you have drilled some exploration wells on the BP acreage at this point and have found some more gas?</p>

          <p>Hi, some quick ones for me. How encouraged are you in Egypt for the Paleozoic, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly the jury is still, but I have always been encouraged by it, frankly. I don't have the <mark type="ph" /> saddle (53:30) of having data. So there's no reason why it doesn't exist out there. What we continue to step out there and do is we encourage ourselves every time we drill down through the Paleozoic, and we continue to get encouraged by that. My thought is go out there in the middle of nowhere and drill a well. We haven't had that courage yet because I really think that you have a real shot at it. The last two wells that we drilled, they definitely had pay and Paleozoic, which is super.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. With Argentina, you said you were going unconventional with shale tests. Say you're really successful there going forward. How hard will it be to build up infrastructure because you'll probably have to bring in frac trucks from all over the do it, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the infrastructure from the pipeline, the good thing about Argentina is they got all kinds of pipelines crossing that Neuqu&#xE9;n basin. The bad thing about Argentina is they've got very little service equipment. In fact, we are bringing in a very large service company's equipment to help us with not just that play but some other horizontal oil plays also. And it's a very large company that's not housed in the Middle East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing that I still have to pinch myself to think about is we're not getting more for gas in Gas Plus in Argentina than we are in the United States. So it's economically feasible to bring some of these service providers into the country. They need a lot of gas down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's for sure. I think that's pretty encouraging. Last one for me is the Permian. You mentioned the horizontal wells. How much incremental recovery are you going get with the program with all the waterflood fields? And also do you have Wolfcamp shale exposure, and how aggressive will you be on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The horizontal waterflood, we have proven to ourselves that that really works. And if you put little horizontal lines on a map of all the acreage we have in waterflood, you're not in the 7,500 locations that I mentioned that are in the Permian because you can put much more of them in there. So we've got a long way to go with respect to the horizontal waterflood. It makes all the sense in the world because what most people, all of us have been doing is cycling water into permeable zones. So if you drill a horizontal well in a less permeable but still got a lot of oil in it because we're drilling less permeable wells, and the Eagle Ford and everywhere else is trying to suck oil out of there, look for oil in rich oil places. You've just got to get in a less permeable zone and frac it. And so far, it has worked very well, better than our expectations there.</p>
          <p>In terms of Deadwood, the Wolfcamp, the Cline, I'll be real honest. We're sorely disappointed in our first horizontal well there. I will tell you we tried some gee whiz stuff on the fracs. And we need to go back to doing it and see if we can get some rigs out of there because there are a lot of people drilling around us that have pretty good rates. And we've got 167,000 acres there, so it's not like it could be &#x2013; it could be a big play for us.</p>

          <p>Like most plays, actually I don't, but in parts of our acreage. I think &#x2013; because we've got people that you and I could name the top two right offsite that are making good wells, so some of this stuff is not rocket science, if you know what I mean.</p>
