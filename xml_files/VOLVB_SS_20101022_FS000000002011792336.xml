          <p>Welcome to the Volvo Group Report on the first three months 2010 conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to your host, CEO, Leif Johansson. You may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and most welcome to this Third Quarter 2010 Conference Call. We have made available to you on our website a number of slides that we will speak to respectively and we also have our CFO, our Investor Relations people, but also our different business area leaders to speak to their different business areas as we come through the program.</p>
          <p>Let me start with taking you through the group highlights, which is page 2 here. We had a very decent quarter. It was actually from a margin point of view, the best third quarter we have had but was also good is that we had very good growth and a great order intake. And all of that combined, we think, into a very decent quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the operating income there at a shade below 5 billion and operating margins of 7.7 and then we had a cash flow negative at 1.9, which is the normal procedure as you can say as we go through the different seasonality of the group. We had a strong, for example, Q2 and Q4, and then we have a much lower Q3. That's normally what happens.</p>
          <p>Good news about the investment environment this time around was that we saw Europe and I should say, Greater Europe, with good and well improving market conditions and I'll speak a little about the order intake as we come through that. We saw Asia and South America remaining strong or actually quickly growing in the case of South America. And then for the first time, and we have been waiting for that a couple of quarters as you know, we saw North America with an improving demand in the different categories but most notably so on long haulage.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Volvo Groups then on Slide 3, the Volvo Group net sales there, we had a good growth there, well above 30% coming in, clocking in a quarter at about SEK 64 billion and rolling turnover now beginning to be closer to the 260 &#x2013; 270 than earlier 2008, which was the quarter &#x2013; or the annual sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>Operating income there, you see going from a loss in Q3 '09 to a fair sized profit in Q3 '10. And then up to the right on that slide you see again the situation where the non-North American and non-Western Europe sales are actually 50%. Now the good news of course is that, that continued and there was a similar situation in the last quarter but this time it actually means that the North American and Western European grew at the same rate than did the rest of the world. And that's a new event over the past many quarters now as we see a little of the comeback, a little of a bounce-back from very low levels of North America and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>And then you can see the size of Asia there growing, having toppled North America with orders of magnitude there. And it's actually coming closer to Western Europe also, so Asia there, our business in Asia is doing very well and of course that's because of the investments we have made over the past many years now as we grew position here in Asia.</p>
          <p>If you talk a little about order intake &#x2013; net order intake and I'm making reference to a slide that we showed at the press conference but which isn't in the handout. Now you're actually seeing that we have net order intake having improved by 5% between quarter three and quarter two and that is an unusual situation where we normally have a seasonal lower order intake in Q2 &#x2013; in Q3 compared to Q2. And also if you look at Q3 to Q3 where of course that's an easier comparison because we were at low levels in Q3 '09.</p>
          <p>Today you see Europe actually up 137%, North America up 84% and South America up by 15% and actually continuing to grow their change on Q2 to Q3 for South America, but still was actually 22%. And then Asia continued to grow at almost 30% and all of that combines into a growth rate of net order intake for Trucks of around between 50% and 60% compared to the quarter three '09 and that in turn is also higher than Q2 '10, which again, we think is great news in terms of demand.</p>
          <p>Then we had also a discussion and I'll make reference again to a slide that was shown at the press conference &#x2013; a couple of slides that were shown at the press conference. We had the heavy-duty truck market in Europe and heavy-duty truck market in North America. What we ventured to say there, which I've seen in press wasn't completely understood, was to given &#x2013; was to say that given what we now know and with the order intake numbers, we could have guessed at a fairly high number and we really see nothing that would have us not get to there a fairly high number, but we said given all the discussion in media and what have you about double dips and what have you, we thought it would be appropriate to say we do see good growth here both in Europe and in North America.</p>
          <p>And we have put both those two markets above 200,000 units. And the message there was not to &#x2013; for you to listen to the 200,000, but to listen to the above 200,000 units, right. If we make that clarification when I seen the report in different media here.</p>
          <p>We see nothing today that would make us less enthusiastic than what our net order intake actually shows. And of course in reality, that's the best information we can provide you with us guessing what the &#x2013; how the total markets will develop given austerity programs and what they may be is perhaps not much of a good exercise as some would want to do. Order intake more important and above 200,000 both Europe and North America was the message, which I present to you.</p>
          <p>Then let me hand over to our CFO, Mikael Bratt here, on slide 4 in the package. The one that reads Headline Operating Leverage Through Cost Control and Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif, and you have to pick on the cost control here.</p>
          <p>We think that what you see on slide 4 here really confirms what we have been striving for here, which is to hold on to the incremented cost structure that we performed during last year here. And it seems the last four quarter here we have had a top line growth of 32% and an OpEx development of plus 2.5%, which I believe really confirms our focus and commitment to cost control.</p>
          <p>This is operational expenses, but I think also when you look at our industrial production, really see a fantastic development there and a good performance from a cost control management. And we see the margins there reaching very high, historical levels there. So, it's all good control both in manufacturing side as well as on the operations expenses side.</p>
          <p>Before we move on to the cash flow section here, I just wanted to highlight the currency exposure or the currency impact in the quarter here, which you find on page 5. This is not the level of details we have been explaining for you before. And I would say this is more of an exception this time. So we're not planning to have this as an ongoing level of details related to currency going forward here, but this time I think we need to spend little bit more time on it.</p>
          <p>What you see on the slide here is the different items from the balance sheet and the P&amp;L that has an impact from currencies. And on the top line, you see the big box here saying business area, and this is the items that you find in the business area performance in the quarter. And in there of course, you have the net flows that has gone through the books during the quarter, and that has been done of course at the spot rate at the time of the transaction, the transaction day.</p>
          <p>Then you have realized hedging contracts that have matured during the quarter. And as you can see, it's a fairly low amount here of roughly 40 billion that has impacted the result in the business areas.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, you find the revaluation of receivables and payables, and that is what we have on the books that is going to be paid or received in the ordinary course of business. And they are always mark-to-market at the end of the quarter or end of the month. And for this quarter, it has quite a significant impact here of 390 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So when you add up the main items here, you see then the 629 million we have recorded in the report. So you have here realized FX losses, and you have also mark-to-market, you could say, of the balance sheet included in this amount.</p>
          <p>On the group headquarter function, you have a reported amount of &#x2013; in the quarter of 600 million, which then is related to unrealized gains and losses on the hedging contract that is still open. And they will of course over time mature. And when we look at the hedges today, they are only hedging them &#x2013; the firm flows that are expected going forward here. Now for Q4, about &#x2013; that corresponds to around 47% of the flows that you will see.</p>
          <p>And also on the hedged book, you could say that it's primarily three to four months. But of course there are a few hedges that are stretching into a longer period than that. And when you sum it all up, you have then the net effect for the group of 200 million.</p>
          <p>So there you have all the details around the hedging contracts. I hope that will &#x2013; gives some explanation to &#x2013; and a clearer explanation to you on the impact in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So let's then move on to the cash flow. And we reported a negative cash flow of 1.9 billion in the quarter and we had a negative impact of working capital changes of 6.4, which then was net, of course, by the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>We have said before and also say it again here, that the third quarter is seasonally one of the weaker quarters for us. And you have to put it in reference to prior years. We have provided you with the Q3 cash flow all the way back to 2005. And as you can see, the cash flow has traditionally been negative, and also so this year.</p>
          <p>I think it's becoming more evident when we move on to the next page, which is page 6 &#x2013; sorry, 7 &#x2013; cash conversion cycle, where you see that we are on an improving trend when it comes to working capital. And we have certainly come down significantly from the high 70s during the crisis here, and we are now on I would say pre-crisis levels of around 30, 31 days.</p>
          <p>We see the accounts receivable stabilizing on 35 days, where about it should be. We see accounts payable heading back towards the 75-days mark, and I would say there, we have more improvement expected as we move forward here in ramping up the production. And also on inventory, which today is on 70, I would see some slight improvement there, as well, going forward.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say we are on track when it comes to improving the balance sheet here.</p>
          <p>And that takes us to the next page, the net financial debt in the group, which has come down to roughly 62% in the quarter here. We have also here seen good improvements lately here, and even though we had a negative cash flow in the quarter, we still see an improvement in the net debt position, thanks to the currency. Here we see some more positive effect from the currency when we revaluate the debt we had in &#x2013; under non-Swedish currencies. So we have a positive impact there of 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>I can confirm, of course, the 40% objective we have, and I expect us to reach that in an acceptable timeframe, when we look at the activities we have here to further strengthen the cash flow and also the performance P&amp;L-wise.</p>
          <p>On the group liquidity position, you can note here that we have taken it down a little bit. We were about 70 there in the last quarter, and we have consciously taken it down a little bit here when we feel that the situation in the market around us and access to liquidity have stabilized. So we are bringing down debt, and also with that, improving the financial net I would say. So focus on paying down debt here.</p>
          <p>So cost under control, cash flow under control, and we have a net debt position improving here with improved financial position. So I will stop there. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Mikael.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the Trucks group then. As you know, we have Mack and Renault, Volvo and UD, but we also have Eicher in these numbers now and we had them also in the relevant quarter last year, Q3 '09.</p>
          <p>If you look at growth there, we were up by 37% and that of course is based on the fact that we see an improving demand certainly quarter-on-quarter, year-over-year as I said before, but also between quarter two and quarter three and we are in a progression of meeting higher demand basically all over the world. Perhaps with an emphasis that we now also see North America and Western Europe coming in quite strongly on the order intake line, but also actually in the sales numbers already in Q3.</p>
          <p>The operating margin there at 6.6. We had a little discussion about this at the press conference. Northern Europe better, Southern Europe less strength in &#x2013; both in order intake and deliveries. U.S. coming back up, Japan remaining reasonably slow. And then we have all of the rest of the world and most notably so of course, India, China, countries around India, China and then also Brazil having contributed very nicely to our growth here.</p>
          <p>Interesting to note and we think very good is that after a messy couple of first quarters here where we were basically the only manufacturer on the block that had EPA '10 and wanted to sell EPA '10 technology and some of our competitors instead were taking orders for U.S. '07 technology very, very late in the &#x2013; even in quarter three. We now see the switch over to EPA '10 competition and as far as we can judge by order intake rates and what have you, we have been very well received with our engines.</p>
          <p>We have the benefit of having now been out in the market in the U.S. since January with EPA '10 products and customers are beginning to have real experience &#x2013; real life experience of those products and we think in general are quite satisfied with what they see. Obviously the cleanest trucks on the face of the earth right now, but also very good fuel efficiency coming out of those now many thousand trucks that we have on the road.</p>
          <p>And that has lead us into increasing production then for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and we have said as a catch-all number for the whole of the group that we will be increasing with double digit production. It's fair to say that higher than 10 in the U.S. and even closer perhaps to 20 in the U.S. and closer to 5 perhaps in Japan, those are the types of spreads there, but a good catch-all number, double-digit numbers and improving.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at our order intake of course that means that our order intake is growing quicker there and we will be building order book in many of the continents that we are operating in and we are reasonably happy with that. I think it's also fair to say that to increase production much, much more would have been difficult from a supply chain point of view.</p>
          <p>We have had good productivity in the up turn and we intend to in-focus there, hold on to those skills and see if we can continue to get that. With that comes then strict cost control and then we made the point here that in the Truck group in general and across the different geographies, we have now new legislation coming at us in Europe in '13 &#x2013; 2013 and we have a number of big projects aimed at that to be able to achieve good Euro 6 engines and also on construction equipment Tier4 and Stage III engines, but also to be able to have a good with that wave of new engines, good introduction of also other product development &#x2013; new product coming in.</p>
          <p>And that, of course, we have intend to spread around the world. So you have seen us run through fairly high numbers of product development over the crisis here at least in relation to sales. And we intend to deliver very good value for those investments as we move forward here. But product introductions and the ability to really make sure that they come out well then, somewhere around to 18 or 24 months from now. It's going to be on our minds quite a lot.</p>
          <p>With that, let me finish Trucks there and then we go to Construction Equipment. We have Olof Persson, our new &#x2013; I was going to say new, but that's no longer the case. Our now experienced leader of Construction Equipment. Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Leif.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the market had a good growth for our industry. It was up 31% in Q3 and 34% year-to-date measured in units.</p>
          <p>In that, you can see that the BRIC countries were increasing with 44% and we see a still a very good pace in China. It's actually up 33% in the quarter and if you look year-to-date, it's a full 62% there. Interesting also, or notable is that Russia starting to move. The numbers when you do the percentage, goes very high of course, 268%, but that is coming out from a very, very low level. But we see some activity then in Russia, which is of course good to see.</p>
          <p>Also in North America and Europe, some traction, up 25 respectively, 16% in the market there. And if we then look into our full year predictions, we see in Q4 continued good growth within the BRIC countries. And basically then I would say flat, a little bit up in North America and Europe and all those estimates are in the report. I would like to add that if you look at the North America numbers, I think what we know today the outcome would probably coming at the end of the 10% increase rather than the 5 that we have to spend there in the report.</p>
          <p>Moving into our performance, I think we have done pretty well. Sales is up almost 60% if you adjust for FX and we see good growth in all markets. We now &#x2013; if you take the full sales, including spare parts and everything, 55% of our sales is now outside EU and North America. Looking into the new machine sales, BRIC countries in total stands for 50% and of that is China close to 40%, but that is under new machine sales.</p>
          <p>Financial performance, best effort for Q3 ever, with 10.5%, that's of course driven by the sales, the productivity, but of course also other cost improvements that we've done over the years here. I would also like to say that this 10.5% is done &#x2013; reported despite the headwind we had in &#x2013; on the currency during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Capacity utilization in Q3 increased, up from 50% in Q2 to around 60% in Q3. And as a group in general, we are looking then to increase further our capacity and production rates going into Q4. The cost of raw material has had an upward trend during the year, but I'm happy to report that we have been able to offset that with price realization across the board. And we actually have had, on the spare parts, a little bit more increases than if you look at the raw material or input the material increases.</p>
          <p>Short-term focus is definitely very much now on the introduction of Tier4i and Stage III B engines for North America and we are on track with this big project. The technology is there and the testing is going on full-fledged as we talk and preparations for the production start-up. We have not yet seen any pre-buy effects coming out of the North America or the European markets.</p>
          <p>We also focus now of course in Q4 here now for having the official launch of the four new SDLG brand excavators between 13 and 29 ton. That will be &#x2013; we have started the production, the three out of four machines are being produced as we speak, and will then come to the market to some extent this year, but of course it will be done ramping up for the spring season in China next year.</p>

          <p>Good, Olof. Thank you.</p>
          <p>We have slide 10, Buses, and H&#xE5;kan Karlsson being the President of Buses. H&#xE5;kan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
          <p>I will say during the third quarter and the tough market conditions in North America and Europe was continued. And it's clear that we are six to eight months delayed in the business cycle, if we compare ourselves with the truck companies.</p>
          <p>In North America, both the city and coach market loomed downwards this year, with the coach market on a historic low level. But if you see our sales, we have had a good leverage on our investments and strengthened our market position, so still we are improving our sales in the North America region. We think that 2011 will be the turning point and we will see a slow recovery in the market. In Europe, it's still negative traveling also there compared to last year in the range of 10%, and we foresee a flat market from that level during 2011.</p>
          <p>South America and Asia continue to grow, and we have been successful in some big tenders in these regions, which will help our volumes for 2011. Order intake slight higher in compared to 2009, and the sales was up with 13%. The operating margin, 3.4% mainly driven by cost reduction and improved sales, and I would say fairly good leverage if we compare it to the quarter three last year.</p>
          <p>We have had two important product launches in Europe. First one, the 8900 is the first step of our new Intercity city range, and also the 9500, it's a low end coach that will then support the full product range that we have now on the coach range. And both these products are important for the European volume growth and profitability for 2011.</p>
          <p>In focus, continue with cost reduction in all regions to improve our profitability further on and we have a lot of big tenders now in the different markets, which need special attention during the fourth quarter so we can secure a good volume growth for 2011. And we continue to secure our new product launches. We have just started the US'10 introduction in U.S. and that's in fact it seems that it's done very well and the customers are very pleased with it performance. So despite the low market, we continue to deliver profit during the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Good, H&#xE5;kan. Thank you. We have slide 11, we have Volvo Penta and we have G&#xF6;ran Gummeson to speak to the Volvo Penta quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Leif.</p>
          <p>The world market for marine engines during the third quarter was unchanged and compared then to the previous quarter. The end customers in both Europe and North America that are traditionally our main marine markets are still very cautious and hesitant to buy a new boat. There are good presence at the boat shows, but it's a tough time to get orders. Actually, that's the experience we have from the late boat shows.</p>
          <p>The development for our industrial engine segment is stronger and that goes for all our major markets in &#x2013; around the world. A large part of the order book that we have today is explained then by the strong demand of industrial engines.</p>
          <p>The financial development for the quarter is weaker than previous quarter and to some extent explained by the seasonal effects we have, but we have also been hit by the currency revaluation effects and also by temporary production disturbances in our Vara factory where we produce our famous D4 and D6s engines. These technical problems have now been resolved and we enter the new quarter &#x2013; quarter 4, now &#x2013; with normal deliveries from the Vara plant. We have good control of our operating expenses.</p>
          <p>In focus going forward, we are now intensifying our efforts to increase our sales and especially in the marine area where we see great opportunities then to wider &#x2013; or to sell more with a wider product range of IPS systems that we introduced during the summer time. On top of that, we have also a wider soft product offering that we can give to our customers.</p>
          <p>On the industrial engine side, we continue to capitalize on the strong momentum and the growth shared the range of engines. We have secured a number of customers in the American genset business with good volume potentials. The 16-liter engine is a key product for us in this work. That ends my report, Leif.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Leif.</p>
          <p>If I look on the market conditions, they are still very positive trend for air traffic and we look on passenger traffic, they are up 8%, and cargo is up 27%. So we are at pre-crisis level in the industry.</p>
          <p>IATA has come up with a forecast for the airline industry, and they are upgrading and have a very positive view on the airlines making money this year. They have placed a large number of orders for Airbus and Boeing, and the order intake was up 150%, and especially during the air show at Farnborough that placed many orders. So they have a very stable backlog in the industry.</p>
          <p>Volvo Aero sales were up 3% and our operating income went up 224 million, and that was mainly due a lower cost and higher productivity, and the margin was the best ever since 2005 Q1 of 12.3%. We can also note that the divestiture of Volvo Aero Services is completed, and we had no additional costs to report regarding that.</p>
          <p>In focus is our cost management and product costs. We driving our productivity improvement program in our factory system, and we are gaining also productivity from the investments that we had done during and through the crisis as well.</p>
          <p>We are focusing very much on the new four programs that we're developing, we are from product development to ramp-up of serial production now in four different engine programs that are running until 2013. Then they enter into services for many of these programs. We can also note in our industry that we had a push out from the Boeing, for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner and also for the new 747. And we are adapting to that new program now to take inventory control and to adapt to the new delivery schedule from Boeing. And that concludes from Volvo Aero.</p>

          <p>Some positive trends continued for our Customer Finance business in the third quarter. New financing volume in the quarter was 8.8 billion, an increase of 42% compared to prior year quarter and this is consistent with strong Volvo group deliveries during the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was 48 million, an improvement over prior year quarter and the second quarter, but still on the weak side I would say. The improvement compared to the prior quarters stems mainly from reduced credit provision expense. However, credit provision expense was still an issue in the third quarter in parts of our European market. These markets and some of our customers continue there to recover from the downturn.</p>
          <p>Some highlights. In North America, portfolio performance continued to be strong. And we're pleased to say that in the U.S.A., performance returned to the very good levels last seen prior to the downturn and the financial crisis. In Eastern Europe, our portfolio continued to stabilize in a reasonably good way, but still with account delinquencies at a high level compared to historical standards. In focus for the customer finance business is the continued and accelerated profitable growth of our business in North America and Western Europe and I would say we're quite pleased with the prospects and the momentum in these more mature markets.</p>
          <p>Also in focus, the continuation of what has been, I would say, quite good controlled and profitable growth in Brazil and China. And I would add that the outlook for Russia is trending in a very positive way as well. Remaining in focus is the reduction of our repossessed inventory in Eastern Europe as we properly manage this process through the legal systems in each of those markets. The good news being, as we heard, that demand and prices for used equipment continues to firm. I would add late that this is true with all of our markets. It's good to note that customer credit profiles continue to improve. And this aids in all the points, which I've mentioned here today. So that's the report from VFS.</p>

          <p>Good. Thank you, Marty.</p>
          <p>Let me do the summary on page 14 before we open up for Q&amp;A here.</p>
          <p>We had an earnings per share of 1.38 versus a loss of 1.44 Q3 '09, Q3 '10 respectively. Operating cash flow there we have gone through in some detail with you, seasonal effect. And then we had a good sales growth here, more then 30%. Very reasonable operating margins translating into operating income then of almost 5 billion.</p>
          <p>A lot of focus here on cost reductions both in the quarter and as we move forward. And then also the fact that we are turning upwards with our production, basically across the group and across most geographies with few exceptions double digit numbers is what we call at that and of course with that, we have the opportunity to continue to drive productivity through the group.</p>
          <p>And that gets us into the part of this conference call where we will answer any questions you may have. So operator, if you prepare for that.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Fredric Stahl from UBS is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Fredric here from UBS. Could you maybe give us an idea of the capacity increases that are planned for the &#x2013; and if you can, for the Chinese construction equipment market next year? If you have a view of what your competitors are doing on wheel loaders, for example. And then secondly, if you can give us an idea of what your hiring plans are for the European and U.S. Truck businesses that you have going into 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you want to start that Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can do that. I mean the &#x2013; on the wheel loader side, I don't think that we see any major expansion plans in terms of capacity and that goes I think very well with a long term view that the wheel loader market increases are not going to be as steep as for the excavator. Where we see capacity in like ourself is then coming into the excavator market. So that's basic with you.</p>
          <p>Now I don't know if it's going to be until next year. That's more of a long term planning horizon. We see that but we have read in the press along here that there are some plans of increasing the capacity within the excavator side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to do it &#x2013; because it's &#x2013; we haven't really put all the numbers together there in terms of how much debt. But there are a number of competitors who are &#x2013; announced that they will put some sort of a excavator production into place. But it's one thing with the total capacity of new plants and other is of course what kind of models can we produce on those lines that already exist or what kind of capacity you have. So it's difficult to give a catch-all number there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on this hiring situation in the U.S. and North America, I think the best way to say there is that we &#x2013; in our assembly factories and our manufacturing sites typically if we can increase productivity, let's say, by around 5%, that should give us the opportunity to produce about 5% more without hiring more assembly factory people, and also factory people. Now we are above those numbers so we will see people coming in, but you are doing that with a view of making sure that we have it only where they are needed in formal absolute direct labor, in the sense that we don't want to lose efficiencies that we gained with the program we ran through the crisis.</p>
          <p>And also &#x2013; and that's been a big debate here in Sweden today and in Swedish newspapers &#x2013; they are doing that with a view of holding onto the flexibility that we learned that we needed to have, even if 2008 and 2009 crisis was a unique event, we think we need a little more flexibility than what we actually had. And therefore we are bringing in temporary employment and, to some extent, also manning companies in many of our facilities, to make sure that we have the ability to do whatever comes our way in the terms of market.</p>
          <p>I read, in some papers, were interpreted as us preparing for a new downturn. And as I said before, we don't see any new downturn. But we also read the papers about the austerity programs and what have you, and need to be prepared for whatever comes our way. But what we are really addressing is a fairly sharp upturn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Christer Fredriksson from ABG is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Christer Fredriksson from ABG. On page 3, you had quite a good chart on operational leverage in the business. And I was just wondering if you could give some more color on what do you think about the operational leverage going forward, especially giving consideration to what you said about adding more temps, which I guess are more expensive, and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's operating leverage, I know, is dependent a little on where you are on the capacity curves. If you look at Europe and North America, then I would expect to see reasonable operating leverage. And temps in the U.S. are not more expensive, while perhaps temps in Europe, depending on which country you're operating in, might be more expensive. Many companies certainly are. So but in &#x2013; overall, I would expect reasonably good operating leverage out of Europe and North America.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if you go to Asia where in most of our countries there we are operating at high capacity levels, then perhaps then you are on a less slower gradient in operating leverage than you would have than on &#x2013; when you start out with 50 or 60 or 70% capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult to give you a catchall number there. We will see how that develops. So far, so good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was good. And also when it comes to summer vacations, was it only Renault and Volvo in Europe that was affected on this? Or did you have any other summer stops anywhere else? Or it wouldn't be <mark type="inaudible" /> of course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say we probably have summer vacations most everywhere. What do you mean? Or how do you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean for instance, in Latin America, you have &#x2013; I guess you have a different &#x2013; you don't have vacations in the summer like you have in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think &#x2013; what are you asking? We had nothing unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. What I'm asking is that you're raising production levels basically 10% on the production &#x2013; daily production rates. I was just wondering how much basically &#x2013; where you had the summer stops? Where I can assume more production days? In what divisions I could do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best way at the group level is probably to take the difference between Q2 and Q3 sales, because I think that we &#x2013; towards the end of Q3, we had production rates that clearly came up compared to Q2. In the beginning of the Q3, we had production rates similar to what we had obviously coming out of Q2.</p>
          <p>So I think the best way is on a group level is to take the sales difference there, the decline of sales between Q2 and Q3. And then assume a normal couple of weeks of vacation there, and not any big changes compared to where we have been traditionally. If you scale back there, you will be able to do that I think reasonably well.</p>
          <p>Let me ask, I'm looking at Olof here, on China, is there a reason on Construction Equipment to look differently on seasonality in China because of the vacation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; there is one vacation week and I don't really recall now if it was beginning of September or end of August. There is a national holiday. I think it was actually in September, we had one week there. But again, that's normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Finally, just on your view on the credit provisions for the FX going forward. What do you think? How much &#x2013; do you expect to have this level going into 2011 or '12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we look at the provisions of course on a regional basis and then below that on a customer basis, and we certainly look forward to the continued recovery, but issues do remain in Eastern Europe and I would say pockets of Western Europe. But as we continue to have further good experience and as rates of improvement accelerate, provision expense should indeed go down, other factors remaining constant. So I think it's progressing in a good way.</p>

          <p>Nico Dil from JPMorgan is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please.</p>
          <p>First of all what percentage of the 51,000 trucks that were ordered in Q3 can be delivered in Q4?</p>
          <p>The second question is the revaluation of the receivables. Frankly, Mikael, a very helpful slide from my perspective. A shame that it will disappear here. What I'm looking at here is the, I take 350 million in the revaluation of receivables and payables, and some revaluation of foreign subsidiaries. That will probably &#x2013; sort of is a one-off. So just sort of wondering where that fell. Was that all in Construction Equipment effectively?</p>
          <p>Third question is, a bit of granularity on the excavators in China where you're starting up three or four different new products. Could you let us know what the total market is there for these type of excavators? So that's China for Chinese competitors, effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, perhaps we should start from the bottom there and then ask Olof first on excavators there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorting through the numbers in my head, as I'm speaking. Yeah, the total excavator market in China is reaching up to a &#x2013; 100,000 units. I think it's going upwards 80,000, 85,000 units. Out of that is the Compact business, if I remember correctly about 20,000 of that.</p>
          <p>So the biggest growth I think we will see is exactly in this &#x2013; what we call the mid-size segment, which is exactly spot on between the 13 and 29 ton. That has been the fastest growing one.</p>
          <p>I need to check, Nico, exactly the split between the compact and the mid-size, but there is a good market and a growing market in this mid-size 13 to 29 ton machines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we do the cash flow there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is correct to say that. I mean the 306 there is a one-off. It's the same as the hedge revaluation is a one-off, so to speak, if everything else is equal.</p>
          <p>So it is exactly what it is. It's mark-to-market on both sides. I mean the receivables and payables hit the balance sheet, and then we have the hedges, which is off balance sheet or mark-to-market, according to the rules here.</p>
          <p>So you have a lot of moving parts here, and it's very difficult of course to give any guidance, because first of all, you have the movements in the currency, and you also have the movements of the flows, as we move forward here. But that is by default expected to be repeated next quarter looks big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on this delivery issue, I think you need to go back to the slide on the net order intake that we showed in the morning. And there you can see that, for example for Europe, Q2 on Q3, we had about a 2% increase. And there I would probably guide and say that September delivery rates &#x2013; and you know we are sharing with you deliveries for every month, so you'll be able to see this as we progress.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably that delivery rate is probably about good for the fourth quarter also.</p>
          <p>North America, I think there we are actually beginning with a 40% Q2 on Q3. There we are beginning to fill also first quarter deliveries. And I probably would guess the same in Brazil there. That some of that order book stretches into also &#x2013; sorry, first quarter &#x2013; that we are stretching in the Americas, North America and Latin America stretching into <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Asia is probably about the same delivery rates that we had also, a little like we had in Europe. We'll share that with you as we go through the months.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yann Benhamou from Exane. Two questions, please. The first, with regard to raw materials evolution. If I'm right, the first quarter that you have a negative impact on the P&amp;L. Can you comment on the outlook with regards to Q4 and coming quarters?</p>
          <p>A second question with regards to a detail on the incentive in LatAm. So the incentive will be expanded into Q1. Do you know if there is a possibility for the incentive to be extended another time? And second, if we're speaking about orders or trucks delivered until the end of Q1 to benefit from the incentive? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think on raw material, there was a catchall number of &#x2013; was it about 100?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>100 million, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>100 negative in this Q.</p>
          <p>I think it's clear that we have a raw material increases heading our way, but nothing that we don't think that in the main we would be able to get across to the market. I'm looking at Olof here to confirm that, and he nods his head. And on the Truck side, I think we have that case also. So nothing you can say &#x2013; certainly an inflation on raw material, but nothing that would change the basic outlook that we have here.</p>
          <p>On the incentives in Japan, I just arrived by -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Latin America, sorry. On Latin America, there is clearly a situation where the incentives that are being run are growing the market. And you could make a case that when incentives come down, then that might have a slight negative impact.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you can say that the whole of the economy and all of the investments in infrastructure, including oil industry and what have you, is going very well. So the underlying growth rates there &#x2013; and that &#x2013; unlike Japan. Or actually the case for a stronger Brazilian market as we move forward, even without incentives, is much better I think than it was in Japan, where as you know it slowed down.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I'm looking at Mikael here. You have been to Brazil here. What is the chance that the incentives will remain?</p>

          <p>Okay. Are we speaking about orders? Are they always before the end of Q1 to benefit from the incentive?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up again on the issue of the hedges. And thank you very much for the additional disclosure. Three questions, please.</p>
          <p>The 390 million from revaluation of receivables and payables. I assume that's mainly receivables? Maybe you can confirm or deny that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the 390 revaluation of receivables/payables, and the 598 of marking-to-mark hedges. Should those two numbers more or less cancel each other over time? Or is life more complicated than that?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, can you remind us of your structural mismatch between revenues and cost to give an idea of your overall group transaction exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start with the 390, that is of course a net number of receivable and payables here. And our big net exposure is in dollars in the group here. I don't think I can right now make a breakdown for you here, how it pans out on receivable and payables in the different currencies here. So this is the net effect you have here.</p>
          <p>And you &#x2013; it's correct, as said, we cancel out the sales over time. But of course the hedge contract is somewhat longer than the receivable and payables, because receivable and payables are according to the payment terms we have, for example, to our suppliers and what we then have towards our customers. And that is a little bit shorter than the hedging contracts.</p>
          <p>But as you know, the hedging contract are aimed for firm flows, and you have firm flows that are shorter, but you also have bills that have a much longer delivery time, and therefore you also have a longer hedge contracts. Especially when it comes to bigger orders on the Bus side, and you have it also on the Construction Equipment side and the Truck side.</p>
          <p>So it's a mix in time there. But to a large extent, it's matching each other of course in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the structural currency mismatch? The group's transaction exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; as I said, dollar is the biggest exposure we have right now and I think in the annual report you can find the exposure for currency as of last year and it's actually on page 25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of our course, I would say that it fluctuates a little bit over time, but the currencies you have there is the major currencies.</p>

          <p>Justin Ward from Wells Fargo is online with a question.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. This is Justin Ward. First on the Construction Equipment side, there's some mixed commentary from competitors about pricing. So I was wondering if you could comment on industry pricing dynamics by region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; what pricing?</p>

          <p>Pricing in the Construction -</p>

          <p>Equipment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, by region. Is there any region in particular where it's more aggressive? Is anything taking you by surprise in terms of competitor pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the competitive landscape is of course definitely there and we see some difference across the regions there, but I rather &#x2013; I mean we have seen that we have been able to in terms of pricing, to push through our price increases, mainly as planned I would say, giving then a total of worldwide positive price realization year to date and also in the quarter. But definitely market that has been depressed for a long time and now starting to come up. We of course have a very tough competitor landscape, but I would say we have that all over the place. It's a lot of competitors out there and we are having a competitive landscape there, so I &#x2013; generally we have to fight and make sure that we are competitive in all our markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then on Truck, it appears that the European market recovery is a little slower than North America and your implied growth rates for 2011 feels like Europe is going to be a little bit lower than North America. Can you just touch a little bit on the differences in the fundamentals in those markets that are causing sort of the differences in the recovery pace there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think first of all your assessment is right, just so that you remember that we did not say, 200,000, we said about 200,000 in both continents there. But there is a distinct difference between the U.S. and Europe and that is the age of the fleet. The U.S. market has been down for quite a long while and it has the oldest fleet of trucks on the road for a very long while, even you can say after the Second World War. Now that we would suggest will mean a higher rebound rate from recovery rate in the U.S. than in Europe where instead you can say we had high sales all through '07 and '08 and a relatively new fleet. So that's certainly one aspect.</p>
          <p>Then I think construction in the U.S. is lagging as I would say construction in Southern Europe is, but on the other hand construction and even infrastructure in Europe in northern parts of Europe and in Eastern Europe, Greater Europe you can say is starting to come along.</p>
          <p>So there is also a little of a qualitative situation. We were &#x2013; we're spending a lot of time to trying to figure out where Mr. Obama's &#x2013; all his stimulus money into the infrastructure and road building, et cetera is going. We don't see that much of it. We are still enthusiastic that there are big numbers thrown around there. But again you can say possibly a view that North America would come down slightly quicker. But that might be an open issue.</p>
          <p>And then of course, you have the overall volatility of Trucks on changes in the general economy. And there we would probably put the rate of improvement as a higher rate of improvement in the U.S. given the fact that there's quite a lot of stimulus money and that normally the U.S. is a more dynamic, confident, more dynamic economy while in Europe, where we have fairly short austerity programs in many large countries and the most notably in our U.K. the last &#x2013; the latest would possibly push growth into slower growth rates. Still clearly growth but slower growth rates than perhaps in the U.S. Since we often are a multiplier on growth rates in demand for Trucks, that would also raise the case for the U.S. coming out slightly quicker.</p>
