          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone.  Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Our earnings announcement was released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.  Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to call by accessing the webcast link on our Internet homepage.  We have several slides to supplement our comments this morning.  We'll be referring to the slides during the call.  They are also accessible using the webcast link on our fcx.com website homepage.  In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the call will be available by accessing the webcast link on our homepage later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, I'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements.  Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and slide presentation and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer.  We also have Red Conger with us today, as well as Mark Johnson and Dave Thornton.  I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials and after that we'll open the call for questions.</p>
          <p>Today FCX reported third quarter 2009 net income attributable to common stock of 925 million, $2.07 per share compared with 523 million or $1.31 per share for the third quarter of 2008.  For the nine months period ended September 30, 2009 FCX reported net income of 1.6 billion, $3.70 per share compared with 2.6 billion or $6.20 per share for the nine months 2008 period.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter copper sales totaled 1 billion pounds; that was similar to last year's third quarter but higher than our July 2009 estimate of 910 million pounds, as we had excess to the high-grade section of Grasberg during the period.  Our gold sales were of 706,000 ounces were significantly higher than last year's third quarter of 307,000 ounces and our July 2009 estimate of 550,000 ounces reflected accelerated mining of a high-grade section at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>Our Molybdenum sales during the quarter of 16 million pounds were lower than last year's level of 19 million pounds, but slightly better than our July 2009 estimate of 15 million pounds.  Our recorded copper prices for the quarter averaged $2.75 per pound that was lower than last year's third quarter which averaged $3.14 per pound.  Our gold prices averaged $987 per ounce during the third quarter of 2009 and that compare with $869 per ounce in the year ago period.  Our molybdenum realizations were 13.95 per pound.  That was about 57% lower than last year's $32 per pound level in third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As you'll see from the press release, our results reflect strong performance at all of our operation and continued successful execution of our plans which we'll talk more about in the slides.</p>
          <p>Consolidated unit net cash cost which exclude Tenke Fungurume operations which are currently in startup averaged $0.50 per pound in the third quarter of 2009, substantially lower than last year's level of $1.29 per pound.  Strong cash flows were generated in the third quarter totalling $2 billion approx. the year-to-date number to $2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures during the period totaled 244 million bringing the year-to-date total to 1.1 billion.  We ended the quarter with total debt of 6.6 billion and consolidated cash of 2.3 billion.  We took steps during the quarter to repay debt through October, through yesterday we had repaid a total of 638 million in debt including 340 of redemption of our 6&#x215E; notes and open market purchases of our 8&#x215C; &#x2013; and 8 in a quarter and 8&#x215C; senior notes.  We also called redemption of 5.5 convertible preferred stock during the quarter and that was converted in to 17.9 million common shares.  At the end of September, we had 430 million common shares outstanding and assuming conversion of our 63/4 quarter mandatory convertible preferred stock which is mandatorily convertible in May of 2010.  We would have between 469 million and 477 million common shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>We also announced today that our Board has reinstated and annual cash dividend on a common stock of $0.60 per share that would be $0.15 per share per quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to slide materials.</p>

          <p>Thanks Kathleen and good morning everyone.  We've all lived through a very interesting years this past year, I just thinking back to our call a year ago, we had been several weeks in to the process of starting the changes to our business that this results for this quarter were flat.  Tremendous uncertainly is facing us because of the real desperate situation in the worse financing industry a year ago.  We knew we had changes but this time last year we didn't know exactly what those changes were going to or has to be.</p>
          <p>We have reported a good third of the quarter in the third quarter of 2008 and now to look at these results for the third quarter of 2009.  A year ago, we wouldn't have expected them to have been so much stronger than they were a year ago.  We still have some uncertainties in our business, but we've shown we can adjust to changing economic conditions and we're tremendously optimistic about the future of Freeport-McMoran Copper &amp; Gold as we look forward because of the assets that we have, our ability to manage those assets and a positive outlook for the markets that we operate into.  Some real key numbers to focus in on are simply the level of earnings that we generated, the $2 billion of operating cash flows that we generated in the quarter with only $240 plus million of capital expenditures, it's very strong performance.</p>
          <p>And that's really illustrated on slide four where we showed some results.  Reducing our three by-product credit costs by over 30% year-on-year is a significant accomplishment.  When we look at the work that our team, the Red Congress team and North America and South America where we set some very aggressive plans to change our cost structure and adjust our production profile and our capital spending and the team really executed that in South America.  But particularly important in North America where our costs were approaching $2 a pound in the third quarter of 2008 they now had a, this positive result.</p>
          <p>And our molybdenum business which was just beginning the significant downturn molybdenum prices a year ago.  Dave Thornton's team did an excellent job in adjusting the primary of molybdenum business supported by our by-product business to meet these changes.  And then the great Grasberg mine and Mark Johnson and his team with the ability to have access to the highest grade section of that mine during this time so that would generate such strong copper volumes, but also particularly such strong gold volumes at a time when positive gold prices all adds up to a great operating performance.  Even based on our estimates as recently as those at the end of the second quarter, we had 10% more copper and 28% more gold, and 7% more molybdenum.  So volumes were good, cost management has been good, plus the fact that from a mine sequencing standpoint we were at a high grade section of Grasberg mine and that occurs periodically at the times we have to mine lower grade sections but the good news is when we had that opportunity to us our guys took full advantage of it and that added up to the strong performance.</p>
          <p>Kathleen talked about the cost structure on page 5, there you can see what it is by geographic area, as I mentioned North America, which had unit cost of &#x2013; net unit cost of dollar a pound and cost before credits of $1.22 reflects a really remarkable change from a year ago and of course Indonesia benefited by the strong gold prices and strong gold production particularly the production volumes had the large credit which resulted in us having $0.50 a pound.  Overall, you can see how our sales mix soar by regions.  We have a spread between North America, South America and Indonesia with a very significant gold production from Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Markets today of course driven by China, China is having record imports, there is a story out today about the confidence that the Chinese Government is expressing about its economy.  No question, some of those imports went into restocking and the inventory builds but underlying that is a very strong internal Chinese economy which going into the year was a matter of concern because of weakness in its exports and concerns about its real estate markets but today we are seeing that the internal economy is really trumping those concerns as automobile production and consumer spending and infrastructure spending on items that are consuming commodities really are driving that economy in the face of weak demand for copper and molybdenum in the U.S., Europe and Japan, we see this relatively strong market which in those economies even though demand is weak, inventories are extraordinarily low.</p>
          <p>So, recovery in the developed world's economy is going to lead a need for consumers to buy our product.  And when you add the coming recovery, we don't predict when that might be on top of a world of strong demand from China and the rest of the developing word and next step with the continuing problem that the industry is having in terms of finding new projects to invest in and having operational labor issues and other factors that are affecting suppliers from the aging existing mines is what gives us such a tremendously positive outlook for the markets which report molybdenum, and copper, gold offerings yet.</p>
          <p>Page seven shows where we are with the terms of our outlook with out existing plant.  We're taking some steps today to invest in some projects that we had deferred, we'll talk about those in a few minutes but we're not undertaking a large scale change to the strategy that we put in place at the outset of 2009 to reflect the conditions.  And this plan shows that based on those operating plans that will be looking for heavy copper sales in to 2010 at roughly the same levels where we have today we'll have a strong gold year Grasberg affected by mining sequence and it won't be strong in terms gold sales next year as it was this year but still 2 million &#x2013; roughly 2 million ounces is a strong year for us and our molybdenum plants will continue to constrain our production sales to match the markets need for the product.</p>
          <p>Page eight gives the outlook for the fourth quarter this is again reflecting our mine plans.  We have been successful at Grasberg, which historically we've been able to do, when we're in this high-grade section of taking our short-term operating plans and optimizing them and because the grades at the core of the Grasberg mine are so hot, some relatively small changes in terms of accessing more volumes, more ore volumes translates into large volumes of copper and gold and so we continue to do that.  It's something that we &#x2013; that's just part of an optimization not a change in our long-term plans are, our long-term plans are build to maximize NPV for the ore body and remain geotechnical safety for the pit and that will continue to override what we do but simply by taking advantage of having access to high-grade ore, we're able to add additional volumes. We'll continue to try to do that in the fourth quarter.  This is our outlook and we will &#x2013; but you should take that in account thinking about where will be as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Add all that together and page nine shows, what our outlook now would be for our cost structure for the full year of 2009 very positive again, just couldn't be more pleased with seeing this outlook at the end of the third quarter based on where we were going into the start of 2009 and to have a consolidated unit net cash cost of $0.60 pound with copper prices being where they are today results in our company being very profitable and very cash flow positive.</p>
          <p>Exploration continues to be the major feature of our company and when we, it is really natural risk course company in large part but for us because of the assets within our portfolio and the ability to add reserves, resources, reserves and ultimately development costs from those projects is something that points to a very positive long-term future for us.</p>
          <p>We reduced our expenditures for exploration this year.  We're roughly $250 million for '08.  Our budget for this year is 75 million.  We continue to see opportunities that provide for us some incremental spending.  We had a lot of data that we generated in 2007 and 2008 from an extensive amount of core drilling and our team is analyzing that data and folding it into our mine plans and our future mine plans.  We'll continue to have the ability to add reserves and we're developing plans for what we want to do long term in terms of doing core drilling and exploration analysis or ore bodies really focused on our existing producing mines where we have the ability to add reserves and add future expansions in a much more straightforward way than you do faced with brownfield development, greenfield development in the world today with all the challenges in terms of getting permits and communities acceptance of new mines.</p>
          <p>The model that we show every year based on the outlook for our cash flows is shown on page 11, we show it over a range of prices and then on page 12 for analysis purposes, we show sensitivities to our model based on different prices so that you can look at it but it roughly at today's copper price we're looking at approximately $6.5 billion of 2010 projected model, I will say model to EBITDA and $4.5 billion of operating cash flows and you'll see we'll have relatively low capital expenditures as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Prices are higher.  We are very leveraged to commodity prices each $0.10 change in the copper price affects our operating cash flow numbers about $260 million.  So $0.20 is over $500 million of operating cash flows to those numbers and copper prices are volatile.  The near-term outlook for prices is one in which you could develop scenarios for weaker prices or stronger prices.  We're going to be prepared to operate in whatever scenario develops but this gives you an outlook for just what our company do in this environment.</p>
          <p>Page 13 shows that capital expenditure, current capital expenditure outlook, we're now in our annual cycle of developing our plans for 2010 so we're looking at all this and they're likely to change.  For 2009 we're now looking at capital expenditures of 1.4 billion which is consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, roughly half of the spending level we had in 2008.  We have added a couple of projects commission to that would increase the current outlook for 2010 to 1.4 billion and but that is subject to our continuing analysis of where we're going.</p>
          <p>These projects included couple of things that are mentioned on page 14.  At the old historical mining district of Miami, Globe just to east of Phoenix here which was a key for mining industry for many years.  We have significant reclamation of activities ongoing from historical mining activities we have had a plan to mine material in connection with the reclamation activities we had deferred that.  We're now reinstituting that originally we thought it would cost $100 million, but because we have excess equipment because the adjustments we made to our Arizona operations to scale back high cost incremental pounds.  We now can do this project for much less $40 million and it will give us some copper while we'll advance our reclamation activities.</p>
          <p>At our large mining Peru, the Cerro Verde mine where we have the opportunity and the long term plans to have major expansions.  We're continuing to drill the resource there and we have the information available to us that would justify major expansion.  We are going to go forward with a optimization, our programs spending about $50 million to increase the mill rate there and add $30 million per year of incremental copper at a very low 30 million pounds of incremental copper at a very low cash cost, as both these projects have extraordinarily high rates return.  At El Abra, our major mine in Chile, we are in the final stages of mining the oxide ore body that was available to us.</p>
          <p>We have had a project that called Sulfolix that we have worked on for, sometimes to look at how we would approach the development of a very large and growing sulfide ore opportunity.  We had originally planned to start that in 2009.  We deferred it for a year and then in the process of thinking about what to do going forward and we've now made the decision to proceed with Sulfolix project.  This is a very positive brownfield expansion extensive mine life by ten years providing significant copper production.  We'll have $450 million of capital to be spent over the next three years and about $600 million total project, this since &#x2013; since the Phelps Dodge transaction, the drilling data that we got from El Abra has really been very encouraging and beyond this project, we're looking at potential further expansions perhaps partnering operations with near by mines to develop the very large sulfide ore body through a mill opportunity.</p>
          <p>At Grasberg, we've continued in 2009 under our constrained capital program continue invest in the underground ore bodies, which we have now completed the expansion of the DOZ mine to 80,000 tons per day that's one of the worlds, if not the worlds largest single block caving underground mine there in the shadow of the big Grasberg open pit, but it is very large profitable and efficient operation.</p>
          <p>We're investing in a smaller high-grade mine called the Big Gossan, and in the Grasberg block cave we're continuing to do what's needed to develop that ore body so that when the Grasberg open pits depletes, which we're projecting around 2015 and we'll continue to evaluate that.  We will be able to immediately go into operation with the block caving operations for the very large extension of the existing ore body that we're now mining at the surface to mine that in a very large block caving operation underground.  And we're very comfortable with our technical ability to do that based on our 20 plus year experience, 25 year experience of mining underground.</p>
          <p>And then we're also completing the feasibility study to mine the very large reserves that we have established adjacent and underneath the DOZ mine, the deep MOZ mine and that will be available to us to start up as a DOZ mine wraps down.  This is continuation of that block cave mining that we began really in the early 1980s as we just go deeper, identifying the ore body and completing the development.  All of these in the context of an industry that has challenges and finding attractive economic investment opportunities are very highly attractive because of large volumes long life and very low cost.</p>
          <p>Tenke Fungurume, again, very pleased with what our construction and our operating team has been able to accomplish in a very difficult environment because of it's location in Central Africa.  The absence of infrastructure and just the challenges of doing business are in a place where infrastructure has deteriorated and the mining industry had really dried up we began construction there early in 2008 and in roughly a 15-month time period we had completed the basic plant and had begun to produce copper.  Our first copper came out in March and during the third quarter we produced 54 million pounds of copper.  The construction activities for the mine, the copper processing facilities, cobalt facilities and the SO2 plant are now complete.</p>
          <p>By late, in the third quarter, we had reached design capacity for the copper production and we're continuing to ramp up and deal with start of this year is for the SO2 plant which has a big impact on cobalt production.  So, we are actually operating, moving product to market and selling it.  We have started a feasibility study which we will commence.  We've done planning for it.  I talked with the engineering firms to evaluate our second phase of this project.  It's more of an optimization effort which will require low amounts of capital and we &#x2013; but it would give us the ability with really very little capital to expand capacity by roughly 50%.</p>
          <p>This is &#x2013; we are now on slide 18, the largest investment of any kind in the history Democratic Republic of Congo was total investments to-date for this initial project approaching $2 billion, our partner Lundin recently hosted an analyst visit to the site and analysts who went there were able to see really a world-class project in terms of it's operating design and its construction.  We built this project using the same standards that we would apply anywhere in the world.  We have developed significant infrastructure to set the stage for future expansions, we're investing in social and community programs and in terms of the country this project provides significant employment for a country that really needs employment, our opportunities for businesses by local contractors, significant taxes, royalties and dividend payments through the government participation.</p>
          <p>We paid a lot of taxes to-date even though we haven't had production roughly just under 150 million &#x2013; just under $150 million.  We made significant transfer payments to Gecamines; it's a state-owned company.  So it's from the standpoint of the government if you look at this contract in relation to contracts around the world this is a contract, it's very favorable with respect to the DRC as host country.  They get just over 50% of the total economics of this project through taxes, royalties and dividends.</p>
          <p>We have been participating in a review of our contract as all the contracts in the country have been reviewed.  There have been &#x2013; has been publicity about positions that Gecamines has taken and certain representatives of governments to try to increase those benefits we are working very cooperatively with the government to be responsive to the issues that they raised and will continue to do so.  We are encouraged by comments that a number of people involved in the government are making about seeing the benefits and the importance of this project from the country's perspective and are working to get this matter resolved although it's not resolved as we speak today.</p>
          <p>Kathleen talked about our balance sheet and looking back, we took some steps that have been very positive in setting us up little from a financial position and liquidity standpoint to deal with what we have to deal with this past year.  The equity raise that we did immediately after combining with Phelps Dodge in March 2007, the use of the cash that we generated when commodity prices were, were hard to reduce debt.  And now that we're generating excess cash we're continuing to improve our balance sheet.  And today we are $6.6 billion of gross debt and $2.3 billion of cash and a maturity schedule shown on page 20 that has just miniscule amounts of required debt repayments to 2014; our company is in a very strong position.  We recently through the day have made $638 million of debt reductions through calling one issue of notes and retiring roughly 300 million in open market purchases.  We also took steps to call on, in the money preferred cost convertible security that was issued several years ago in connection with our acquisition of shares that Rio Tinto owned and converted that preferred stock into common stock and then increased our cash flows by not having to continue to pay the preferred stock dividends.  We also have on our balance sheet the mandatory convertible preferred stock that we issued in 2007 that will mature in May of 2010 and that will automatically go into common stock again eliminating the preferred dividend requirement for that issue.</p>
          <p>So, we have got a strong balance sheet, strong liquidity position, we have shown that we can manage our cost structures in a very aggressive and positive way.  We have very attractive near-term and longer-term growth opportunities which we will expand as we continue our exploration activity.  We will &#x2013; with the cash that we're generating we'll continue to look for opportunities to further reduce debt.  Today, we have announced that our Board has authorized the reinstatement of a common dividend initially at $0.60 per share annually.  Our company has a long tradition of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks and we'll be continuing to review our opportunities as we go forward.</p>
          <p>That's a summary of the positive situation that we're in today.  And operator, we would like to open the line for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and congratulations on another strong result.  I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts with regards to the timing of ramping back up at some of the other U.S. assets such as Morenci?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dave, that's something that we are, we began plans for as we were curtailing operations.  The decisions we made about curtailments were made and we were going through that process this time a year ago of looking at alternatives and not only thinking about what we could do to reduce in the near term the high cost incremental pounds but what will be the consequence of that in terms of ramping up because we were confident at some point we'd do that and we're continuing to review those plans now.  We're likely to make some changes in the near term, but to have a full scale return to maximum production is going to be contingent on our seeing evidence, clear evidence of recovery of copper demand in the U.S. and Europe and we haven't seen that yet.  Same could be said for our molybdenum business.  It's going to be a situation that's available to us that we will act when the time is right, when the market needs those commodities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And as a follow up, let's assume for a minute that the assets that are shut down today shut down or scaled down, today scaled down.  On the mine side and delivery cost how should we be thinking about that number beyond Q4, i.e., is that $1.15 per pound sustainable into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on input prices.  About 25% of our cost company wider energy costs.  So, pricing has risen some with the price of copper so that will have an impact.  But we every time we go through one of these things and we've all been through several down cycles during the course of our careers you learn things.  You learn things about your operations and you learn how to manage things and as we ramp up we're going to be able to sustain some cost efficiencies that we've learned through this process.  Our safety statistics are much better now than they have been in the past because we have on average a much more experienced workforce and we continually try to improve our safety programs.  But there are things that you learn through going through a time like we did this past year and we're going to be able to hold on to those.  So for purposes of your modeling I would suggest you look at the elements of our cost and come up with your own estimates about input cost and then with the basic cost structure should be sustainable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning Richard, and just congratulations to you, Jim, Bob, Kathleen everyone at the Freeport team for doing just a great job once again and beating everyone's expectations.  But I have a question on one of your supplemental slides, slide number 29, which shows the copper equivalent cross section, the mining sequence for the fourth quarter and to me I don't know, just eye balling it looks like in the fourth quarter you are certainly looks like primarily in that high-grade part of the core at the Grasberg mine.  Is there a potential for you to exceed the third quarter copper output in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be overly optimistic to think that we could exceed the third quarter just based on the third quarter was in such a high grade section.  This is a &#x2013; this is just a cartoon type schematic which you can see &#x2013; we are, from that we had an average greater degree of access in the third quarter than the fourth quarter.  What we have the opportunity to do is perhaps, I guess we have done in the last couple of quarters and historically improved on our outlook, but to be able to get to that level that we had in the third quarter is overly optimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just last question regarding 10-K, I know you had a lot of cut off dates with the government that government has put out and negotiations come and go, and I think the last one was a couple of Mondays ago, but can you give us an update on those negotiations?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's &#x2013; there's really not much to say Mike, other than that we're continuing those discussions.  This thing has been going on now for two and a half years, we had a process earlier in the year with a special commission that we had made a lot of progress with and it appeared that this was coming to a close.  There was in effect a new process started in early August that we have been participating with, involving government officials in Gecamines and in those discussions continue.  From our standpoint, our position has been consistent and that we have a contract that was negotiated in a visible fashion from 2003 through 2005.  That contract is bonding under Congolese law.  It has international arbitration provisions associated within that there is a dispute and we're operating under that contract.  We're not getting a new contract approved, but it's a revisitation review of our existing contract.  So, we have &#x2013; we've listened very carefully and we want to be cooperative and a good partner of the government.  We've offered to do some things differently without changing the underlying contract and this is more or less a continuation of the same sort of discussions that we've been having for a very long time now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that was a separate issue.  That had to do with a reported incident corruption by a government official who was convicted recently embezzling money out of a bank, a government bank account that we were paying some fees for temporary workers into.  And in connection with the government's investigation of that they did arrest three of our employees and held a trial and those employees were acquitted in that trial.  We of course have our, doing our own investigation of these issues.  We take it all very seriously.  There was never any credible evidence that we've found or that was provided at this trial about any wrong doing as far as our employees and we were of course thrilled when the acquittal came down and they were released from being detained.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the 7 South area, in the area that we were able to accelerate mining in the third quarter that area is we've got about 10 million tons left in the pit bottom and as we complete that mining in 7 South which will be done about mid year next year  The 8 East deposit or the 8 East pushback that you see on the cross section against takeover and right now 8 east is providing more than 50% of the ore and will as the 7 South points down 8 east will continue to access better grades in 2010 and that will be the majority of our metal for 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And that's, and this is something Mike, I know you've followed for years, of course, you brought report ever since the development of the Grasberg and as the mine matures and this is a very large open-pit mine almost 3 kilometers across and a kilometer deep.  With the high-grades at the very core of the &#x2013; the bottom of the pit our volumes are going to be affected at any point in time, it is just where we are in mine sequencing.  It's not a question of grades changing and so forth actually the grades or the ore body are being very consistent with the models that we set that we've established through all of our thousands of wells across that we drill and the volumes is very over the quarter year-by-year about where we are in our mine plant.</p>

          <p>It's a &#x2013; it will be a combined program of looking for potential opportunities in the marketplace to reduce debt, we would like to reduce our debt, we're only to going to do that.  We don't feel like, we have to do it, we'll only do it if the market opportunity is there to do it on an economic basis, we're going through our process right now.  I am looking at our capital plans assessing the marketplace and when the opportunity is right, we will &#x2013; we look forward to the time of investing capital in our business because those have great returns.  We don't want to do that too quickly but we're also going to be prepared to do that and then we reviewed on a continuous basis with our board the opportunity to return cash to shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great, and on the thing on Tenke where you are looking into optimization and increasing the capacity, can you give us some timeframe, what do you think it's going to take to achieve that end, do you &#x2013; is there enough infrastructure available to bring that copper and cobalt out if you &#x2013; when you achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's stages, it's stages I mean, the first stage is a relatively low cost straightforward opportunity to expand production about 50% and we're going to kick off the feasibility study for that.  But it's we will report more to you on that as we go forward, but it's relatively low capital requirement.  There will be a next stage would be an opportunity to do a major expansion of the oxide ore and the resources there but that would require more capital and more time.  Then ultimately the future of this project is going to be driven by the sulfide ore and there is a layer of mix oxide sulfide ore that is very high grade that would be part of the plan.  And if that stage of dealing with a sulfide ore, that it will require significant amounts of additional infrastructure, particularly from a transportational standpoint and we're talking with a government now about restoring real capacity.</p>
          <p>There will be power investment but we're &#x2013; everything we've done so far has been done with a view that we will ultimately invest to grow this project to be a world-class, world-class ore body.  But it will be done in stages and particularly as we look at that sulfide and mix store opportunity, we still have to do ore drilling and exploration analyses in metallurgical work and development planning but that's the stage that we require significantly greater infrastructure that what we have today.</p>

          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to congratulate you, Jim Bob, Kathleen and your entire team also just taking a hard actions early on to position the company the way it is today and I think that really should be applauded and certainly not forgotten.  I got a couple of questions here, and my first question is a strategic question, does it make any sense to consider becoming more aggressive in hedging your inputs like energy and I am not only thinking about going through the futures markets but does it make sense to own energy sources with the company now throwing off very substantial levels of cash?  And then I have one more question too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tony we continually look at opportunities and strategic views along those lines.  Philosophically, we see that there is a correlation between our input cost for energy and some of our other input cost and the price of copper.  So that, when copper prices weakened we benefited by the weakening of energy cost and other input cost and by the same token as prices rise because those costs are a fraction of what revenues are for copper.  We benefit even though those input costs rise.  Philosophically, we are not a hedging company.  We don't see ourselves as traders and we really see ourselves as an opportunity for investors to get exposed to these commodities markets in an unhedged position.  Investors have the opportunity themselves to hedge of course, but we basically have historically had a philosophy of not hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and even though at times obviously you can maybe obtain some energy sources that might be lower cost just to provide even better margins for you over the cycle to keep more of that in effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Tony if you have hindsight you can do that, but if we had obtained an energy source 15 months ago when prices were so high in hindsight that would be the wrong time to do it.  So it's easy to look back and say if we had done X and Y at certain times it would be good, but we've been very successful over the years of approaching this thing on an unhedged basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know you have.  The other question I have for you is in regards to the Grasberg and in thinking about the transition to full underground mining in 2015.  For modeling purposes, how should we think about your total production there and also how is the site production delivery course, how is that likely to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the transition is going to take a period of time.  We can't begin to blockade until the pit is depleted.  We can do development activities, get prepared to that but the actual commencement of the caving operations will be at the time the pit depletes.  So there will be a period of time where there will be a ramp up.  We've always had this valley <mark type="ph" /> approach during those early years and we're taking some steps through what we're doing with the DOZ mine, what we're doing with Big Gossan, what we're doing with stockpiling material to help offset those.  The cost for the underground in Europe is really again going to be a function of energy cost.  We benefit underground and that we don't have to move waste rock like we do above ground.  We don't have the kind of big haul truck fleet and like the shovel fleet that we have above ground.  The cost structure is going to be very attractive.  It is very attractive right now for our DOZ mine.  Our labor is an issue.  We're doing extensive training right now to prepare ourselves for that.  But let me just say that it's going to be depending on input costs a very attractive operation and over the life of the mine it will be something say less that $0.40 per pound net at $800 goal.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello all.  Going into the downturn you had outlined a plan that if you go into the mid 4 billion pounds of copper production range.  Now in respect to you're taking a cautious view and have outlined some growth plans now, but based on your asset review that you have done in the meantime, would you be able to say is that still a number for a production rate in a positive comparable environment that you would feel comfortable with?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark Liinamaa thanks a lot for your question.  Absolutely, I mean the one thing we haven't done is lost any resource opportunity with what we've had.  Among other reasons but one of the reasons we went forward with Tenke was we had obligations under our contract and we wanted to preserve that opportunity.  But all the curtailments that we made are other operations or places where we own the rights to the resources and we can step up and expand them.  So, the 5 billion pounds plus of outlook that we had before is certainly there for us.  I mean it requires investment, and requires some time to get there and with our exploration opportunities we can see opportunities to grow beyond that level.  So, we haven't lost any of those opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  Question for you on the China situation there's been lot of talk of inventory copper can you comment on that, do you agree with like the numbers of million tons and things like that, is that something that worries you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David it is what it is I mean I wouldn't say it worries us we're encouraged by the growth of the Chinese economy and their spending on infrastructure and the fact that the economy hasn't run into any of the really significant bumps in the road that were predicted earlier this year.  We don't have any particular insight into the inventory levels, we're expanding our commercial activities there historically they've been a really small part of our business but we are expanding our sales of copper concentrates into China we're selling cobolt in the China and selling some molybdenum there.  So, in terms of what we're seeing from the commercial contacts we have there, people aren't over concerned about this level of inventory the biggest concern that we hear from our Chinese customers is the availability for copper for what their needs are going to be long-term.  And so they are projecting tremendous amounts of growth, tremendous amounts of resources needs in a world where those supplies are very limited.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hard, it's hard for us.  Everything is always on the table.  It's hard for us as we look at opportunities, to find opportunities that compete with our own internal investment opportunities.  And I use this &#x2013; I make this comment many times.  If you buy something you end up having to pay for that resource to the current owner.  With our resource opportunities that we can invest in on our own, we have the resources and we can invest in them and capture all that value for our shareholders.  So, if the right opportunity came to us and then you can be sure that, bankers are always in our offices and we have a group that's monitoring everything that goes on around the world.  The right opportunity is there.  We're in a position to take advantage of it.  But it's very had for the opportunities that we see to compete with what we have available to us internally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob.  Let me just use that as an opportunity to talk about a couple of things.  We appreciate very much the congratulations over the quarter that Richard's been operating and changes we've had but there is largely fast operations we have molybdenum, many of the continent of greater productions.  The exploration opportunities, where some of the acquisitions were concerned, the question just asked every time, when we made the acquisitions into a tripod and <mark type="indiscernible" />.  For <mark type="indiscernible" /> its is subsidized together.  What we basically did was to set the stage for use development program to delineate assets of both companies more particularly the Phelps Dodge company because we had and you know we had a very active program that we're delineating the bottom of the ore because of our undergoing operations that was upcoming in 2015 and many of the mines that were in the Phelps Dodge package.  The oxide ore was the focus of the opportunity and I know everybody that's being following us knows the definition of oxide versus sulfide ore, but for those that hadn't gotten the picture yet, imagine having a bunch of peaches sitting around and some of the peach was ripe and that was exposed to oxygen and the whole rest of the peach being unrecognized.  That's what oxide ore was, a very good decision by Phelps Dodge was to develop a process of bleaching, so to brightened part of the peach that was oxide could be taken at a dollar and the rest price environment in the copper business.  So, all of that was investigated and the drilling was done to really outline the oxide ore.  In many cases, and we just talked about the El Abra situation, the good part of the peach that was considered not exposed to the erosion was never delineated to any extent, but we did early on in the merger the Freeport McMoran and Phelps Dodge was just spending a lot of money about a $300 million exploration program that was really a delineation program and what we confirm is that the sulfide part of the ore and all of these mines has tremendous new potential all the way from our newest to the oldest mines and this has been great mine in the Congo and really once again all of it have been evaluated there was the oxide part of the ore body because of the bleaching ability as opposed to having to go through complete refining process in a smelter.  So all of these sulfide ore bodies, you could look at as being as second part of the acquisition, we're required to proven ore which was principally in the sulphide <mark type="ph" /> situation the oxide ore some information was variable of the sulfide ore with increased exploration opportunity.  The exploration/delineation as we've told you before are still called brownfield exploration opportunity that are done in the existing mines where we had existing infrastructure.  So they are far superior to going out and trying to buy new assets when you do a great merger which Richard and the team have not only done the merger but have continued to take opportunity to combine the resources both the natural resources and the human resources and end up with this model for production that gives us once again multinational, multi-metal company it has copper gold moly, cobalt and obviously with gold in over $1,000 an ounce with the amount all reproduce at the Johannesberg which follows our international production cost.  As Richard said, our acquisition of the sales side 3/4 merger, set the tone and therefore new acquisitions for us is very hard to find.  This acquisition we putting these two companies together.  We feel good.  It's got years to run before us defining the total potential.  So, I hope that first actually why our acquisition although always something that we'll consider are just not as attracting as developing our own resources as a result of the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold merger.  Thank you Richard.</p>

          <p>Yes.  We have obligations with some time requirements to start feasibility studies.  I mean we're required to develop the resources if they're economically feasible and there was a timeframe that required us to initiate feasibility studies once we reach commercial production for the first phase of the development.  I mean this is consistent what we want to do.  So, we don't see it as any kind of owners requirement.  But there are timing requirements for initiating studies and to assess feasibility for resource development where next typical with concession agreements around the world and we're inline with doing that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure six months or so.  We are &#x2013; we are just in the process of beginning to contract &#x2013; beginning to contact engineering firms to work with us on it and we expect to commence that study at the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand, we are aggressive in order to develop this.  You look at the &#x2013; we always point to the development at Grasberg that we've been operating at that site from 1972 to 1988 when the discovery wells, discovery holes were drilled and for drilling the initial core holes in the Grasberg, 10 years later, we had spent almost $4 billion and it had gone from the operation that had less than 20,000 tons today through its mill to one that was operating at 240,000 tons per day.  In terms of aggressiveness and development, this is a company that's committed to that and with given co-operation with the government's ability to operate the development of infrastructure and what we believe is going to be very attractive markets within the coming timeframe we are going to be very aggressive about development here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then last question, can you just talk about how the IMF could potentially play a role in helping to iron out the negotiation process with the government here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the IMF is not directly involved in our project, the IMF and World Bank and other international institutions are working with the government in terms of its overall financial situation and, as Hilary Clinton recently visited the DRC in connection with her trip to Africa and she was encouraged in the DRC and other African countries to take steps to encourage private foreign investments effort.  I think all of that the world wants to see Africa and the DRC succeed and success requires significant private investment by reputed companies and that certainly what we bring to the DRC.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I just wanted to see if I can get some more color or elaborate now that we're back on the table.  Now, I just have about three issues, first of all will there be any fall-outs in production or is the timing now set up that you can go ahead and once the oxides run off, you just maintain the steady state sort of at around 300 million pound plus.  I guess my second part...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that Brian is yes, we should be able to sequence this because we're building a new leach pad and with the ability to sequence spending we ought to be able to maintain relatively stable levels of production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I assume the second part of the capital up from 450 to 600 in 2015 that's just continue to build additional pads in the future that doesn't get you any more production or is it the because the great fall off or something?  What's the extra 150 up past 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That sustainable that's just to sustain the production level for the life of the ore body.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Life ore body and I assume none of this relates to what you sort of talked about a little bit in the call earlier what I would call elaborate too that there is some more ore outside of what you're seeing right now which might lead to a larger operation with or without a potential partner going forward, everything we talked about today is just standalone on the 300 million 10 year extension.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right and this is one of the things that I refer back to Jim Bob's comment that you go back to the time we combine the companies, we knew about the Sulfolix project, we knew that that was built into our plans of having to have a longer mine license <mark type="ph" /> of significant volumes at attractive cost for <mark type="indiscernible" /> what we've learned since then though is through our exploration activities that there is much greater opportunity now than we saw 2.5 years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I guess that begs a question why you just don't ramp it up bigger right now given, is that just a cautious view, it sounds like you have the data it doesn't strike me that it's capital constraint view given your cash flows, what is that that just hold it up is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We looked at that, I mean that was one thing we analyzed just to whether or not we go straight to a mill, mill opportunity from doing business and then in regards to desert challenges are power in water.  And so, we are continuing to analyze those to find ways of meaning those challenges efficiently, but what our analysis showed us is considering the timing for going forward with the mill development, it was economic for us to go forward with this Sulfolix project in terms of maximizing NPV.  So, we're not &#x2013; this doesn't eliminate the mill but if we're going straight to a mill, we would not had the benefits near-term of the economics that we have from Sulfolix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And just maybe just on another comment mad earlier about Miami, the capital cost came down from a 140 million because you said you can basically use equipment from other shutdown mines.  I think we're going to go ahead and do that.  Does that in any way really slow you down and bringing back to the other production in the U.S. Southwest, I guess David was asking about or is that just a, it's purely an economic timing trade off that we can move the trucks over to Miami it will be cheaper there than reopening the other stuff, the U.S. southwest or is there a reclamation requirement that makes you go back to Miami and do that first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there was reclamation then we're going to have to do in any event.  So, that's the context that we were dealing with.  Before when we were buying trucks to support our mine plant at other mines to do the Miami project was we're going to have to go out and buy new equipment.  Now, we have that equipment that's available to us.  It's not going to slow anything down.  It's just rather than having the equipment sitting idle, we're going to put it to work near term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then would that be fair to assume that the Miami cash cost at Miami would be lower still though than the currently shutdown other U.S. Southwest operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's going to be in the dollar range and again that's because it's mining for reclamation.  So, I mean it's taking cost that we were, some of the material we're moving, we're going to have to move anyway.  So, now we're just going to capture some copper out of it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Richard and again everybody congratulations on a really strong quarter.  My question was really more about the 2010 guidance for gold.  I think that's really a lynchpin to perhaps why the street may have a lower year-on-year outlook for you guys, and if you could just kind of quantify the certainty with the projections for lower gold output at Grasberg in the last two quarters you've been annualizing output at a rate of over 3 billion pounds sorry 3 million ounces for your company and next year you are quoting closer to a range of less than 2 so that 1 million ounce fall off in gold is a big headwind and I was just wondering given that you've already for two sequential quarters sort of beat your own internal guidance if you're not feeling a little bit more optimistic about you base lines for 2010 guidance at this point in another words that they have upside from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let's see Jorge this goes back to the comments that Mark <mark type="ph" /> Johnson had, we're transitioning from one mine phase at Sevens <mark type="ph" /> to the 80's phase which is at a higher elevation where grades are lower and then we'll be lowering 80's down to higher grades over time.  So we are, that's our mine plan and we will be following that mine plan.  So we know that mine plan based on what our model show us for the grades and the sections that we're planning to mine this is &#x2013; this is our current best outlook and so it's not, you can't compare an annual run rate for what we've done the last two quarters with what we'll do in any future quarter because we're just simply mining in a section of the mine that has different grades there's still extraordinary high grades it's just this is &#x2013; this is the heart of this grade ore body that we've been mining.  Now, I'll go back and say that as we then on a day-to-day basis execute these mine plans, Mark works with our team and Papua <mark type="ph" /> and these guys and they make decisions to say, here some high-grade ore that we can access and if we can do that in a way that's not disruptive to our long-term mine plan and acts within our parameters of geotechnical safety, we do that and so particularly, I just go back and say this, particularly when we're in the high-grade sections of the mine and 2010 we will be, not as high-grade as we were in the third quarter but a very high-grade section of the mine.  Those decisions to access small volumes of ore can translate into larger volumes of copper and gold because the grade content of that ore is so high.  So I think that we'll have likely opportunities to improve on 2010, you can't guarantee that but history has shown that we've ability to do that but it won't be going back to the quality of the ore that we mined in the third quarter.  We don't see that as headwinds, I mean I know &#x2013; I know analyst have to come up with quarterly estimates and annual estimates.  We look at this as a long-term ore body that's going to provide really strong volumes at very low cost and strong cash flows and that's what we operate this thing for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, fair enough and I appreciate that color.  The second question I had was just regarding the base line dividend that you declared for 2010 at $0.60, historically you have the flexibility when you're paying that quarterly run rate.  I think in the third quarter of last year, you're paying around $0.50 to just on any given quarter start to bump up that rate, should we take the $0.60 base line for 2010 at this point or do you see upside flexibility as you get into 2010, again getting back to this idea of excess free cash flow, would you allow yourselves the flexibility to change that policy sort of intra-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.  I mean our Board reviews financial policy every quarter.  As you noted in 2008, we actually increased the dividend.  We have done that a couple of times since we merged with Phelps Dodge.  In the past we paid some special dividends.  Between the market conditions, we have authorized stock buyback program.  So, we will be to the extent the markets are strong, we're funding our capital expenditure, we're taking advantage of opportunities to reduce debt, excess cash, the priority would then be looking to return to shareholders.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge <mark type="ph" /> let me just make a comment about the projection of our goal.  When you are looking at the open pit as you just brought up in your question, the symmetry of the open pit, we have no latitude because we have to keep that high above from being in a position to have any kind of a slope.  As we go underground, if you look at past to 2015, you get into this big golden hush <mark type="ph" /> you would recall it at the bottom of the pit, which reach mine in and out over in the open pit because of the symmetry of the open pit, once we get underground and we're broad caving, we don't have the, high wall to deal with, so you have a lot more focus or been able to stay in the high-grade ore.  So, 2015 usually sound like a long way off as we sit here about to approach 2010 it becomes ominous and as Richard just said that more focus stability we don't have all the hall <mark type="ph" /> out of the open pit and don't have the symmetry of the high wall to deal with.  When underground can become a very efficient operation as you literally stick into the core of the ore body where you can just take the high-grade ore and not have to take the waste on the high walls as we've done from the beginning open pit.</p>

So we will start including it in our overall the cost presentation.  It is in our financials.  We are making full disclosure about this.  You can see what the unit costs are right now, so we're not, it's not like there is not anything being disclosed.  Your question, I think launched the fact when we're going to include it in our overall cost numbers and once we reach design capacity in 2010 we will include it in our overall numbers.  Again as a segment as we do with North America, South America, Indonesia and in Africa, but all the data is there so you can see the unit cost is going right now.</p>

          <p>Congratulations on the $2 plus and all the good decisions over the last year however painful they were that went into it.  I've questions about the acid plant at Safford, which I believe was started and maybe a 100 million of $250 million budget had been spend and the Climax project were something like 200 million of 500 million had been spend.  I guess I have a strong enthusiasm for U.S. projects that are already permitted partly billed nobody should search us <mark type="ph" /> throw people in jail easier places to operate maybe.  How long can you hold those projects idle until you might be required to take a reserve against investments?  What is the outlook for restarting those projects?  Also this morning Moly mines in Australia had a $700 million financing for iron ore and Moly from a Chinese company, as you delay other companies seize opportunity and thus that weigh into your decision making.</p>

We want to start that project, it is the worlds best development project in the Molybdenum business, you're right, we've spent money, we have a lot of construction work done, we have mills in place, we really need two summers construction seasons to get that project going about $350 million and we'd have the design capacity for 30 million pounds annually of cobalt, at very attractive cost structure and we're going to go forward with that.  We are the world's largest producer of Molybdenum.  We have great positions in all the market places for that and as the market goes forward we've constrained production at Henderson our standalone mine.  We have Climax ready to go and we're going to protect our market share, we're going to be profitable and we're going to do that at the right time.  We agree with you John it is a great asset and we're looking forward to go forward and develop it.  The sulfur burner at Safford, is effected by the sulfuric acid market which has changed so dramatically over this past year.  Red do you want to talk about that?</p>

John, the sulfur burner project was stopped both to conserve cash and take advantage of the good asset fundamentals that we found quickly earlier this year and in the Southwest we are continuing to reevaluate when it would be appropriate to reinitiate that investment as we say it's permitted and ready to go and we're just looking for proper timing and opportunity on that.  It will save on logistics and give us good long term prices going forward or costs.</p>

          <p>Yeah, currently we're using the same route from South Africa that we used to bring in the massive amounts of materials we brought to site during construction.  And so, we're shipping copper and cobalt by truck down through from Tenke Fungurume to Angola and then on to Johannesberg by truck.  The transit time is taking 20-25 days.  We are talking with purchaser of the product they're looking at taking the product from Angola into Darussalam so there's alternatives.  We are having discussions right now more about restoring rail within the DRC that's where the infrastructure is so low, actually Kathleen is giving me numbers to show that we're averaging less than 20 days transit.  So all of that's working well, it's a long truckhaul, has a lot of trucks but they are contractors and again it's something that we've had experience in working on for sometime because of the inbound material from construction.  We are beginning, we are engaged in discussions with governments with some other parties about restoring rail options within the DRC and ultimately the most favorable option would be to connect with rail roads in Angola that which was in traditional route which Angola's restoring it's rail system now.  So all of those things are items we're actively working for.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, you guys have estimated 75 million exploration expense for 2009, but with the 73 million that you've spent year-to-date, that implies just 2 million in expenditure in 4Q '09 is that correct and should we expect such low levels in 2010 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you shouldn't expect that.  No, we &#x2013; 75 million was a general budget, I think that number you're talking about includes -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Includes research, so actually the budget you are comparing that to it was 75 million for exploration the 15 million for -was a 20 million for research.  So we're spending about own rate with our budget, we will be &#x2013; but we want to spend money on exploration, our exploration has come up with ideas for that make sense, we're not going to constrain them our budget numbers because it add such significant value.  We just a year ago as we were developing our plans, we were in a cash constraint mode that was going into the year we didn't know where we were going to be at the this time of the year and we had a lot of data and our exploration team to continue their work, we didn't take off any emphasis on exploration, it just we decided to curtail core drilling and some field work and continue to do analysis to see, see where we were going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But with the understanding that you guys have a large amount of great internal projects you do anticipate exploration expenses increasing for 2010, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the second question would be with regard to the open market debt repurchases, previously you guys had mentioned that where is perhaps would be nice to be investment grade it was not driving any of your behavior is that still the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, we were able, we were to operate effectively in the financing markets and I think we have a lot of credibility within in the credit markets with what we've done in the past and we don't see that as being constrained.  We &#x2013; we are investment grade rating &#x2013; rated by both S&amp;P and Fitch, we believe, we qualify for it with Moody's and we'll continue to talk with him about that but we don't see our rating as being any short of constrained strategically with what we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So the debt repurchases, surely are driven by desire to increase the flexibility of the company as well as to lower the annual interest expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, similar question as David's.  I understood when obviously there was some really yield to your paper and how attractive the returns might be, but given that you have talked to a lot of different much higher return opportunities, why would debt buybacks be the best strategy here because at this point you're capturing may be a 6 to 7% return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But compare that with a return we have this potential amount of cash we have on our balance sheet.  And as we look forward, we're going to continue to generate cash.  So we have the resource, we're not constrained by any capital.  The capital spending or for exploration spending by cash, so we got ample cash resources and when we have the opportunities of comparing the interest cost with virtually no amounts we get for cash, it just make sense to do it and in the long run we want to have, as we always have &#x2013; we want to have a very strong balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so it's just minimizing negative spread on the cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Minimizing as you said improving the balance sheet.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  I have a question regarding CapEx, I noticed in the past that 2000 CapEx were estimated to be about a billion and I read today that it's now taken up to be about 1.4 billion, I was wondering if there was any granularity in the CapEx where that's going to be?  I know you've made the strategic shift in over the last 12 months in moving to a higher ore grade lower cost mines and that's really worked for you.  And the way I look at CapEx is really an indication of where you think demand supply is going to be in the long-term.  So, I take it as a positive that you're taking CapEx up, I was wondering if you could go through the split between equipment purchases and sort of repair and spare parts and also I think about nine months ago you canceled some shovels from Joy Global, I was wondering if some of those equipment purchases that were delayed third quarter, fourth quarter last year now coming back on with the better commodity pricing and better demand outlook going forward?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, let me say we did cover in our slides where this capital spending is going to be directed and that's with the startup of the Miami operation and the optimization project at Cerro Verde and there is slides on that.  In addition, we always are evaluating our maintenance capital spending and they're some increase in that.  We are growing through a budget process right now in which we will update spending, we expect overtime for the reasons you said to see our capital spending raising, we haven't reinstated the major expansion projects that we were previously engaged in and so there is not huge amounts of new equipment orders in this expansion.  But the redirecting of equipment and the engineering cost and the execution cost of what we're doing but we have not yet begun to make major new expansions of equipment purchases.  In fact, we still have a substantial idled equipment fleet that we are looking to put back to work.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think it's more likely that you put that back to work or move it as in the case of Miami?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are, we have been.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking advantages of moving it.  We shipped trucks from U.S. to Indonesia.  We reallocated trucks from South America.  We shipped trucks to South America for plants and so earlier in the year we're talking a good bit about how we were dealing with our inventory management and our supply chain management and again, I take my hats to the guys, they really have been able to do this in a very effective way and it's been one of the reasons that's helped us reduce our cost by, unit cost by more than 30%.</p>
