          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Eni's 2008 Interim Review Conference Call hosted by Paolo Scaroni, CEO. My name is Tina , and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our 2008 interim review. In the first six months of the year, we have made significant progress in implementing our long-term strategy. In E&amp;P, where our strategy is to deliver sustainable industry-leading growth, we have achieved a solid production increase of 2.8% in a climate of unprecedented oil price trends.</p>
          <p>Net of the PSA effect, our production growth would have been 8.1%, with robust growth of 2.3%, excluding portfolio acquisitions. We have positioned ourselves well to deliver superior future growth through our successful exploration and by building a position in unconventional oil in Venezuela and Congo.</p>
          <p>These excellent results specified the strength of our E&amp;P division, which has prospered under the stewardship of Stefano Cao and of his right-hand man, Claudio Descalzi, who today succeeds him as COO.</p>
          <p>In the last year and half, when almost 100% of Stefano's time was absorbed by the Kashagan negotiations, Claudia has been running the rest of our E&amp;P activities globally and has been directly responsible for most of our major achievements.</p>
          <p>Claudio joined Eni in 1981 and has grown through the ranks of the E&amp;P division to become Stefano's natural successor. I am extremely pleased to introduce him to those of you who have not yet met him and take this opportunity to thank Stefano for his 30 years contribution to the Group.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, where our strategy is to consolidate and expand our European leadership, we have continued to grow our international sales rapidly, reporting a 20% increase in the first six months of the year. We have also strengthened our strategic position through the acquisition of a 57% stake in Distrigaz, the Belgian gas operator, which is nearing completion following yesterday's signing of the shareholders' agreement with Publigaz and through our investment in Hewett, potentially Europe's largest gas storage project.</p>
          <p>All this has been accomplished while maintaining a disciplined approach to investment and a strong financial structure. As you all know, one of the rating agencies has recently downgraded our TAT. However, our gearing has remained stable at 38%, below our 40% ceiling.</p>
          <p>Our financial results will be presented by Marco Mangiagalli today, accompanied by Alessandro Bernini, who will tomorrow take the helm of our Finance Department. There is no need to say how much we have appreciated Marco's contribution over the years and are pleased that his expertise will stay in the family as Chairman of Saipem. I will now take you through these points and give you a little more detail.</p>
          <p>Turning to E&amp;P, our production growth will continue to be extremely resilient in the face of high oil prices, both in the short term and in the long term. Indeed, even assuming an average oil price of $112 a barrel until year-end, our full-year production would increase by 2%, one of the highest growth rate in the industry. And even assuming average oil prices of $120 a barrel from now until the end of 2011, well above our and industry forecast, we would still grow production by 3% per annum. This is because only 16% of our reserves are governed by return-based PSA, which are highly sensitive to oil prices.</p>
          <p>Considering the evolution of oil price and industry's cost expectations since our strategy presentation in February, we have revised our long-term price deck to $65 a barrel. This is the new threshold we use to stress test the profitability of future projects.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our long-term growth. We have secured our prospect through significant and successful exploration activity. In the first half of 2008, we have added 450 million barrels to our resources from our exploration program, with a significant contribution coming from the leases we acquired from Dominion last year, which had a particularly short time to market.</p>
          <p>This is also true for our discoveries in Egypt, Australia and Pakistan. Through Galp, we have also had an exposure to the giant Tupi field in Brazil. Looking even further ahead, we have added 35,000 square kilometers of new acreage to our exploration portfolio, which will sustain our resource replacement.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, Eni has taken a major position in the unconventional oil sector with agreements in Venezuela and Congo. We had been able to gain access to large resources at competitive development costs, thanks to our longstanding relationship with these legacy countries, which means we can capture additional value through operational synergies, especially in Congo, and through our proprietary EST technology, which enables us to convert heavy oil into high quality products.</p>
          <p>Both projects will start to deliver oil within the span period and are expected to be profitable at oil prices well below our long-term scenario. These two projects combined are expected to reach a total production of 500,000 barrels per day in the long term, with over 300,000 barrels in 2015.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Kashagan, I am pleased to announce that in June we reached a full settlement of the dispute after a complex 10-month negotiation against a backdrop of rapidly rising oil prices. Satisfaction for the positive outcome has been recently reiterated by the Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov. This settlement will be finalized in a definitive agreement by October 2008.</p>
          <p>Since the signing of this MoU, the Kashagan projects regained momentum with KMG approving over 200 contracts. We have also secured a green light on a further 200 awards. The experimental program did not stop during the negotiation, 70% of the offshore modules are ready to start production, and all the wells needed to reach the planned output of tranches one to three have been commissioned.</p>
          <p>We have also started working on tranche three of the experimental phase. Finally, we have agreed with KMG, the new governance, to manage the development and production operations on Kashagan and its satellites.</p>
          <p>Turning to Gas &amp; Power, let me give you some more details on the two significant transactions we have carried out in the first half of the year to consolidate our leadership in the European gas market. With Distrigaz, we have acquired a strong position in Belgium, a key country in the European gas market due to its high level of interconnectivity with the Centre-North European transit gas networks.</p>
          <p>The integrated management of Distrigaz with Eni's gas portfolio will give us the opportunity to extract valuable synergies by optimizing gas sourcing, infrastructure and sales. Eni with Distrigaz will have 21% of the European gas market.</p>
          <p>With the shareholders' agreement we signed yesterday with Publigaz will lay the basis for an effective management of the Company and a profitable development of our gas operations in the area. We now expect to close the acquisition of the majority stake by year-end as soon as authorization from the European Commission is granted.</p>
          <p>In line with our strategy of consolidating our gas prices in Europe, we are looking very closely at the developments in Spain regarding Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Gas. We look forward to talking to Gas Natural in the framework of our existing joint venture agreements.</p>
          <p>Moving to Hewett, storage capacity will provide an increasingly important competitive advantage in the European gas market, as domestic production declines and we become more and more reliant on pipeline and LNG imports.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, we kicked off potentially Europe's largest gas storage project, with a 210 million acquisition of depleting fields, which are strategically located to serve most of the UK, Belgium and Northern Europe, where there is a lack of storage capacity.</p>
          <p>We are now in the process of assessing how much of the 9 billion cubic meters of total potential capacity will be converted to storage, following which we will update you on our expected CapEx.</p>
          <p>The new storage capacity will enable us to take advantage of seasonal gas price differentials and general price volatility, leading to enhance margins. It will also support our strategy of pursuing higher margin client, while further reducing the risks of entering take-or-pay territory. The Hewett project leverages on our E&amp;P and Gas &amp; Power competencies. It is another example of how Eni's integrated approach can create value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our R&amp;M division, I am pleased to report that we have taken the final investment decision on the construction of a full-sized EST plant in Sannazzaro, which we will have &#x2013; which will be up and running by 2012.</p>
          <p>This project, which will cost around &#x20AC;1 billion, will increase our conversion index, giving us double-digit returns as well as demonstrating the potential of this technology, which is a key pillar in our heavy oil strategy. As for marketing, we have increased our market share in Italy by 1 percentage point to 30%, thanks to our drive to improve quality and service and our successful loyalty program.</p>
          <p>Our achievement in the second quarter of 2008 not least our industry leading production growth, have enabled us to produce solid financial results, particularly in terms of operating profit. On the basis of these strong results and our confidence in the Group's outlook, we'll propose the distribution of an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.65 per share, an increase of over 8% versus 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, I will let Marco Mangiagalli to give you the detail of our &#x2013; about our first half results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo. Thank you also for your word, and good afternoon to everybody. In fact, it has been a long period 15 years and an exciting one, but everything must come to an end. Having given the opportunity to become President of Saipem, which I consider a great privilege, and consequently, I can say that there have been no regrets in taking the decision to step down.</p>
          <p>Shall I say that I'll miss you all? It would be probably too much and you wouldn't believe me. But in any case, it has been always exhilarating and I must admit, a pleasure to deal with you.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I'll now comment on our results focusing on the second quarter and starting with a quick overview on the trading environment.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2008, the Brent price averaged $121 per barrel, increasing by approximately 77% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The European refining margins averaged $8 per barrel, increasing by 17% versus the corresponding period of 2007. And finally, the euro showed an appreciation of 16% versus the US dollar compared to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like remind you that Eni's results are affected by several issues, including the seasonal factor affecting the demand for natural gas and petroleum product used for residential heating, the demand for which is highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter. Therefore, Eni's operating profit and change in net debt in the first six months cannot be extrapolated for the full year.</p>
          <p>Going to the results, adjusted net profit in the second quarter amounted to &#x20AC;2.3 billion, an increase of around 4% compared with the second quarter of 2007. This was largely due to a 34% increase in the adjusted operating profit partly offset by the higher income taxes due to the higher contribution of the &#x2013; to the pre-tax profit from the E&amp;P division, and the impact of 5.5% supplemental corporate tax rate on the Italian subsidiaries operating in the energy sector.</p>
          <p>This supplemental tax relate is effective from the 1st of January, 2008, and we cannot rule out possible changes in the final version of the relevant decree. Any change will be accounted for in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit in the second quarter totaled &#x20AC;5.6 billion. This result mainly reflects the strong performance of the E&amp;P division, on which I will comment shortly.</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbon production, as Paolo said, in the second quarter increased by 2.1% compared to the same period of 2007, averaging 1.772 million boe per day. The increase is backed by the contribution from the assets acquired in the Gulf of Mexico, Congo and Turkmenistan, the startup buildup and better performance in Egypt, Angola, Pakistan and Venezuela. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of PSA that accounted for approximately 100,000 barrel per day. Net of this effect, growth, as being been said, would have been of 8.1%.</p>
          <p>Second quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;5 billion, up 43% compared to the second quarter of 2007, mainly as a consequence of higher production sold and the higher realization prices denominated in dollar. It must be said that the liquid realization prices were reduced by approximately $7 per barrel on average as a result of the commodity hedging contracts we have entered into. Furthermore, the result was negatively impacted by depreciation of the euro versus the dollar, higher operating cost and the DD&amp;A as well as increased exploration CapEx. In dollar terms, second quarter adjusted operating profit increased by 66% versus the corresponding period of 2007.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas &amp; Power division, overall gas volumes sold increased by 7.7% in the second quarter of 2008, totaling around 22 bcm driven by the growth in international sales. The Gas &amp; Power adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;587 million, up down 13% over the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the second quarter of 2008 amounted &#x20AC;799 million. This compared to the &#x20AC;758 million in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Marketing segment result decreased by 7%. This reduction was primarily due to a lower operating result of power generation activities due to the provision relating to certain electricity revenues recorded in 2005 and 2006 that according to the Authority for Electricity and Gas were not entitled to be subsidized. Marketing activities accounted for a stable result. The favorable scenario mainly related to the euro position versus the dollar and the higher sales in the target market were offset by the stronger competitive pressure in Italy.</p>
          <p>The regulated business generated &#x20AC;275 million, up 26% versus the second quarter of 2007. The increase is due to the higher volume transported and distributed due to the colder weather condition as well as to efficiency gains and the incentives provided on the new investment in the transportation network. Finally, international transportation showed a substantially flat trend versus the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the R&amp;M, adjusted operating profit of this division decreased by around 19% as a result of the higher maintenance activities and the appreciation of the euro versus the dollar. This reduction were partially offset by higher refining margins in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Marketing, the weaker performance of the wholesale segment was partially offset by the stronger contribution from retail marketing in Italy.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2008, the Petrochemical business posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;157 million compared to a &#x20AC;67 million profit in '07. This loss is due to the negative base chemical margins resulting from higher feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>In the oilfield services and engineering, sector second quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;253 million versus &#x20AC;203 million in 2007. The increase is attributable to higher results across all business lines. The other activities segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;56 million, substantially flat on year-on-year. And finally, corporate activities posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;37 million.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, operating activities generated a cash flow of &#x20AC;10 billion. On top of this disposal and other primarily exchange difference contributed for around &#x20AC;1.6 billion, bringing the overall cash generated to &#x20AC;11.6 billion. The cash flow generated the supported the significant investment that amounted to around &#x20AC;8.7 billion. On top of this, dividends and buybacks absorbed &#x20AC;3.2 billion, bringing the overall cash used to &#x20AC;11.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt, as at the end of June, slightly increased to &#x20AC;16.6 billion and our debt-to-equity ratio remained stable at 0.38.</p>
          <p>Coming to the end of my presentation, let me focus on the cash returned to shareholders. In 2008, we will pay out at least &#x20AC;5.4 billion as follows: &#x20AC;0.70 per share representing the 2007 final dividend, proposed &#x20AC;0.65 per share representing the 2008 interim dividend and at least for 0.4 billion of share buyback completed year-to-date. The overall cash distribution allows us to generate competitive returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening. And we are now please to answer to any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wonder if you could help us with Distrigaz just in terms of maybe quantifying exactly when you think it will contribute to earnings and how we should be thinking about modeling those earnings into our forecast, both in terms of the current earnings from Distrigaz and also the synergy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Company will contribute about 200 million in EBIT. This is before synergies. We are working Publigaz as a minority shareholder to define the detailed integration plan, and as soon as we have reached final agreement on this plan, we will be presenting in a dedicated document exactly the ongoing contribution of this business including the synergies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I also ask, since you mentioned on UF Gas, can you tell us what you are able to about the shareholder agreement that's in place?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We certainly have a preemption right in the case of a sale of Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Gas. And we have a complex close which is related to a change of control. So we might &#x2013; we certainly can exercise the preemption and we might trigger the close related to the change of control. We will enter into discussion with Gas Natural probably in September to define what is the best solution for our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask just the price that that stake is carried at does that reflect historic cost investment or does it relate to the purchase price from Gas Natural?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I well remember, when we bought the first 50% of Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Gas, we paid it less than 300 million &#x2013; no, 400 million, the first 50%. So it was a fairly small amount. Now, of course, the value is much higher than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. A couple of questions please. Firstly, on the movements from the first quarter to the second quarter in the tax in exploration and production, if you could explain the movements between any effect of the Robin Hood tax, if there is deferred tax effect in Libya and so on, and how that tax rate might move in future quarters? The second question is on the Group tax, how Group tax might evolve? And then on your CapEx guidance, I saw it move up from 13.3 in the first quarter to 14 in the second, I wonder if that's a function of activity in new projects, exchange rates or cost pressures, if you could elaborate on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Italian taxes are one of the most complex in the world you think of. I will ask Marco to give you some detail, first on the Robin Hood tax and then on the total tax framework which we would be moving this year and then more specifically on CapEx. Marco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paolo. Barry, it's a kind of a mission impossible, but if you are patient I'll try to drive you through this Robin Hood tax, which in fact is the sum of two main pillars. The first one is a 5.5 supplemental income tax effecting from January 1, 2008. As a consequence of this, the statutory income tax rate for energy companies now again back to 33% as it was in previous year. Substantially, the Robin tax law canceled the reduction of the company income tax led to 27.5% which was introduced very recently with 2008 budget law. As a consequence of the 5.5 supplemental tax rate our additional current taxes have been recorded in the second quarter for an amount of &#x20AC;154 million, which affected the adjusted net profit.</p>
          <p>Out of this amount around 100 million regard the first quarter because the tax has been decided recently but it is applied starting from 1st of January. And this one is the reason for the increase of the tax rate in the second quarter versus the first quarter. As a consequence of the increase in the tax rate, the net deferred tax asset has been reassessed and a special gain of &#x20AC;94 million has been recognized in the reported net profit.</p>
          <p>The second pillar of the so called Robin Hood tax refer to the fact that the energy companies aren't anymore allowed to state inventories for tax purposes with the LIFO method. And consequently, the methods provided by international accounting principles, weighted average cost or FIFO, must be adopted also to determine the taxable income. On the difference, between the book value and the tax basis of the inventories, a one-off 16% tax is due. For us such one-off tax amount at June 30th to &#x20AC;434 million, but the definitive amount will be determined based on the same difference at year end and will be paid in three equal installments in 2009, 2010, 2011. The reported net profit benefited of the difference between the deferred tax liability recorded at the ordinary tax rate and the one-off, 16% tax due, resulting in a net gain of &#x20AC;443 million. I wonder if it was clear or not. But believe me, that's the maximum we can do. Anything you've got?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear &#x2013; sorry go ahead.</p>

          <p>Fine. I did my best. As regard the Group tax rate, Barry for year-end, we are expecting something in the range of 53%. We do not there project any longer tax rate, so let's try to survive with this guidance just for 2008. As regard to the CapEx guidance...</p>

          <p>Marco, if you want, I can say something on the CapEx, it's easier maybe, because simply -- Paolo Scaroni speaking &#x2013; on the CapEx, we were planning to spend this year &#x20AC;13.3 billion. We now give a guidance of 14. This 700 excess CapEx are almost all attributable to the E&amp;P division and in particular, to a bonus in Libya. Bonuses for us are part of the CapEx, as you know, and this bonus Libya is related to our renegotiation in Libya which extended all our licenses by &#x2013; to 2042-2047, while I use this opportunity to tell you that in terms of tax regime nothing changes in Libya. So we do not pay any additional taxes on our Libyan production.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I had, first of all, a question of clarification. At your new $65 long-term oil price, could you please tell us what long-term production growth we should assume versus the February target of 3%? And my second question concerns the balance sheet you expect gearing to decline below last year's 38% level. Could you just remind us of the timing of Gazprom exercising its call option on the Russian assets please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Listen, on the first question, $65, we confirm our target of 4.5% in the next four years and 3% in the following three years, so will be no change. On the gearing, yes, of course, what is important is what will be the decision of Gazprom on Gazprom Neft. This will take place in the first quarter of 2009. Since &#x2013; as you probably know, we paid this 20%, $3.7 billion and the market value or what is worth it's probably 6 or something like that 5.5. All this indicate the likelihood of Gazprom to exercise the call is quite high. If they were not to exercise the call, this would be very good news, because the value is much higher than what we paid. In terms of the total gearing, yes, we expect &#x2013; we expect a small decline, not because we expect our debt level to decline but because we expect our net worth to go up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just two questions. You mentioned earlier that the Kashagan experimental phase agreement should be finally result in October. Can we, therefore, look forward to a CapEx number for phase I to be announced in October? And secondly, all past movements over the first half of the year imply a big increase in wholesale and hence retail gas prices in Italy over the course of the reminder of this year. I am wondering do you see any problem in pushing through such implied large gas price increases, or is there going to be some kind of pushback from consumers or politicians that would mean you are not fully able to put that through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first, on the &#x2013; on Kashagan, yes, in October, we'll give you a detailed new number for the experiment. When everything will be finished, all contract will be signed, we'll be in a condition to give a precise number. On the Gazprom in Italy, yes, you are right. There would be price increases in any event even if the oil price would drop gas prices are going to go up in the next six months simply because they are referring to the oil prices of today. I would say I am fairly optimistic about the reaction &#x2013; the reaction &#x2013; the methodology that is used to increase prices in Italy because this is defined by the authority which makes a very straight calculation of the increase in oil prices and this would reflect in the wholesale and retial prices. The truth of the matter is that there will be some consumers, particularly the low-income consumers which will be badly hit by the increase in gas prices. And this is the reason why we thought that it was in the best interest of our shareholders to define, kind of, an emergency plan with this contribution of &#x20AC;200 million that we are ready to give in order to subsidize gas tariffs to the lowest income part of the population.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Could you give us feel for how the variable transfer mechanism Kashagan above $85 per barrel will likely work going forward? And then secondly, on Russia, I know you've got the first European player in the downstream market <mark type="inaudible" /> Russia agreed over the last quarter. What relationship or dependency is there you developing upstream gas in Russia directly for them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, on the first question, I will ask Claudio to answer and on the second, one probably Marco Reboa who will give you a feed about our gas sales in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So talking about the first question, Kashagan is a &#x2013; slide in scale related to the price. We don't give figures, but it's just related to the price &#x2013; oil price. So the higher the price, the lower our take <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Russia, we've concluded a small sale of about 300 million. This is a single customer sale.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Cubic meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cubic meters. This is really to get started and get to know the market in view of our upstream gas coming from the Arctic Gas family of assets. We have set a target of 1 billion cubic meters by 2009 and this will be mainly selling our own equity gas. So what we're doing now, we're starting a downstream activity to get familiar with the rules, particularly around transport, which is the largest issue in Russia. 2010 will be the initial production of Arctic Gas and then that will increase significantly during 2012 and 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can say that on this <mark type="inaudible" /> we are really warming our muscles more than looking for a profit. We know the margin will be small, but we will learn a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you foresee any issues of with transport for Arctic Gas? You obviously said that that that's the most problematic element to get you hand around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you've seen recently there is specific push also from the Kremlin to have even greater transparency on the gas transport. This is to let the independence and the associated gas to flow more freely. We have successfully executed the sale using &#x2013; going by the current rules. And having Gazprom as a 51% future partner in Arctic Gas certainly makes it more reliable as transport integrated venture. We also have certain rights already agreed that these are the transport with Gazprom.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Few questions. The first one is, maybe you could go into why there are so many asset impairments in the E&amp;P division in the second quarter, especially with some very high oil prices. I'm presuming these must relate to some of the acquisitions you have made, maybe you could discuss that and I've got two other quick questions as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are right, Neil. The impairments were made on whole unproved mineral interest and assets, which refer to all acquisitions. You may remember the Lasmo, the Fortum and so on. So we looked at this quarter as an opportunity to have a reassessment of what we had in house.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Were you using the current oil prices as a basis for reserve bookings or were you using similar reference level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we normally use forward curves to test, to assess to this purpose.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks for that. The second one is around Hewett and yes, you've been the partner of Tullow in that particular field. How much due diligence have you been able to take on the whole concept of gas storage? It seems the Tullow wanted to get out for cash flow reasons for their other operations. But in terms of what you have done and looked into on this, how confident are you that this field's reservoir characteristics and infrastructure is fully suitable for what could be a very interesting part of the UK gas infrastructure, especially before the LNG coming in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have been working 18 months on this field and on particularly technical terms. We have been creating a team made up by our E&amp;P people and in particular, the people who are running <mark type="inaudible" />, our storage company in Italy together, of course, with the Gas &amp; Power team in order to evaluate the margins of this business. We are very confident that that storage is a very profitable business today and it would be even more profitable in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I totally agree with you, but have you got the necessary okay and requirement from a government point of view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet. No, not yet. This is a very good answer, not yet. We think that the UK government that is very much keen to have a storage capacity. So, as I said, the general attitude is very positive. We expect to have all this authorization in the next few months and particularly remember that this is offshore and therefore there should not be any <mark type="inaudible" /> kind of effect. This is offshore but still very close to backed on, which for us is a key hub for the gas both in the UK and in Belgium. Remember that in Belgium there is no storage capacity, zero. And in fact, this storage, you can, although it's located in the UK, you can imagine that through the inter-connector interconnected is the located in Belgium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sure. It does make the absolutely perfect sense and good synergies. And just finally, a quick question on Galp. What really is in place that would stop you having serious look at this Company as a way &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> just got over 33%, what would stop you going after this Company entirely to increase the exposure to Brazil, because obviously it must be screening extremely well in your expiration department's review of the world's future reserves at the minute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, your question is correct. No, in fact, I cannot say that our long-term strategy is to stay at 33.34% in the Gazprom. This certainly is a position that we can accept, but we want to move to a more normal position that an international company would have on a company such as Galp. Having said that, remember that paid this company, I think in 2000-2001, our stake stated &#x20AC;850 million. We've got dividends for at least 500 or 600 million and now our stake is worth something like 3 billion or more. So it has been a success story so far. The partnership with <mark type="inaudible" /> has been a success. We are ready to take opportunities in the future. And of course, the position that Galp took on two people also on Jupiter are position that we are looking carefully. We had been appointing not only in the gas division, but also in the E&amp;P, the number two in order to help Galp in the future developments and in particular, in the huge CapEx program that will necessarily take place in order to exploit the reserves. I think that in the next three to five years the situation might evolve.</p>

I wonder just in view of the relative price nature of Mr. Cao's resignation, at least to me, if you could put a little bit more color around why that &#x2013; what may have led to all of that? Secondly, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how Kashagan operation shift is actually going to work with experimental phase and whether that fully clarified in the MoU you signed.

Probably he could not see much of a future in Eni and he thought he might be looking for opportunity somewhere else. This is the best explanation I can give. On the future of Karachagan, I ask maybe Claudio to give you some more detail and as well on Karachaganak.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. So first about Kashagan, say from the third phase, so after the experimental phase, as you know we hand over the operator shift to Shell. And in &#x2013; for the second phase, we are &#x2013; we have a company joint venture &#x2013; a company that is built by all the joint venture partners that run jointly the future operations, and each major company will be in charge of the subsets the operation. So we have in the Eni, we'll be in charge for the onshore operation. So we'll run onshore operation as soon as we take care about drilling. And so, that will be the modest way a company that is in charge and subset run by one of two measures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Just let me add that with the first oil, at the end of experimental program the learning curve for us will be, at the end, we will have learned what we needed to learn our Kashagan and as I probably &#x2013; you have heard me saying before, the amount of energy in terms of, particularly in terms of human resource as we've been devoting to Kashagan in the last three years will be reduced with it. And we look forward to it because we need human resources and skilled people in other parts of the world. There was no point in using 100% of our people to receive only 16% of the profits of this venture. On Karachaganak...</p>

          <p>The second half is the main target. The most important target would be in Angola where already we have two big discoveries, that's <mark type="inaudible" /> in Italy and in Gulf of from Mexico. And we think that by the end of the year we are able to more than double of our reserves. So, we can be more or less <mark type="inaudible" />. So, we confirm our target of 1 billion additional resources in 2008 for the full year...</p>

          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. Two quick questions. Firstly, you said that you would like a more "normal" position in Galp. Could you, perhaps, explain what do you view as a normal position? And then secondly, probably a very stupid question, but obviously you have to pay taxes on the booked profit on your rising inventories under the new tax system. If you have a situation in the subsequent year, where you lose money on that position...</p>

          <p>We will get the money back at the top of the rate on top, not just on 16%, we get it back at 33% -- 37%. So we've looking forward to <mark type="inaudible" />. Now, on the position in Galp, let's say, I consider that for Eni to pull this stake of at least that company, which is in the same business in which we are. It's a kind of transitory position not just on 16%. We get it back at...</p>

Now, on the position in Galp, let's say, I consider that for Eni to pull this stake of at least that company, which is in the same business in which we are. It's a kind of transitory position and not be a long term position. Therefore, either we see the possibility of completely integrating the Company with us or we might even consider to divest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just one question and one clarification, please. Mr. Scaroni recently talked about the IOCs having to come up with a new business model to help excess reserves. I think, clearly, you had the Congo deal very much in mind. I wonder if you are looking to apply that model to other countries around the world. If so, which and would it be affected to those countries where are you already have a material upstream? And I've a followup question on Distrigaz, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, you are right. I had in mind Congo. And let me just tell you that in the next few months we would try to replicate the Congo model to other African countries. Let not me specify which was today, but we certainly have strong ideas particularly in the vein which we will deal with regards to today's players and which can used for the country in exchange for a stronger position in upstream. Then you had a second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I did. The press release today says that once the Distrigaz deal was complete you are required to make a mandatory bid for the rest of the shares. Once you had control, is it your intention to move to 100%, or for example, you make an offer at market price to limit your increase &#x2013; an increase in your stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, we have to offer for 100%, including the stake of Publigaz. So we will offer to everybody. From &#x2013; as part of our agreements, we know really the Publigaz will not divest completely from its stake. We remain with a relevant stake in the Company which are part of the shareholder agreement we signed yesterday. What will happen to the few shares which are in the market? Frankly, we don't know yet. We would be quite pleased to withdraw the Company from the stock exchange. This would consider a positive, but frankly we don't know what will happen.</p>
