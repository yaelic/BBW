        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enbridge Incorporated First Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Vern Yu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Enbridge, Inc.'s 2010 Q1 earnings call. With me this morning are Pat Daniel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; and Colin Gruending, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we may refer to forward-looking information during the call. By its nature, this information applies certain assumptions and expectations about future outcomes. So, we remind you it is subject to risks and uncertainties affecting every business including ours. Our slides include a summary of the most significant factors and risks that may affect the future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed in our public releases &#x2013; public disclosures filings available on both SEDAR and EDGAR.</p>
          <p>The call is webcast. I encourage those listening by phone to view the supporting slides on our website at www.enbridge.com/investor. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted shortly thereafter. The Q&amp;A format will be the same as we've done most recently. The initial Q&amp;A will be restricted to the analyst community, and once we're completed we'd like questions from the media. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that both Pat Murray and I are available after the call if you have any detailed follow-up questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat Daniel.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Vern, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on a very snowy Calgary day to review our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>We were very pleased to announce just a few short hours ago adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2010 of $318 million or $0.86 per share, which is a 16% increase in earnings per share over last year. These results now place us well on our way to meeting our 2010 guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70 per share. Richard of course is going to walk you through the results in a little more detail shortly, but first let me talk to those areas where we see some very substantial opportunities for further growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Over the last seven or eight months, we've been referring really to four key areas where we're seeing substantial activity and potential for growth and where Enbridge also enjoys strong strategic advantage through the existing infrastructure that we have and our proven expertise in those areas. The areas that I'm referring to include the Alberta regional oil sands, the ultra-deep offshore oil and gas, North American oil and gas shale plays and then our newest business unit, renewable and green energy.</p>
          <p>Let me go through those one by one starting first of all in the oil sands. We've been very encouraged with the continued series of announcements from major producers as they advance new or expanded projects in the oil sands. Examples like Statoil who are ramping up operations at their Leismer site, announcements by Cenovus and ConocoPhillips who are going ahead with future phases of Christina Lake. As you are aware, Enbridge has won the business to serve both of those projects. When you add the Leismer and Christina Lake projects to our work on the Woodland Pipeline to connect Imperial Oil's Kearl project, Enbridge has now secured three oil sands related projects in less than a year.</p>
          <p>With renewed activity and production forecast by major producers including Suncor, Husky and Surmont, and that's just to name a few, you can expect to hear more from us as we continue to pursue additional opportunities. Our existing regional infrastructure gives us a strategic advantage in terms of being able to scale solutions to their near, medium and long-term needs. So, just to give you an example of that, in the near term as the initial phases of large-scale projects come on stream, Enbridge is able to offer bridging capacity that minimizes capacity commitments by the customer, and then as production grows and this new phases are brought into service, we have the ability to expand our services up to and including transportation on a fully dedicated pipeline. This kind of flexibility is a direct result of having the most comprehensive system in the area that has very cost-effective expansion options in order to accommodate new volumes as and when they come on-stream.</p>
          <p>Much like the oil sands region, there have been numerous announcements in U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-deep water in the past year. As you know, we have announced 750 million in new projects to connect both the Jack, St. Malo and Big Foot gas projects into our existing gas pipeline systems. As the primary transporter of ultra-deep gas and a proven player in the construction and operation of ultra-deep facilities, we have an advantage when bidding of new projects in that area.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on building out significant asset base in the region and at the same time to leverage our gas expertise in an attempt to further expand our liquids transportation infrastructure in the Gulf, much like we did with the Big Foot Oil Pipeline. We see substantial opportunity for not only expansion of these systems to serve new customers, but expansion of our return on our existing systems as we increase the volumes with the new connections that are being made.</p>
          <p>The third exciting growth area for Enbridge is the various oil and gas shale plays within North America. And I'm going to begin with the Bakken formation where Enbridge is already the primary oil pipeline provider. I think we're all aware of the significant growth projections for oil and gas production out of the Bakken. Even the most conservative estimates indicate tremendous potential for companies like Enbridge, and we're actively working to expand our systems on both sides of the border.</p>
          <p>On the Saskatchewan side, we placed into service a large expansion in June of 2008 and we're currently in the midst of another $120 million expansion, which will add a further 129,000 barrels a day of capacity to that system on the Canadian side. On U.S. side, we placed the North Dakota expansion into service on January 1 of this year, and this 51,000 barrels a day expansion has been full from day one. We have presented a number of potential capacity expansion opportunities to our producers and expect to secure anchor commitments that will support the next project in the near future on the U.S. side.</p>
          <p>On the gas side of the shale story, we're very well positioned to take advantage of infrastructure opportunities near within our current Texas footprint. So in the last few months, Enbridge Energy Partners has announced two separate projects, and of course, our East Texas assets are located very close to the exciting Haynesville Shale play. We are also well connected in relation to the Montney play through our Alliance Pipeline, which is actively extending the reach of that system to better serve the growing gas play in Eastern DC. And just recently, we announced a new potential project that would transport NGLs from the southern Pennsylvania and northwest Virginia areas of the Marcellus play to the Aux Sable extraction plant. I think you're aware, the Aux Sable plant has approximately 20,000 barrels a day of excess extraction capacity that could be well served by this pipeline.</p>
          <p>The final growth platform that I will speak to is our renewable, or green energy opportunities. We've announced $1 billion in projects over the last seven months and we believe that there are substantial opportunities in this area, due to government and public support for this gradual shift to a less carbon-intensive economy. We currently have interests in more than 560 megawatts of green generating capacity, either in operation or under construction, and we are actively working to secure additional projects which align with our risk-reward profile. While Ontario offers a very favorable environment for investment in renewables, we're open to opportunities in other areas where there are favorable commercial terms across North America, and we'll be looking quite broadly.</p>
          <p>Our green energy business has also provided us with insight into opportunities in upgrading North America's electrical infrastructure. New electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure is needed to relieve transmission grid congestion arising from increased green energy power generation. Also, additional gas-fired power generation will be needed and added to provide power when wind and solar are unavailable, and of course, all of these investment opportunities will be of interest to Enbridge so long as they fit into our tried and true investment triangle, which I know you've heard a lot about over the years.</p>
          <p>I should also quickly mention one area of our business that will grow by improving the return on its capital. In 2009, Enbridge Gas Distribution was able to increase its allowed rate of return above the embedded regulatory rate by approximately 120 basis points to around 9.6%, and we are aiming to increase the premium above the embedded regulatory rate to more than 200 bps in 2010, so great promise and opportunity there.</p>
          <p>All of these growth opportunities, the 6 billion that we have already secured to come into service in 2012 and thereafter, as well as the numerous opportunities we're actively working on, will allow Enbridge to achieve its target to grow EPS by 10% per year on average into the second half of the decade. In addition, and Richard is going to speak to this in a little more detail shortly, you can assume that cash flow growth will be even stronger than earnings per share growth over the same time period and that puts us in very sound financial position.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Richard, I would also like to briefly cover the status of tolls on our mainline system. In the first quarter, Enbridge reached agreement with producers on the key turns of a new Incentive Tolling Settlement, which as you know we refer to as ITS on the Enbridge Mainline System, and we filed final tolls with the NEB. The new ITS is for one year and is extendable if agreed by both parties. I think it's fair to say that Enbridge and its customers continue to realize significant benefits under the ITS agreement, which really reaffirms the advantages of working cooperatively and in partnership with our customers.</p>
          <p>In relation to the tolls for the operator equipment project, the NEB has approved our interim tolls and has set a hearing date for this November to address our final toll applications and the challenges made by a few of our shippers in relation to the inclusion of operator equipment costs in our tolls. I think it's fair to say that a hearing of this nature is a standard procedure in the context of shipper complaints regarding a carrier's toll filings. Similar shipper applications made to FERC challenging the operator equipment tolls were rejected by the FERC near the end of the first quarter, and we're optimistic of a similar decision on the Canadian side.</p>
          <p>So, that's a very quick review of what would drive our growth over the next several years. And let me now pass it off to Richard to review the quarterly financial results in a little more detail. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. So, picking up on slide 12 of the slide package for those that are following that, as Pat mentioned earlier this morning, we released our first quarter results and reported net income was 342 million or $0.93 per share. That's a decrease from 2009 where we reported 558 million or $1.54 per share, but of course this year-over-year decrease was due to the 2009 year including the one-time gain on our sale of the investment in the Colombian pipeline, OCENSA, which played up a $329 million after-tax gain in the 2009 first quarter. Excluding non-recurring and non-operating factors, our adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter increased from $0.74 to $0.86 or 16%. And that's actually slightly ahead of where we thought we would be by this time of the year and puts us in a very good position to meet our 2010 guidance range. So, let's walk through each of our segments in a little more detail.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 13, Liquids Pipelines, adjusted earnings rose 37 million as compared to 2009. This 38% increase was primarily from recognition of AEDC on our Southern Lights Project and within the Enbridge System from Alberta Clipper. The Enbridge System also benefited from a higher rate base as a result of placing Line 4 into service last year and from operating cost savings. The Spearhead Pipeline increased as well as a result of the expansion, which was placed into service in May of last year. It should be noted that this quarter should reflect the peak of our AEDC earnings as Alberta Clipper came into service on April the 1st and Southern Lights will come into service in July of this year.</p>
          <p>With Natural Gas Delivery &amp; Services, results were slightly lower in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the sale of the investment in OCENSA in Q1 of last year and a decreased earnings contribution from our energy services business, which performed well this year but did not have the same level of opportunities as it did last year when the commodity markets experienced greater changes in the price of oil and gas and that was allowing for more arbitrage opportunities.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, within this segment offshore results were once again strong and the contribution of Enbridge Gas Distribution was similar to the same period of 2009, even though the change in our customer billing practice, where a larger portion of the customer's bill is shifting to a fixed component and a lesser amount will be variable, reduced earnings by approximately $7 million for the first quarter. So, earnings for EGD were flat despite that $7 million reduction from the change in the billing practice. And as you will recall, this change only affects the distribution of earnings across the year, as among the quarters it has no impact for the full year on the bottom line of EGD. In fact, as Pat mentioned and as first quarter would bear witness to, our full-year results from EGD should increase significantly versus last year, as we continue to generate cost savings which in turn increase Enbridge's return to shareholders and also increase the savings that we are passing on to our gas distribution customers.</p>
          <p>Sponsored investment earnings continue to be very strong. Enbridge Energy Partners' contribution increased by 50% year-over-year, and this exceptional performance was the result of increased rates on April 1st of 2009 as a result of completion of Phase II of the Southern Access expansion as well as placing into service Phase VI &#x2013; the Phase VI expansion of the North Dakota feeder system on January 1st of this year and that was ahead of schedule and on budget. As a result of this strong performance and Enbridge Energy Partners' confidence in its future cash flows, a $0.05 increase in the annual distribution was just announced. And this is very good news for Enbridge as this is the first increase that Enbridge will be entitled to 50% of as a result of the partnership distribution level now being in the high split range.</p>
          <p>Alberta Clipper U.S. also favorably impacted earnings. The U.S. portion of this project was completed late in the quarter and placed into service on April 1. So, the earnings that you see in the quarter reflect 67% of the after-tax earnings from the AEDC converted to Canadian dollars. And finally, corporate costs were basically in line with the prior year and consistent with our expectations.</p>
          <p>So, before I hand it back to Pat, I did want to spend a little time focusing on the strong cash flow growth that we will experience over the next few years. The expected growth in cash flow will be larger than our expected growth in earnings, and that's as a result of the fact that our depreciation is expected to be higher than the maintenance capital on our systems following our significant expansions, depreciation up but maintenance capital not so much. Therefore, even as we maintain our earnings payout level at the midpoint of the 60 to 70% of earnings, our payout of distributable cash flow, which we define as funds from operations less maintenance capital, is expected to decrease from its current level of approximately 45% to even less than that. This will allow Enbridge to self-fund all commercially secured projects as well as have the capacity to fund numerous development opportunities we have in front of us, which Pat mentioned earlier, and that without the need to access the equity markets.</p>
          <p>Thanks, everyone, for your time. And I will pass it back to Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Richard. So, let me just very quickly summarize. We are very encouraged, not just by our success in capturing a number of new projects, but by the increasing level of activity in the key resource basins and where we have a strategic advantage. Additional growth will also come from improving returns in existing businesses such as Enbridge Gas Distribution. And as Richard mentioned, not only was this quarter very strong but our cash flow growth over the next few years will be exemplary and will provide Enbridge financial flexibility that very few companies will be able to match over that time period.</p>
          <p>So with that very quick summary, let's move on to the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just in the offshore segment, when you first announced the Big Foot project it was termed a letter of intent. So I'm just wondering what the state of the agreement is today and do you have seen any risk to the project in light of the oil spill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, let me just respond generally that from what we have been able to determine, Robert, the Chevron permits are a valid stand in that that development will proceed as scheduled. As you know, it's early in the development of the issues in the Gulf to know longer term what impact may be, but we don't expect there to be any impact on this project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it a hard agreement or is it still in the LOI stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still in the LOI stage at this point, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just second question, if you look at the dividend policy, I know you have mentioned that dividend growth should follow earnings growth, and Richard, you mentioned that with the AFFO growth that payout ratio would move down. Are you considering a modest move up in the payout ratio? Is that something that you would examine, and if you would, what are just some of the key factors that would cause you to make just what would be a semi-permanent change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're comfortable with that range of 60 to 70% at this point, Robert, and I think you can expect to see us within that range. We always assess the appropriateness of that range relative to our peers and investors' preferences. But at this point, we are comfortable with it and I think you can expect us to stay in the 60 to 70% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you, Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Sam Kanes with Scotia Capital. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and congratulations on a strong quarter. This Marcellus NGL backhaul line, I guess there is room for 20,000 barrels per day in Chicago at Aux Sable, but that's an awful small line. Is it &#x2013; do you envision that it could possibly rolled out with this potential success of Marcellus into Sarnia as well, like backing and filling NGL requirements there or what would be the minimal size that makes economic fundamental I guess principal sense in the context of pipelining backwards NGLs &#x2013; dry NGLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam, it's probably too early to tell on &#x2013; in answering most of those questions. We're seeing of course in the Marcellus liquids rich gas that logically positions us very well with regard to Aux Sable, not that we are trying to capture with regard to announcing the potential project to determine what level of interest we are able to firm up. The potential could be there to move it northward as well rather than over to Aux Sable, but it's far too early for us to speculate on that. It would be small diameter in that the volumes are not likely to be large, at least in the near-term, but it's still too early to be very definitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, with respect to your increasing cash flow over earnings going forward here post 2012, you'll be in a great position here back into the acquisition market potentially. Again, you've been acquiring projects pre-construction in renewables. I'd imagine based on your principles, you'd be agnostic given that your hurdle rates are mapped in that area or any other area, or do you have an increasing focus now within renewables in general and that specifically, is there any hypothetical logics for Enbridge to pull in the Enbridge income fund 28% minority as one of your competitors or colleagues did this week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to &#x2013; when we come to the Enbridge income fund, I'm going to ask Richard to comment on that because &#x2013; but let me first of all just address your general point with regard to growing the cash flow and therefore well positioned for acquisition and further growth. I certainly agree with that and we are very pleased with the way &#x2013; now as a result of the projects built over the last number of years, we see a very rapid escalation in that cash flow. And as you probably know from our Investor Relations presentation, we pretty much doubled cash flow over that five-year period. So, it puts us in a very strong position. We're open to looking for opportunities in any one of our key areas of development. And as I mentioned, we obviously have got a lot of opportunities on the liquid side and see some significant future growth, particularly in the oil sands region in the Bakken, and on the gas side, we are very involved in the shale plays. So, we'll be looking at a number of opportunities there. Specifically, your question around renewables, we continue to like the experience that fit well in our investment proposition and we do see a continuing number of good renewables opportunities coming out that also would be involved. And possibly, as I mentioned in my remarks, looking at some areas that have come to our attention as a result of the involvement in the renewables, whether it's gas-fired power generation or distribution and transmission to release some of the congestion that has become obvious.</p>
          <p>Richard, can you comment on the income fund and share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think, Sam, there's any prospect that we will want to be buying in the minority. If we were going to have done that, it would have been something we would have done instead of converting it to a corporation. So, that was successfully completed on Monday of this week. The fund is well positioned. Its yielded price is strong and it does have its own organic growth opportunities, but it's well positioned to be able to continue to fund those effectively and continue to contribute growth to Enbridge through our 25% incentive share of cash flow distribution growth within that entity. So, status quo looks pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kuske with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Given the amounts of pipeline expansions that you've done over the last few years and what one competitor has done, there has been a significant movement in light-heavy differentials which was somewhat predictable, but when you think about the light-heavy movement and really that collapsing and then just what we're seeing in global refining markets with the new-age refineries being essentially million barrels a day and then a lot of refineries in the U.S. now being regarded as just generally small, how do you think about counter-party risk, secondly the future movements of crudes and really that light-heavy differential overtime and how that translates into tolls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there are a number of questions there, Andrew, and that probably could be the subject of a full-day discussion, which actually recently has been with the management team. Yes, very significant changes in global refining. And with regard to the counterparty risk, the first part of your question, I am assuming you were referring to counterparty risk with regard to U.S. refiners in light of the changing global refining dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct, especially the smaller scale ones.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I think it's fair to say, and I am looking for Vern on response to this, that we carry very little exposure to the downstream refiners that the majority of the tool paying and commitments are with our upstream producers. Vern, can you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. When we do have exposures to the lower rated smaller refiners, generally we have significant credit assurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, Andrew, give me the second part of your question, that was the counterparty risk part of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just on future movements, if we look ahead and there is like lot of excess pipeline capacity, export capacity out of Alberta for a period of time, Gateway of course seems like it's pushed off for a period of time, but could you give any commentary about certain liability of that and then really with the light-heavy, how the translates in tolls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we continue to be comfortable with the economic case that can be made for gateway as our customers in shippers, and you're right, the light-heavy differentials have come in significantly and probably it will stay tight for a fairly long period of time due to the excess now of downstream heavy crude processing capacity. And until we see a very significant uptick in bitumen production in Western Canada it will keep differentials very narrow, but we do see still a significant offshore premium for Canadian crude oil and the ability to move into another market and improve the negotiating leverage that Canadian producers have with U.S. &#x2013; their U.S. customers and their refiners, and we have undertaken third-party independent reviews of our theories around that pricing and have also confirmed them with our customers, and the expectation is that the economics remain attractive with being able to reach the offshore markets for that reason.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally if I may, just on the declines in the Enbridge System Spearhead from Q4 to Q1, is that just largely related to the landfill activities on Keystone, if that's what you believe?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, Andrew it's Colin. So just looking in the highlights, it's actually in the news release, you're probably referring to Spearhead volume, 112,000 barrels per day which is actually up from Q1 of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It does vary a little bit with season and with the various contracted shippers' movements, but I think you can attribute some of that to the landfill issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. The Bakken play has really, obviously, developed into a very large, significant opportunity for you, and we're seeing some expansions around that. One of these regulatory principles in Saskatchewan prior to that was that the reserves weren't all that great in the area, and as a result, there was incentives for companies, or Enbridge, to put in gathering systems, which you absolutely needed. I'm just wondering, with the development of the Bakken play, do you see any changes to the regulation there to reflect the changed level of reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is any indication of changing regulation, Bob, no. As you know, there's a great deal of optimism around short, medium, and long-term, and I haven't heard any indication of regulatory change. Richard, have you ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not aware of anything, and there is a pretty hot competition between Saskatchewan and North Dakota on the Bakken, so I doubt that Saskatchewan would want to do anything to discourage further development on the north side of the border.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, it was more or less on the pipelining tools that they could actually come down, given that it does need the fast depreciation rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I rather doubt that, there is such a clamoring for incremental pipeline capacity right now that I think the producers are doing everything they can to incent us and others to ensure that we've got the capacity in place for them on time and on budget. So, I sure haven't heard anything that way, Bob, but I'll follow up on it and either myself or Steve Wuori will give you a call back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, I appreciate that. And just a general question, on Gateway you're going through the process now, originally &#x2013; not originally, but you had an agreement with some of the producers and refiners to fund that development work in a $100 million. I'm just wondering if we're through that yet and what the process is if we go beyond that. It's hard to believe we could go through $100 million, but I guess, we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, can you respond to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yeah. No, we're not through the 100 million, Bob. That 100 million was intended to be sufficient to take us well through the approval process, not just up to the filing point. So, we wouldn't have used it all up. It may ultimately require more than that to get to the finish line on the filing process, but at the moment we still have cash in the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. One last question, Richard, on IFRS, have you made a decision on whether you'd go that way? We had one utility in Canada say this week that they were going to go to U.S. GAAP and avoid that IFRS issue, at least for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I noticed that this morning in your notes, Bob, but no, we're still on course and our intent is to go the IFRS route.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the caveat that we continue to monitor IFRS with respect to rate regulated accounting, which we expect will ultimately be resolved in a favorable direction, but that's our course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be great if it was. If not, have you looked at what impacts that might have, given the differences between rate regulatory accounting and IFRS, and I'm referring to the balance sheet here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've looked at it, we've looked at it very closely, and we also have reserved the potential to go to U.S. GAAP if we conclude that we're not going to get rate regulated accounting.</p>

Presentation-wise, there may be a few balance sheet extra lines, things like pension assets and derivatives, things that broken out in their own lines, but by and large the financials should look pretty similar to what you're used to. Any new, wonky things we'll try to break out for the investment community in our MD&amp;A in our adjusted table, and you'll likely see enhanced disclosures consistent with what the experience has been elsewhere in the world so far in IFRS.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-on question from Steve's with respect to your renewables. Would, potentially, a corporate transaction serve to bolster a growth in your renewables or would you see direct investments in assets and projects as more attractively valued?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally speaking the latter, Linda. We see the investments at the project level to be most economically attractive at this point in time. That doesn't mean to say that we wouldn't do a corporate acquisition on the renewables side, but generally speaking, it has worked best to come and buy at the project level, and we've had very good success as you know in doing that. So that tends to be where we're looking most right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And geographically, within North America, that's a pretty broad scope. Are there any highlight regions that are of most interest to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's pretty easy to narrow down in the renewables business because you tend to go where the state or provincial incentives, either through feed-in tariffs or some level of subsidization, make the projects economic. So that's obviously screening criteria number one. Number two, we like to be as close as we can be to our existing operations. We are prepared to step out from that for the right opportunity, but we do like to operate these facilities, and hence, as you probably know, we've tended to cluster them around existing Enbridge operations, but the incentive structure &#x2013; government incentive structure is probably the most critical part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where would you have build opportunities for transmission and distribution without buying into an existing utility franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on that issue, I would suggest that more likely it would be a buy into existing rather than a greenfield, in that we would be looking for some expertise in getting started in the business. I thought you were referring to the renewables, as in wind and solar, where we tend to buy at the project level rather than the corporate level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I was referring to that. Okay, thank you. Just a follow-up accounting question, maybe for Richard. Can you confirm that your first quarter earnings on your Enbridge System were booked to reflect the new ITS agreement, as well as reflect the original 2007 proposed tools on the Alberta Clipper Canada?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the answer is yes to both, Linda. Clipper entered service April 1, so it's not a Q1 issue in any way. So it &#x2013; yeah, I think you've got it right.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I just have two big picture questions. I'm hoping you can expand a little bit more on what you think the fallout in the Gulf of Mexico will be following the spill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carrie, that's really hard for me to comment on at this point. As you know, we are not a producer, a driller, an operator, and hence, I think I best leave that comment to any one of the number of our customer companies around town who would be more knowledgeable. So, it's very hard for us to tell at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question, I'm just wondering what steps you're going through right now to get to your Gateway opponents onside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are working very closely with land owners and with interested parties right across the extent of the system. And constant consultation, working with them to try to make them aware of the opportunities available to them as a result of Gateway, and to try to address concerns that they might have with regard to the environmental issues around a major construction project like this, and the offshore tanker traffic. So we're &#x2013; I won't say we're in constant meetings, but we certainly are in weekly meetings with various interest groups across the entire system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you finding that there is one specific area of concern that they're &#x2013; that you keep something up against or is it just more general sort of a just say no blanket approach they're taking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the primary concern is we see it as oil tanker traffic of the West Coast and that is the primary issue, the one that's brought to our attention most often.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Lewis with Venture Publishing. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my call. Just had a couple of quick questions again with regard to Pacific exports. First, what signals or interest have you received from upstream producers that they'd like to see this project go forward? And secondly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how involved Chinese refiners or other sort of Asian receivers of products are in getting this project off the ground?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jeff, I guess to answer the first part of it, probably the most obvious signal that we've got from upstream producers in addition to just general support is the fact that they're providing this $100 million worth of funding that was referred to in order to take the application through the approval phase. And I think that represents a pretty big commitment from them and it gives them the right to up to 50% of the capacity on the pipeline as well. So, we see strong engagement from that group and strong support for the concept. That's the most obvious and quantifiable signal. Obviously, we continue to have discussions with producers and find strong support even for those that aren't in the group.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to downstreaming the Asian refiners, we do have interest in the way that I have appraised that in the past as we have interest all the way from Japan to Singapore and with various points in between. We're not able to disclose the signatories to the sponsoring support packages that we have, but it is brought Asian downstream support for the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you disclose who is behind the 100 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we can't. It's subject to CA. I would &#x2013; it's a confidentially agreement. I'm assuming that at some point during the two-year regulatory process with the National Energy Board that that will be disclosed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
