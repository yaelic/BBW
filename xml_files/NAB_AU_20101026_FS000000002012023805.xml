      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to those attending in person and those on the phones and on the webcast. I have the executive team with me here today and Lynne Peacock's also on the phone. The agenda for the day is pretty traditional. I'll run through the presentation, as will Mark, and we'll take Q&amp;A. So, I'll just go through the headline, and then I'll hand over to Mark for some more detail.</p>
          <p>This is a solid result. It is a result that reflects the strategic priorities that we've been focused on, and the tangible improvements these strategies are beginning to deliver for customers, staff, and shareholders. The group delivered cash earnings growth of 19.3% on 2009 to 4.6 billion, reflecting NAB's continued strength in business banking and wealth, and the return of positive momentum in personal banking.</p>
          <p>Costs remained within guidance, despite continued investment across the Group. And the charge for bad and doubtful debts significantly improved from the pace of 2009. Our balance sheet remained strong with a Tier 1 ratio of 8.91%, and this is well above the Group's target. And we also continue to hold high levels of liquidity. Pleasingly, we've been able to increase the final dividend by $0.04 to $0.78, bringing the full year dividend to $1.52 per share.</p>
          <p>We continue to achieve progress against the four key strategic priorities we've outlined to the market. Number one, improving the position of the Australian business and ensuring it is our prime focus. Number two, investing in our people, culture, and reputation; three, maintaining balance sheet strength, and four, accelerating our efficiency, quality, and service agenda. We continue to maintain the franchise value of our offshore businesses, and where possible, improve returns. This progress is pleasing and gives me confidence about the future outlook for the group.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the economy, the global economy has returned to trend growth around 4.5%, albeit with sizable differences between the developed and emerging economies.</p>
          <p>Conditions in the U.S. and U.K. remain tough. While U.S. growth is likely to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range, this is not sufficient to lower unemployment and hence, the authorities are looking to add further stimulus.</p>
          <p>The U.K. economy is in recovery mode, but will remain subdued. Whilst the impact of the recently announced government spending caps are yet to be fully realized, they were in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>In Australia, business confidence moderated in 2010 in response to the financial market turbulence in Europe and concerns about the sustainability of the recovery in the U.S. and China.</p>
          <p>In addition, with the draw of the fiscal stimulus here in Australia has meant the economy is becoming increasingly reliant on growth in the private sector activity. Despite these concerns, the economy continues to grow at around trend at 3%.</p>
          <p>Going forward, growth is likely be driven by the overall strength of the international trading environment, and the additional income associated with high commodity prices, given the strong ongoing resource demand from China and India.</p>
          <p>Business credit continued to decline in 2010, albeit at a diminishing rate, driven largely by corporate de-leveraging and uncertainty about the future. The economy is expected to accelerate further, to near 4% in 2011 on the back of rising business investment and lower unemployment.</p>
          <p>Housing credit is expected to grow at solid rates in the face of continuing dwelling undersupply and falling unemployment. New Zealand growth is expected to strengthen in 2011, boosted by the World Cup. I'll be making a personal contribution to the New Zealand economy in that year. But fundamentally the outlook is less positive than Australia, given its relatively limited resource exposure and higher unemployment.</p>
          <p>The regulatory picture is also little clearer than it was when we spoke to you at the half year, but there remain many variables. The final global settings, particularly on the net stable funding ratio and liquidity, should emerge in coming months. The critical outstanding issue is the degree of Australian alignment that will be required, and the transition time to achieve these settings.</p>
          <p>The domestic political environment has stepped up a few gears in recent weeks. What implications this may have for the sector is unclear, but now it has been consistent for more than 18 months. The political intervention remained a real threat and many of the moves we have taken over that time have positioned us well should that intervention occur.</p>
          <p>Today's results reflect the progress we have made against our strategic priorities. We've achieved underlying profit within the Australian franchise whilst investing in the longer-term future of the Group. We have improved our reputation as an organization, positive differential in our market positioning, and reduced the gap in customer satisfaction against our peers. We've also made progress rebalancing the portfolio to improve our relative ROE, all while maintaining capacity to invest in the future and improving our balance sheet position.</p>
          <p>Our business banking franchise continued to benefit from its relationship-centered business model and focus on putting more bankers in more places. Despite subdued system demand, NAB's business banking increased lending by 3.3 billion over the last 12 months and hired an additional 209 bankers, and further improved market share to 22.5%. All of this was achieved whilst system growth was negative.</p>
          <p>It was pleasing to add numerous industry awards to the business banking trophy cabinet over the last 12 months. We will continue to further deepen customer relationships and achieve stronger cross-sell, and this work continues to progress well with the co-location of wholesale banking specialists and credit managers with bankers, and a project with personal banking to improve service levels to micro-business customers, and the opening of a new dedicated small business call center.</p>
          <p>In personal banking, progress has been made to restore the core retail business, to address portfolio gaps, and to build for long-term growth. A range of initiatives have been undertaken to rebase this business for sustainable success and improve its market position and reputation. This strategy, and the investments we have made in the business are beginning to deliver solid sustainable earnings momentum, with revenue improving 4.8% in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Net new transaction accounts, which is a key relation product, grew at six times what they were a year ago, customer defections have dropped 25%, the gap in customer satisfaction to peers is reduced, mortgage lending growth is now consistently above system in all channels for the first time in five years, and most recently it was 2.5 times the system.</p>
          <p>We are comfortable with the growth and have the balance sheet flexibility to support it. There is still more work to be done, but progress to-date suggests that the direction we've set for this business is the right one.</p>
          <p>In wealth, despite the disappointing AXA outcome, the management team and staff remain focused. The integration of Aviva continues to track a full year ahead of business case expectations and MLC maintains its number one position in retail funds under management and retail superannuation.</p>
          <p>NAB Invest, which utilizes MLC and NAB Wealth's capability to identify quality asset managers, now has investments in six asset managers and will continue to look for opportunities in the areas of global equities, infrastructure, and property.</p>
          <p>Our market leading positions in business banking and wealth make the increasing focus on cross-sell between these business a viable, attractive, and achievable strategy.</p>
          <p>BNZ continues to outperform its peers and be an area of innovation for the wider group. The transformation of BNZ's retail stores continues with 26 stores now refreshed. In addition, BNZ had recently invented, patented, and launched liquid encryption number technology.</p>
          <p>Our leading edge anti-fraud security innovation that helps minimize skimming and counterfeit fraud. We can now deploy this innovation across the group. More broadly, key foundations are now in place to drive cross-sell, and the performance driving culture.</p>
          <p>We are seeing good collaboration engagement scores indicating people are motivated and focused on performance. And performance measurement has been better aligned to the shareholder, with half of senior executive short-term incentive now having deferred shares for up to two years, and a greater emphasis on risk management.</p>
          <p>There is significant work continuing on our group-wide process and efficiency program, at which the next generation is a core part. We're nearly two years into the program, which has three main objectives; improving the customer experience by removing system and process hurdles, reducing risk and driving efficiency by replacing 110 legacy systems with around 15 new systems, and finally, improving our competitiveness and effectiveness in ways that allows to match and surpass competitors on customer service, product offerings, and price.</p>
          <p>2010 was a year of design and build for the program, as well the implementation of securitization for RMBS, a frontend for international payments, and upgrade of human resource systems. UBank's new cyber product was the first product successfully launched on the next generation banking IT platform, enabling customers to open an online account in five minutes, and we now have over 110,000 accounts.</p>
          <p>We will introduce mortgage capability into UBank before the end of 2010. 2011, we'll see the work continuing to achieve quicker turnaround times for mortgage applications and focus on further enhancing the capability and performance of our customer contact centers. There will also be the launch of WealthHub, designed to improve the capabilities and efficiencies of our financial and JV world advisers and further enhancements to UBank.</p>
          <p>And by the year-end of 2012, Next Generation will have developed the capability to support the majority of NAB products and customers. Next Generation is enabled for future revenue, allowing increased speed to market, a simplified products set, and will transform the way customers do business with us. And between now, and then obviously we'll keep you updated on our progress.</p>
          <p>So finally, to the outlook, to the outlook, and I'm increasingly optimistic. Australia is in a unique position, given our close links to the emerging economies, particularly China, India.</p>
          <p>Despite their regulatory environment becoming a little clearer, uncertainty does remain as to interpretation of Basel III, and the Australian banks' position on liquidity. With this in mind, it is prudent to remain conservative in our balance sheet settings to ensure we can accommodate any unexpected impact of regulation.</p>
          <p>Major Australian banks will remain under the political spotlight. The implications of this and also, the implication of identifying alternative sources of funding to mitigate the cost and reliance on offshore funding remains to be seen.</p>
          <p>For us, the focus remains firmly on Australia. Acquisition activity will be limited to bolt-on opportunities that will either enhance our organic strategy, de-risk, or create greater value in our existing positions, most likely in the U.S. or NAB Invest. Beyond that, our acquisition appetite is low.</p>
          <p>Irrespective of the environment in which we operate, and the challenges that are presented to us, we are well-positioned across each of these dimensions.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll hand over to Mark to take you through the result in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody. My pleasure to take you through in a bit more detail, in many respects this shouldn't be a surprising result because now we do quarterly reports, it gets hard to create a surprise in just three months.</p>
          <p>Although I would say the result is probably slightly better than the trend we had established. And we do find a number of positives in the result, which as Cameron just said, reinforce the degree of optimism that we expressed at the half.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth clearly is subdued, primarily by re-basing of personal bank on the fees front, and the wholesale bank on the sales and trading and treasury front. But we have seen an emergence of balance sheet momentum. And the GLAs [Gross Loans and Acceptances] are up $15 billion, or 3.3% in the half, after adjusting for foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The main franchises are all gaining share in key areas. Our margins and asset quality are broadly stable, although there are headwinds to be dealt with in both. The higher risk areas of the SGA portfolio in the U.K. are well understood, well managed, and are also stable. And we're well-positioned for regulatory changes and other interventions that we anticipate.</p>
          <p>So there are some complicating factors in the result. We have three acquisitions right at the beginning of the year, one of note during the year in the U.S. and also, a much stronger Aussie dollar of course, towards the end of the year. But I'll do my best to bring out some of the underlying factors as we go through. So, if you look at the snapshot result, and the full year is actually quite different to the half, I think. If you look at the full year, you see just short of 2% growth at the NII line, and there is quite a lot of moving pieces in that. A 10% decline in OOI, including MLC, reflecting the headwinds I mentioned in personal bank and in the wholesale bank and also, in the U.K., which had some one-offs in the prior year, which of course, don't recur and has its own issues on the PPI front that manifest this year.</p>
          <p>The operating expenses grew 3.7%, and that brings to a conclusion our guidance around expenses, and we will be shifting much more to a focus on jaws rather than focusing on an absolute amount, and this result also brings to an end the taking below the line of accelerated EQS initiatives. So, the underlying profit is down 6%, and the B&amp;DDs are about a 1.5 billion better, back to about 50 basis points to GLA. It's still well above the historic norms, but you see that we're not seeing a very fast recovery from this point yet in the B&amp;DD expense.</p>
          <p>And that all that adds up to the 19.3% cash earnings growth of course, a recovery in ROE. The NIM is better this year than it was in the prior, and the Tier 1 ratio has landed in a solid place. Now, if you adjust all those for FX and acquisitions for the full year, the result is actually not that different. It's revenue minus one, expenses plus 3.8, and the cash earnings up 16.2.</p>
          <p>If you turn then to the half year, you can see net interest income momentum in the half at 1%. It's actually 1.5% ex the foreign exchange effects, and the ROA coming back and up 5%, primarily because you will see SG&amp;A is a much less significant drag on our performance as time goes on.</p>
          <p>The expense growth is high in the half, it's 3.6%. I think if you think back to the first half, it was pretty flat to the second half of the prior year, so we tend to have a second half tilt in our expense spend and we have it here, and we also have an acceleration in the spending on next-gen, which is featuring.</p>
          <p>So the underlying profit is pretty flat. The B&amp;DD only slightly better in the second half, 16%, and the cash earnings growth 9%, and you have the other factors down there. So, the NIM very slightly weakened notably at 2.24%.</p>
          <p>Quickly to touch on what's going on in the main franchises. The business bank had a good year, up 37% in its cash earnings. It's worked hard to hold volumes, to hold its balance sheet in this period when business credit has been shrinking, and I'll show you more on that. It's also been attentive on pricing, had sensible deposit strategies, and has benefited from a recovery in its B&amp;DD.</p>
          <p>It's much flatter in the half-on-half, despite some advances on the balance sheet. And that mainly reflects the fact that the upswing in business credit is not that apparent yet, although there was some strength towards the end of the year. And there is a B&amp;DD tally; in fact, the B&amp;DDs in the business bank were slightly higher in the second half than they were in the first.</p>
          <p>The personal bank is down 15% on the year with the fee rebasing, mortgage pricing, and the capital benefit changes we pointed out to you at the half being the major factors. In fact, ex the advantage, acquisition is down 20% year-on-year. But a very encouraging result for the half-on-half view, with the business putting on about $10 billion in housing, $5 billion in deposits, its ROA up 14 basis points, substantially closing the gap from where it started, and a drop in B&amp;DD, with a lot of attention to collections, and the benefits as we grow this portfolio &#x2013; these portfolios of growing into lower than average risk exposures, which are bringing down the provisioning requirements.</p>
          <p>The wholesale bank is really a story around the rebasing of markets and treasury. The custody business, and the specialist finance businesses are not really into any kind of meaningful upswing at this stage. And so we do have this rebasing going on through the year, and as I'll show you, we really feel that particularly on the last quarter performance, the treasury and markets business is now pretty much normalized.</p>
          <p>The U.K., there's quite a lot of noise in the U.K. result. Prima facie, it's up 53% for the year. It's benefited greatly by the basis risks coming under control, so the cost of basis risk was &#xA3;126 million less this year than it was last year, and that accounts for a large part of the recovery, and the strength in margins.</p>
          <p>Although it has also benefited from strong front book margins and a 20% reduction in its B&amp;DD. And the prior year had about &#x20A4;38 million of one-offs in the OOI line around the repurchase of Lennox securities, and the sale of the wealth business to AXA, which of course, don't recur. The U.K. has also got much less capital benefit out of the center as our rolling average capital benefit rate has really soaked up the low interest rate environment in the U.K. So, the capital benefit we've given them is &#x20A4;32 million lower this year than the prior year with a 15 million extra of that coming in the second half, and so that accounts for the second half softness that you see here.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is flat, up 1.4% on the year, and up 5.5% on the half, despite an uplift in B&amp;DD, because there is some volatility in that in the second half. But it had very strong underlying fundamentals in terms of share, and a very strong NIM performance, with a 10 basis point uptick for the full year, 16 basis points in the second half, so very good momentum in the New Zealand business. MLC is up 33% if we take AVIVA out, that's actually 14% and reasonably flat in the second half at an underlying profit level. There's an uptick shown here, but that's primarily coming on the tax line.</p>
          <p>And finally, SG&amp;A is much less of a drag than it has been. I think it lost nearly 580 million in '09, 262 for the year, and only 45 in the second half. So, that continues to swing back towards a positive. If you look at the waterfall below, you see on half-on-half basis the underlying profits before bad and doubtful debts, and there you can see the momentum in the businesses coming through.</p>
          <p>So business banking up 27 million half-on-half, personal bank up 41 million half-on-half, and New Zealand up 35 million half-on-half. GWB has both organic growth, and the acquisition of Tier 1 bank, and I've mentioned the big swings in SG&amp;A, and wholesale banking already.</p>
          <p>At the Group level then, just to dig into some of the key elements of the results. In the top left of this chart it shows you the GLAs on an average basis with the acquisitions and FX shown separately. Over the second half, the six-month momentum picture, so you can see there a 3.5 billion pick-up in average in the business bank, 6.4 in the personal bank. Most other parts of the portfolio are fairly steady. And of course, in the business bank, a good proportion of that also includes housing volumes.</p>
          <p>On the right &#x2013; top right, just to give you a subset of some of the market share points, and you'll find a lot more in the MD&amp;A, but right across the portfolio, very good share gains, 94 basis points in business lending, even though we're flat. Australian housing picked up 40 basis points over 11 months. Retail superannuation, 120 basis points. And we picked up New Zealand housing of 10 basis points. But in fact, if you look at New Zealand, you'll see they've gained share in just about every category.</p>
          <p>The Group NIM, in the bottom left here, we lost a couple of basis points in the half, it's slightly weaker than that in the fourth quarter. On the margin side, lending margin side, we've obviously been continuing to reprice where there are opportunities, but we're really at the tail of that activity, and we've also benefited from some mix changes there.</p>
          <p>The deposit competition comes and goes in its intensity, but over this period, cost two basis points of margin. And then more significantly, you can see the headwind coming from the term funding and liquidity costs, accounting for five basis points of headwind in the period.</p>
          <p>And then to give a little bit more granularity on that, perhaps to feed the debate, on the bottom right, you can see mapping back to pre-crisis levels, the four major components of the cost of funds to our bank relative to the base rate, and the bank bill &#x2013; or its spread has some volatility, but it's largely stabilized.</p>
          <p>You can see how customer deposit pricing has really come on, as we've moved customer deposits from below wholesale to typically higher than wholesale in the rates they attract. You can see the steady build in the term funding cost as cheap funds roll off and are replaced at current yields, and you can see the costs of liquidity, which may well increase under the Basel III.</p>
          <p>We put an arrow there to show where NAB last did a rate rise, and there was a period probably below that line for a while, and then there's a substantial headwind from about October, November onwards. So, the bottom line is we've had about 118 basis points increase in the average cost of funds, 33 basis points of that coming since April, and to-date we've recovered about 92 basis points, and so that leaves a gap of 26 as things stand today. And there is nothing really that would suggest any of this is going to abate in any significant way going forward.</p>
          <p>To take a quick look at the OOI, and then the cost position. On the OOI, you can see the OOI coming down versus '09, the major drivers being the markets and treasury, which is down 713 million year-on-year. And the fees down 309 million, of which the fair value agenda was 233 and 191 of that coming in the personal bank.</p>
          <p>But we've effectively rebased, if you take the second half run rates on this fee agenda, the recent announcements on credit cards were negligible in their impact. And if you're looking for a full year-on-year effect for FY '11, it's probably about $30 million headwind from the fees.</p>
          <p>The markets and treasury contribution showing up in the OOI lines, that's not all of the contribution because some comes in NII, it's 213 in the last half. When I say we feel this is normalized, if we take the full contribution in markets and treasury and we go back to the 2008 picture, we've got about an 8% to 10% CAGR of 2008, which was always what we were saying was when we felt things would be rebased. And we're back to about a 60/40 split between sales and trading. So, 60% of the contributions coming in sales, 40% out of trading, which is also the norm. So, we feel this is really settled down now, but obviously the world remains volatile, and so time will tell.</p>
          <p>Moving to the top right and just looking for moment at the SGA drag, you can see right at the top there in brackets the negative revenue from SGA, 165 and 84 last year. 108, and then positive 18 this year to give a net 90 negative.</p>
          <p>I know the mark-to-markets on the SCDO portfolio are a frustration to people trying to forecast them. They're also a frustration to CFOs trying to budget them, and it's unfortunately just a function of three or four variables that move quite independently in those vehicles.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the fourth quarter did see a reversal. So, we had a negative 209 in the third quarter and a positive 142 in the fourth. So, we're still down 67, which you see there in lilac for the half, but we have at least got the thing to go in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cost side, we're still at negative jaws. We've got 2% income growth in the half, 3.6% cost growth. I've already told you, we're going to be focusing much more on jaws as we think about how much latitude we're going to give the businesses to invest going forward.</p>
          <p>Just to give you a sense, this time over the full year of what's really driven our cost growth. We've just got a little waterfall for you here bottom right. That shows us going from 7,580 to 7,868 excluding the foreign exchange, and the acquisitions. So, first of all, there is about 180 million of benefits we get this year from the, what we've previously and in the current year taken below the line, our accelerated EQS. There's been a deliberate and targeted reinvestment in the business of 254 million; this represents things like the uptick in the next-gen spending, which won't show benefits in the business for probably another 12 to 18 months, a deliberate effort to hire new and more diverse business bankers and open more business banking centers, additions to collections and customer service in the personal bank, and so on.</p>
          <p>So there's been some conscious and targeted investment in the business to position it for an upswing and higher levels of activity.</p>
          <p>Our BAU cost growth, net of ongoing EQS within the businesses is about 155 million, and notable in the year was an increase in the cost of the U.K. pension, reflecting substantially higher deficits that that has in the current equity and interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>On asset quality, you can see the recover in the top left of the B&amp;DD charge, and that charge is now more than entirely specifics. You'll see a negative orange at the bottom of the September '10 bar, which represents a slight reduction in the collective provisions, but we've not been intervening at the center to release provisions. This is entirely a function of the credit models and some particular exposures flipping over from collective to specific and taking the provisions with them. So, we've done nothing to our overlays. If you look at the top right, you will see the quarterly B&amp;DD expense, and you'll see we had a real downswing to March '10, but if anything it's been flat to slightly up since. So, our view of the recovery in B&amp;DD, based on this data, and what we see at the moment is that it's a slower recovery from this point than many commentators seem to be anticipating.</p>
          <p>The 90 day past due and impaired is pretty stable. It's now 188 basis points. Although we really should take Tier 1 out, because the Tier 1 acquisition represents quite a lot of impaired assets, but they come in at fair value. So, they can be distorted, so putting this aside, we're at 183 basis points and we were 175 last year and 186 at the half.</p>
          <p>So we're flat to very slightly better on the half on the 90 days past due and impaireds and our coverage remains strong. And whether you want to look at it at, with or without the GRCL; with the GRCL, it's about 188 basis points collected provisions to RWA at minus 1000.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital has stayed strong at 8.91. We just boxed the four &#x2013; the first four factors here, cash earnings, the dividend, growth in RWAs, and the foreign currency translation, and there is a slight net capital generation of about five basis points.</p>
          <p>We have of course, put the DRP settings to bring back more capital. We are anticipating about a 35% flow back in this calculation. The GWB accounts for nine basis points since we undertook the acquisition. There is still some regulatory change going on around RWAs, and the like, which cost about six basis points in the period. And they are the major factors. The U.K. pension deficit was actually stable, half-on-half.</p>
          <p>Our funding and liquidity continues to be a good story. Our group stable funding index is moving still in the right direction. We all know we're on a journey to 100% some day and in some way, but as long as we're moving in that direction while the goal posts are being set, we're happy with that. If anything, we've surprised ourselves and over-delivered on the customer funding index, and it's not necessarily our intent that that would always go up. In fact, that 64%, I think the way we feel at the moment as long as it stayed above 60% we would be comfortable with that, but we do expect to continue to term out and otherwise reduce the reliance on short term wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>You can see on the top right that our issuance this year was characterized by even longer average than we've achieved in the past, to average the first call of 5.1 years. And it was a very well executed plan this year. We did $28.3 billion of issuance. It was all without government guarantees, it was well timed, and we stood out of the markets while the European sovereign debt crisis was at its peak, so we were very happy with the execution of that.</p>
          <p>Next year based on what rolls, what matures, actually not what matures, but what goes to less than 12 months to maturity, we would need $22 billion of issuance. But we will set ourselves to do 25 to 30, which is very consistent with what we've done in prior periods, in order to support both the growth we anticipate and a continuing hardening of the ratios.</p>
          <p>And then on the liquidity side, it's pretty much unchanged. We're continuing with very high levels of liquidity, continuing to average up the quality of those holdings. And so that is what it is until we know where we're going.</p>
          <p>Now obviously regulatory reform is a hot topic; it's probably not one I can do much to clarify for you. We do know on the liquidity side that that will be quite a significant change. We'll all like it if it would be about the quality of holdings more than the level of holdings, but both are on the table. And quite what the Australian solution will be in the absence of a high stock of government paper is not yet clear. So, we not only need to work out what that solution is, but we have to go through a period of observation before we move to implementation. And so we'll have to wait and see how quickly that moves.</p>
          <p>On the net stable funding ratio, as I've already pointed out to you, we're doing what we can organically to anticipate the changes and move in the right direction. There is a long timeline on this to 2018 and as things stand, I told you at the quarterly review it would be about a $50 billion ask for us to close the gap here. But again, we will have to see what happens on that front.</p>
          <p>Capital is a little bit easier to understand, although important decisions haven't yet been made. There's unlikely to be a constraint at the total Tier 1 level. But at the core Tier 1, we currently sit at 6.8, and the indications from Basel are that the banks should be operating at seven, perhaps with a buffer to that. If we just take the Basel III definitions as published for all the capital deductions, today we were at 8.19 under Basel.</p>
          <p>But there is the potential for APRA to adopt some of the harsher elements of the Basel III algorithm without necessarily giving up on some of the more lenient. And if that were to be the case, we estimate it would put us at about 6.65%, which is, given the implementation time, the sort of gap we would expect to close with organic capital generation.</p>
          <p>I mean, one source, we have about $2.6 billion of capital that has disappeared into the credit &#x2013; risk weighted assets through credit scoring through this cycle. So, I mean, for example, getting a chunk of that back would more than close this gap. So, we don't have answers on this, but we are active participations in the process of thinking through where to from here.</p>
          <p>I want to conclude by just touching on some of the core indicators in the individual franchises. I want to start with the personal bank, which over the last 18 months has halved the gap in the MFI customer satisfaction ratings with a steady climb to 74.7. Our brand attributes have all shifted to the positive and in fact, lead the peer averages on all, but one.</p>
          <p>Our home loan share of system growth was 1.1 in the first half, 2.5 in the second, 1.7 on average over the year. Deposit system growth was 1.8 times the system, and net transaction account growth is six times the historic rate of net openings.</p>
          <p>And what I couldn't tell you last time, and I can tell you this time is that the seasoning on those new accounts puts them almost bang on the average of the accounts we already hold today. So, in other words, how they activate, how big the balances are, and so forth. So, they are as valuable as the average that we have.</p>
          <p>Additionally, on the personal bank side, we're taking this period of higher mortgage flows to address the skew in our existing mortgage portfolio to riskier exposures. So, we haven't &#x2013; we're biasing very much to low risk exposures now, particularly out of the broker channel where we're using risk-based pricing to skew the portfolio back towards industry norms, and that's having quite an effect and I already the low B&amp;DD expense partly as a result.</p>
          <p>One measure of that, our early term delinquency, which is people who are in arrears by six months, has improve from 1 in 85 in the 2006 to 2008 period to 1 in 250 in the current period.</p>
          <p>Investment collections are really &#x2013; investment in collections is really paying dividends. We put more people in, and their productivity has nearly doubled in 2009. And generally just having the 73 million half-on-half revenue momentum is very pleasing.</p>
          <p>On the business bank front, I already mentioned how hard we've had to work to achieve pretty much flat or up $2 billion of lending balances in a period where the rest of the industry has really retreated by $40 billion, and that of course, is what drives the gain in share. Also within the business bank, a great deal of attention to margins through repricing and sensibly positioned deposit pricing strategies, keeping the NIM healthy and pretty much flat at 250 basis points.</p>
          <p>Wholesale bank, I already said is not experiencing much of an upswing on the custody or specialist finance fronts. But meanwhile, it is continuing to chip back, chip away and take back market share in all the major correct &#x2013; categories of risk management solutions, including getting better penetration of our business bank portfolio.</p>
          <p>And in the MLC and NAB Wealth business, we continue to be encouraged by the positives we see. Market shares are up, reflecting a return to positive net flows. We've had unprecedented interest from advisors in joining MLC. The statistics will show an increase of 69 over the half. But there are a lot of people leaving the industry at the moment.</p>
          <p>And in fact, we've had more than 100 practices join MLC in the last six months. The Aviva integration is well ahead of plan and expectations. And importantly, the advisor and client retention are significantly better than our initial forecast. So, we're very happy with the way that integration is going.</p>
          <p>JBWere integration is complete, and the cross-sell has begun to get traction, and as Cameron mentioned, we have an exciting private client platform being launched next year, and the business continues to be very attentive on the cost line.</p>
          <p>And then to the international franchises, New Zealand has been remarkably stable through this period of disruption. I &#x2013; it really had much less of the B&amp;DD shakeout than other New Zealand banks in particular.</p>
          <p>It's now, as I said, growing share in all categories. The NIM is up 16 basis points. Sequentially it has flat costs sequentially, which is the pride and joy. Although they're up 1% year-on-year. And the asset quality lead indicators are now improving. So, the 90 day past due and GIA is down 10 basis points to 175 over the half.</p>
          <p>The U.K. bank continues to operate in what is a tricky market, probably the most tricky in our portfolio. As Cameron said, the government action was much as foreshadowed, and I think well-received, and we still see a double dip in that economy as quite unlikely. There are other positives coming out of there.</p>
          <p>I already mentioned the year-on-year effect of the basis risk that we'll say, continue to move customers away from base rented &#x2013; base pointed products, and have hedged a lot of that exposure. So, extremely unlikely that would come back in anything like the way it did, even if we were to re-experience a crisis.</p>
          <p>And the asset quality is much more stable although the GIAs have increased. Importantly, the commercial real estate development portfolio is &#xA3;1 billion smaller now than it was 18 months ago. So, it was 2.5 billion and driving 50% of our B&amp;DD. It's now 1.5 billion and driving 25% of the B&amp;DD. So, that's coming much more within tolerance.</p>
          <p>The latest announcements suggested that the U.K. banking levering looks less onerous for small banks. But we continue to work through exactly what shape that is going to take before we determine what will be our strategy for dealing with it. Front book margins are still very good in the U.K. And the franchise has been growing at two times system in deposits.</p>
          <p>So I think to get a fuller recovery there, as well as some economic stability and working through the backlog on asset quality, I think to get a fuller recovery in the profitability of that franchise, we really need to see U.K. interest rates begin to rise.</p>
          <p>Great Western Bank remains very sound. It has had some uptick in B&amp;DD thus far in the collectives as the recession finally, reached the Midwest.</p>
          <p>The GIA is 90 days past due and GIA to GLA is 1.48% there, which is a significant increase for them, but it's still below the group average of 1.88%. It's occasionally doing little tuck-in acquisitions, as you may have noticed. The last one, Tier 1 was about 2 billion of assets and just over 60 branches and was done at about a 5.5 forward P/E.</p>
          <p>So these acquisitions being done on very good terms and in the case of that one, with the U.S. government standing behind the asset quality to 80% as well. And finally, it's getting traction on the agricultural banking front. It's now the eighth biggest agriculture lender in the U.S., which sounds impressive, but it only has a $900 million portfolio. So, obviously not many other people that are focused on it, but nevertheless, that franchise continues to move forward very well.</p>
          <p>And finally, SG&amp;A, which is largely stable. Peter Thodey's team have closely analyzed all the exposures in there and are very well abreast of the way things are, and the opportunities to run off. There has been about 2 billion of run off in the year. It looks like more than that, but it's primarily because of the foreign exchange effects. So, it's about $1 billion in each half, excluding the foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The asset quality is largely unchanged, particularly on the SCDO front, where there were no credit events in any of the pools in the last six months, and I think only one in the calendar year. And you will see NIM falling in the SGA portfolio due to a combination of the run off, but it is also U.K., U.S.-based, so we are starving it of capital benefit, and the like, so there are those things going on, but that portfolio is performing just about, as well as we had hoped.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude. There is reasonable momentum, particularly on the balance sheet side, and hopefully that will show through on the revenue side as the rebasing comes to an end, a good part of that coming through in the Australian franchises, which are all appearing to be quite vigorous.</p>
          <p>We've been disciplined with our management of costs. We will increasingly now focus on jaws. That doesn't mean we will always deliver positive jaws, because as you know, revenues tend to react more quickly than costs, but that's how we think about our business, that's how we plan our activities.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet settings remain strong and we feel we have ample capacity to take the growth opportunities that we expect to emerge through FY '11. Our riskier areas are well understood, closely managed, and displaying a pleasing degree of stability. And while regulatory, political, and economic factors will continue to present challenges for us, we feel that we're well-positioned to weather those influences as well.</p>
          <p>So with that, thank you for your attention, and we'd be happy to take some questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Cameron. Hi. John Mott from UBS. Just a question on costs, and the jaws comment that you made at the end. And just one item that caught my attention if you flip to page 37 of the actual result, not the presentation, but the results, so you've got a table there of full time employees and you can see employees really jumped up in the half by 6% and every division saw quite a big increase in hiring, which looks like your embedding higher costs are going to keep going for a while.</p>
          <p>At the same time, you don't have the benefit of the below the line restructuring cost that you've been taking, which were quite substantial during the year. Are you comfortable with this big increase in costs that you've effectively locked in for the next year, especially given the revenue outlook for the banking industry still does look patchy for at least the next 12 months and with regulatory risk coming through as well, it could be even longer than that?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We feel comfortable with our cost position. We've taken some targeted opportunities to hire our core of the business bankers that we've hired this year. We've also made additions in personal bank. We're taking on advisors. We're now moving to an environment where we're going to manage to jaws. And we can't predict the revenue side necessarily, but we're comfortable with our cost position. Even though we're moving off the guidance, what we have established is a clear view within the organization that we have a reasonable track record of managing efficiency.</p>
          <p>The other thing is in some of those costs is obviously a significant uptick in people on the Next Generation program. Now, that will run off over time. But we've got &#x2013; that's a very substantial investment as well. That's not being baked into our long-term costs, but will provide long-term benefit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Guys, I just wanted to ask on the margin, if I could, just where the spot margin sits at the moment. I think, Mark, you mentioned that the margin was down in the fourth quarter and just sort of getting a bit of an indication as to where that sits now; has the trend continued on the way down? And just if you could also comment on the U.K. margin that fell quite substantially in the second half, just sort of where that &#x2013; that's sort of sitting at the moment as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fourth quarter margin, there is some volatility in this, so you can't necessarily just draw a line through it. But the fourth quarter margin, I think was 2.21, so I think three basis points weaker than the second half. And the U.K. margin is primarily a function of the lower capital benefit. As I said, it was &#xA3;32 million capital benefit lower in the year, of which 23 was in the second half. So, obviously that flows straight to margin. But if we compare them, the margins we get on products on average to front book margins, they are all still higher. There was 4 billion of new lending in the year replacing run-offs. So, we slowly bring that into the equation. But it doesn't come in that quickly, of course.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Just a question on capital in reference to slide 105. I know you're saying that under Basel III you got 6.65% core Tier 1, ignoring any upside where local regulation is bit more punitive. Can I just get you to comment on that in reference to also John Laker's comments a week ago in a speech where he made the comment that there are a number of areas where Australia is more punitive on the capital side of things, and it would take a lot for APRA to actually reverse those, at one point.</p>
          <p>And then the second thing, you followed up saying that a suit of the lowest common denominator in terms of capital, i.e. the 7%, was not something that APRA was looking at. So, is there a circumstance here is where APRA looks at your core Tier 1 being 6.65 then looks at a target ratio being north of potentially 8% when you sort of put in the systemically important side of things as well, and that the capital situation is not as comfortable as what I suppose was originally first thought for the Australian banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think &#x2013; APRA thought long and hard about why and where you should deduct things from capitals. I don't think that just because the Basel Committee comes out taking some of the pain, not all of the pain, I don't expect APRA to go back on decisions they've made, certainly not lightly. So, I think if there's going to be an outcome, it's going to more to the 6.65 than it is to the 8 point whatever. It is important to understand the 8.19 because we spend a lot of time in offshore markets raising debt from investors who want to have an equivalent view across organizations. So, that's an important thing to understand, nonetheless.</p>
          <p>Quite whether &#x2013; quite exactly where APRA's going to come out on these things, and whether we're going to be seen as a systemically important institution, I don't know. It would be nice. Actually, it might not be nice. So, I just think there's a lot of moving pieces on this, and so it's hard to predict. Eric, is there anything you want to add? Eric is our Treasurer.</p>
          <p>Not really? Here's your moment, Eric.</p>
          <p>[Laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your answer was spot-on. What we tried to do in this slide was provide a bit of a range of outcomes, and as Mark said, the Basel fees or harmonization position and APRA's approach to that is a bit unclear, but we've tried to quantify that in the 8.19 number, and then APRA have been very clear saying that where their standards currently exceed the Basel III minimum, they're not really minded to retreat, and where they're below, their view will be to take the deduction.</p>
          <p>So that's why we've presented in a way. The 6.65 ignores any upside. I do think it's hard to be quite aggressive on deductions, and also, quite aggressive on where you want to set the minimum target. So, the minimum Basel target's been set at seven, and I guess we'd run a buffer to that, but it's hard to play on deductions and on the minimum ratio as well.</p>

          <p>It's Craig Williams from Citi. Six months ago, when we sat here, you talked about a business banking pipeline that was the strongest you'd seen in five years. Can you talk about the confidence you have on the &#x2013; I don't know whether they're your autonomous forecasts or not &#x2013; turnaround in the relative growth rates in business lending expected in 2011 from minus 3.5 to positive 6.5, given that SMEs would seem to be under a bit of pressure from the ATO right now?

        <plist>
          <p>I'll get Joseph to comment a give more detail. But just to sort of give you a little bit of... I mean, we still do hope the business credit will rebound in 2011. There is a substantial pent-up demand out there that has to be fulfilled. The pipeline remains strong, in fact, if anything, it's a little stronger than we saw at the half-year. And I don't know where the system's going to land, but we would have the expectation of <mark type="inaudible" /> as we traditionally have. We've got the number one franchise. So Joseph, do you want to give a bit more color to the pipeline?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, as Cameron mentioned, the pipeline remains strong. It's actually got stronger in the second half, mainly in the larger corporate sector, I would call the top 500 companies. It is somewhat subdued in the SME sector, so we would expect to see system growth rebound closer to the end of the first quarter calendar FY 2011, and we anticipate that we're going to see that mainly from the top end of town, so &#x2013; which I'm calling the top 400 or 500 corporates, where balances sheet today are in very good position, well-placed to meet the investment decisions that business is willing to make. So, we do remain confident of seeing credit system growth return. As Cameron mentioned, 6.5% is our anticipated FY '11 increase, and we would expect to outperform system, given the momentum that's clearly evident in the business bank. It has been evident in the business bank for quite some time, as indicated by Mark.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Cameron, the retail bank showed positive draws in the second half, 5% revenue growth, 4% cost growth. Do you think that your draws can improve in the retail bank going forward, and how reliant would that be on repricing? Any repricing of timelines that you obviously haven't done since April '09, and therefore, wasn't a feature of the second half result?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to predict where the draws might land, but I think what we feel comfortable about in the business &#x2013; I'm sorry in the personal bank is it's on a much more sustainable footing there. So, many of the levers are in our control, and many of the threats that may emerge in that space, be they competitive or innovatory threats, aren't really going to concern us.</p>
          <p>So for example, a number of the things that have been announced in the government program of credit cards are stuff we've got rid of a year ago, so it doesn't stop there, I mean, in that sense. So, we feel from the personal bank point of view, and probably in this half it's starting to come through as the businesses got momentum and is on a very positive footing, from a sustainability point of view. So, now, the interest rate, it's very troubling where that might move, but we do feel a lot better about the personal bank than we perhaps did 6, 12 months ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question was on the personal bank, and in particular, the margin trends. Now, you've arrested the decay from minus 30 bps to minus 6 bps in the last period. The lending margin, and the deposit margin were both pretty flat. I'm just interested, given the result there on the lending margin, whether you continue to be comfortable with the mortgage strategy that you're running, given you've been able to hold lending margins fairly stable? And also, just some broader observations on what's happening on the deposit side, and whether you could see that being a positive influence in the coming six months?</p>

          <p>Lisa, do you want to talk maybe on the deposit? I might just say on the &#x2013; I'm not going to get into interest rate forecasts, but I think what we've demonstrated is a commitment to be competitive over the last probably 15, 18 months, and we've seen volumes come through that and it's really hard to predict what might happen in the competitive environment, but we certainly see it's delivering volume for us, and it's allowing to average up the quality as well.</p>
          <p>On the deposit front, Lisa do you want to -</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, one of the advantages we have obviously is we are able to run different brands. So, we've been able to certainly through the full year grow strongly around the UBank, and in the last six months, certainly through the NAB-branded deposits as well.</p>
          <p>So we're continuing to see solid competition moving between the online accounts, and the term deposits as well. But it's starting to moderate to some degree as well, but that will clearly be an area of competition. But where we've seen the strong growth in transaction accounts, you'll start to see more sustained balance growth through there, which is much stickier business.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Johan Vanderlugt from Daiwa Capital Market. Please ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. My question is about the personal banking division as well, so another one for Lisa, I'm afraid. Page 93, sorry, 94 in the slide pack. If I look at the breakdown in terms of origination, I see a sort of big fall in terms of the proprietary channel from 75% to 61%. Then if I look at the commentary on page 56, you're actually referring to increased capacity and improved efficiency, which was initially a focus on the broker business.</p>
          <p>My question is what can we expect in terms of initiatives to be focused on the proprietary channel, if I look at the number of retail outlets that went up by 25 for the half? So can we expect further deterioration of the share of the proprietary channel, or will it stabilize at around that 60% mark or probably go up, because it has some implications for the net interest margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all, the way to look at the split of flows is in fact, not deterioration of the proprietary channel, it's actually strong growth of the broker channel. So, typically in this country, by and large, one in two loans are typically taken out through a broker. If I look across the industry, on average somewhere between 40% to 55% of flows typically come through brokers, and historically, we've been significantly underweight, and that's what you can see in that chart.</p>
          <p>So what you're seeing actually is strong growth in the broker business. The proprietary channel has continued to grow. If we look at the full year at 1.2 times system, and over the last month or two and half, well above that as well. So, there is still very strong growth above system in the proprietary channel.</p>
          <p>We certainly, though, have been improving and investing in frontline people, in very small business bankers, which we've been doing with the business bank. And in ensuring we've got our service capacity there as well. So, being in a position to be able to improve service as we grow, and make sure that we can actually provide a deeper, more cross-sell opportunity into the future and a deeper service experience.</p>
          <p>So the initiatives are to enable the continued growth, but really where you're seeing the split is about the even stronger growth in the broker, but still above system in the proprietary channel.</p>

          <p>Hi. Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on the business banking side. When we're looking at the margin trajectory, half-on-half. It looks like it's now tapered off and leveled out. As we look forward, given the common stress of just about how the growths in top 500, I would have thought that &#x2013; is that going to be a &#x2013; business mix-wise, going to be negative to the margin? And then if you can just talk about competitive forces in the markets right now, how you just see them playing out as well, if that's stabilized, or if competition's stepping up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I think it's fair to say that we don't see any upside on margin, we think margin's pretty much peaked. I think when you look at the slide at very healthy levels, we would anticipate &#x2013; there's two dynamics at play. One, we would anticipate that margin on new business would be, we would expect to be at lower margins, given competition and given that the risk in the economy is less today than it was a year ago, offset to some extent by the fact that we've got about 12% of our book still at pre-GFC pricing, and that will be getting repriced. That will be the last repricing wave across the portfolio. So, we'll be repricing that at the current market, which is obviously higher than the pre-GFC market.</p>
          <p>And then the third thing &#x2013; so those are the two market dynamics. The other factor that's quite important in understanding margin in our business is the strength of the relationship franchise. So, we do not anticipate that we will be as exposed to margin erosion in terms of the way that we manage our customer and build our business, as might be the case with the other players in the market. And we've shown that resilience at the quality of the relationship, commitment that we've had does have some economic value in terms of margin management, and we'd expect to see that on a relative basis to be evident going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we anticipate that there is a strong line between new business activity in terms of lending and fee growth, but also the way that we're growing our transaction banking accounts. So, we're seeing good progress in that, and I'd expect that we will continue to see good growth there. But a lot of it's going to be driven by system activity, and a lot of it's going to be grown &#x2013; determined also by our success in growing our transaction banking penetration, which had been showing good progress and consistently over the last couple of years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Victor German from Nomura. Just a question on underlying profit. If with back half SGA business unit, your underlying profit actually went backwards about $100 million in the half, and in light of the earlier question from John given that your costs growth is arguably accelerating the in '11, do you think you will be able to achieve positive growth in underlying terms in 2011, and where do you think that will come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I haven't actually done the analysis, but obviously you've still got rebasing going on, particularly in the markets, and to a lesser extent, in the treasury area in those numbers, if you just take SG&amp;A out. And I think an important thing for us to get decent underlying profit growth, having rebased in the next period is going to be continued strength on the personal bank side, but an upswing on the business side. If we do see a swing from negative 3.5 to plus 6.5 on the business side, that's going to give us ample opportunity to move the underlying.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mike Macrow. I just wanted to make a point that with both political parties criticizing banks for their competitive ways, and particularly with regard to the mortgage, I would say that you guys have an incredibly competitive product out there in UBank, which anyone would have to say is probably at the bleeding edge, rather than the leading edge in that area. And in all these accounts, I can't see any reference to any of the numbers around UBank, in terms of the number of billions of dollars in UBank, and what division it's reported under, or what impact it's had on that margin change. The margin change you point out in terms of the lag with the reserve bank rate, can you answer any of those thoughts or concerns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, in these results, it's reported as part of the personal bank. And it is a high-margin, low-cost offering. And, but it's in line with marginal cost of funds in wholesale areas and term deposits, and things like this. It's not extraordinarily expensive. And while it's making a contribution to our liquidity, at the same time, we're building a franchise. And as Cameron said, we're already planning to bring on UBank mortgages in the second half of the year. And then it's always a test bed for our next generation capabilities. So, we'll bring on payments capabilities in due course, and so forth.</p>
          <p>I'm sure my kids will be happy if in their lives, they never see inside a bank branch or meet a bank manager. This is really a franchise that will appeal to the online next generation, and we need to valuate for what it can contribute in the meantime, but recognize that we're on a long journey to build a franchise.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Fred La M&#xE9;tier from Maxim Equities. The regulatory expected loss increased by about 10% for the last six months, but loans increased by only 3%, and the loan growth was in housing, so the increase in regulatory expected loss looks surprising in the context of those numbers. Can you explain why we have that high growth in regulatory expected loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's &#x2013; they have the regulator progressively works through different asset classes, and makes sure they're happy with model overrides and classifications of different kinds of loans. And in this particular period, we had APRA make some adjustments to the way we treat certain commercial real estate exposures. And that gave rise to higher capital in-cost. I don't know, Bruce, if you want to add anything to that? That's it?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's T.S. from Southern Cross. I just can't find too much details on your agribusiness lending business. Can you &#x2013; because I believe it's your core competency, can you just comment on this business? I mean, the competition, the margin outlook, those sorts of things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is &#x2013; we would like to think it's a core competence. We're the largest agricultural lender in Australia. A very significant franchise in New Zealand. Obviously, significant capability emerging in the U.S. There are always going to be challenges in this sector, whether it be the current debate going on around the irrigation space, but there's been drought, and a whole range of other things. I think the &#x2013; the thing that we like about agriculture, I guess, as a sector to lend into is that it actually is one of the most long-term stable growth businesses that exists. The growth is not spectacular year-on-year, but it's very steady. And that remains steady, whatever the factors happen to be, whether it's rising populations, changing diet, a range of other things.</p>
          <p>So we think it's a very attractive sector to be in. The second thing about it is it is probably one of the businesses that's at the heart of our relationship model. I mean, we've had a long track record of recruiting out of agricultural colleges, recruiting off the land. So, we've got people that have a very fundamental understanding of what it means to run a commercial farming or agricultural enterprise.</p>
          <p>So it's probably actually one of our more stable businesses in terms of margin outlook and growth. It'll never be spectacular, and there'll always be environmental challenges thrown at it, but it's probably one of those businesses that we feel pretty confident about.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Cameron, six months ago you told us that you would only acquire in the U.K. if you could do a deal that was significantly APS and ROA accretive. You subsequently pulled out of any participation in the sale of RBS assets in the U.K., and then earlier today you've told us that your acquisition appetite is low, so could you just provide a little bit of clarity on your specific strategic intentions and acquisition ambitions in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The criteria hasn't changed since the half. If we see opportunities there that will have a significant financial accretion at a group level, we'd obviously consider them.</p>
          <p>The reason I say the &#x2013; by the same token, we also don't rule out a divestment, so we know the fire sale price. We've always been consistent with that. In the absence of either a very attractive acquisition or an attractive divestment, status quo remains the option; you improve the franchise. Going forward, the reason I'd say our acquisition appetite is low is we just we don't really see huge opportunities there.</p>
          <p>If they emerge, we'll consider them, but we're not seeing them there. The price is just the &#x2013; opens the gate. If it meets the price criteria, you've got to think about the regulatory implications, because we've got to deal with both the FSA and APRA, and they want to obviously increase the <mark type="inaudible" /> domestic franchise.</p>
          <p>And you've got to deal with integration risks. So, price is just the first hurdle, and it doesn't mean even if you get through that price, that you won't get through the subsequent two, so that's why we are just putting some criteria around that. But our financial criteria hasn't changed since the half.</p>

          <p>Well, we're just coming back to this core Tier 1 and wanting to take every &#x2013; not every opportunity &#x2013; but take an opportunity every time to reduce the potential headwind that we have on the capital side.</p>
          <p>So by putting a small discount and uncapping, we probably moved from about high-teens to about 35% drawback of the dividend, which just keeps the capital healthy and makes it more likely that we'll arrive in 2013 in good shape.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Not really wanting to set a precedent from relying on economists' forecasts, but most are predicting rates to go up by about 100 basis points over the next 12 months. So, I just wanted to gauge your impressions of the vulnerability to your business credit growth and mortgage credit growth rates in particular, to the higher interest rate environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think their current forecast is 100 basis points as well, so I think we're in that camp. Look, there will be implications obviously about potentially on demand. But we'll still leave it at 100 basis points settling below where we started in many respects, but particularly on the personal side. So, we do still say, I mean, housing &#x2013; we do still think the levels of housing business credit growth will be off the historic peaks, but they'll probably be even more sustainable, and we still have some factors driving them.</p>
          <p>There is dwelling under-supply, and there is predictably stable to falling unemployment, which would help it on the business side. There is &#x2013; there is a very substantial pipeline at a point that has to convert; the pent-up demand is there. So, I think interest rates, even with 100 basis points, with those other competing factors should actually see the outlook being okay.</p>
