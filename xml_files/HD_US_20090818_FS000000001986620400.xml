          <p>Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Sales for the second quarter were $19.1 billion, down 9.1% from last year. Comp sales were negative 8.5%, and excluding the charges related to the EXPO business closings, diluted earnings per share were $0.67.</p>
          <p>Despite the negative sales environment and difficult market conditions, there were some significant positives for us in the quarter. As Craig will detail, we had positive comp transactions in the U.S. for the first time in more than five years. We also had the largest gain in total market share that we've seen in five years, and we saw improved comp rates in some of our most important and most hard-hit markets, like Florida and California. Craig and his team drove terrific values and innovation in core DIY projects, and we achieved positive comps in paint and had a strong selling season in outside garden.</p>
          <p>We continue to make improvements in the underlying business. Since our last earnings call, we've opened two new RDCs, one in Houston and one in Cincinnati. As of today, we have eight RDCs serving approximately 800 stores, or more than 40% of our U.S. store base. Mark Holifield and his team, by the end of this quarter, will basically be opening an RDC every month. This is an impressive, maybe unprecedented, pace for a large-scale supply chain effort.</p>
          <p>Marvin Ellison and the store operations team have brought more focus and better execution on customer service, and we see that through our net promoter scores, which take the percent of our customers who rate their experience with us as a nine or a 10 and subtract from that the percent of customers who rate their experience as a six or worse. Our net promoter score has improved approximately 1,000 basis points year-over-year and is now at 62.7%. It's particularly significant for us that our scores went up in the second quarter versus the first quarter, since frequently there can be a deterioration of performance as foot traffic increases.</p>
          <p>On the international front, our business in Mexico produced another solid quarter with positive single digit comps in the face of a contracting economy. We had negative comps in both Canada and China, but I should point out that the SAP implementation issues that impacted our Canadian business over the last several months have been largely resolved. The Canadian team is now focused on the business, not a system implementation.</p>
          <p>We had good expense control across the board and managed inventory levels effectively by achieving flat inventory turns year over year. All in all, relative to our plan, we had a solid second quarter. As Carol will detail, based on our first-half performance, we are lifting our earnings per share guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>But the larger question for us is when will we start to see a broader market turnaround? We are now in the fourth year of a major correction in the housing and housing-related markets. Private, fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP is at 2.4%, the lowest it has been in over 60 years and down 30 basis points from the first quarter, which previously set a record low. To understand the current trends across the country, we can look at the comp performance of our top 40 markets in the second quarter versus their comp performance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>There is some encouraging news, here since nearly 75% of the markets performed better in the second quarter than the first. And as indicated, we've seen some significant improvement in California and Florida. In California, double-digit negative comps turned to single-digit negative, and in Florida, while we still have some double-digit negative comp markets, the percentage comp decline is about half what it was in the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>But caution is still appropriate. We have some short-term sales headwinds in the back half of the year as we anniversary hurricane activity from last year and commodity inflation in fuel-related categories. More importantly, while the performance across most of our regions is better, we're still not seeing positive comps in any areas other than the areas impacted by hurricanes last year. And while there was improvement in hard-hit markets like California and Florida, we remain concerned by the high level of foreclosure activity, which we believe continues to put pressure on the housing markets in those areas, as reflected in lower sales of basic building material products.</p>
          <p>With the dunnhumby tools, we are also getting a clearer look at customer behavior across different segments of our shoppers. Again, there's a mixed picture, some clear strength on the consumer side as basic DIY activity picks up, but these tools also allow us to see some areas of stress with greater clarity. For example, we have traditionally said that pro sales represent approximately 30% of our business. That turns out to be accurate as a statement of the past. What has happened in the downturn is that our pro business has declined more rapidly than our consumer business. As an indication of that, pro sales are now down to about 27% of our overall business, versus approximately 32% at this time last year. A key element to returning to positive comps for us will be the recovery of this important segment.</p>
          <p>Whatever the timing of a return to positive comps, our associates are doing an excellent job of laying the foundation for the future success of the business. We intend to reflect the heritage of this company by setting the standard for customer service and product authority in our market. It is a source of great pride for the company that even in these tough times, we will have record success sharing in the first half, with 96% of our stores participating.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. As expected, our second quarter comps showed an improvement over the first quarter, and we posted a positive comp in paint. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were paint, seasonal, building materials, flooring, and plumbing. Millwork, hardware, kitchens, lumber, and electrical underperformed the company's average comp for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the progress we made in driving customers to our store during the quarter. Our total customer transactions were positive for the first time in two years at positive 0.3%, and comp transactions were flat year over year. In the U.S., our comp transactions were up 0.4%, and this is the first time since the second quarter of 2003 that we have not had a comp transaction decline in the U.S.</p>
          <p>This increase was driven by innovative new product, enhanced customer service, and our continued commitment to drive value for our customers. We saw a marked improvement across several departments, with lumber and building materials showing material improvement in transactions, along with paint and seasonal businesses, which experienced positive growth in transactions.</p>
          <p>For average tickets of $50 and below, roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., transactions were up 3% year-over-year. This is the second consecutive quarter of positive transactions for tickets under $50. The primary drivers of this were the continued strength of basic repair and maintenance categories, paint, and our seasonal garden business. However, despite a slight improvement from the first quarter, average tickets of $900 and above, which also represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, transactions remained double-digit negative. Here the weakness continues in high-dollar discretionary spend categories.</p>
          <p>Our overall seasonal business results were mixed in the quarter. The usual summer heat never came in parts of the U.S., with June temperatures averaging their lowest in five years and July the coolest in 18. As a result, products like air conditioners and fans underperformed compared to last year and negatively impacted U.S. comps by approximately 0.5 point.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we were very pleased with our performance in lawn and garden. During the second quarter, we saw positive comp growth across several product categories, like live goods, fertilizers, chemicals, seed, and landscape products. In outdoor power equipment, sales significantly outperformed the company average, and we grew share on the strength of our exclusive product offerings with Toro, Honda, Cub Cadet, Ryobi and Homelite.</p>
          <p>Paint is another area contributing to our positive transactions in the quarter. Guided by our portfolio strategy, the major investments we've made in our paint department are clearly paying off. With the help of Matt Carey and his IT team, we completed the rollout of new paint tinting equipment across all of our U.S. stores, making the process more efficient for our associates and driving inventory efficiency by simplifying the tint bases required.</p>
          <p>We also launched innovative product: BEHR's Premium Plus Ultra, a paint and primer all in one; Rust-Oleum's Ultra 2x product, which delivers twice the paint in the can for about half the cost of competitive products; relaunched Glidden; and reset our applicator program, simplifying the offering for our customers. As a result of these actions, the department showed a positive comp as we improved the total project sales and gained market share.</p>
          <p>The downward pressure on ticket continues in construction categories and big-ticket discretionary spend. In total, our average comp ticket for the second quarter was down 8.5%. In the U.S., our average comp ticket declined by $4.11 or 7.3%. Key contributors to the decline in average ticket were commodity categories such as lumber, building materials, and electrical. Framing lumber and structural panel remains down about double digit from a year ago. Similarly, copper prices are still running on average about 40% lower than the same time last year. These impacts were partially offset by inflation in roofing. Finally, in the second quarter, big-ticket discretionary projects like kitchens and millwork contributed over $1 reduction of the year-over-year average ticker decline.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're continuing to make progress through the implementation of our portfolio strategy and the use of our new tools. We are committed to deliver value to our customers while managing the business in a tough environment. The team delivered a solid performance in inventory and gross margin dollar productivity, as you will hear from Carol.</p>
          <p>These efforts resulted in the company achieving total share gain during the quarter despite having closed our EXPO business and significantly slowed new store growth. Six of our 13 departments grew share in the second quarter compared to last year, and additionally several key classes saw unit share gains, such as carpet, hand tools, hardware, toilets, molding, and cleaning to name a few.</p>
          <p>As we exit the busy spring selling season, we remain focused on providing value to our customers every day. Our organization and storage business is off to a great start. We have invested in a new merchandising set that provides an expanded offering of energy-efficient CFLs and LED bulbs. We are providing online tools to educate customers on the importance of weatherization and simple projects like caulking. We are helping customers take advantage of the government-sponsored tax credits on weatherization products like storm doors. And we are well-positioned to offer energy- and money-saving products along with fall project know-how.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $19.1 billion, a 9.1% decrease from last year, reflecting negative comp or same-store sales of 8.5% plus the net impact of fewer stores due to the closing of our EXPO businesses. While total company comps were negative 8.5%, we experienced great variability during the quarter, principally due to weather, with negative comps of 6.8% in May, negative 10.7% in June, and negative 8.1% in July.</p>
          <p>1.6% of our comp decline is attributable to our international businesses, principally due to a weak sales environment in Canada and a considerably stronger U.S. dollar. Comps for U.S. stores were negative 6.9% for the quarter, with negative comps of 4.7% in May, negative 9.8% in June, and negative 6.5% in July.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.66, down 7% from last year. During the quarter, we had $20 million of expenses related to the closing of our EXPO businesses. Excluding the EXPO-related expenses, adjusted earnings per share were $0.67.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin was 33.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 32 basis points from last year. Our U.S. stores reported 38 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, driven principally by two factors. First, we had lower markdowns than last year as we anniversaried clearance markdown that we did not need to repeat this year. And second, favorable strength performance.</p>
          <p>Through our focused bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continue to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin. The U.S. gross margin expansion was offset by six basis points of margin contraction arising from our non-U.S. businesses due to certain higher costs. Now, you may recall that in the first quarter, our Canadian business experienced significant margin contraction as it worked through the inventory and other adjustments related to our SCORE or SAP conversion. I'm pleased to report that our Canadian team worked diligently to resolve these issues. And our Canadian gross margin rate is back on track.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased by 43 basis points to 23.9% for the quarter. As a percent of sales, our expense deleverage reflects the impact of negative comp sales. We experienced another solid quarter of expense control, with expenses coming in roughly $20 million under our plans. We are seeing some benefits from some fundamental changes we've implemented to improve spending efficiency in our business. For example, earlier this year, we introduced an automated checkbook in our stores. This is a great tool that allows our store managers to manage their expenses on a real-time basis. Managers can see how their expenses are trending relative to their plans and make on-the-spot adjustments. Essentially, this tool gives our associates the power to control what they can control in order to run a better business.</p>
          <p>As a general rule of thumb, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 10 basis points for every point of negative comp. Year to date, we are running much better than that due to our strong expense control and the impact of a lower cost of private label credit. As we've previously discussed, the year-over-year benefit arising from our private label credit renegotiation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year than the second half. Additionally, the weighting of our sales distribution is higher in the first half than the back half. About 68% of our expenses are fixed. So we would expect to more expense deleverage in the back half than the first half of the year. For the year, we believe that our general rule of thumb of approximately 10 basis points of expense deleverage for every point of negative comp holds true.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin was 9.6% in the second quarter, down 12 basis points from last year. In the second quarter, our income tax provision rate was 33.3%, down from 36.2% last year, due primarily to a favorable foreign tax settlement. This settlement reduced our tax expense by approximately $50 million for the quarter and provided approximately $0.03 of earnings per share benefit. As a result of this settlement, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35% for the year.</p>
          <p>Now moving through our operational metrics, during the second quarter we opened three new stores and closed one store in China for an ending store count of 2,240. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, down 0.8% from last year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $322, down roughly 8%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains a good-news story. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $10.8 billion, down approximately $1.1 billion or 9% from last year. On a per-store basis, inventory was down 8.3%. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $44 billion in assets, including $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. This is an increase of approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments from the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting cash generated by the business of approximately $3.7 billion, offset by $353 million of capital expenditures and $762 million of dividends paid.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, we have a $3.25 billion A2/P2 commercial paper program that is 100% backstopped by a committed long-term bank line of credit. As of the end of the second quarter, we had no outstanding commercial paper. We have approximately $11.4 billion of outstanding debt, of which $1 billion comes due in the third quarter and $750 million comes due in the fourth quarter of 2009. At this point, it is our intent to repay the debt maturities as they come due using cash generated by the business.</p>
          <p>Computed on the average of beginning and ending, long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was approximately 9.3%. On an adjusted basis, excluding charges related to our 2008 store rationalization actions and the closing of our EXPO businesses, return on invested capital was 10.3%.</p>
          <p>We continue to control what we can control. We are focused on executing our strategic imperatives, and our financial results reflect the success that we've had thus far. Our results for the first half of the year were better than our plan, but as Frank mentioned, the external signals call for caution. We are comfortable with the sales guidance we gave at our June investor conference, as we still believe sales will be down roughly 9% for the year.</p>
          <p>On the earnings front, based on our first-half performance, we are lifting our guidance and are calling for fiscal 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations to be flat to up 7% for the year and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be down 15 to 20%.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your participation in today's call. And we'll be happy to take your questions. Augusta, we are now ready for questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from Maggie Gilliam with Gilliam &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm wondering if you could please talk a little bit more about Canada and the SAP initiative, whether you've learned anything from it yet regarding adopting it in the United States? And also what kind of merchandising initiatives are you pursuing vis-&#xE0;-vis Canada and the U.S., Canada being a place where you're selling more decor products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maggie, thanks very much for the question. Actually Matt Carey is here, and probably is in the best position to talk about some of the SAP implementation points.</p>
          <p>I will say to the latter part of your question in terms of the merchandising initiatives that one of the great things about having the Canadian business is that they do go out and do some things a little bit differently than we do in the U.S. And as you said that some of their stores are significantly more project-focused and decor project-focused, and the Canadian team has had great success with that.</p>
          <p>The Canadian team actually was early on adopter of Eco Options, which &#x2013; we then took that program and as you know are running with it in the United States. So a lot of the things that they do in Canada in terms of merchandising initiatives we're then able to transplant here. So it's terrific to have that group working on different ideas.</p>
          <p>SAP implementation was very much a part of that in terms of being able to the use the Canadian business to understand what an effort of that magnitude might look like for us. And so with that let me just turn it over Matt to make a couple of comments on the SAP implementation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Maggie. What I'd tell you is as we said in the past, we're going to continue to kind of monitor and watch this SAP performance. The implementation of that system has kind of smoothed out from my perspective, and I think from the Canadian team's perspective. We've obviously learned a lot of things about how to do change in our environment, and we'll continue to apply those learnings as we modify systems in the chain.</p>
          <p>We also have found a few things that we'd like to bring to the U.S. around labeling and signing, as well as things in the U.S. that we'd like to put in Canada around data maintenance and some of the other things. So we're going to continue to share best practices where appropriate, and we'll continue to look at the SAP implementation in Canada as a learning lesson as &#x2013; that might inform us about future decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'd also just make a general comment on that, Maggie, that as we think about the SAP implementation, there are really two sets of issues. There's first, what's the performance in Canada and what do we learn from that performance. And then also what do we do in the U.S., and what have we learned over the last year in terms of what we're capable of doing in the U.S. without a major implementation like that. And we've seen a lot of progress in the last year on that side of the ledger. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Stephen Chick with FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. I guess on &#x2013; I appreciate the clarity that you provided on the pro commercial percentages, 27% I think for this quarter, down from a year ago, 32% if I took that down right. Can you give us an idea of what the trajectory of that has been, and can you confirm, is that &#x2013; do you think of that as higher profit margin business relative to the non-commercial, or is it the other way around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Steve. First on the trajectory, it's interesting because &#x2013; and this is, frankly, a lot of these trends we might not have seen, but for a better understanding of some of our underlying data &#x2013; a significant difference in how the pro business reacted post September 2008 versus the consumer business. And when you think about it, it actually makes some sense that the pro business was under more pressure from September 2008 going forward. Consumer business was also under pressure; it's just the pro business was under more pressure. So that's the trajectory that we've seen, kind of pretty much following &#x2013; if you kind of do October 2008 on.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin performance, what you'd see with the bulk of our pros is they shop the whole store, and so the margin performance around the pro is not that dissimilar from the consumer. Craig, do you want to add anything on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I would tell you that from a ticket standpoint, our pro average ticket, as you might imagine, is a higher average ticket. And of course their frequency of shop is higher than our average customer. So those are both downward pressures against those metrics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then second if I could, I think related to maybe Craig's comments on ticket sales above 900. I just want to make sure I kind of took it down right &#x2013; it's a double-digit decline. Is that a lesser &#x2013; I think last quarter, I thought you had said down 15%. Is it down less than that rate, or is it more? And has the geographic makeup of your sales, like the improvements in California, has that helped that metric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>The metric is still double-digit negative, and it has improved slightly from the first quarter. And in the first quarter, it was down approximately 15%. And it's really driven across several areas of the business. As we see it, we had transaction improvement in our lumber and building materials areas. Part of that was driven through outdoor projects; part of it was just driven through DIY projects, but I wouldn't say that it was specific to one area.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, if you could give us some specifics on the impact of credit to the expense line this quarter and then also offer up color on what you're seeing in terms of turn-downs and general use of the private label credit card and other credit related forms of payment, that'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd be happy too. First on the expense line, year-over-year we had a $42 million benefit as a result of a lower cost of private-label credit, and year-to-date the benefit is about $160 million. Relative to what we're seeing with the consumer and credit, we're seeing a shift.</p>
          <p>Total credit penetration &#x2013; and that includes not only our private label card, but Visa and MasterCard, et cetera &#x2013; last year, total credit penetration was about 65%. This year total credit penetration, about 62%. So a 300 basis point contraction, if you will, and that's all in our private label credit. So private label credit has dropped from 28% penetration last year to 25% this year.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of what we're seeing with our customers, for anyone who's applying for a private label credit card, about 76% of all applications are approved. That's down about 50 basis points from last year. In terms of the average credit line that's being approved, it's about $5,200. That's down $1,600 from last year.</p>
          <p>The through-the-door FICO scores for those who are being approved is about 712, up slightly from last year. If you look at our existing cardholders, those who are just using the card within the store, the average FICO score is 677, which is about the same as it was last year. So hopefully that gives you some color on the consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how does the 5,200 compare with the average outstanding line? I know that's kind of approved capacity, but where is the average line for your program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little north of $6,000, and the average utilization is about 25%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Good. Can you guys point to the reasons why you think California has improved, especially in the face of the unemployment situation in that state? Do you think that's simply a function of improving housing turnover, or are there other factors at work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first you do &#x2013; weather does play a role in our business, and we had a streak of some very nice, seasonable weather out in California and in our Western divisions that helped with our outside garden sales. I'd say also, as we've talked about before, you do have a churn of some houses as they go through the foreclosure process that drives things like paint, drives things like carpet upgrades and the like. And that's balanced against a larger drag that we think there is as you go through accelerating foreclosures, and that kind of slows down some of your basic building material business. Is that helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. So two questions. One is that you've said that you gained share in six of seven categories, yet it was your biggest share gain in five years. I think previous quarters, you'd gained in seven categories, and then the quarter before that nine categories. So I guess the way you reconcile those is, in those six categories where you gained share, that the share gains must have been outsized, greater than they have been. So can you discuss where that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just first, and I'll turn this to Craig to address. But I'd also offer this caution as we go through the share data. Our market doesn't have a lot of really clear share markers. And one of the things when we referenced &#x2013; when Craig was referencing the six areas where we gained share, that was largely around the consumer.</p>
          <p>And then if you remember that we have a substantial percentage of our business that's also pro, and both and the pro and the consumer data is reflected in the overall market share, which is the number I referenced. You can see that you got some goes-ins and goes-outs there that don't always neatly fit together. But, Craig, if -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So the reference was that six of our 13 departments on the consumer side gained share in the quarter, and that was around paint, hardware, plumbing, both our lawn and garden categories, both sides of that business, both in power equipment as well as nursery and landscape, as well as appliances gained share in the quarter. And then if you look at the total that Frank was referencing, and as we look at both consumer and pro and compare that, it was our largest share gain that we've had, and we broke the 20% mark at the end of July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to give a little bit more information on the market share, when we talk about overall total company market share, we reference our performance against the NAICS 444, which is census data. And we think that's the best representation of both the pro and the consumer market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah. I think that makes sense. Okay, thanks for the color.</p>
          <p>The one last just sort of almost maintenance question is, on the earnings guidance, so is the right pace $1.42 from last year when we're thinking about flat to up 7%? And then does that include the $0.03 &#x2013; I think it does include, but confirm &#x2013; does that include $0.03 tax benefit you got this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Our guidance includes the $0.03 tax benefit that we got this quarter, and when I &#x2013; let's just use adjusted. The adjusted earnings per share that we're guiding off of from last year is $1.78.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary, I'd say it will be sometime &#x2013; we're thinking in 2010, and probably second quarter or back half of 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second is you talked about power tools and some of the private label, and there's been some discussion about how well you're doing with some of your technology innovations. Could you go into, like an area like power tools in a bit of detail and then discuss is that why you think you're gaining share in those categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we really believe that we have a great lineup that services both our pro and our DIY customer in power tools. We certainly focus on key brands within that product category that our pro customers want. We have focused on launching and trying to be ahead of the game on lithium technology, which delivers more power, longer run time, better battery life for our pro customers.</p>
          <p>When you look at the innovation over the years that we've been able to bring with the Ryobi program on the consumer side with the lowest replacement costs of batteries pretty much in the market, it has become a great product for both our pro and light-duty &#x2013; or light-duty pro and our DIY customers. So we believe that the strong focus on brands that dominate the market and positioning ourselves with advanced technology has helped us in that product category.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>It's a great question. It's something that we think we have opportunity to improve upon, but we're obviously working with our suppliers on that, and we're working with our marketing team to enhance that messaging, but it's an upside opportunity for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on whether or not deflation across the entire box had a meaningful impact, and whether or not you were able to grab a little extra margin as prices came down to you, and any lag time that may have existed with that passing through to the customer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you look at the big impacts, lumber was about a 39 basis point impact, wire was about 28 basis points, but that was offset by building materials to a degree at plus 29. But from a margin impact, I mean, the market moves with the cost market when it comes to retail. So there's really not much of an impact on margin at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly on &#x2013; you addressed the credit in quite a bit of detail. I'm just curious, are you starting to see any reversal or loosening of credit with your credit partner, versus let's say six months ago?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Frank, I was really kind of very interested in your comments about the pro versus the consumer, and that 32 and 27% if my math is correct, and I applied it correctly it looks like that the pro business year-over-year in the quarter was down around 24% while the consumer business was down somewhere between 2.5 to 3%? Am I thinking about that right, first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your math is very good, Budd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, then, can you give us some more color of what may be driving the pro business or not driving it? Is there a net promoter score that's attached to it? Is there some color on ticket? Or have you lost share in pros or the number or pros that you're being able to serve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'd say, Budd, it's &#x2013; and again, let me preface this by saying if we had been looking at this with the dataset that we had previously applied, we would have said the pro and consumer business were down roughly the same. We've taken a different cut at the dataset that looks more at buying behavior than an SIC code, because the fact is pros don't come in with a little badge that says "I'm a pro."</p>
          <p>And that's what I referenced in terms of the dunnhumby data. We're looking at buying behavior. So maybe the single most accurate way of saying it is people who bought like pros in 2008 this time versus people who are buying like pros in 2009 is down significantly.</p>
          <p>And then when you think through why that would be, first you've got a lot of very basic things, which is you look at that private fixed residential investment number, which has a lot of what you'd call pro-related spend in, and you'd see if anything our decline is less dramatic than the decline in that indicator, which would also be consistent with what we see in the share data, but you've got high unemployment in the construction trades, you've got a lot of pressure obviously in homebuilding, a lot of pressure in larger projects that we think goes into that number.</p>
          <p>And I would say the other thing underneath it is we then subsegment that into different kinds of pro-like buying behavior and look at the different patterns within that. And again as you might anticipate it, the folks who are more maintenance, repair, operations-related pros are responding differently than a general contractor pro. So I hope that color helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. And when you say responding differently, I hope they're responding better -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; almost more like the consumer side of it. So it's the heavier pro that's really been more impacted, because the MRO's got to go on anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Budd, this is Marvin. And the pros are pretty resilient. So that MRO customer now has become a maintenance/repair kind of customer, because they're trying to find a way to stay busy. But again, just like the normal customer, when this market gets more difficult, then they find different ways to spend; their spending patterns change.</p>
          <p>But they still have to try to keep business going. And we spend a lot of time in the relationships that we've built with pro customers, talking to them about the different projects they're working on, and we try to make the necessary merchandising adjustments to give them what they need so they can in fact continue to stay busy.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got you. And if I could sneak in one more question for Carol, you gave us the year-over-year second quarter on credit and the year-to-date. Could you remind us what your forecast was for the year on credit benefit, and is that still the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we told you that our cost of private label credit would not exceed 1.5% of credit sales, and we asked you to use a number of about 30% penetration. Obviously our penetration is down. So we didn't give you a clear dollar figure for the year-over-year benefit. We might have guided around $250 million, something like that, for the year.</p>

          <p>First the follow-up question, any comment on &#x2013; it seems like July seemed to have an early &#x2013; earlier in July was tougher, and it seemed to recover towards the end of the month. Any comment on how August is shaping up, particularly with some of the better weather in the Northeast?</p>
          <p>And second, really bigger picture, as we think about the back half of the year, seasonal mix does come down, or least the outdoor mix does come down as a percentage of sales. I mean, how do you merchandise into that? And how do you &#x2013; do you think &#x2013; how does the increased DIY trend that we've seen in the first half kind of manifest itself in the back half of the year, whether it's snowblowers or what have you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can give you color on how we're performing in August, and then Craig can talk to you about what we're doing for the back half from a merchandising perspective.</p>
          <p>As we built our plan, we told you that the comps in the first half of the year would be worse than the comps in the back half of the year, and we still think that to be true. The third quarter, there's a lot of noise in the third quarter, because we're anniversarying hurricanes, et cetera. So we don't expect the third quarter to be materially different than that of the second quarter. We exited the quarter with a total company comp of a negative 8.1% in July, and that's where we're running today. So we're running at where we thought we would for the August period to date.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot of good things going in the merchandising perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you think about the seasonal business, as you were saying, the trend falls off as you move into the third quarter. First, step back and recognize that that happens every year, so our comparisons are the same, if you will, year-over-year. And then we'll really focus as we move into the third quarter on those things that become really important to the customer at that timeframe, the finishing up of outdoor projects that prepares their homes for the winter season, as customers begin to think more about energy and focusing there on how to prepare their homes. We'll be focused in those areas, fall cleanup. Those are all simple, easy projects that a customer can take on, and be prepared.</p>
          <p>And then of course there is the &#x2013; what I'll call simple decor updates that will take place in the fall season as well. We fully expect there to be continued pressure in the big-ticket discretionary spend, but the simple updates of the home are the areas that we'll focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up. I mean, is that all mute &#x2013; or moot, sorry &#x2013; if California and Florida continue to sequentially improve? I mean, does the whole seasonal outdoor question really become a moot question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when we look at California in the second quarter, as Frank said, we certainly had some benefit from good weather. And that helped drive the outdoor business. But I also &#x2013; when we look at the numbers, we're seeing a relatively solid performance in DIY projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; really because of the seasonal nature of our business, it's important to look at our business year-over-year rather than sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>55% of our sales occur in the first six months of the year, and that holds true in a down market as well as an up market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, right. But I'm saying, like, assuming big ticket doesn't really come back, right, and that remains under increased pressure, if California and Florida recover, at the end of the day that could overwhelm that aspect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, the recovery of California and Florida &#x2013; if I understand your question, Chris &#x2013; that would be helpful. Again, understand that that's only a percentage of our business, but that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions or basically one question. The upside performance relative to plan on sales and I believe on gross margin, can you identify or at least bucket what you think drove that or allowed you to accomplish that in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; Eric, this is Craig. I think the &#x2013; we have a continued focus, first of all, on driving value in the marketplace for our customers. I think Marvin and the operations team have done an outstanding job of really focusing on customer service. And then we believe that we're getting traction in terms of doing a better job through our new marketing campaign of beginning to communicate the value proposition that we have as a company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't plan for positive comp transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I think Eric, one thing to consider, Carol cited the inventory reduction year-over-year, but we also &#x2013; our experience in our best in-stock percent that we really have on record &#x2013; I've been here seven years; we've measured it the same way for seven years, and we now have our best in-stock position in the stores with the degree of inventory takeout. So you couple all those things together, and we feel very good about our progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, as far as the expense leverage, obviously the market share performance would suggest you're adequately investing in the business, but I'd just be interested in a little bit of the thought process of limiting the SG&amp;A or the expense growth to the degree that you are, if there's any concern that you might be underinvesting in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've very consciously set out objectives we have for improving our business and have identified areas where we are and have been consistently investing. There are other areas where we've been able to trim back, and we think they're largely non-customer focusing areas, and we think those are appropriate and sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And on the capital side, we told you that we deliberately back-end weighted our capital spending, given the economic uncertainty. So you may say, well, are you a little light on capital for the first half? No, this is what we said we would do. We've got about 650 million remaining in our plan, and we'll spend it by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Augusta, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Our final question will come from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-up for Craig and then Carol. Craig, on the gross margin side, if one of the ways we're able to get inventory, that great inventory performance, and keep in-stocks up, are we taking down SKU counts? Is that part of the focused bay approach? And if so, how far are we in that process? And I had a follow-up for Carol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, if you look at gross margin, we've been telling you that we've been working hard on process and the implementation of new tools, including forecasting tools and our assortment maintenance tool, which allows us to better position product in the right places. That has begun to pay off for us, and as we mentioned, we have not spent the money in clearance, where we did last year because we've gotten, really, inventory in the right spots.</p>
          <p>Part of our portfolio strategy approach based on the specific role and intent of specific categories is in fact looking at the assortment breadth. And we have where appropriate been reducing SKUs to simplify for our customers. Matter of fact, in the applicator reset that we just put into the stores, we had a fairly significant reduction in SKUs. And that, to be honest with you, Greg, will be ongoing work, and it's category by category. Some categories may actually expand in SKU count, while others will go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, this is Marvin. There's two other points I'll make on in-stock. If you have frequented our stores over the years, you would notice that our overheads are much emptier today than probably ever before because there has been a concerted effort on improving the operational process in the stores, but also the supply chain improvements allow us to take product from receiving to the shelf versus from receiving to the overhead as we've done over the course of the past few years. So operational improvements in the store, supply chain improvements, just allow us to have the inventory in the right place where customers can actually buy it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then, Carol, on the deleverage effect, the 10 basis points for 100 basis points of comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As we go into the future, into next year and beyond, is there something that's changed in the supply chain or the fixed cost structure that makes you think that that won't revert back to a 20 basis point per 100 once we cycle the credit and EXPO closing? Is there something that's changed there? Or is that a &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our rule of thumb is in a negative comp environment, once we turn positive, and we've heard from Frank that will happen next year. Once we turn positive, we would expect to see more than 10 basis points of expense leverage. Now, we are, like all companies in corporate America, are faced with rising medical costs, other costs that are coming with us. So we've got to work those through our model before we can give you our general rule of thumb. But where we sit today, we would expect to see more than 10 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then Frank, is that the &#x2013; in the second quarter, is that the first month of the second quarter or is that July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Wish I knew.</p>
