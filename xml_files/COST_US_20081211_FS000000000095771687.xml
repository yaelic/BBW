        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  My name is Rachel and I will be your conference operator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation first quarter earnings conference call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you.  I would now like to introduce Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer.  Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rachel, good morning.  This morning's press release reviews our first quarter fiscal 2009 operating results for the 12 weeks which ended November 23.</p>
          <p>As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.  The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>So to begin with, our 12-week first quarter; for the quarter we came in at a reported $0.60 a share.  This compares to our October 8 conference call guidance range of $0.61 to $0.65.  First Call at the time, as you recall, was at $0.64.  Most recently, it had been at $0.61 and then yesterday jumped to $0.62 as a couple of the data points in there had raised their estimates in the last day or two, so essentially coming down I think I believe as analysts are responding to the slightly weaker sales trends in October and November as compared to September.  Last year's first quarter of course, we came in at $0.59 a share.</p>
          <p>As outlined in this morning's release, this year's first quarter results included several items, some helping and others hurting our results for the quarter.  These include very strong gas profits this year in the first quarter, two charges to our P&amp;L related to what's going on I view in the stock market and the credit markets, together representing a $34.2 million pre-tax or $0.05 a share charge to first quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>The next item that I will term foreign exchange headwinds; as I had mentioned on the last conference call, our foreign earnings results were converted and reported in US dollars.  It essentially hit us in the first quarter by an estimated $0.03 a share.  That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year over year, our foreign operating results, which is about 20% of our company, would have been pre-tax $22.7 million or $0.03 cents a share higher.  We would expect that assuming currencies stayed the same for the year; of course you're going see that all year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the trend during the quarter of weaker comps, mostly on the non-food side our business, needless to say that hit earnings as well as the trend line from September to October to November was slightly down each quarter, the underlying comps.</p>
          <p>With those weaker sales results, I might add those were despite more aggressive pricing, a conscious effort on our part, to drive sales during the quarter.  We estimate that to be a penny or two.</p>
          <p>Also while our inventories are clean and we believe well managed during the quarter, some seasonal markdowns to keep them clean; I talked to our head of non-foods merchandising and he estimated that somewhere &#x2013; less than a penny a share but nonetheless several million dollars of markdowns to get out of some of the seasonal stuff early.</p>
          <p>LIFO was actually a small pickup.  I believe on the fourth quarter conference call back on October 8, we had estimated &#x2013; and of course then it was before gas plummeted and the economy changed a little bit and we started to see the exact opposite of inflationary trends.  We did get a pickup of $2 million in the quarter of LIFO income, LIFO credit if you will.  I believe at the last call, we indicated that that could be about a penny a share hit, and so that was a positive for the quarter.</p>
          <p>And lastly as it relates to our first quarter earnings performance, one of the other things that jumped out at us was healthcare costs, particularly during the month of October and into early November.  In talking to our third party administrators of the plan, they said they've seen this in a lot of places around the country.  And putting two and two together myself, it's almost in sync with the stock market decline that we saw that we saw healthcare costs go up dramatically above and beyond what you see at the end of the calendar year anyway when people have already hit their deductibles and they want to get their free eye exam and/or their teeth cleaning.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the quarter, first of all if you just add up the things that I just outlined, the negative slightly outweighed the positives, but not by much.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the quarter, as previously reported, total sales were up 4% and our 12-week comparable sales figure showed an increase of up 1%.  For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were significantly impacted by the strengthening dollar.  The 4% total sales number includes a hit if you will of about 3.25 percentage points due to FX such that the four total sales increase and the 1% comp reported figures essentially would have been seven and four without the FX impact.</p>
          <p>By the way, gas inflation or deflation now &#x2013; gas inflation helped September sales pretty dramatically but was essentially a non-issue in October as prices were falling.  And as they continued to fall, gas deflation hurt November sales, so essentially a non-factor for all of the quarter but certainly a big change in factor from where we entered this fiscal year and where we ended this quarter in terms of how that impacts sales.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest I'll review with you, our opening activities and plans; we opened a total of eight new locations in the first quarter, seven net in the sense that we closed our original Las Vegas location.  It will reopen in the first quarter as a Costco Business Center.  But that is currently closed, so a net increase of seven during the quarter.  We'll see Vegas go back into the equation in Q3.  Of the eight new locations, six were in the US.  One was in Canada, one in the UK.  As of quarter end, we operated 550 locations around the world, which includes of course the 31 in Mexico that we currently do not consolidate into our figures.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll review with you our ancillary business results, which seem to be pretty good; online results, which as you might expect have weakened; along with big-ticket electronics items and the like; and membership trends which remain pretty strong.</p>
          <p>I'll also explain these two charges that totaled the 34 million, the bigger piece going to SG&amp;A and the smaller piece going to interest income.  A reduction in interest income, I'll mention that.  I'll go through the preliminary balance sheet.  I'll give you a few comments on the directional change of inflation to deflation and how that impacted LIFO.  I'll make a brief comment on Mexico operations and our partner, Comercial.  You have seen that in the news with the issues that our partner down there has had.  And lastly, what I will call limited guidance, I'm going to be conservative and perhaps a little more vague given that it has been so hard to predict given all the headwinds and the tailwinds out there.</p>
          <p>To the discussion of our quarterly results, sales for this year as I mentioned were 16.0 billion, up 4% from last year's 15.5 billion; again on a reported comp basis up 1%.  Add three percentage points to each of those numbers to account for the FX if you wanted to look at it in local currency sales increases.</p>
          <p>In terms of the 1% reported first quarter comp, it was comprised of a 7% number, reported 7% figure in September, a minus one in October for the company, and a minus five in November.  But again, such monthly figures are greatly impacted by both FX and by gasoline price changes.</p>
          <p>If you just added up the two that Bob Nelson talks about each month in the monthly sales call recording, the sum of those two things in September was a positive 130 basis points; in October minus 400 basis points; and in November minus 760 basis points, so almost a nine percentage point swing in just 8 to 10 weeks; so quite a bit of swing in those things, which just makes it a little more difficult to understand the numbers, but that's what they are.</p>
          <p>The 1% recorded comp, International comps and local currency; as you saw expressed in US dollars, our international comps for the quarter were minus 7%.  It was actually plus 7% in local currency.  And I might add that they were even stronger as the quarter progressed.  They're all positive in local currencies in November, both in November and the quarter end in the past couple of weeks.  As I briefly mentioned gas &#x2013; which is by the way not the case as I mentioned to you already in the US.</p>
          <p>As I briefly mentioned, gasoline had no impact, essentially no impact on Q1's comps as price inflation, relative price inflation year over year during the first month, month and a half was offset essentially by price deflation relative to the year over year for the last six weeks of the quarter.</p>
          <p>The average transaction decreased.  To get to our 1% reported comp just in terms of simple math, it's an average transaction decrease of 1.5% for the quarter.  Again, you would have to add the three percentage points of FX in there to get to an underlying local currency transaction increase of 1.5 to 2.  And average frequency increase of just a shade under 3%, so frequency has continued strong in the high twos and low threes for many months in a row now.</p>
          <p>In terms of cannibalization, a small impact of about 0.5% in the fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, if you look at the comps as compared to back in the summer, again they strengthened a little bit in September, were a little weaker in October, and still a little more weak in November.  Again, I'm taking out FX; I'm taking out gas inflation and deflation.  Trend-wise, the Northwest has weakened a little more than average although it has been the stalwart, holding up a little more than average for a long time here.  California has been pretty much proportional to the overall US, still lower but that gap between California's comps and the rest of the US not widening.  And holding up the best has been the Northeast.  Internationally, all of Asia is doing great in local currencies in the mid-teens or better, with Canada in the mid-singles.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which is about half our business, high singles; again, I'm adjusting the detriment of FX out of there.  Tobacco continues to be mid-singles negative.  Otherwise most &#x2013; virtually all categories were up year over year with dry groceries, canned goods, what have you, being the strongest comp in the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>Just looking through the list, I was surprised to see given all the craziness out there that alcohol was flat, beer and wine and spirits.</p>
          <p>Within hard lines, comp which has been in the mid to high single negative digits, nothing very thrilling; generally everything is low single digit negative to as much as 20% minus comp in the hard lines.</p>
          <p>The one bright point has been electronics.  While it's still overall a low negative comp, our television sales have been way up in November.  I don't know if Bob mentioned this on the recording, but we had unit sales up over 50% in the four weeks but that translated into a dollar sales increase of only 3%.  If you go on to Costco.com, you can see that we're having &#x2013; we're selling two-packs of flat screen televisions for less than $1,500 for the both of them.  So we've seen a lot of &#x2013; we have been &#x2013; notwithstanding what's going on in the economy and with big ticket items, we have taken advantage and been opportunistic in going to vendors that have been stuck with inventory when other cancellations have occurred elsewhere and taking advantage of that.</p>
          <p>Within the soft lines comp, again in the mid to high single digits negative, a repeat of hard lines, nothing thrilling.  Generally everything is in the minus five to minus 20 or 25% comp range.  Probably the one standout, again slightly negative, ever so slightly negative but still a standout relative to the other subcategories is apparel.  Again, I think it has to do with the fact of availability of branded items in that category.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, like food and sundries, positive, darn near close to positive double digits.  Produce is a standout, in the double digits with all four of the sub-fresh food categories positive.  Clearly food is driving our business as it is others.</p>
          <p>Moving down the line items and the income statement, we'll start with membership fees.  In dollars we were up 6% or $21 million, and as a percent of sales up five basis points.  The five basis points seem stronger than the up 6%.  I think that again has to do partly with the FX issue.  If you had flat FX, our dollars would be up 9 to 10%.  Someone here asked earlier &#x2013; we're talking about now that it's positive, a part of that is the fact that the negative as the dollar weakened over several years, it was always a small effective negative to us. But here in one fell swoop in the matter of six or eight weeks has been a big change, so I felt I should mention that.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership fees, strong renewal rates, still a slight increase in penetration of Executive Membership in spite of the weak economy and the apparent ramp up in membership marketing activities from the competition.  Our new member signups in Q1 were essentially flat year over year in the quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we opened two fewer openings.  In terms of members at Q1 end: Gold Star 20.5 million; Primary Business 5.6 million; add-ons 3.4; for a total of 29.6.  That's up from 29.2 million at the end of the year 12 weeks ago.  Including spouse cards, 54.1 million cards in our system; I'd add about 2.8 million to that number to be actually at 57 million if you include Mexico.</p>
          <p>At quarter end on November 23, paid Executive Membership topped 8 million, an increase of almost 400,000 or 5% just in the last 12 weeks or about 30,000 per week increase in the quarter.  So again, it still has been a big success for us in terms of converting members to that.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates, as I said they continue strong, essentially at our all-time high renewal rate.  Q1 '09, the numbers both for Business, Gold Star, and total were the same as they were at fiscal year end, and rounding up a percentage point versus a year ago; Business coming in at 92%; Gold Star at 86%; and total a shade above 87.0%.</p>
          <p>Continuing down the line, gross margins, year over year in the quarter they were up 32 basis points.  This is where we get to drive you crazy a little bit with the explanations, but basically coming in at 10.97 this year versus 10.65 last year.  As usual, we'll jot down a few numbers.  The line items will be core merchandising; the second line item, ancillary businesses; third line item, 2% reward; fourth line item, LIFO; fifth line item, other; and lastly, total.  And then three columns: all of fiscal '08; fourth quarter of '08; and then first quarter of '09, so we can see a trend here.</p>
          <p>In terms of going across, merchandising core was plus 17 basis points for all of '08 compared to all of '07; in Q4 on a Q4-over Q4-basis, minus 19 basis points; then in Q1 '09 versus Q1 '08 lower by 13 basis points, so minus 13 basis points.  Continuing across ancillary: minus 13, minus six, and plus 46; 2% reward, minus three, minus two, minus two; LIFO, minus five, minus 14, plus one.  Other, minus five &#x2013; I'm sorry, plus five, minus four, and zero.  Such that totals for all of '08 year over year were up one basis point, all of '08 versus all of '07.  In the fourth quarter of '08 versus the fourth quarter of '07, we were down 45 basis points; and Q1 over Q1, we were up 32 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now as you look at that up 32, core merchandise business, which is again a little over 80% of our business in food, sundries, hard lines, soft lines, and fresh foods, we show here that the quarter was down 13.  We still have the issue with gas and its penetration notwithstanding the fact that its relative penetration, while still up a little bit, is not nearly as up as it was Q4 over Q4 with the declining gas prices of late.  But just looking with blinders on at just those four categories based on those four categories, margins and sales, Q1 was lower by two basis points.  I'll go through a couple of comments on that in a minute.  The aggregate was lower; sales penetration of those categories made the minus two and 13 in our matrix.</p>
          <p>Of the four major departments, fresh foods and soft lines were lower year over year.  Part of our conscious aggressive pricing was bringing down produce items to drive more business on the food side and bring people in.  With food and sundries and hard lines being higher year over year, I think the hard lines one would be a surprise to many given the weakness in some of those categories but again, I think we have improved in some categories like electronics.  Again, given non-food sales weakness and a few extra seasonal markdowns, not a bad showing at all in our view; our year-over-year gross margin in the retail gas business as you might expect was substantially up year over year.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook going forward, overall margins are okay.  Keep in mind we will look foremost to drive top line sales, which we have and may in the future &#x2013; which have and may in the future still be a small hit to margins.  We are also as you would expect us to be doing is going back to vendors who are raising prices just several months ago to understand why they aren't coming down and we have been successful in that as well as I would expect our competitors to be as well.</p>
          <p>The impacts from increasing Executive Membership, a very small hit, as you see two basis points.</p>
          <p>LIFO, given how we started out the fiscal quarter &#x2013; again, I think on October 8 at our last quarterly conference call, we mentioned that we could take a charge in the quarter of perhaps a penny a share, 8 to $10 million pre-tax.  Now, however, with the expectations for lower inflation, again we are actually looking at our LIFO pool calculations as of Q1 end.  We did bring back a couple of million dollars.</p>
          <p>I should point out that the moderate LIFO benefit recorded in Q1 excluded the effect of significant gas deflation that occurred during the quarter.  That's because we're not &#x2013; remember LIFO is not just looking at an index at quarter end.  It's trying to guesstimate what it's going to be as of year-end and adjusting accordingly.  We're not sure which way gas prices are going and how low -whether they'll go up or down but we felt that looking at it at midyear, but nonetheless there's a decent LIFO credit that is still there, potentially there if gas prices remained low.  We will realize that in the future.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 31 basis points so minus &#x2013; higher means bad so it's a minus 31, coming in at 10.46 this year versus a 10.15 last year.  Again, a very simple quick table helps to look at it better.  The line items are operations, central, stock compensation, quarterly adjustments, and total; going across the same three columns: fiscal '08, Q4 '08, and Q1 '09.  Operations was &#x2013; in the first column would be a plus five, meaning better year over year or lower by five basis points; Q4 '08, plus 21; and Q1 '09, minus 16; central, plus three, plus three, minus three; stock compensation, minus two, minus three, zero; quarterly adjustments, plus eight, minus six, minus 12; for a total of plus 14. So in all of '08, we were lower year over year by 14; in Q4 '08 plus 15 or lower by 15; and Q1 '09 minus 31 or higher by 31.</p>
          <p>Now operations was higher by 15 year over year.  Let's face it; this is all about sales levels and about six to eight basis points related to that healthcare spike that I mentioned.  We've seen that subside by the way in the last couple of weeks, but we'll see what happens tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Nothing really unusual in central, nothing unusual in the dollars; it's really the same story, a little weaker sales and the challenge of leveraging or deleveraging that.  Our stock compensation expense was flat year over year as a percentage.  It's really a slightly higher number of our issues being granted to more managers and more people in the organization, but granted at a lower price than a year ago. So the sum of those two essentially was a wash in terms of expenses as a percent of sales; overall not a thrilling SG&amp;A performance but to be expected with sales, a little sales weakness and of course the lower gas prices.</p>
          <p>I will mention lastly the minus 12 basis points of quarterly adjustments, the charge we described in this morning's press release that hit SG&amp;A, of that $34 million that was in the press release, 28.4 million or 18 basis points, minus 18 is in this minus 12.  We also have a pickup year over year of plus six.  If you recall, last year in Q1 we took a $9 million reserve for a give back to employees last year in the first quarter for healthcare, which we don't have a comparable number this year.  So looking at that, that minus 18 is really the non-recurring amount of that, and then of course the non-recurring plus 60 offsets that.</p>
          <p>Let me go over briefly these two charges; again, one which the bigger of the two which relates to SG&amp;A and one that will impact interest income and other but I'll go ahead and talk about both of them now.  The 28 point &#x2013; of the 34 million we talked about in the press release, the $28.4 million pre-tax charge related essentially to the stock market's free fall and the mark-to-market impact on the cash value of life insurance policies covering just over 800 Costco members and management.  This was a charge to SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>For 18 years, we have utilized split dollar insurance to provide for life insurance coverage for our warehouse managers and above.  Using this traditional insurance product, as the cash surrender values in the underlying policies grew, that asset if you will which is on our books as a long-term asset, has been invested in a diversified portfolio of both fixed income and equity type market funds.  It's always marked to market at the end of each quarter.  Historically at least until this quarter, the plus or minus to our quarterly P&amp;L was generally zero to 2 or $3 million, a couple of outliers beyond that but nothing huge; and part of SG&amp;A, nothing really to talk about historically.  In Q1, the mark-to-market value of these policies went from a little over $90 million to $61.7 million or a loss of 28.4.  That was a 32% decline in value.</p>
          <p>I don't need explain to you guys that we have got a diverse portfolio from fixed income to S&amp;P 500 to small cap growth and we all know what happened in October.  I can tell you that as of the beginning of the quarter, the portfolio was about just under 30% in what I would call non-equity type funds, fixed income and the like.  It's now about 60%, including about that incremental 30% in money market funds, just to be out of that craziness and go forth with running our business.  So I would hope and expect that to be relatively one-time and we'll go on from there.</p>
          <p>The second charge, a $5.8 million pre-tax charge to interest income and other, I spoke to you about that on the last couple of quarterly conference calls and October 8 on our year-end conference call as well.  Just very quickly, if you go back to a year ago in early December 2007, we had about $1.1 billion of our cash in what was referred to as enhanced money market funds, spread among six or seven of them.  We received a call in early 2007 from one of those funds saying that the fund was stopping redemptions and the fund would be allowed to float, be NAV from $1.  That hadn't happened in a number of years, over 15 years prior to that.  We immediately requested redemption from all the funds, which at the time as I mentioned totaled a little over 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>As of last week, we've redeemed just under $1 billion of it, which was reinvested in government funds and have about 137 million remaining among three of those six funds, and those are being done through orderly liquidations as these things mature.  All three have restricted redemptions and they are in the process of undergoing that orderly liquidation.  As they mature, they can be sold by the portfolio managers.</p>
          <p>With this $5.8 million charge, I think we have taken right around 10 million against the 1.1 billion if you will.  Most of it has been in one of those funds, but nonetheless about 1%, a little under 1% hit to that original 1.1 billion we had in these &#x2013; what we thought were safe money market funds.</p>
          <p>We don't expect big changes in that.  Again, we are down to the final throes here.  And what's left is not the best of it.  It's just when these things mature.  Could be there be a few million here or a couple of million there?  Sure, but we don't see any &#x2013; we certainly don't expect a big charge like the 28 million again.  Could we get a couple million here and there from this over the next four to eight quarters?  I wouldn't be surprised but nothing big.</p>
          <p>Again, this has been more of a liquidity issue for us.  We don't have a liquidity issue because we've got plenty of cash.  But this has not been about a risk of principal, thankfully.  It has been more about just getting our money out of these things.</p>
          <p>In terms of the SG&amp;A outlook for the remainder of '09, it really relies on sales trends, no big changes expected plus or minus.  We don't have anything up our sleeves to drive you guys crazy in the next six months, but we'll have to see what sales trends are.</p>
          <p>Moving down to pre-opening, pre-opening was quite a bit lower, 8.6 million lower, coming in at 12.8 million this year versus 21.5 million last year.  We did open 10 openings last year versus eight this year.  Probably more importantly, we also had several openings that occurred in the early parts of Q2 in December last year, late November and early December last year.  I don't think we have any plans for openings in Q2 this year.  So again, some of that is the reason.  As well, last year we had about $3.5 million more within this number, more in remodel and new warehouse business additions than we had this year; no real surprises when you look at the underlying components of it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the provision for impaired assets and closing costs, last year in first quarter, we essentially were flat at a $79,000 charge.  As you recall from last year in the first quarter that essentially flat number, zero number, was about 3 million of expense normal expenses for impairments and closing costs, offset by a nearly like amount in real estate gains.  In the first quarter this year, we had a charge of 6.8 million, a little over two-thirds of which is related to the relocations that we've got going on.</p>
          <p>So all told, operating income in the first quarter was up 7% year over year, from 394 million last year to 420 million this year.  That's on a reported basis with all the stuff that we've talked about here.  But as I mentioned early on in the call, one big positive, gas profits, and a very small positive LIFO credit relative to expectation essentially were offset by those other things that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was slightly higher year over year, essentially the same, 24.6 million versus 23 million in last year's first quarter.  Virtually all of this, nearly all of this is the interest expense on the $2 billion debt offering we did in February '07.</p>
          <p>Interest income and other, significantly lower year over year; a year ago in the quarter, it was 33.3 million.  This year, it came in at 18.2 million or a $15.1 million lower amount.  Virtually all of it was lower interest income, not other, which of course this 15 million includes the $5.8 million hit I just talked about, and as you might expect much lower rates of return on our cash balances.  Somebody asked this morning were we investing in any of these negative return Treasuries. The answer is no, we haven't.</p>
          <p>Overall, if you take all this into account, pre-tax income was up 2.3%, from 405 million to 414 million this year.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate, a good tax rate, higher than last year; probably somebody forgot to mention earlier on, last year we had a 35.3% tax rate for the quarter.  There were a few extra discrete items that were to the positive for us.  36.7 actually includes a small amount of discrete positives.  I think we start with a base rate assumption of about 37.25, so again but nonetheless about a percentage &#x2013; a little over a percentage point higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of a quick rundown on the balance sheet, which we will also include in the Q&amp;A which goes out in a few hours, we'll keep trying to get this to you at the same time but we want to get it right before we send it out.  Cash and equivalents, this is our November 23 balance sheet: cash and equivalents 2.816 billion (2,816); inventories 5,933 [5.933 billion]; other current, 1.351 billion; for total current assets of exactly 10.100 billion; net PP&amp;E 10.192 billion; other assets, 721 [million]; for total assets of 21.013 billion.</p>
          <p>Short-term debt on the right hand side of the balance sheet, short-term debt 169 [million]; accounts payable 5.847 billion; other current 3.522 billion; total current 9.538 billion; long-term debt 2.196 billion; deferred and other 327 [million]; for total liabilities of 12.061 billion; minority interests 85 [million]; stockholders' equity 8.867 billion; again for a total of 21.013 [billion].  Some of you have asked in the past could we also give you our depreciation and amortization number.  For the quarter, it was $155 million.</p>
          <p>Let me point out a couple of things.  Again, our debt-to-cap ratio came in at 21%.  That's after buying back nearly $5 billion of stock in the last 3.5 years, and back in early 2007 adding $2 billion of debt to our balance sheet; plenty of financial strength.  Accounts payable, if you just take what's on the balance sheet and take accounts payable as a percent of inventories, a year ago at quarter end it was 93%.  This year it's 88%, down a little bit.  Again, it all goes back to a little bit of sales weakness; and inventories in local currency dollars up slightly.</p>
          <p>If you look at the average inventory per warehouse, last year at quarter end it was 11.687 million.  This of course would be the highest of our quarterly numbers each year anyway because it's a month before Christmas.  This year at quarter end, it was down 256,000 per warehouse to 11.431 million.  But again in fairness here, you need to look at the FX impact with the roughly 18 to 20% of our business that's outside of the United States.  Of that 256 lower number, if you had flat currencies year over year, that's 600,000 of the 256.  So in fairness, the increase per warehouse is about 350,000 across the board.</p>
          <p>There are no issues.  About half of it is actually &#x2013; about 40% of that 350 is food and sundries, just increased food and sundries.  And as Bob mentioned, Black Friday was a week later, so that could be part of it as well.  Seasonal is fine, I want to emphasize that.  We took markdowns early in the season on trim-the-home and trim-the-tree and things like that, and we feel pretty good about coming out of that with no surprises there.  So no inventory concerns, again I think we did a good job of taking markdowns early and reducing commitments on certain seasonal items that we know we don't want to be stuck with at the end of the season.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, first quarter of '08 we spent 437 million, a little bit more than the year-ago first quarter of 378.  However, I would estimate that for all of '09, I think at the last quarterly conference call, we mentioned &#x2013; I'm sorry, we spent less this year, about 378 versus 437 last year.  My guess, I think on October 8 we mentioned that for the year we expected '09 to spend about 1.6 to 1.8 billion.  My guess is that with just a few things slowing down, not consciously on our part, just delays in getting a few things done we'll probably be in the 1.5 &#x2013; 1.6 range.</p>
          <p>That notwithstanding, in talking to Jeff Brotman and Paul Moulton, who are &#x2013; Jeff of course is our Chairman and Paul, who reports to him, and runs real estate, we are starting as you might expect to see opportunities out there and we will be opportunistic.  But it takes some time and we think there will be plenty of opportunities.  All you have to do is pick up The Wall Street Journal and read about real estate opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our dividend, this tax day we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.145 cents a share to $0.16 or a $0.64 cents per share annualized dividend.  On an annual basis that represents a cost to the company of about $285 million.</p>
          <p>Costco Online, which is both Costco.com as well as Costco.ca in Canada, it has been a great business, very profitable.  The year ended, as you know, with 1.7 billion sales.  Comps again for the quarter were in the high single, very low double digits negative, skewed in October and November.  It has actually come back a little bit but not &#x2013; but it's still a negative number.  Again, we too are being opportunistic there.  If you go to Costco.com right now, you too can get two flat-screen televisions for less than $1,500 total price.  I'll also mention, let's see here.  Again September was good.  It was off in November and October and it's consistent with what we see, just generally weakness in big ticket and non-food items.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, I mentioned in the quarter we opened eight, closed one, so net of seven.  And then that closure will come back to us in Q3 when we open Las Vegas as a business center, the old Las Vegas unit.  We have no openings in Q2, six planned Q3, and seven for Q4 actually, again eight plus one relo, for a total of 22 new, two relos, and a net 20; plus two in Mexico which we don't consolidate.  So we expect to currently have 22 units which so far so good; we're actually pretty much in line with what we said at the beginning of the year, something in the 20 to 25 range.</p>
          <p>In terms of square footage, some of you called back and asked for square footage.  At quarter end, our total square feet of retail operations were 79 million &#x2013; I'm sorry, 72,994,390 square feet.  So all told for '09, if we add the 20 net units net of Mexico, that would be 4% unit growth and about &#x2013; just under 5% square footage growth.</p>
          <p>Two final topics; Mexico, not a whole lot to say there; as many of you know, we and the third largest supermarket chain in Mexico, Comercial Mexicana, each own 50% of the stock of a company called Costco Mexico, which operates 31 Costcos down in Mexico.  We actually manage the operation out our San Diego office but have a very good management down there as well.  We've gotten questions about what's going happen with the challenges that the other partner have.  Like you, we'll have to wait and see.  Costco Mexico is currently operating profitably.  We have a good partner there, and we'll see what tomorrow brings.</p>
          <p>Last thing, just yesterday or the day before, we announced that we were adding a Board member, to now have 14.  A gentleman named Jeff Raikes, whose is currently CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  I think he has been CEO there for about three months.  Prior to that, Jeff was for a little over 25 years a key member of management at Microsoft, and we welcome him to our Company's Board.</p>
          <p>Finally before I turn it back over to Rachel for Q&amp;A, I'm going to give again what I called earlier a conservative estimate of guidance.  First Call was at $0.75.  Clearly, that's in our view going to be on the high side.  Again, we haven't seen sales improve.  The trend during the quarter was lower, not higher.  We still have the FX headwinds but that hasn't changed.  The one bright spot of course after Christmas is, is that you traditionally have higher food penetration in January &#x2013; February versus non-food, big ticket discretionary items.  So given that the strength is on that side, hopefully that helps you a little bit, but we're not betting a lot on that.  And we're going to continue to price aggressively to drive business.  We've got a lot of good things going on merchandising-wise.  We're not going to go crazy here, but we are looking ahead to what the business looks like after we get out of this economy.</p>
          <p>For the year, it was October 8 when we had our conference call at which time First Call's estimate for the year was at 3.25.  I'm happy to report that all you guys did a good job bringing it down to $3 as of today.  Again, I'm going to have to punt on that one.  What we have seen is it's very hard to predict nine months out, much less next month.  And again, there are a lot of good things going on here merchandising-wise.  Operationally, we're in good control in terms of our physical inventory, our shrink numbers.  We think there are some more real estate opportunities coming down the road over the next several months.  That being said, trying to predict what's going to happen eight, nine months from now is very hard right now.  So in talking to Jim [Sinegal] about that, we wanted to defer.</p>
          <p>Again, just if you think about it, if just currency rates stay where they are now relative to where they were last year, that alone is a $0.10 to $0.15 hit for the year, which $0.03 of course we identified in Q1.  A little under half of that was in our number to begin with, but quite a bit of it is not.  Again, those are the types of difficult predictions that we're going try to run our business right now.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm going to turn it over to Rachel and answer any questions.  Thank you.  Rachel?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard, and thanks for all the color on the quarter; a lot of questions these days on food disinflation and how we should expect that to impact your business in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is it's going to go the other way.  I mean inflation was a short lived word at least right now.  I've given you just a little color, random examples.  If I looked at &#x2013; as an example, if I looked at our various LIFO pools, what we call food and sundries, in Q1 it was still up about 0.5% in pricing.  In sundries, it was up about 0.5%.  In electronics and computers and what have you, it was down 2.5%.  Gas, which also includes sporting goods, office, automotive, was down all because of gas.  Tobacco, beer, and wine was essentially flat.</p>
          <p>If I just again look at some examples, something as basic as ham and bacon and butter are all down about $0.50 on 9 and $10 price points, so down 4 or 5%.  These are recent price decreases; Cheerios down $0.50 on a $5.50 item; canned tomatoes down $0.80 cents on a $7.50 item; $0.40 down on juice, orange juice.  A year ago, rib eyes &#x2013; New York steaks were $7.99.  They're now $5.99; that's all because of lower demand.  But we're doing a heck of a job with that stuff.</p>
          <p>On the non-food side, again I'm just looking down a whole list here and just picking out a few.  Kirkland Signature diapers and Kirkland Signature baby formula are both down a couple of bucks on 20 to $40 price points, so 5 to 10%, so we are seeing some of this come down. Gas of course is way down.  You feel like you forgot to fill up your tank when it only says $38.</p>
          <p>Again, who knows what tomorrow brings.  When you read the paper, there's nothing in the world going on that's going to change this very dramatically.  So my off the cuff guess, and it's truly a guess, is we'll probably have a LIFO credit for the year whereas just three months ago in our own budgets, we were adding 0.03 or $0.04 to the number for the year of a hit.  So my guess is there's going to be very little if any and probably a little again headwind if you will in pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just being in the closet notes, an increase in terms of the instant manufacturer rebates, which I believe are vendor supported markdowns, can you talk about the trend year over year in terms of what you're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of what we call IRCs, instant rebates, and what it is, is manufacturers who have a lot of inventory pushing it out and we of course are well known for taking large quantities, large massive quantities of big ticket items.  I think the television example is a great one.  But whether it's a high end vacuum cleaner or high end luggage or apparel, we're getting some great brand names out there and big quantities.  That stuff is selling by the way.  It's not selling like it was, but it's still &#x2013; we can push through that with great confidence.  And so I don't see that changing other than the fact that I'm sure some of these manufacturers haven't continued to build as if things were getting better next week.  So maybe there's a little less availability next year.  But certainly going into Christmas and certainly the pressure on the buyers here as you would expect, among other pressures like going back and saying the price should be coming down now, is to find those items that we can either divert or buy indirectly direct or buy direct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then the last question on the SG&amp;A front, I was actually pretty impressed with your performance in the quarter, especially in the past where you've had mid-single digit comps and haven't been able to lever.  I thought it was a very strong performance.  Can you talk about anything different in terms of your business model now versus let's say three or four years ago when we could expect continued SG&amp;A performance as such on a weak comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've always said there are not a lot of silver bullets out there.  There are little things.  Over the last several years, I think we certainly improved in healthcare other than the spike last month.  But we certainly improved in healthcare with the changes that we implemented back in late '03, early '04 that had a four-year tail to it because of how those changes to the healthcare plan changed and that helped us.  I think we've done a great job on worker's comp.  We brought in a couple of great people about three years ago that are getting people back to work safely and more quickly and getting them off worker's comp.  And I think we have &#x2013; aside from the great changes in legislation in California that was killing us five, six years ago, we are seeing still little improvement in worker's comp, and I think again that's being proactive on that side.</p>
          <p>We continue to &#x2013; believe it or not, I only hear from you guys or my in-laws or anybody &#x2013; or my own friends when they're backed up in a line and there are ten lines closed at the front end, but I've got to tell you that we continue to improve the speed at the front end, if that helps you a little bit.</p>
          <p>There are some other things that help margin and SG&amp;A that are little things.  I think the example I gave recently was you're seeing a lot of square packaging.  What used to be a round bottle, a round tub of detergent is now square.  It's now triple concentrated.  In milk, you've no doubt seen the new Costco milk carton, which again you get more on a pallet and therefore less freight per item.  A lot of that goes into &#x2013; those are all little things and we don't quantify them, but all that goes into &#x2013; I know at our annual manager's meeting in August, we had an example and on the slide it was 12 or 15 bulk, high volume items like paper towels and toilet paper and facial tissue and water.  And just in terms of changes of packaging, much of which is being done by the manufacturers but with help from us and other major retailers I'm sure, just in those 12 items in the United States, we are going to save &#x2013; on like volume, reduce our pallet throughput by over 200,000 pallets.  That's a lot of trucks that you don't have to spend money on.  A lot of that goes into &#x2013; needless to say, the freight goes into reduced cost of sales.  But it also means that forklift operators aren't schlepping 200,000 palates through the warehouse.</p>
          <p>So all those things, a million here and a million there, it doesn't add up to a lot of basis points but at least helps a little bit.  We are not as you would expect changing our wage rates.  We are not as you would expect going to charge our employees a lot more for healthcare.  Those are the types of things we have in place and what we pride ourselves in.  But we aren't giving up.  We're looking for where we can save money.  It certainly is tough when you've got comps being weakened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we assume then that you need a lower comp to leverage going forward than you have historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know and I say that because even here, it sounds so easy when I finally give it to you today on the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does sound so easy, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got to tell you just in terms of understanding it, just I would like to dramatically &#x2013; if you think about it, in Q4 a year ago, five quarters ago, gas sales, which is a sub-1% SG&amp;A business, was 8% of our sales.  In Q4 this year, it was 12.  In Q1, it was a little over nine and still rounded to nine.  So it's still going &#x2013; directionally it still impacts it.  It hurts a little bit but not nearly as much as it did a quarter ago.  So there are a lot of screwy things going on that make it hard.  But when I look at just basic payroll in the warehouses, I think we've done a pretty good job with the lower comps not getting as deleveraged as we could have in my view a couple years ago.  But again, I think it's a lot of these little things and I would like to say yes with a slightly lower comp than we thought a few years ago, we can still get a little leverage, but it's hard to predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thanks so much for the color and best of luck.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a few questions, first following on Deb's question.  If we were just looking at core comp, I guess recently you talked about four to five as that magic level where you can achieve expense leverage.  If we look at something more like a three, what would you say is a reasonable range of expense deleverage in terms of basis points for every comp point under four?  Is that something you think you can address if you're just looking at core comps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to address.  A different way to look at it and this is truly back of the envelope, if you think about it, what is one percentage point of comp up or down versus what you think you do?  On 71 billion in sales last year, one percentage point is 710 million.  When we've done our own regression analyses, if you will, of what is that on the margin &#x2013; it has been a long time, by the way, since we've done a regression analysis.  But the fact of the matter is best guess, and it's a guess, is that incremental dollar of sales be it lost or gained is about 4.5% pre-tax profit.  I don't know if it's four or five but let's say it's five just to make the math easy.  On 700 million, that's 35 million.  At right around seven million a penny, that's $0.05 a share.  So I'm not sure when comps go up or down how many basis points margin changes and SG&amp;A changes, those are the two critical ones.  But I have more confidence in guesstimating how the bottom line changes and then you decide where you want to put the basis points.  Hopefully that helps you a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful.  Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing on the pricing front in the clubs?  I know you did some things in November on some of the higher profile items.  I guess one, why did you feel the need to do it?  How much are you doing?  How deep are the cuts, what areas of the club; any color you can give us on that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically as one of the analysts I think put in a comment a few months back, it's in our DNA.  Our first order of business is to drive sales.  A company with a 5% minus comp versus a 5% plus comp operates completely differently.  You're spending your time worrying.  Employees are spending their time worrying about being cut hours and laid off.  We want to do everything possible to drive sales.  In a given month, in the last month of the quarter, I think we came &#x2013; the head of merchandising came to Jim.  As Jim had asked for, I want markdowns on key items be it produce or high profile items like &#x2013; I don't even know if these are the items we did, but it could be soda pop.  It could be Tylenol; it could be butter.  It could be Tide detergent, who knows.  But at the end of the day, it was a couple cents a share.  And we're still doing a little of it this quarter.  So it's not $0.05 and $0.10, but it's not zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you pleased with the results that you're getting on the items where you've been able to cut prices in terms of unit increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you ask Jim, absolutely.  If you ask me, I'm not sure.  Quantify &#x2013; it's hard to quantify what it would have been with and without.  I can tell you anecdotally when the operators, and I've talked to several of the operators.  When they are going around as an example, we took our famous rotisserie chicken back to 4.99 in many markets.  We saw a big pickup in unit sales of chickens when we did that.  By the way, you infer a naysayer, which I can be sometimes myself, was wow, that really worked.  There's a little bit of awe-shucks retail merchandising in us.  This is what we do for a living.  We're going drive business.  By the way, we're also going back to vendors.  It's not like we start by doing it and then going back to vendors.  But there's a little bit of headwind there.  And that's what we do for a living.</p>

          <p>And just a few final things, on the healthcare side, I heard recently from a company that they were seeing a spike as a result of spouses becoming unemployed and getting on the other spouse's healthcare.  Is that something that you're seeing?  And then is that what maybe causing it?  And does that mean that it could continue?  And the final question is with regard to the full-year guidance.  I understand your reluctance to put a range but if we were to assume just to get somewhat of a handle on it, if we were to just assume that the dollar stays where it is, that comps &#x2013; core comps stay at about 3%, and that some of the trends that are in place on pricing were to stay where they are, are we talking about something closer to like 2.80, 2.90, or just under 3, any additional color there?</p>

          <p>On your first question as it relates to healthcare, two comments.  One, we seem to have a lot of married people here.  They're married to each other.  But a much bigger reason and the real reason I don't see that being &#x2013; we have not seen that.  I just talked to our benefits people yesterday when I was gathering information for this call.  We tend to be the &#x2013; when you think about it, first of all 90% of our employees are hourly.  And many of them who are married, we have on average, our average employee who is in the plan, there are a little over two people covered by that person, from that person, so there's an extra 1.25 people, be it spouses or children.  A lot of them are already in our plan because we're the plan of choice.  If their spouse is working in a comparable job for another company &#x2013; again some of them are working here so that's wonderful from that standpoint.  But if they're working for another company in a comparable job, eight or nine times out of ten they're coming to our plan because it's a much more favorable plan.  So we don't worry; we've been hitting ourselves with it forever.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, Richard.  I just want to follow up on Dan's question, maybe ask it a little bit differently.  If $0.75 for the second quarter is too high, let's just say $0.70 just to make the math work.  That would suggest about 20 basis points of operating margin erosion and EPS down about 5%.  I'm just wondering if in your models internally, does that feel right and if that seems like a good yardstick for the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Charles, as much as I &#x2013; and you know I love to talk.  I've got all my keepers here in the room as well.  We're just trying to stay away from it.  It's not unlike in July when for the first time ever, we announced we were going to miss Q4, if you recall, and we said we were going to be way below.  We're not saying that here.  I'm just saying that back then when we said that; that was the first time we didn't quantify something.  And we're trying to wean ourselves of this quantification, particularly in this time when it's so hard to predict.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand; that's fair.  Yesterday, Kroger talked about some changes they're seeing in the perishable business with a little bit more shift to frozen product away from fresh.  I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing that in your mix at all.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both are strong and looking just at our fresh, our comps in fresh have remained where they have been.  I think that &#x2013; I don't know if it's &#x2013; I haven't been aware of a shift there.  The only shift I've seen is there had been some shift from meat to poultry and things like that, but that's not just in the last month that has been.  And we have seen anecdotally, in our food court, we have seen a huge jump in take-home cooked pizzas.  Where you can get &#x2013; and that's again people I think instead of eating out are coming to supermarkets and to Costcos to have dinner.  For $9.99, you get this oversized, overcapacity wonderful pizza that you bring home.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard.  Richard, just talking about traffic, traffic has remained strong despite the fact that gas has pulled back.  Walk us through your thoughts there.  Is that a function of the lower food prices is now what is the traffic driver as opposed to lower gas prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'm shooting from the hip here.  I think we're the value proposition.  I think the fact that people aren't eating out &#x2013; again, clearly you don't see the press &#x2013; you don't see the press every night on TV talking about $4 gas prices.  I filled up my tank.  It was &#x2013; and Washington has high gas prices because we have no state income tax.  There's a lot of tax on the gas.  It was $1.89 for high-test yesterday.  It was $1.99 a week ago.  Nobody on the news is talking about that anymore; it's old news.</p>
          <p>I think that food in general and the fact that we've got great cheap stuff, good quality cheap stuff is helping.  I think people's habits have changed.  Some of them are good habit changes and some of them like I don't really need that sofa is not good.  But at the end of the day, food is &#x2013; clearly if you look at other forms of discount where companies that have embraced more food than not food are being helped in this and are holding up better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So the fact that traffic is holding up and gas perhaps is not as much of a driver, that's not surprising.  I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would guess &#x2013; if you had said six months ago hey Richard, if gas prices halved, do you think your frequency would still be at around three, I would absolutely have said no.  It doesn't make sense because you're not getting the press everyday out there saying where is the cheapest place to buy gas.  It's gratifying &#x2013; I remember even two years ago when gas prices were rising, will people come to Costco because: A) it's a further trip; and B) they say gosh, I can't get in there without spending a lot of money; they seem to figure out how to do both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess my follow-up question is in light of the fact that gas doesn't present that type of driver, you are now using food to maintain traffic levels.  Is that a strategic decision or is it more a competitive response and that's the thought process in terms of taking prices down, others are being more aggressive out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just us.  I don't think we &#x2013; strategic is too flattering.  It's just that's what we do.  But keep in mind on gas, our comp gallons, what were our comp gallons recently?  Our comp gallons are still positive mid-singles.  So maybe it was positive high singles or low doubles at the peak of $4 a gallon or something, but it's still holding up pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then are you seeing any competitive response?  If it is just you taking prices down, what are you seeing from Sam's and BJ's as you are taking prices down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam's particularly is very fierce when we're down the road from each other.  As I've mentioned in the past, you take a big market basket of highly competitive commodity items and branded items and there's &#x2013; we both are at each other's places every day.  So yes, but we want to be first and we're going to keep being aggressive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the vendor conversations that you're having, should we expect whatever you get back to be reinvested in price or should we see some fall to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say all of that will be reinvested in price.  Again, but on the stuff that's just us doing it, it's just picking a few things to try to drive business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just the last question.  On the buyback, we're seeing obviously Wal-Mart has suspended their plans to buy back stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me get in one last comment, Adrienne, on the &#x2013; what were you just talking about?  I'm sorry, pricing.  We are doing other things.  I still feel pretty comfortable generally about our margins notwithstanding a few things because sales have fallen here a little bit and we want to get it in the right direction.  We're still focusing on private label expansion, which helps margins.  We still are looking at certain initiatives that we talked about in the past where we can make a little margin, so this is not all a one-way street.  But at the end of the day if it costs us a penny or two in a quarter to try to drive a little extra business, that's what we want to do.  We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our employees and we owe it to our long-term business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the core margin, the margin that you talked about that's down two basis points, in the past you have said that we should see a positive side in front of it, obviously that has switched, so going forward it should be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is &#x2013; my long term guess &#x2013; my long term statement is still that it's positive, okay?  Whether it's positive last month or next month, we'll see.  But again, we're not going to be down here forever with the economy as well.</p>
          <p>Getting back to stock purchase, we did see that announcement.  In terms of ourselves, we currently &#x2013; when we stopped buying I think in mid-September, we have held off.  Again, it gets back to liquidity, just keeping our gunpowder dry.  Long term, we are a buyer of our stock.  And I'm guessing that we're not planning to rush into it until we talk to &#x2013; probably have our typical informal conversation in our next Board meeting, which is the same time of our annual meeting in late January, so I don't expect anything.  If the stock plummeted from here, all rules are off and &#x2013; but there's no rush right now.</p>
          <p>I would expect something in the future.  I don't mean the long future.  A lot of it had to do &#x2013; everybody out there in the world, we got as much "cash" as we have.  Half of that 3 billion is not &#x2013; it's marketable.  It's monetizable but it's not &#x2013; it's debit and credit card receivables and monies tied up in our VIVA trust and things like that.  So the 1.25 billion or 1.5 billion that's truly cash, when we're now down to 140 billion or so that's in those enhanced money markets that will keep coming out, that's good news.  We had that one government fund lock up on us a few months back with 320 million.  We got about 140 out of that two weeks ago.  And all of the rest of it is we have been notified and the money fund has announced all of it without any impairments in net asset value, the dollar net asset value will be forthcoming in the second week in January.  So that will make me breathe a little easier, but when you started seeing things like government money market funds halt redemption, you say hey, whether we buy stock today or tomorrow, let's wait a little bit and just see what happens in the craziness of the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard, just two questions for me.  The first one is on the opportunity for gross margin and continue to expand it, the private label penetration.  From a consumer standpoint, are you seeing much around there?  And I guess your co-branded efforts within private label, should we continue to expect more products like that coming out or how are you thinking about it at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's going up a little bit; and yes, you should expect to see more.  Again, the name &#x2013; the brand is there, the quality is there, and the margins are there.  But I think Jim has said it best all the time is it keeps inching up but we still see ourselves as a provider of well-known brand names at great savings too.  And as much as we sell the heck out of a gift pack right now of Belgian chocolates, we're thrilled to have the ability to sell Godiva chocolate or See's Candy.  The same thing goes as much as we sell the heck out of a Kirkland Signature jean, we had some jeans over there yesterday that was in for $140, which apparently &#x2013; we had Zegna men's dress pants for $229 yesterday across the street.  Most people think that's crazy, as do I, but I bought a pair because I know they retail for $400, so there is that out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Then Richard, can you talk about membership fee, just the signup trends or just your ability to rejuvenate membership fee income growth and your plans around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, on a local currency basis, membership fee dollars were up 9.5% when total sales in local dollars were up 7%, so actually a little bit that's the conversion to Executive Member conversion.  We are actually thrilled.  The question that I have been asked, Bob, and I know Bob here and Jeff Elliott have been asked ten times a week in the last several months is that BJ's and Sam's are doing lots of marketing and lots of advertising and lots of membership deals, ten weeks for $10 and all this stuff, and we have actually curtailed some of our membership marketing from a year ago.</p>
          <p>It was about six months ago that we were off-campus, 10 or 15 executives for two days, and the topic was &#x2013; one of the visitors to that meeting to present was the head of membership marketing to outline all the things we're doing everywhere in the country and let's try to consolidate and do less.  Not to say we're not marketing, we are.  But if anything, the pendulum in Jim's view had swung a little bit &#x2013; we were doing a little too many of these $10 off here and gift cash card or those kinds of things; let's get back to what we do best and merchandise the value of the membership.  So I view us as being strong now and we'll not rejuvenate it if you will but we'll continue to rejuvenate if you will by having great stuff out there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I'm wondering if you can update us a little bit on the expansion goals for '09 and beyond in terms of the different geographies and where you might want to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of infill, we continue to think that there's plenty of opportunity in the US and Canada.  We think that with the challenges &#x2013; our bet is if we're in six or seven malls right now, and when I say we're in malls, we're usually in the parking lot with a breezeway entrance into the mall.  In some instances, one example would be in Atlanta, Cumberland Mall.  The mall owner tore down I think it was the JCPenney and then we redid the parking lot.  We have a gas station and a full Costco with no direct attachment other than a breezeway into the mall.  But no doubt we're there because we bring destination shoppers of high end to that mall.  It has been a great location for us in terms of somewhere we weren't invited to even come to the party.</p>
          <p>I think you're going to see more of that going forward in many parts.  As you know we're opening in Australia next June or July.  We have been as evidenced by the comps and the membership signups and the profitability of the three Asian countries we're in, we're going to push that a little harder, but a little harder means maybe we'll get in those three countries three openings a year instead of one, maybe four or five a year four or five years from now.  But still, that's a net positive.  Jim Murphy, who runs international, continues to look at other parts of Europe and &#x2013; but again, my crystal ball tells me it's more likely to be in some more malls before we get into Western Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you say the international business ex-Canada because Canada is a pretty mature property.  We've got 80 units.  Clearly, we're growing a lot more than we would have ever guessed five years ago up there.  We are opening two or three a year.  But ex-Canada, I think that's possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  A different question is if the core merchandise comps were to stay relatively moderate, what kind of ideas might you have for how to work on operating expenses in order to get them closer to leveraging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't do very well in addressing that question.  And again, I don't want to be cute about it.  We're not going to change our wage rate.  One of the things that we have continued to test, we always put into the warehouse &#x2013; a warehouse manager could lower their payroll if they got to use all part-timers.  We have a rule that at least half the people hourly people in the warehouse have to be full time.  We have a second rule that every part-timer is guaranteed a minimum of 25 hours if they so choose.  We have a third rule.  Even for part-timers that don't want a minimum of 25 hours, and I don't know the exact number, but no in the warehouse can have more than a certain small number of people that work less than 20 hours.</p>
          <p>Now all those things make SG&amp;A and expense control harder.  But it's: A) most part-timers want more hours.  We do help ourselves a little because you have that employee that used to be full time, got married has three kids and all five of them are on our healthcare and they're working eight hours a week, one day a week.  By having that 20-hour minimum, it eliminated some of that, a lot of that.  But we are still encouraged.  We still promote internally where we have to get more employees in the warehouse to save money doing something.  I think there are a lot more savings right now on things that impact margin like the freight issues, the pallet issues, the packaging issues.  Again, there's some labor involved in that but a bigger savings is on the freight side and the space, how much space it utilizes.  I think we're going to spend more time focusing, Uta, on what else can we bring to the table in merchandising.</p>

Again, on my first part of this call, we talked about all the pluses and all the minuses and the net of the two was a slight negative or something.  That gives you a sense of where it is.  It will be less of an impact.  It will still be a positive impact in Q2, but not as big because we're still more than average profitable.  But we were crazy profitable for several of those weeks when gas was really going down fast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Okay, fair enough.  Then on the core margin when you talked about the four core merchandising categories being down two basis points, can you remind us how that number compares to what you saw in the fourth quarter?  Knowing what you know right now about the second quarter, where should we see that?  Is that something that can go down five, ten basis points for the second quarter or what are your thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start the answer by saying what I said earlier.  Figure out what your bottom line is and then decide where you want to put the basis points because it is hard to estimate.  In the fourth quarter, our margins &#x2013; again put your blinders on and just looking at core sales and core gross margin, I think we were up in the high teens compared to that minus two.  But again, just take the little extra markdowns I mentioned, take the more aggressive pricing, take the weakness in non-food, and you're more than there in that regard.  Again, one tailwind, if you will, is that even if things stayed as weak as they are today, you still have in January &#x2013; February by definition a traditionally higher penetration of non-discretionary items, food and health and beauty aids and what have you.  Right now, you have a traditionally higher penetration &#x2013; an increased penetration relative to the whole year of non-foods which is weak.  So that alone I hope will help us a little bit but we'll have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense, and then two more quickly on the international front.  International margins versus last year's on a segment basis; I think last year the international business did about a 3.53 operating margin.  How did it compare this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be in our segment analysis.  The FX doesn't really impact that because FX changes every line item on the income statement from sales to cost of sales.  My guess is it's going to fine just based on the fact that comps in local currencies are very strong in Asia and decent mid-singles in Canada.  So at least so far, I wouldn't see any detriment to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect.  And then lastly of the 22.7 million of FX hit, how much would have been related to the Mexico joint venture profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very little, 10%.  Off the cuff, I'm guessing very little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right, thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We'll take one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard.  I want to ask a little bit about your core merchandising margin that was down 13 bps.  If you took the gas out of that, where do you think that would come out?  I guess you made an overall comment saying that gas offset the charge.  So should we imply that's like a $35 million number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gas is in the other number.  Gas is in our ancillary businesses.  That's where that number was so big.  Where it affects your core is what I said, the 13 just looking at core sales versus core margin year over year was down two basis points, but it appears down 13 because of penetration switch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then if you look forward, if we actually get into cooling of inflation or maybe even deflation, is that good for you or bad for you?  On these prices where you did mention things are down, are you giving that back to the consumer or are you pocketing some of that on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, first and foremost we're giving it back.  We still want to maintain a certain amount of dollars of profit per unit.  But much like when an item &#x2013; I'm making this up but say we're making 10% on a $10 item, and all of a sudden the item is now $12, we didn't necessarily make $1.20 now.  We make closer to $1 still because that's how we looked at it.  Similarly going down, we still want to make a dollar, not less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And thematically, do you think cooling of inflation or a tip into deflation, is that good or bad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's bad, not big bad but little bad.  I've always said a little inflation is good because we do make a little &#x2013; again, we do make a little more.  Using my example of $1 versus going to $1.20 on gross margin, we made more than $1 but not all the way to $1.20, so a little inflation helps you a little bit.  Again, on a totally macro basis, a little inflation helps you because it makes the Kirkland Signature look even better sometimes as we can drive that business and we clearly make more money there versus some branded items.  So if we had a little inflation and had knowledge that that's how I was it was going to be for a couple of years, I think that would bode well for us and people out there.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just again on the gas, do you think the year-over-year swing was something around 35 or $40 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not saying.</p>
