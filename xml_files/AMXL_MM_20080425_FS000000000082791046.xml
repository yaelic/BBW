      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you, Vera. Good morning, everyone. I think I move into the first quarter of the year with very good subscriber growth and revenue growth in the context of declining prices that has happened very much across the board by good strong traffic expansion and content churn.</p>
          <p>I think one thing that is important is to note that, relative to the consensus, our revenues were below the expected numbers, and we are going to be addressing this in the call. But the EBITDA margins are virtually identical to the consensus, even in spite of the fact that subscriber growth was a good 20% higher than the market was expecting. So we had a very good EBITDA margin, given that the subscriber growth was much stronger than the consensus had it to be. In fact in the case for our revenues, we are roughly 4% below consensus in the total revenue growth. But this is something that we will be addressing during the call.</p>
          <p>It's important to know that in the quarter we continued to rollout 3G networks throughout the region and have been most everywhere the first adopter of the technology. Our 3G coverage now spans 14 countries in the Americas, and in several countries we remain the sole 3G operator today.</p>
          <p>We added 5.7 million subscribers to achieve a good 1 million more than the consensus. So we had 5.7 million new subscribers and our base reached nearly 160 million, 31.3% more than our year ago. With our net subscriber additions, 1.5 million came from Mexico, 953,000 from Brazil, and just over 0.5 million from of each of Argentina, Peru and Colombia.</p>
          <p>Churn rates have been relatively stable throughout the region. Brazil and Mexico are virtually unchanged from a year ago. Colombia and Argentina is about 30 basis points high.</p>
          <p>At the end of March we had 51.5 million subs in Mexico, 31.2 million in Brazil, 23 in Colombia, 14.1 in Argentina, and nearly 10 million in the U.S. Mexico and the U.S. now accounts for 27% of our subscriber base compared to 66% by South America and 7% by Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Consolidated revenues were up 20.6% annually to 81.3 billion pesos, with service revenues growing at the same pace even in the face of price declines practically every quarter. Particularly noteworthy have been those registered in Peru, which our average revenue per minute has fallen by 41% year-on-year; Mexico and Colombia, where they have fallen 31% year-on-year; and Ecuador, 25% year-on-year. In Mexico and Colombia, interconnection rates were reduced by 10% and 50% respectively, beginning on January 1st.</p>
          <p>It is important to note in comparing the first quarter revenues with those of the prior year that this year's Easter holidays took place in March, whereas last year they had taken place in April. Here let me be very precise. The Easter holidays are very important also at Latin America. In the particular case of Mexico, we had an additional holiday take place in the very same week. So what typically is a two-and-half-day holiday in the Holy Week became a three-and-half-day holiday in the Holy Week, which many people made it into a five-day holiday. So the impact of the Holy Week was particularly stronger in Mexico than has been the case in other years because of the coincidence of the two holidays falling in exactly the same week.</p>
          <p>Other than that, all we can say is that the revenues are in line with our budget for the year and it is important to note that the seasonality of this year is simply <mark type="inaudible" /> from that of 2007. We would expect that in relative terms the second quarter should be stronger this time than what it was last year.</p>
          <p>Service revenue growth was particularly strong in Argentina and Brazil, 33% and 22% respectively in local currency terms. Altogether, our international presence have increased their share of consolidated revenues to 62%.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA rose 18% year-on-year to 34 billion pesos due to the margin as I said in line with consensus. In spite of <mark type="inaudible" />, sales came at 41.7%. And it's not only the great subscriber growth, but the fact that we launched the 3G networks in a number of countries in the first quarter. Altogether in the last roughly four months, we have launched major operations in 14 countries.</p>
          <p>So this has had an impact on some cost and expenses, mostly that have to do with &#x2013; on the one hand was the market gain associated with launching the new services, but on the other hand <mark type="inaudible" /> to having another network operating at a time when that network is still not generating much by way of revenues. So there are certain fixed costs associated with the operation of another network by way of link, by way of maintenance of the equipment. And these things all have had an impact in the first few months of the year.</p>
          <p>So with effect we are now operating in 14 countries of the region with 3G and all which have really been introduced for the most part in the last four months.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization charges have now fallen to 12.5% of revenues, which have already fully depreciated &#x2013; substantially all of our CDMA networks and these expenses should continue to fall relative to revenues in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>Operating profits were 24 billion, net profit 14 billion pesos. The latter ones reflect but the impact of additional financing cost which partly arrives from the change in the accounting methodology, as have moved away from inflationary accounting, pursuant to the new Mexican GAAP, as we are no longer registering the inflationary gain associated with our <mark type="inaudible" /> obligation. Our net debt came down by 5 billion pesos to 87 billion pesos, which amount to only 0.67 times EBITDA. Share buybacks and capital expenditures totaled 11.1 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Our working capital increased during this period &#x2013; this is basically what happened in the first quarter as we took in new inventory and liquidated accounts payable from purchase of handsets and network equipment that for the most part originated in 2007.</p>
          <p>So with this, Vera, I would like to open up the floor for your questions. Thank you, all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. Before we open for Q&amp;A, I would like to ask a couple of question, Operator could you organize the queue while I ask a couple of questions to the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, one movement please. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Please go ahead with your series of questions Ms. Rossi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Daniel and Carlos my first question is about the cost related to the launch of 3G, could you quantify what was the additional cost and expense in the first quarter of '08, is there a way to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Vera it's difficult to give you a number because, big part of the &#x2013; of the network is already in our &#x2013; let's say in our towers we put 3G, we've had to put more links, but you have extra cost by deploying a new network but I think as you put traffic in the network and have revenues in the network, I think you are going to have a very good cost on that network. So today we're having some extra cost but at the end of the day when you have that traffic, I think you are going to have a benefit on that because we're using lot of our infrastructure today, inside of our infrastructure and cost that we have today in the network there. I don't have exactly the number but I think at the end of the year &#x2013; or beginning &#x2013; when you start to see the revenues in the 3G, then you are going to see that that the costs are going to down as quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Vera if you look at income statement, you will see that the cost service is growing &#x2013; this time grew more rapidly than the revenues and that's again something that is normal and it is solely directed or solely linked to the operation of the network. That is the cost of service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if we didn't have the 3G, the cost of services, would grow less than...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...than the revenues which have indicate all the time. You can see all the numbers for last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and are you offering a &#x2013; how are you doing the migration of 3G &#x2013; of customers to 3G, are you offering just to postpaid users, to all users?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. we are offering some handsets &#x2013; I think we have very good price of handsets, different prices from high end to low end handsets and we are offering that to a postpaid with lot of services and data included and in the prepaid for voice because you know that voice in 3G is more efficient than in 2G. So that's &#x2013; we are offering to all of our customers now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this migration is causing an increase in handset subsidies or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's the &#x2013; as I said we're offering all types of prices &#x2013; all segment prices of handset, so we have high end, mid end and low end handsets and we are not increasing our subsidies to them, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one question about the ARPUs in Mexico, how do see your ARPU performing in the next quarters, when we won't have the same amount of holidays and potentially an improvement in usage due to the elasticity of demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know that the ARPUs were a little bit down because, first the vacations, second, the promotions that we are giving in Mexico, and third because we have a reduction on the interconnection in calling tariff base of 11%. So all of these things means that the ARPU goes down a little bit. I think that the ARPU is going to recover in the next quarters, but I don't know exactly how it's going to react the elasticity of the minutes. So I'm sure that the things that we're doing today in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil all around the country are the right things to do for the long-term of the &#x2013; the benefit of the long-term of the company. So I don't know how fast those &#x2013; those elasticity is coming but I'm sure that the ARPUs are going to recover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel and Carlos. And now I'm going to open the floor to Q&amp;A. Operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our first question in queue comes from the line of Richard Dineen. Please state your company affiliation followed by your question Mr. Dineen. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's yeah, Richard Dineen from HSBC Securities. I think actually Vera hit upon two of the key questions there in terms of 3G prospects. Maybe just to clarify a couple of things.</p>
          <p>In terms of the price &#x2013; the wholesale price of the 3G handsets, maybe if you could tell us what average cost you're seeing there and how the subsidies might differ versus 2G, really just trying to get a bit more of a feel of how the cost of equipment might trend as the services &#x2013; as you start to migrate the customers on to 3G. And also perhaps just on the elasticity there, can I just confirm that you &#x2013; you are seeing you think positive elasticity in Mexico, I mean it certainly seems like that; from the minute yields seem to have fallen by about 30% but the MOUs are up more than that. Again, not really sure as to why that's not driving a better ARPU trend. If you can just clarify on those points that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first &#x2013; the way we do is that we have in GSM also all kind of handsets from $400 handsets to $50 handsets, let's say. And then we put a price and we have like a formula to put a price and to give a subsidy to all those handsets. And it's going to be exactly the same in 3G. We have different handsets from $400 to let's say $100 or $150, and we are going to put the same formula to have the same subsidy. So a handset of $300 from 3G is going to compete against the handset of $300 in 2G and it's going to be exactly the same on the handsets of the $150 or $200. So I think that subsidy is going to be the same.</p>
          <p>And what you are saying about the elasticity in Mexico, well the promotions and the prices you see at the most in Mexico are going up but still we need that they go a little bit up. Postpaid is growing faster than prepaid and all the new postpaid center with lower contract plans pushing ARPU a little bit lower and also in the prepaid we are having the people that is not consuming the same because they are low segment prepaid people. But I think at the end of the day, that the elasticity is going to come and we are going to have that no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question in queue comes from the line of Henry Cobbe. Please state your company affiliation followed by your question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks very much indeed for the call. It's Henry Cobbe from Nevsky Capital. My question is &#x2013; I have 2 questions. First of all just on the CapEx budget for this year, perhaps split between 3G and your regular operations or by geography. But what are you penciling in for CapEx for this year and maybe next year as well? And the second question is just on the competitive outlook in Mexico and how do you see Telefonica contributing to price pressure in the market and competing for high-end customers, postpaid customers? And your view of where your market share is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on terms of the CapEx the &#x2013; I think we're going to get &#x2013; we are going to spend around $3.5 billion on CapEx plus 10%/less 10% depending on the traffic and the volumes of traffic so we have to put more capacity in some places. So it's 3.5 plus/minus 10% plus the licenses that we buy in Brazil. So that's more or less what we think we are going to spend.</p>
          <p>And what you are saying about Telefonica and the competition. Well we have been having competition for the last two years or three years and the competition has been &#x2013; no we have been having competition for the last 10 years. But competition has been more tough for the last two years and I think that's what you are going to see in all the countries. So they &#x2013; I think all of the competitors today are intelligent competitors and they are going to &#x2013; we are going to have some offers in the markets where we think that in the long-term are going to be profitable and good offers for us. That's the way we do our promotions and that's the way we have our prices and the plan's that we're putting. So that's mainly &#x2013; it's not new; it's not this quarter &#x2013; the competition is not this first quarter of 2008; the competition has been for all the last year very tough and 2006 also. And I think we are going to see that in the next year. So that's the way the markets are and that's the competition. And not only in Mexico, no? You can see competition all around Latin America.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And may I just a follow-up on Ecuador. What's the issue here? I know you are coming up to concession and I saw reports saying that it's still not clear if it's going to be granted to you or not. And there's money being asked for investments. Could you just update us on what's happening, and is there a risk that you lose your concession in Ecuador?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not thinking that we are going to lose our concessions. We are discussing the price of the concession in Ecuador and I think we are having the discussions on &#x2013; the concession ends on August. So we still have time to discuss that and we are having good discussions with the government. I think in my view, the government wants us to stay in Ecuador and to still develop the telecommunications there. It's my feeling it's what they are saying to us, and I'm very positive that we are going to end having that concession in Ecuador and being there for the next year, just giving the cellular services in Ecuador now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Andrew Campbell from Credit Suisse. I just wanted to get an update on the regulatory side in Mexico, in particular the spectrum of auctions that are coming up for 3G. Do you have any better feeling for timing on that and also any updates on number portability in terms of timing as well, and any other regulatory developments you think are important?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the number portability I think the time is 5 of July, so everybody is, I think all the companies are working to have all the technical issues done by that time and we're going to have number portability in the 5th of July.</p>
          <p>In the auctions of the license, I still doesn't have the date. The government is saying that they want to auction those license and that they are going to be &#x2013; they're close to give us all the information and &#x2013; but we don't have the date right now. And, well, all the other things as they are running, we don't have any big changes in all the other regulatory issues. The COPEC, which is still making the analysis about the cellular market, we don't have any news about that. So nothing in that side, and the only thing that has a date is portability and it's coming on the 5th of July.</p>

          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" />. It's Will Milner from Arete Research here. Can I just dig into the termination rates and the changes in termination rates that you've seen? Obviously that's had quite an impact in the quarter. I mean, can you sort of lead us through what is the proportion of your service revenues that are from inbound in Mexico and Colombia? And I guess specifically on Colombia, it doesn't really feel right that the reductions for 2.6% that I think you alluded to in interconnect revenues would cause the revenue growth trends to go from plus-20 to minus-1. So I'm just wondering what else is happening there, and why you're seeing this sharp deterioration in trend. And then just finally on that point, where else, which other markets in Latin America are you expecting this year to see either a change to the interconnect regime, the extension of CPP, or sharp falls in termination rates? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Mexico the interconnection rates, as we said, was 11%. But it's not only the interconnection rates; it's also new prices and promotions that we're having. And it's exactly the same in Colombia. In Colombia, the interconnection rate was 50% down, but the revenue per minute is going down steady. We have been promotions. There's a new entrance in the &#x2013; no, not new entrance; a new company being more aggressive in the market. Millicom is being more aggressive in the market. And, well, that's the reason why we are more aggressive than what we used to be. But I think that it's going to give us good customers, better customers, and the traffic elasticity's coming in the next month.</p>
          <p>So that's really what you are seeing in all the countries, and some others are more specifically. But at the end of the day, I personally think that we still have elasticity on the demand and that the traffic is going to recover the revenues. It's what we're thinking now.</p>
          <p>It's not only the interconnection rate, if it's your question, interconnection rate. It's only a part of all the price. It is only a small part of the price, but we're having other promotions. Carlos can tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you an idea of what kind of price changes we saw in the first quarter and how is the traffic response so far because traffic response tends to build over time &#x2013; In Mexico, the average revenue per minute fell by 9.6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the quarter, which is more or less in line with the reduction in interconnection rates. So as Daniel was saying, it's not only the interconnection revenues. We've had a reduction across the board in prices. So our average revenues per minute in first quarter in Mexico fell by 9.6%. And in the first quarter, MOUs increased by 3.7%. So we're already seeing the traffic response to price decline. What we have seen in the past is that the traffic response tends to build up over time.</p>
          <p>In the case of Colombia, we have a reduction in prices. Average revenue per minute in Colombia fell by 17.8% in the quarter, and MOU increased by 9.8 or 9% in the quarter. Let's say 10%. So basically roughly half of the reduction, a bit more than half of the price reduction in Colombia was already made up <mark type="inaudible" /> by the traffic response. That's very quickly, no?</p>
          <p>So you typically tend to have a stronger response from demand when you have a sharper reduction in prices. We have seen that again in the case of Mexico several times. And when it's smaller, it tends to build up through a longer period of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess I'm just trying to pick apart how much of this decline in revenues has come about through the termination rate cuts. I mean, 50% termination rate cut is quite severe, and to gauge we sort of need to try and understand what is the proportion of your revenues that are made up...</p>

          <p>Palley Research, thanks. I just wanted to focus on this MOU aspect because it seems like if you look at the growth of MOUs year-over-year, it's 32%; it was like 35% last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Mexico? You are talking about Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexico, yes, yes, I'm sorry. That's like the fastest growth you've ever had. I mean, I'm looking back at 2000. So that's the fastest growth you've ever had. So it doesn't look like the holiday really impacted the usage. It was obviously more revenue per minute. And then I look at last couple of years as far as the 10% interconnection, which &#x2013; that's existed for a couple of years now. So I'm not sure why that's a surprise. But the interconnection there &#x2013; and we did have five, ten minutes of increase I think sequentially in Q3, Q4 prior year.</p>
          <p>So with that revenue per minute that's still going to assume that ARPUs are probably down 6 or 7% unless somehow growth accelerates faster than it has in Q4 and Q1, which again is the fastest rate that I think you've seen in the past eight years, at least since I've modeled it. So how exactly does ARPU stabilize? And also if I look at the revenue per minute, revenue per minute came down throughout 2007, not just in the first quarter. So what makes us think that the revenue per minute will also stabilize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we have said that the revenues per minute will stabilize. I think that we believe over the next few years you will continue to see price declines in the markets. As we hook up more capacity and as the markets tend to grow in size, they become more sensitive to pricing and therefore these markets become more elastic. But again going back to the case of Mexico and for the answer we gave in the previous question, if you look solely at first quarter, first quarter we had a reduction of nearly 10% of revenues per minute in Mexico, very much in line with the reduction in interconnection rate, just like the way interconnection represents probably 20% of our service revenues.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we have an increase in traffic of 3.7%. Now the increase in traffic may have been held back somewhat by the <mark type="inaudible" /> falling much. But this is not abnormal. We have always seen &#x2013; after a price decline, you'll see some response by traffic and the response of traffic does not happen on day one. It has response of traffic that gradually builds up over time. People tend to build up their usage in response to a lower level of prices. And again you have all the historical numbers for Mexico so you can attest to that. Okay? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Thomas Lahoose with UBS <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you for the call, gentlemen. Just two questions really. The first one is how fast do you think that your customer base is going to be converted into 3G? And more importantly how fast do you think your traffic is going to be converted to 3G? Roughly what percentage of traffic do you think will be running over 3G by the end of this year or the end of next year? And that would be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have that number but we are not putting pressure to the &#x2013; what &#x2013; the first question what they asked me if we're putting our subsidy or we're giving more advantage to their 3G handset. I think 3G handsets are today in a very good range of prices. There are a lot of models there, and I think traffic is going to go to 3G and customers are going to go to 3G when they see better services, better handsets, nicer handsets and that's more or less what we expect. We don't expect that we're going to have a big change of our customers to the 3G network and we're not in a hurry to change them. We want to change them and that they &#x2013; when they change it's in postpaid because traffic and in &#x2013; in prepaid because traffic and in postpaid because of new services and that's more or less what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>I think we have all the services that there are going to come new customers like the broadband, wireless broadband and I think it could be &#x2013; there are good service for all of our customers in Latin America. So you don't have to change your 2G handsets if you want to have a broadband access there, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question would be given that you are highlighting that revenues are going to come back and that 3G will eventually have a positive impact on margins and your guidance to CapEx of an average of like $4.2 billion with the low net debt that you have, how much money do you expect that the company could be giving back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, can you repeat the last part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much money do you think that Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil can give back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we always said is that we always gave the normal dividend and at the end of the year depending on the price of the shares and the buybacks, if we're going to do an extra dividend or we're going to do more buybacks during the year and that's we're going to see; also depending the opportunities that we could have in other countries, in other places. So that's more or less the way we have been managed our cash flow and I think we're going to do the same this year.</p>
          <p>Still we have our dividend and it's around &#x2013; it's going to be around $1 billion plus the buybacks that we're going to have and the rest we're going to return as an extra dividend. Now, I don't know exactly if the buybacks are going to be &#x2013; how much they are going to be the buybacks this year. But what I can tell you is between both dividends and buybacks we're going to return to the shareholders the extra cash flow if we don't have an opportunity as in other place, in other country. And that's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That answers the question. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, this Mauricio Fernandes of Merrill Lynch. I wanted to go back to the point of the promotions; as far as I understand those promotions were basically given their time from prepaid and postpaid either for free or cheaper than the average, around Christmas. And my question is the promotions will continue to exist for the rest of the year, just wanted to get a sense of whether those minutes have been utilized already or whether you have an inventory of minutes yet that people can still use and we've put additional pressure on the ARPU in the second quarter. And if in the ongoing promotions for the rest of the year, whether we should expect them to be similar to what happened in Christmas or whether to establish a specific promotions directed to the Christmas season? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mauricio, promotions are promotions; they are not reduction on prices, okay. And what you see is that we have some promotions in December that we finalize the promotions in January, where we have promotions from November and December Christmas season, but we finalize those promotions in January. What we start further promotions on January and February and March, and that's the way we have been doing all our marketing. So we have promotions and we have reduction on prices, and today, we have been having some promotions, some of those promotions stay at the reduction of prices, and other promotions as we take them out. So that's more or less, we decide depending on the aggrativity of the market as a competition, and a lot of things also the month and maybe it's some other day and Christmas and all depending on the cycle, we decide what promotions we use and we do. But if we want to take the promotions, and we decide to take the promotions, if that's your question, we can't take out the promotions. So that's not something that's we need, or we are obligated to give to our customers for the rest of the year. So that's why they are promotions, not reductions on prices, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Daniel just one more, excuse me, one more thing on &#x2013; given that Easter is in March, in April we don't have it, as you said you would expect over the coming months the ARPU to recover depending on the &#x2013; if you have seen all of that, yes. But can you give us a sense already of April, how that's coming, that will be great? And still on &#x2013; another question on the buyback with cash effect of shareholders, if you return the excess cash to shareholders, you would get to 0.6 to 0.7 times net debt should be down. But as far as I remember from previous conference calls that you mentioned keeping it around one time, just wonder if your excess cash means 0.6 to 0.7 times or it means getting it closer to one time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mauricio, in terms of the promotions, well let me only give you a figure, in the February, our revenues grow 13.1%, we don't have any vacations, nothing, March, our revenue grow only 5.8% because we have the Easter vacation on March. So that's more or less where you can see how those have effects to our ARPU this year. But I think gradually &#x2013; gradually I think the ARPU is going to recover; I don't know if it's going to be in the next quarter, it depends a lot on the market, on the competition, on the crisis and what I can tell you is that we decide that it's not something that we already give to the market and it's done forever. Now we decide what promotions we do and how aggressive we want to be.</p>
          <p>So we feel that today Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is in a very good position. They are impacting &#x2013; we are impacting for the long-term, we are impacting for the next year and we cannot decide on one quarter or two quarters, the way Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is operating, so I think we are doing the right things for the long-term of the company and as we said, there is five or six or seven years ago, when some people does not like what we were doing well, they give us very good regards &#x2013; give us very good things at the end of that period and I think what we are doing today and the way we are marketing and moving on the markets, it's going to help us in the future, so we think and I as the CO of the company cannot make the decisions for the short term, I think we need to make the decisions on the long term and Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is doing the right things for the long term of the company. And I don't know if Carlos wants to talk a little bit about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well about the capital structure of &#x2013; we compared in the past margin we have never felt comfortable going beyond one but we have never stayed much below one either, no so, I am not know at exactly what time we would be looking at the company but if we don't do any &#x2013; I mean there will have to be some re-levering because the 0.67 times EBITDA that we have today is going to keep on falling on a last 12 months EBITDA basis throughout the year, so there has to be some kind of re-levering of the company and the proceeds of that will also be available for distributions to the shareholder.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of extra questions on the revenue side, I think we've got on a lot of good detail, if you looked back at the promotions versus interconnect versus the vacation and Easter holiday. How would you rank all of those as far as 1, 2, 3 as far as the effect on revenues in the quarters as far as which had the larger effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; between vacation I think it's number one. I'm very close to that promotions is number two. I think that's the way I will rank these things, and interconnection would be number three. But the numbers that we gave you, in Mexico we reduced 9.6% quarter-to-quarter on price and did more growth like 3.7, almost 4. So in two to three months we are half of the growth done. So I think that gradually you are going to see that recover of the ARPUs, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how fast. I don't know if it's in the next quarter or in the next one, but gradually you are going to see a recover as to there, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the vacation and the Easter effect, do you think it's really reduced usage then and that might have slowed down the elasticity, that people just went on a long holiday and didn't use the phones? Is that the kind of the thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have found that people that go to the beach, usually <mark type="inaudible" /> phone on the beach than when ride into Mexico City in the car.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to touch a different issue that hasn't been talked yet, on the economy &#x2013; obviously in the U.S. we're seeing some sluggishness here, some signs of recovery, but still sluggish. What have you seen in Mexico as far as any effect from the U.S. economy or just the general Mexican economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think this is important, we haven't really felt anything <mark type="inaudible" /> impact. What we have seen in terms of economic statistics here of Mexico have being better than what has been expected. We have seen a big pickup of economic activity in Mexico contrary to what again most people were expecting. So we really haven't felt ourselves like there is any need to change basically our view of how we should be doing throughout the year, based on the market circumstances. And as I said at the beginning of the call, whereas the revenue differences with the market seems to have been more on the base that people, analysts underestimated the impact of the vacation, the <mark type="inaudible" /> March, in our case within Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, we are very much <mark type="inaudible" /> with our budget. So we did factor in the effects of these vacations, and we have not felt any need to change our own budget ourselves.</p>

          <p>Good morning. This is Ramos of GBM. I have two questions. First, I wanted to know how much impact you're expecting in your costs in Argentina, as a result of the launch of the Claro brand. If you could give, what you expect, in terms of EBITDA margin, for single Claro that would be great. And secondly, you recorded 1.7 billion in extraordinary financial expenses, and I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on these so we can &#x2013; to see what we can expect going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Argentina, I think we already booked part of that launch, in this quarter and maybe the other part, is going to be in the second quarter, but that's what we do &#x2013; I don't expect because of that to have a difference on the EBITDA margins for the second quarter of this year. So we do a lot through January to March, April, and some of the costs are already booked. So Carlos is going to explain to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There it has more to do with inter-company transactions whereby partly funding &#x2013; that is part of the funds that are located in subsidiaries and are being launched from Mexico. And what has happened is that already we don't hedge those transactions because that is related to the company. We don't really take an economic vis-&#xE0;-vis the market, but what has happened is that in some cases, in some countries, exchange rates appreciated notably in the first quarter. And that means that some of the countries have had to register the equivalent of FX losses, but that base is really more noise than anything else, it is not an economic impact vis-&#xE0;-vis the market.</p>

          <p>In Mexico, I think we have another 10% reduction in the next January and another 10% reduction in 2010. I think it's what we already have signed with all the competitors, now it's what we have for the next two years. In the other countries that we don't have anything signed for the future and, we don't have that there already. We negotiate every year. Or every two years, what's going to be their inter connection business.</p>

          <p>Yes, Anthony Durant of Vanguard, just looking you have approximately 6.22% of your portfolio in the U.S. Do you, with the weakness in the U.S. dollar and your strong cash flow position do you look too possibly expand further into the U.S. possibly with a joint venture or purchase, Sprint perhaps or somebody else?</p>

          <p>No, what I can tell you about the U.S. is that TracFone is doing good. Our EBITDA is doing excellent. We have been growing our EBITDA a lot from the last quarter and we are happy.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this Andre Baggio from JPMorgan. First question, I would like to know is on these promotions. I would like to know how much of these promotions are under your control and how much for the promotions are a response to the effects of Telefonica promotions in the markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think all our promotions is under our control, and sometimes everything is under our control. We decide what promotions we want to do, and we make the studies before they make any promotion &#x2013; how much they are going to hit you in revenue, how much they are going to give you on new subscribers on our retention or fidelity. So the promotions always being studied and all the promotions are under our control, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, can you say that you are attracting new subscribers with promotions? Can you say that there's a negative effect on ARPU just because you're adding new subscribers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we have led the market in price reduction, so we want that we have been reducing the prices in the market. I think it's good for our customers; it's good for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. We have been doing that in all the other countries; it's not only in Mexico. And that's the way we operate. So it's not only a reaction. It's promotions and sometimes fidelity, sometimes because churn, sometimes &#x2013; there's a lot of things that we could do there, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But <mark type="inaudible" /> I just want to point out that in Mexico today first quarter our average revenue per minute for both is actually <mark type="inaudible" /> It's 84 peso cents, okay? So that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>7.8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...7.8 or thereabouts. That would be probably about &#x2013; Colombia will be in &#x2013; compared to, for instance, what you would have in the markets in Brazil today, that would be in the neighborhood of &#x2013; it's much higher than that, no? So what you have is that, yes, there is this competition in our market. We have strong competition in Mexico, and we have strong competition in Brazil. But in Mexico we have taken a path, so we have been able to reduce prices faster because we have seen very good elasticity of demand in the market. And that's why we have led the market in price reduction downwards, as Daniel was explaining. But you should take a look at an average revenue per minute in the different countries and you will see that now Mexico is really almost the lowest and it's not because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the most competitive not only in Latin America, all around the world. So I think elasticity has been very good for us in Mexico, and that's why we're driving the prices down in Mexico. And if we saw that in other countries we want or we need to do that, we're going to do it, no? I think that's good also for the company, the customer support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a final comment, a question. Is it a very good margin in Brazil? It's at 29%. Currently we have a flexible guidance of ten; we'll have just a 23% of EBITDA margin for the year. Can you explain a bit better why do you think that showed such a better performance of Claro in Brazil versus, what the competitors are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you study the competitors, so you can tell us better why &#x2013; what are the difference. I think we have a very good cost structure in Brazil, and that's the reason and the reason why we are having as a better margin than the other ones, no? And &#x2013; I think that's cost because we are growing more or less that same. And especially in Brazil we need to review exactly what the growth in the market because I think in to some of this &#x2013; we have been very careful that all our new subscribers are bringing revenues in Brazil and all around Latin America. And I think some of the &#x2013; some of the customers in Brazil are not going to bring these good revenues in the future. Now the market has been grow 100% year-to-year in Brazil and I don't think that is specifically. So I think you need to take a look very close in Brazil of what is happening now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Darphil Associates. In answer to Vera's question, you mentioned that if you didn't have 3G, the cost of service would be less. Were you implying that your EBITDA margins would have been up from last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we'd be more or less the same as from last year. I think if we don't have 3G, we won't have some extra cost and our EBITDA margin would be a little bit less, a little bit high, we don't have exactly the number because it's very difficult to know exactly what is in the cost on the network on 3G, but as we said always, it's I'm happy and I said that one year ago about 50% EBITDA margin in Mexico, I think, it's, we are okay with that, and we feel that both these year it's going to be above 50, I don't know how much above 50 but to be above 50 would be very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if can just ask and you may not be able to answer this, or you may not want to answer it &#x2013; when would you hope that for your company, the EBITDA margin would start expanding again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is when the growth will just stop, when we stop growing, I think the EBITDA margin would grow higher. So I think that in the future, as we get less subscribers, then our EBITDA would go up okay. But I think still we'll have in the next year, a lot of the subscribing will still in some countries have low penetration, and in the other side we have an extra revenue on the 3G handsets with different services. So I still think that we're going to have revenues growth on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil for the next years now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Daniel, Carlos and Daniela, this is Rodrigo Ortega from BBVA. I was wondering I you could just follow up on the migration to 3G services and if you can give us a sense of how many users you already have running or not in this new network, and what share of your gross ads are going to these kind of services?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very well, and that question will come from the line of James Ratzer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you sir. It's James Ratzer from New Street Research. The first question I had was just regarding the calendar effect. You've talked quite a bit about this on the call, you said it's in line with your own internal budgets. I was wondering then for the benefit of the analyst community if you could quantify please what the impact on overall revenue growth has been in the quarter from the change in the holiday season.</p>
          <p>And you also haven't mentioned the fact that 2008 was a leap year so you had a whole extra day in which you can build customers. So to what extent does that also alter the rate of growth for the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And second question I had was, if we look around the world at the moment there's just been quite a lot of other talk in the last few weeks about consolidation whether it's in Europe, and there's a story today about Bharti in India looking to being interested in MTN in South Africa and if organic growth does continue to slow in Latin America, what would be your interest in expanding outside of the Americas region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on expanding, we're always open to see opportunities. Still we are not having anything today, we are not discussing on any opportunity today, but we are open to see opportunities. We have always have been disciplined on all the things we do, on terms of buying companies or going to other countries, and it has to be more or less on the same way we have been doing all the other ones. That's something that we are going to maintain the way we have been doing that.</p>
          <p>And well we have been again talking a lot about ARPUs, service revenues, MOUs and, the only thing that I want to comment is that we have been doing those promotions because we feel that the elasticity in Mexico is still there and that it's going to have a return on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, these promotions. So we feel comfortable, we decide on those promotions and I think for the future it's good to, the way we have been doing these type of things.</p>
          <p>We already gave all the numbers, we already gave more or less how much is the holidays, how much is interconnection, how much is promotions and well that's more or less it. Again, I think that gradually we are going to see more or less the recovery of the ARPUs, I don't know how fast, but I think gradually we have that. In the other side we are having customers that maybe at the beginning they are consuming less, the low end subscribers in the prepaid as penetrations goes higher, then you have subscribers that are going to consume a little bit less. But our subscribers that we have today, I think, and I'm sure that the elasticity is coming in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got time for one quick follow-on so I'm just going to ask please what's happening in Chile at the moment, that market in the first quarter seems to have seen a more dramatic slowdown than other markets. How's the outlook in Chile looking for rest of the year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, in Chile, what's happening in Chile? Last quarter, we take, we clean up our base. We have some of our, some of the customers during the last year that we take them but they are not paying, so we have to clean the base, and to clean this type of customers. So I think we are starting in Chile this year with better customers, better revenues, good revenues, and that's the way you are going to see the improvement in Chile for the next months.</p>
