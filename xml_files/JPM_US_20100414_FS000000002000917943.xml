        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2010 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call.</p>
          <p>We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Cavanagh. Mr. Cavanagh, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator, and good morning, everybody. It's Mike. We're going to do the usual here, so I'm going to refer to a presentation that's available on our website, so please get that in front of you if you don't already have it and we'll go through that and then take some Q&amp;A at the end. I'll just remind people to look at the slide in the back that makes the comments about forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And so with that, let me just get going on page one and just describe the high level trends and the numbers; so overall, 3.3 billion in net income for the company, earnings per share of $0.74 on a strong revenue number of $28 billion.</p>
          <p>You see this little table here that shows you what I'll call some large significant items. I'm not going through them here because I'll cover all of them when I hit the relevant business where they appear. I'll just say it's in two broad buckets, as you can see from here. One is the adjustments to levels of loan loss or credit costs, loan loss reserves related to credit across the Investment Bank, Retail, and Cards. That's where you will hear those. And then a couple of items of significance in our Corporate segment, both investment portfolio gains as well as some litigation reserves we've put up there, so I'll cover that when we get to Corporate.</p>
          <p>So the themes though are very strong in the Investment Banking results on strong fixed income markets revenue and continued strength in the Investment Banking fee side. Consumer credit trends you're going to hear are all starting to look very good on the delinquency side, and we'll cover that further in the businesses; other businesses performing strongly as a general matter; and the balance sheet and capital position obviously as you'll see continuing to be quite strong.</p>
          <p>I'm going to skip slide two. You can just look at that. It gives you the GAAP picture, what the numbers look like I referred to versus prior periods. Let's start with the businesses and do that with the Investment Bank on page three. So here you see the Investment Bank had net income of $2.5 billion, the circled number there over on the left, on revenues of 8.3 billion. That's an ROE of 25% on the $40 billion of allocated capital we have in the Investment Bank that we just increased at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Going through some of the components, I already made the comment about how our Investment Banking fee number is number one share on a year-to-date basis, $1.4 billion of revenues in the quarter on strong bond underwriting versus prior quarters.</p>
          <p>You'll see a page in the appendix I dropped that gives you a sense for where we are across the various capital raising areas, but continue to feel very good about the Investment Bank corporate finance side of things and the prospects for the rest of the year looking ahead and taking a look at the pipeline.</p>
          <p>On the fixed income and equity markets side, I would just say very strong results; and it's generally speaking across all desks, all areas, $5.5 billion of revenues in fixed income markets and 1.5 billion in equity markets. And so that gets you really to the overall revenues that we have, $8.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The next item that really drives the Investment Banking P&amp;L is credit costs. So here you see we had a relief, an actual benefit, a net benefit in credit costs as reserve takedowns exceeded charge-offs. Charge-offs themselves were offset by credit &#x2013; by reserves because as you know in this business we downgrade and put up reserves in advance of a charge-off event. So for those amount of actual charge-offs in the quarter, there were already reserves covering the P&amp;L, so it's just a line swing there. So the net release really just comes from the fact that we had loan sales that were done inside our marks net of reserves and therefore had excess reserves after we sold those loans; and the same with some loan paydowns that happened as you continue to see the trend in end-of-period loans dramatically changing versus prior periods as large corporates have substantial access to the capital markets.</p>
          <p>So the next point there, I would just say allowance for loan losses at $2.6 billion after the change in reserves against loans is about 5%. It would be about 7% or so had we not consolidated the conduits as part of the FAS 166/167 stuff. So the issue there, moving on then to NPLs, I'd just point out NPLs down from 3.5 to $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>All right, I'll move a little closer to the mic, sorry about that, folks. Hopefully you can hear me now.</p>
          <p>The last point I'll make in the Investment Bank is just on the expense side, $4.8 billion of expenses in the quarter. Two drivers there, 35% comps to revenue ratio; that is just an outcome of the real underlying detailed analysis we do on risk adjusted returns in the business by area comes out to that number. In a strong quarter with $8.3 billion worth of revenue, you'd expect to be at the lower end of the range that we talked about last quarter of 35 to 40%, but that number will bounce around based upon the underlying methodology, and obviously it's a first quarter accrual that will get trued up, and we'll be competitive and do what we need to do over the course of the full year. The other item is some increased litigation reserves, including for us some mortgage related items in the Investment Bank as well. So that's it for the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Retail Financial Services, moving on to slide four, here I'm not going to go through all these drivers. You can look at them for yourself. They generally trend consistent with what we've seen before, good growth in the Retail Banking side. But what I do want to point out, we sent out an 8-K last week to just give you the new segmentation after Charlie's Investor Day presentation telling you how we were going to do, attempt to get a better, cleaner view of what the mortgage banking origination side and auto and student lending, consumer lending businesses would look like without the noise of the real estate portfolios, which have obviously been suffering and will continue to. So that's really what we've done in the middle box is separate out and you'll see it on the next profit and loss page, the same dynamic.</p>
          <p>At the bottom, real estate portfolios; it's the totality of the home equity lending business on balance sheets as well as the mortgage balances, whether it is Chase originated or WaMu originated, and those are the dynamics rolling through there. What you see in the middle is the mortgage origination side, production revenue, MSR risk management, warehouse and so forth, as well as the auto business, primarily is the big one away from mortgage.</p>
          <p>So moving on to the next page, which just tells you what happened on the P&amp;L for the quarter in Retail Banking, you see net income was a $131 million loss up on the upper left there. And again, it's a tale of two cities. So taking piece by piece, you see about $900 million worth of profits in Retail Banking, up a little bit year over year, down a little bit quarter over quarter. A couple less days on net interest income versus last quarter is the decline there; and then behaviors as well as some of our changes in number of items bringing down quarter over quarter some of the NSF OD fees in this quarter versus the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Mortgage Banking, the only thing I'll really point out is in the revenue side. When you look at the big comparison versus a year ago, I'll just remind you that we made about $1 billion, which was an extraordinary positive on MSR risk management a year ago, but slightly positive this year, and that's the big swing factor in revenues year over year. We continue to have embedded in those revenue numbers elevated levels of repurchase contra-revenues there. Stable is what we had in the past couple of quarters, about $400 million worth or so of repurchase reserve expense.</p>
          <p>Finally on the real estate side, you see the bottom line, a $1.3 billion loss net of the continued high level of credit costs, but as well a $1.3 billion &#x2013; a $1.2 billion adjustment to loan loss reserves for the WaMu credit impaired portfolios.</p>
          <p>Let me drill into credit trends here for Home Lending on page six. So I'll point you now to &#x2013; there is a page, page 15 in our appendix, which shows you the delinquency trends across all the major portfolios on the consumer side, including these portfolios in credit card. And what you will see in all of those is improvements in early bucket delinquencies, so we do see that. We'll talk about it more when we get to credit cards. So that backdrop is favorable for where we may go from here.</p>
          <p>But in the quarter itself, you'll see &#x2013; I'm just there looking at the left of the page, balances continue to come down versus prior year in these portfolios. We're not originating at these levels obviously that we've talked before, so balances continue to come down. Charge-offs stabilizing a little lower than what it was last quarter. And given what I just said about the early bucket delinquency trends improving somewhat, we are hopeful that we may see some improvement in these numbers such that we don't achieve the prior outlook, which continues to be printed on the right side of the page. We're not yet ready to lower those numbers, but we'll just say that that's what we said before. We're seeing some positive trends; and hopefully in another couple of months we can report some improvements on actual trajectory of charge-offs on the back of the improved delinquency trends. I'm just not ready to do that yet.</p>
          <p>When it comes down at the bottom right to just the WaMu credit impaired portfolios, as you know, we have to do life-of-loan reserving here. And so all I would say here is we're not seeing the pace of improvements in the WaMu portfolios, particularly on the prime side, whether it's prime mortgage or prime Option ARM that we're seeing in the rest of the Chase portfolios on average due to concentrations in FICO score, lower FICO scores and geographies. And that slowdown &#x2013; that slower pace of improvement when you roll it through lifetime loss expectations and some of the other inputs yields a true-up of the lifetime loan loss expectations that we have to reserve for that, so that's a $1.2 billion reserve addition in aggregate for WaMu credit impaired.</p>
          <p>So moving on to Credit Card on slide seven, fee net income of a $300 million loss; the big story is credit. Let me talk about charge-offs first. So you'll see on the Chase over on the left side down towards the bottom, you see the 10.54% net charge-off ratio. That's excluding WaMu, which is the way we talk about it. As you know, we had a benefit due to a payment holiday done early last year, which is about a 60 basis point negative impact versus the same benefit last quarter; so on a normalized basis, right around a 10% plus or minus charge-off ratio. I'll say it now because it comes on the outlook page that we see that normalize to 10%-ish type of charge-off ratio in the next quarter, trending more towards 9.5% plus or minus. And if these delinquency trends that you'll see in the back appendix continue, hopefully we get improvement further from there in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So on the back of all of that, we've had a lowering of our loan loss allowance by about $1 billion in the credit card business on the back of everything I just described.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rest of the P&amp;L, you see revenues affected by the decline in outstandings, which is a large part driven by seasonal effects versus last quarter as well as rundown of WaMu portfolios, and sales volumes seasonally down versus last quarter as well affecting revenues. Otherwise I feel good about the underlying health of the business and the progress we're making there. And so that is the main drivers of what's going on in Credit Card for the loss this quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to Commercial Banking, slide eight; so Commercial Banking made $400 million worth of revenue, not really a lot different about the story here than what we've talked about before, so let me cover it briskly here. But I'd say one thing to point out is continued slower pace of but continued reduction in level of loans and leases, $97 billion in the quarter, down from 100 billion last quarter. So while businesses feel to us to be adjusted and poised to grow when they get orders in and have need to do it, they aren't yet at that point. We're seeing that more in small business. I didn't cover that more on the retail page, but we did see some pickup in small business demand and lending there, about 2 billion of originations in the quarter; that's in retail. Here you have yet to see that effect, but we're hopeful that that could be coming shortly.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the revenue effects of the balance sheet, you see liability balances, cash, deposits that left with us, up from a year ago at 133 billion and up a little bit from last quarter at 122. So that together with continued good performance on the fee side in revenues, Treasury Services products, and Investment Banking fees which continue to be strong, get you to about flattish revenue quarter over quarter and year over year.</p>
          <p>Credit side, improvement from last quarter, with credit costs in total of 214 million. Largely 75% of the credit costs coming from real estate related portfolios, which as you know, were underweighted in on a relative basis. And so nonetheless, we end the quarter with north of 3% allowance to loan loss reserves against a 96 basis point charge-off rate in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Treasury &amp; Securities Services on slide nine, again I'll just point to &#x2013; we'll start with net income, 279 million, up a little bit from last quarter. But just covering the revenue side, so you see in Worldwide Securities Services, the securities side, we're still seeing the negative impact of some declining deposit balances as well as continued narrow and somewhat narrowing spreads on securities lending in the quarter and FX revenues we get off of that business not fully offset by the benefit of higher assets under custody of $15.3 trillion in the quarter. So the same dynamics continue to grind sideways on revenues in that business.</p>
          <p>And then on the Treasury &amp; Securities Services side, 882 million of revenues, you see the average liability balances continuing &#x2013; beginning to stabilize, 250 billion last quarter and 248 this quarter, down from a year ago on the back of flight to quality moving against us after the peaks we saw in late 2008, early 2009. That's flowing through on tighter deposit spreads to the revenue effect there. That's really what explains the P&amp;L in Treasury &amp; Securities Services.</p>
          <p>Last business, Asset Management on page 10, about $400 million in net income, up a lot year over year, down a touch from last quarter; $2.1 billion worth of revenues on $1.2 trillion in assets under management. I'd say just to remember that versus a year ago, revenues up given the effect of higher assets under management there on higher market levels. And versus last quarter the decline is really just driven by the absence of performance fees which are billed largely as a seasonal event in the fourth quarter. So the health of the business looks good here. We have seen some decline in flows as client activity is putting money back to work out of liquidity products primarily. But away from that, we've actually seen growth in assets under management and flows in products away from liquidity products, which we think is a good sign of health of the business.</p>
          <p>Lastly, corporate in P&amp;L impact terms, you see total corporate. We had a little bit of private equity gains, revenues of 136 million, which translates into $55 million worth of net income. And then in corporate, which is everything else, we have $173 million of profit, so I'll just hit on the three items that you see described on the right in the bullets.</p>
          <p>So again, we had another quarter where we had strong gains. We don't usually count on gains or guide for gains, but we had gains of $1 billion related to repositioning the corporate investment portfolio and some trading activity that happens there, so that's $1 billion positive just to call out and understand that's a significant item to the positive. We may still have another quarter &#x2013; we can always have quarters that have some effect on that line. We may have that again in the second quarter, maybe not to this magnitude, as we continue to focus on how we want the investment portfolio positioned.</p>
          <p>The second point is that we continue to benefit though running a large investment portfolio. The net interest income coming off the investment portfolio continues to run at a higher level than what I would call normalized. And those two effects are the reason why on the outlook slide, this number for corporate, I have us guiding you lower on that as we get towards the end of the year to a number more like $300 million plus or minus.</p>
          <p>One other noisy item in the quarter, I'm just not going to get into a lot of details on it, but if you think about it, you see we added $2.3 billion to litigation reserves in corporate for the firm, largely related to mortgage related matters. So think about that as we have repurchase reserves that we've talked about related to the GSEs as an ongoing expense we've been reserving for. This relates to the broader question of all other ideas for claims against us from private investors and others related to whether it is good portion WaMu related. We just put a lot of energy; we're not unique in having exposures here. We've talked about these potential exposures before, but just we put a lot of energy into coming up with an estimate to put a marker down in our results, and so that's all on that item.</p>
          <p>Capital on slide 12, you see we had 11.5% Tier 1 capital ratio and 9.1% Tier 1 common. I'd just remind people you see the bullet below that table that we did adopt FAS 166/167, bringing variable interest entities on balance sheet. The real effect was about $88 billion worth of GAAP assets, very little risk weighted assets or de minimis risk weighted assets as we largely had that covered in our risk weightings before. But one real material effect was the fact that through our actual GAAP equity we had to put up loan loss reserves for the credit card receivables that came on balance sheet; so that was about $7 billion of reserves pre-tax, about a $4.5 billion decline that just went to the equity account negatively impacting capital. But nonetheless, you see the ratios are very strong, and we end the quarter with $39 billion worth of total credit reserves, a ratio of nearly 6%.</p>
          <p>So finally on the outlook slide, I think I really covered this. Let me just pick through everything that you see on the retail side is as it was before. As I said, we're not necessarily reaffirming this guidance. Hopefully it could be better, but we're not ready to change these numbers. We do see delinquency trends looking positive, but we have to wait for that to really pull through and more to come in future quarters.</p>
          <p>Card Services side, I've covered all this; again, no real changes from what we said before, but for the lowering of the charge-off estimate on the Chase portfolio to down from what we experienced this quarter by about 50 basis points looking into the second quarter with the likelihood of some improvement from there in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Corporate, I already talked about the $300 million plus or minus number that you could expect to see as we get toward the back end of the year. I'll just remind people that to the extent that there is a bonus tax imposed in the UK, we could &#x2013; we expect that to be a second quarter accounting event.</p>
          <p>And so with that, that is the quarter and that is our outlook. I'll just remind you we've got a couple slides here after this that I won't go through that just cover a few of the items I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>So with that, we can just open it up to questions, operator.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>

          <p>Hi, Glenn.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just top down, if revenues are a little better, very market related, expenses are a little higher as comp normalizes, and credit moving in the right direction but trending directionally with the economy, when you look at the revenue front, you alluded to it a little bit in your prepared remarks. But can we drill down and try to say where are the leading indicators for revenue growth but there's clearly &#x2013; there's potentially a bank fee? There's clearly a bunch of revenue headwinds related to the regulatory changes. Can we parse out where there are some leading indicators for revenue growth or is that kind of waits on the economy as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, this is Jamie. Just real quickly, let's all not call it a bank fee and call it what it is, which is a punitive bank tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you heard me cover some of the items, Glenn. You hit on some of the businesses that are market sensitive. But clearly you look at the market sensitive results and you've got to feel good about the franchise we've got here. So if the market opportunities present themselves and we're serving our clients, then those businesses can do well. We think secular trends there over the long term are good. Obviously it's too early to call what kind of regulatory impact there could be in any of these businesses and how business models react. But we're not worried about our ability to compete and do well in the market side businesses.</p>
          <p>On the lending side businesses, you clearly have the dynamics of portfolios running off affecting revenues. Away from that though, again I think you see it in the noise in some of the numbers quarter over quarter. But I think we're positioned to keep building the businesses, taking market share, and growing. So the story I would say is, as you heard at Investor Day, investing for growth in all these businesses: more bankers, more branches, better products, California, and the Commercial Bank; so that's what I would point you to. But secular, I guess overlying trends of asset rundown and potential for regulatory impacts, yes, we'll have to deal with those, but we understand that and it's &#x2013; we'll do fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On that point, the things you've noted and others in the outlook related to whether the overdraft policy changes, the anticipation of impact on Card, how much of the fee hit are in the run rate or just on the come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'd say in the first half of the year you'll have a lot of the impacts on the Card side will be in the run rate. We're still waiting for a few pieces of Card Act legislation to really be finalized, which won't happen until June, reasonable and proportionate fees. But away from that, we are going to have it in our run rate shortly.</p>
          <p>Retail, we have a partial impact of some of the actions we took on overdraft fees, reducing number of items in this quarter is already in the run rate. There are changes in customer behaviors anyway, lowering overdraft fees in the quarter. And so the rest of those effects won't come in until the latter part of the year when all the changes go in, third quarter I guess. So by the end of the year, you'd probably see those effects.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last quickie. FICC [Fixed Income Clearing Corporation], you've been &#x2013; first of all, performance is great and off the charts. And you mentioned it's across products, it's across regions. Interesting because VaR [Value at Risk] is down and you have been signaling competition is healing. You also signaled I thought that ask spreads were narrowing, was volume and volatility that strong that it carried the day to more competition and lower VaR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jamie. Number one is VaR is just a measure, an inadequate measure of most things, okay. And remember you're dropping very volatile trading months from a year ago and adding very benign trading months now to VaR, and that's a huge reason why VaR dropped so much. And it's not just volatility. First of all, people did a great job. It's great; spreads are back to where they were. So think of it as they almost normalized, and that's fine, but a lot of client flow, a lot of volume, and good trading around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

          <p>Hi, Mike. I was wondering on the repurchase reserve, any color on what drove the improvement in the rep and warranty expense this quarter? Did the GSEs, do we know if they've hit their peak vintages and if they've at full capacity in their put-back activities now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that number is just going to bounce around a little bit. Put-back levels were about similar to what they were in the past couple of quarters, and no insights into vintage burnout or anything like that yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the NSF OD impact, can you give any color on the assumptions that are incorporated into your estimate of the $500 million hit? And is it too early to have confidence in that? Is that really a guess on your part or do you have some confidence in that hit or is it too early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's better than just a guess. We did work on it when we did it, but it was an early estimate, so let's leave it at that. I mean we need to see how everything evolves from here, but it was a reasonable estimate when we did it. We need to wait and see how it actually pulls through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So far we think the more consumer friendly thing is to fairly offer the consumer an option, not to push it in marketing, but to very fairly say you have this option or that option. That still is our intent. BofA remember, we'll offer that at the ATM for cash, and they'll notify the customer, so we want to treat the customer very fairly. We think offering them an option probably is something they prefer. They always can turn it down.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one quick thing on the SOP 3 portfolio, the credit impaired. Mike, other companies are showing gains to their NIM and NII from purchase accounting accretion which seems to be related to the repricing on deposits better than they had marked, in some cases cash flows on the impaired loans coming in better. Do you have that dynamic going on too and just don't talk about it, or is it just different for you because you had different assumptions in your marks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it is two things. One, it depends on when you did your initial marks and where rate levels were. So there is one effect of just actual market level, market driven assumptions because that's how you did things. And two is we may have that dynamic over time. Remember we do the SOP 3-3 evaluation at sub-portfolios, so we've been focused on our prime Option ARM and prime mortgage portfolios. Other ones have been behaving okay, and if the day comes when we have a view that they'll come in below lifetime loss expectations, we may have an adjustment to make, but that would be down the road.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more of an update on what you're seeing with loan modifications as they affect both first and second mortgages and how that does or doesn't inform the change in your tone if not your guidance where you're saying that if trends continue, then loan losses on home equity prime and subprime might not get to those guidance levels. To what extent are modifications affecting that thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer the first question? If you look at HAMP [Home Affordable Mortgage Program], which is a government program, and I'm looking at it in total, not for JPMorgan, the government was aiming I think for 3 to 4 million mods. We actually think at current ramp rates, take a long time to ramp it up, we'll get to about 2 million on HAMP. That's what we believe, okay? In addition to that, most of the banks do other modifications which are also good for customers, so for us it's more than double of what we're doing in terms of HAMP mods.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage lending categories, all of the indicators, new delinquencies, roll rates, step severity, they are all getting a little bit better, and we think that's good. That trend didn't just &#x2013; it stabilized late last year. January, February, March have been better, so it's early. Those are actual numbers. You're guessing about what future changes might be because of legislation or stuff like that, and we don't know. We're hoping they all get better, and we also think a lot of that will be driven by the economy, not by anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But to the extent that a lot of people think that if you're significantly modifying principal on even firsts that that's going to have a negative impact on seconds and the like. Are you factoring that thought process into the fact that you're saying that we might still end up with loss rates below the prior guidance levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, based on the way we see it now, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. And then if I could just ask a little bit more detail on the 2.3 billion build in that litigation reserve, can you help us understand better the distinctions between the funds that are available there and what you're doing in the Investment Bank, where you also alluded to building some litigation reserve there? And I'm not sure I understood the distinction that I think you were trying to make between what's available for the GSE reps and warranties issues and what this might be for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me make this simple, okay? In the Investment Bank, retail and corporate, we have put up rep and warranty reserves and litigation reserves for GSEs and all other mortgages including private securities. We've tried to do it diligently. Some of those numbers ramped into the Investment Bank this quarter. We've broken out the numbers in Retail and we put the numbers in Corporate. A lot of the numbers in Corporate relate to WaMu. We are not going to give any other information. We think we are properly accrued for reps and warranties, whether they come through on the rep and warranty line or the litigation line. There are legitimate claims that some of the mortgages weren't properly done. It's going to be done mortgage by mortgage. Other than that, we think we've done a pretty good job recognizing the problem early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that, and then I have just one more question which relates to the Investment Bank. I noticed that assets basically didn't increase or only a very small amount. And yet your revenues, in particular in FICC, were obviously extremely strong. Is there some color you can give us on increases that you're seeing in turnover rate of average positions or something like that or are you just turning the balance sheet very, very quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's hard to answer the question. There is plenty of client buy-in. I don't know the turnover rates offhand, and you might see the balance sheet go up a little bit over time from here.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I have a couple questions on credit and capital. If the US economy gets no worse, is it safe to assume that you guys are done adding to reserves on a consolidated basis for the remainder of this credit cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, your assumptions about what the future holds are as good as ours. Credit card, what we look at today, remember we have real visibility only really into next quarter. Those reserves could be coming down over time.</p>
          <p>Mortgage, the numbers are starting to look hopeful, though there's so much uncertainty around mortgage that I want to see it myself before you actually start taking it down. The real question for mortgage to me is how long the high losses last. That's the real question for me in mortgage, not just the reserve number because there are huge losses running through our books today.</p>
          <p>I think in Commercial and I put all the wholesale in this, Investment Banking and middle market, it looks like underlying credit trends are getting better, including the reduction in non-performers, a repair of non-performers, and the financial stability of companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on just the mortgage piece, there is this recent HAMP out on earned principal forgiveness. Could you give us your sense of how you're going to approach this new HAMP modification program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working on that now and we're not ideologically opposed to principal forgiveness. The issue with that is it's got to be done loan by loan to be fair. There is no other way to do it that's proper and fair both to the mortgage and to the bank. And I don't want to double-count it because remember if you do principal forgiveness, it's not that different than reducing payments for five years. So you can double-count it a little bit, but if we change our programs and we add some additional principal to the forgiven principal, it might change some of those loss rates going forward, but we don't know that for sure, but it might. Remember, we already have a lot of reserves up for this stuff, high losses running through. Underlying trends are getting a little better.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us some sense as to how you think about the capital that you've got right now, core Tier 1 9.1%? At what point do you feel you're able to start managing capital either with dividend or buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've been very clear on the dividend. We want to see real underlying employment growth for at least several months. We'd like to see &#x2013; that's number one. Number two, we'd like to see real and sustained improvements in delinquencies and charge-offs in mortgages, and that's not just one month. We'd like to see it continue for a while.</p>
          <p>And number three, I think we pointed out as have other banks there's a lot of capital uncertainty. There's uncertainty around Basel II rules, Basel III rules, dividend tax rules, bonus tax rules, and we'd like to see that clear up before we start using our capital. That number will probably continue to go up over time. We want to make sure that we are always, always properly capitalized and this company is never questioned. If you end up with excess capital, you haven't thrown it away. You just get to use it later.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. There's just a question as you're in the same position &#x2013; could you potentially be in the same position that you are now with Card where your reserves are very high relative to your forward look on losses, so could you end up in a position where you've got significant amounts of capital and you're not able to deploy it as quickly as you would like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about net job creation. That is the really important thing, getting more people back to work. The other number has a lot of other calculations in it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what I mean by real job creation is that we really believe we've got a sustained recovery. That to me is a couple hundred thousand jobs being added for several months in a row.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you about &#x2013; the issues of mortgage modifications have been well covered. I'm more curious about the credit card modifications because there are no guidelines, government guidelines to follow with those, and what your outlook is in terms of how much free capital is freed up by those, by actually the mortgage modifications, or if the credit card modifications are what's the main driver in improvement in early stage delinquencies, or is there something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no credit card modification programs any different today than they were way back. And remember, by the end of the last two years, we've written off close to 20% of the portfolio. You would expect in an economic recovery or even stability that delinquencies and charges would come down and in fact they are because we've written off a lot of the bad stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that, but I'm just looking at what you guys put out, which is your card modifications that doubled from '08 to '09, if that's &#x2013; yes, I would expect that normally, but for the average consumer, things have not gotten materially better, so I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're talking about the things that are in credit work-outs. I think that just tracks charge-offs and bankruptcies and stuff like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is working through the bad stuff, the challenged stuff, so as you see that charge-offs are associated with that, the charge-offs Jamie is talking about, and you're left with a better performing portfolio at the end of that process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be then that the high end is the most resilient with the low end &#x2013; if you could just provide a little bit more color in terms of what specifically you see with credit cards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In credit card across income spans, FICO bands, and vintages, we are seeing improvements in delinquencies and charge-offs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the main driver of that is because obviously employment is not improving just in your estimation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the main driver is the fact that the people who are worst off have already charged off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in prior recessions when unemployment stops going up, you start to see an improvement in those things. That is typical in a recession that the rate of change of unemployment is a bigger driver of credit card delinquencies and losses than simply absolute rates of unemployment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask a big picture question, given that you're getting more confident in the economic recovery and a lot of banks have significantly pulled back on credit; for example, Bank of America is now focused on just the super-prime within credit card, essentially exiting prime and below, it just feels like there is a lot of opportunity to lend as demand comes back to call it middle America and below. And I'm just wondering about how you're thinking about can you capitalize on some of that opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think you see us rolling out credit card new programs all the time, and I think auto loans are up. I think jumbo loans are up just a little bit, but they're up maybe double from a year ago. But we still have, and we broke this out at Investor Day, a large liquidation in the home lending portfolio because people are no longer doing subprime, Alt-A and a bunch of products, and Option ARM, and some of that we acquired from WaMu. That is going to run off, but the other stuff year over year I think you actually may start to see increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the wholesale side of business, there's a lot of commercial real estate that one could argue is going to change hands maybe out of CMBS, out of regionals into potentially banks like yours or that you could be involved in that process. How do you think that's shaking out? Where are we in the process of some of that stuff getting restructured, and can you make some money off that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've seen a lot of real estate stuff getting restructured that has problems, and it's &#x2013; a delay lag is going to happen over the next two years. If there is a proper way to do real estate lending secured with the right developers and that we get some of the upside stuff, we'd be happy to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separately, you've talked about getting positions for rising interest rates, but it seems like you're doing it relatively slowly. To be fair, most banks are adding securities and you're taking them away, but it just seems like it's just a little bit each quarter. Should we interpret that as you aren't too concerned that either short or maybe more importantly the long end is not going to go up meaningfully any time soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way to look at us today is that today we're at a fairly neutral position. So I think the disclosure we make in the 10-K shows for interest rates, the whole curve up 100 basis points. It cost us $300 million. But that's &#x2013; call that a very, very neutral position. So we've already gone from being short funded to neutral, and the question is are we going to change it from there. We don't have to change it at all, but my guess is we will change it, and rising long rates help earnings. Rising short rates hurt earnings. And so when you talk about neutralizing it, if you're going to neutralize one versus the other, it's a little complex. But we like where we are today and over time that portfolio will probably come down. That portfolio is just one measure of interest rate exposure.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm still looking for some clarification. You had 8.3 billion of trading revenues, like 30% of the firm's revenues, and I'm not really sure why the trading revenues were so high at 8.3 billion. I guess some sub-questions would be number one, how much proprietary trading was there. A second part would be how much was in derivatives. And by the way, what does the derivatives legislation do to you guys? And three, how much of that might go away if rates go up on the short end faster than you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first of all, I would say it's very little proprietary when you talk about pure proprietary. It is a lot of client flow, so we're not the only ones who saw that. I think you're going to see other people report similarly good numbers somewhat driven by client flow; and there's good results by our traders. They're on the ball. They're paying attention. Rising rates don't necessarily hurt your trading results. It's not because we're taking a mismatch in trading to see some of that. There is some benefit from the fact that spreads keep on coming in and you have the reverse from last year. Instead of losses in mortgage &#x2013; legacy credit and mortgage positions, you have small gains in those things. And we agree, we believe it was a good quarter for FICC in particular and we're not going to tell you that we expect it to continue like that all year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Back in the old days, you gave some sort of guidance for fixed income trading revenues. So if there were 5.5 billion this quarter, any guess at what a more normal level would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I wouldn't say we ever &#x2013; we always talk about trading as volatile and hard to predict. Obviously we've got an investment in people and balance sheet and infrastructure; so you'd expect &#x2013; you expect results that are positive. This was a strong quarter, no question about it; and so it likely on average runs lower than this level, but I'm not going to give you a number on where.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And legislation on derivatives, could that have a positive, negative, or uncertain impact? What's your thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to have a positive impact. And the devil is in the details here; and when we oversimplify, we're not doing justice to the issue. We do believe that most standardized things will go to a clearing house, and that's fine. That in and of itself doesn't have a huge impact on revenues. Then there is the issue about how much of those and other trades go through an exchange and the transparency. That could or couldn't depend on how it's designed and how much room is left to do &#x2013; have exceptions over the counter or end-user exceptions, and that's not defined yet. So it will be a negative, Mike, and depending on the real detail, it could be several hundred million dollars to a couple billion dollars.</p>

          <p>And then last follow-up, you've addressed the fixed income trading. On the equity side, implied volatility reached a two-year low in March. VIX [Volatility Index] dropped, volume increased only 5%, so why did equity trading do so much better?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess you addressed the derivatives stuff, but I guess a lot of uncertainty also with respect to changes in the securitization process that the SEC voted last week and now maybe are trying to include a 5% risk retention by the sponsor. I just wondered if you could talk about your thoughts about securitization activity going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jamie. First of all, I think in credit card it's going to be virtually gone because the big credit card companies, most of them don't need to do it at all. Some issuers will do it. There's a lot of detail in that 5%, so we're not opposed to the concept of skin in the game. The detail is what tranches, how you do it. I think it will make it smaller, but won't eliminate it. That's my own guess. The real securitization markets that you haven't seen come back yet are the mortgage securitization markets. I think at one point you're going to see that. Five percent will just change what kind of returns you need, what the spreads will be on the total securitization to give the person that has got to own the 5% an equity-like return on what they have to retain since it's permanent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then also I guess another area of uncertainty is that comments were due from the banks for Basel at the end of this week. I know the Fed has encouraged you guys to comment, just maybe your thoughts around that and what you're looking to see change from the original documents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get our comments in. We talked about this a little bit at Investor Day. It's going to be a lot of things out there that the big issues are how all those ideas that are on the table and rightly so, how in the proposal they connect together with each other, the capital side of Basel III, the liquidity side of Basel III, together with everything that's in play today away from Basel III.</p>
          <p>I think the biggest point is to just make it cohesive and thoughtful and take time to evaluate the impact analyses that are going to be underway as well. I won't give you particular &#x2013; there are powerful or potential changes in there that have been well commented on. But our feedback is in and we hope to see a process whereby we get a revised set of proposals toward the end of the year after impact studies are done. But we may not get that, we may just get a final rule. We'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think most people think that some of the things in Basel &#x2013; look, no one is against proper capital liquidity that we need. A lot of the things in Basel III had too much. You can't include agency or MBS as liquid securities. You need &#x2013; 30% of deposits have to be held like there's going to be a run on 30% of your deposits, and you have to base your key goals against that. I think a lot of that is going to get modified appropriately, so the impact of Basel III when it's ultimately rolled out will be substantially less than the impact that you saw on the initial Basel III proposal.</p>
          <p>The other thing which is really important for American banks is that it needs to be consistent globally. That is an important competitive attribute. I think the regulators know that. If you have different countries doing it, it can have a dramatic effect. I also want to point out that Basel III will have a much bigger effect on non-US banks. And so the European banks, they have to look at those numbers and they will have a different reaction to it, and are probably going to want to phase that in over two years to fifty to make up for the dramatic impact on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and then just lastly, Mike, on the slide six home lending update, you talked about stability and improvement in delinquencies in one bullet, In the next bullet, you talk to just the impact of foreclosure moratorium, extended timelines, and OREO [Other Real Estate Owned] and modifications. I guess any sense to quantify the impact in terms of how much delinquencies are being impacted by those factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really the back-end stuff, Jason. It just continues, the back end have elevated levels of delinquency rates. I think 10 &#x2013; 15% is what we said once upon a time, but we haven't freshened that up. But remember, it's not an income statement effect the fact those are getting delayed because we're being very active in making sure that we charge things down and realize economic loss just because of those very delays. Yet it does create some inflation of back-end delinquency rates, which is why we're so focused on those charts, early bucket delinquencies, mid-bucket delinquencies. And then what's going on in the 150-day plus where some of that stuff sits for longer before it gets cycled out is a separate issue that has some distortions in it.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. Just following up on the home equity discussion, it's encouraging that you're hoping and seeing signs perhaps that the losses aren't worse than you expected and could in fact be better. It does seem I guess from the outside a little counterintuitive. Maybe could you expand a little bit on your comments from the Investor Day on the rundown of 60-ish billion of the JPMorgan home equity portfolio? Is there anything that could make you revisit that, some of the expectations for your participation in the mortgage market as we go forward?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess at the end of the Investor Day, Jamie had said that inclusive of WaMu, you had 230 billion of mortgage assets that were likely to run off the books, but over 100 billion of those were JPMorgan assets inclusive of a big chunk of the home equity portfolio. Are you still committed to running down that much of your mortgage assets? Is there anything that might change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really a function of just we're trying to give a sense that those rundowns are real when you consider how much of even the Chase portfolio when you apply current underwriting standards given proven income as opposed to stated income, LTVs that are sensitive to forward home price expectations and lower. All those layered in against a reasonable set of origination levels that would qualify there given where home prices are is what's driving that. If those underlying factors allow us to do more volume at those new lending standards, the numbers could be different, but that's reasonable guess on where we might find ourselves going over many years.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys, a couple things. One, I suppose somewhat simply, how should we be thinking about the tax rate going forward given how it has been low for at least a couple quarters running now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say look back on where we were running, low 30s. We were a little bit lower than that, high 20s this quarter on a reported basis. A little bit of audit settlements in this quarter deflated the ratio. But for that, we would have been around in the low 30s, which is a decent place to see the number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when we look at the home equity loss assumptions within RFS, the sticking with the 1.4 billion outlook versus the 1.1 billion it's running now, how much of that is just conservatism versus are there modification spillovers or something else driving you to be conservative there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's more the fact that it's a little hard right now given the inflection we hope that we're seeing to tune up a better number to give you than to say that's what we last said; hold the thought while we get some more months of experience under us. But given what we're seeing in early buckets, it could be that we don't hit those numbers. That's the best I can give you on that score, just not yet able and ready to give numbers as good as what we had before, but we're just caveating that they're not so solid anymore given some of the early trends.</p>

I mean the Fed continues to keep rates low, but the long end keeps creeping up here and making a run at four. Can you just give me some idea how you look at NIM in a rising rate environment, how you think your core funding is going to trend, whether you expect an extraordinary level of deposit pricing competition, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, this is hard to say because you're talking about something that really relates almost more to competition than anything else. I believe that if you have a rising rate environment, short rates going up 1 or 200 basis points, long rates going up 100 to 200 basis points, but it's because of a healthy economy, everything will be fine. If you have stagflation, rates going up and you don't have a healthy economy, that's probably the worst situation for a bank. In and of itself, it's not the interest rate exposure; it's the other things that are going to drive that including, as you pointed out, competition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any thoughts about what &#x2013; obviously we've been in an extraordinarily liquid environment here, and deposits have been rising as a result. Any thoughts about what we will see in the real core deposit growth or lack thereof as rates start to rise and whether you see any &#x2013; you will see any need this time around because we are coming off such a low rate base to really give consumers more of the rise than you might have otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we talk about interest rate exposures, we already built into that our assumptions about how much rate rises as you pass on to consumers. So we already assumed that and I'd say we're pretty aggressive assuming that you have to pass on quite a bit of it at least early on in an interest rate cycle. And on the consumer side, if you look at consumers, they have a lot of excess cash if you talk to our economists. A lot of that is also money market funds. It's a little bit different in deposit accounts. But we're going to compete for our clients' business like everybody else and we're assuming that it will be competitive going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question I guess for Mike; I'm not sure if you're able to break this down, but we saw the net interest margin expand from 3.02 to 3.32. I'm assuming most of that came from FAS 166/167 as well as probably what went on with trading in the corporate securities portfolio. But is there a way to indicate the portion of that that might have been related to the core lending and deposit business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say it was about stable; no material action in that nor looking ahead would I expect there would necessarily be when you put aside the deliberate stuff we're doing in the investment portfolio or just the outcome of what's going on in the trading businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, the 2.3 billion for the litigation reserve, I know you indicated that you don't want to talk in more detail about that. But should we consider that pretty much a one-time item and at least for now the expectation would be that that would not exist in future quarters?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>It looks fine. I'll repeat a point I made probably before. Pipelines are notoriously bad. Things go away, things come in. In the debt markets there, sometimes the pipeline is not there at all because deals can get done very quickly, but it looks healthy.</p>

Obviously there's some impact on the first quarter. Can you give us some percentages around it? Are we 50% of the way there? Are we 25% of the way there? How should we think about...</p>

Obviously early stage delinquencies in home equity and prime mortgage are coming down or flattening in the case of prime mortgage.

          <p>I noticed that even excluding &#x2013; on your C&amp;I loans that you had an uptick this quarter for the first time in a long time. And I wonder is that even excluding the effect of FAS 167, and is that indicative of customers beginning to play some offense in your opinion?

        <plist>
          <p>Jamie hit it earlier. What's going on in the Investment Bank is access is there. FAS 167 drove the change in that business net of market activity.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. I guess the only thing I was wondering at this point was whether in your caution on home equity charge-offs there is still some risk to higher charge-offs from first mortgages being modified and then the seconds being written off because that still seems to be such a hot button for the legislators and also for investors in first mortgages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would put that in the &#x2013; first of all, we're already doing that a little bit and we're already modifying seconds. Not all seconds have firsts and not all seconds are in trouble and but you've really got to parse through all that. But I would put that as issue of uncertainty out there that remains, yes. We also are doing the 2MP [Second Lien Modification Program] program like most other banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any way of quantifying what the impact of that program and the others might be on the charge-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The devil is in the details of how they're done, not really. Presumably they will be done in a thoughtful way, which as Jamie said, we're already doing a lot of this stuff on a loan-by-loan basis in a way that's appropriate and making changes and adjustments. And in answer to Guy's question earlier, we factor all that into how we think about future charge-offs and therefore reserving. So we have a view;  it's just a question of whether the programs come in with something that's blanket or a less thoughtful approach than we think makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it just seems bizarre in some cases where people have stopped paying on their firsts and still paying on their seconds. It would seem like those types of loans have no value and eventually be written off even if they're current now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That statement, if that were true in some cases and that would be true the way your assumptions are all true, your conclusion would be true.</p>

Yesterday, Kerry Killinger testified before a Congressional committee and essentially said that the only reason WaMu was put out of business was because of, "They didn't belong to the club."

          <p>Thanks. I'm wondering if you could add some color on credit card sales volume trends, up 7% year over year in the Chase card. Any comment on trends intra-quarter? Also, where is the spending being done, what segments, and do you think it's sustainable at these levels or is this just growing off a relatively lower year-over-year comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's definitely the latter, growing off lower year-over-year comps; and as you go back to some of Gordon's Investor Day slides, the more affluent the segment, the earlier and the greater magnitude of sales pickup. I mean we think as it relates to the market broadly, our share of sales is picking up related to all the work that the business is doing with the new products and rewards programs and partners programs we have. And then there is some seasonality obviously when you go from the first versus the fourth figure, a big spending season in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

They're saying you just run it through, but it doesn't &#x2013; people are changing how they price their cards, how they're using cards. And so that much of a static analysis will be what ultimately costs the company three years from now.</p>

          <p>Right, right, actually I just reminded myself one more question. Is what you said about the consumer spending trends, is that what drove the comment that Mike made about small business starting to pick up a bit? I guess small business on the borrowing side is what you implied.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's another good sign. Small business loans are up pretty substantially.</p>

          <p>Our final question will come from the line of Richard Bove with Rockdale Securities.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Consolidation of the VIEs [Variable Interest Entities] raises two questions, I guess. One is concerning your equity account. I understand that you took on more liabilities than assets, and therefore you reduced your equity. But why did you reduce retained earnings? Why did retained earnings go down by 1.4 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really the change was bringing on $88 billion worth of assets, which was largely credit card, Dick, and then you had the major change, the equity account was putting up loan loss reserves related to those card assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and that gets to the second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wait, Dick, if you take a look at the quarter, you've got earnings minus the after-tax effect of that $7 billion of reserves plus OCI plus a whole bunch of other stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of changes in the quarter, but the FAS 166/167 was about 4.5 billion after tax negative to the equity account, all driven really by the credit card side, which was reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can understand why the equity account went down. But the 4.5 billion, I was surprised to see it show up in retained earnings.</p>
          <p>But the other question relates to the allowance for loan losses, the 7.4 billion that was added to reserves. Why didn't that go through the income statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That what the accounting pronouncements were on how to handle 166/167, so that's guidance on how all banks will handle that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that the reason that net charge-offs were higher than the provision as it did go through? In other words, the provision was lower than net charge-offs, and I'm wonder if it's because of the nine...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, independent of that. Charge-offs, I mean the provision less the charge-offs was separately the release of $1 billion of reserve in Credit Card given the improving credit card trends, delinquencies, and roll rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, the charge-offs number shouldn't be used as an indicator let's say in the second or third quarters to what might happen to the provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything you saw in the Card segment about charge-off rate and the guidance we talked about, none of that is affected by 166/167.</p>
