          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and <mark type="inaudible" />, who is now in charge of financial planning and also in charge of Investor Relations as Federico Casillas was promoted to CFO of Banco Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico. Mariana Rodr&#xED;guez and Almudena Sainz are also here.</p>
          <p>The basis for our continuous profitable growth remains in place and they continue improving. Eduardo will go more into the details of our strategies, but I would like to highlight the following.</p>
          <p>First, customer traffic. In a difficult and uncertain economic environment that has affected consumer confidence, we have been able to drive an impressive growth in number of customers. Stronger growth than during the second quarter of the year 2007 and 2006.</p>
          <p>Second, gross margin. We reported improvement in gross margin despite the mix of Wal-Mart, as the volume dips, but has higher margins continued to underperform and despite investment in prices.</p>
          <p>Three, very healthy inventory levels, growing substantially less than sales and in full capacity.</p>
          <p>The biggest challenge in this quarter was expense. <mark type="inaudible" /> will go into the details of the numbers, but I would only mention that every decision and investment made in the quarter was included in our business plan granting no surprises and figures under control. Then we are convinced that this impact in our numbers in the short-term will strengthen our competitive position in the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>Return on equity for the last 12 months to June was 26% while return on capital employed was 28.2%. Now, Eduardo will comment our strategy and execution.</p>

          <p>Rafael, thank you very much and good afternoon to everybody, and welcome for this meeting -- for this conference call. I would like to start by saying that everything that we -- and this is something that I have shared before, what we're doing at Wal-Mart is under the same umbrella and we're basically following three key strategic initiatives that we have. One is profitable growth, the second is talent development, and the third is being a success as we are in the financial field as in the social responsibility field as well.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, we are continuing to be loyal I will say to our core value proposition which is as you all of you know everyday low prices, especially in difficult times like this quarter. As you know, the economic environment is not probably the best that we can have. So we believe that continuing in everyday low-price as the core values our value proposition is very critical for this quarter and the upcoming months.</p>
          <p>It also is important to mention that the quarter went according to our business plan. So basically we planned what we achieve during this quarter since the very beginning of the year, and because probably the economic framework didn't come as soft as we may expect. We expected as a matter of fact that probably economic environment will be tough &#x2013; it was not a surprise for us then that the economic environment was tough. And we have assumed also that the customers, the consumers will be facing an uncertain environment and also we will be very cautioned in our expenses.</p>
          <p>So we decided to go through three main directions. First is to reinforce our price differential which has achieved its stronger level in years. We are very pleased with our price position that we're having right now into the market, because we believe that these will help us in order to deliver our vision as a company, which is, as all of you know to improve the quality of life of the Mexican families.</p>
          <p>Second, we also anticipated the growth &#x2013; basically means that we decided to open more stores than we did in the same semester compared with last year. We opening twice as many stores as we did last year in the same period of time.</p>
          <p>And finally, we need to communicate to our consumers our commitment and determination to continue working for them with a special campaign such as, in the case of Bodega Aurrera, we are celebrating -- we started celebrating the 50 anniversary. With Mamma Lucia, announcing special promotions and thanking our customer for their loyalty. The campaign has been supported by heavy advertising investment in national television, radio, billboards and flyers among other things, because this also have to include in-store signage.</p>
          <p>In Wal-Mart Supercenter also we launched a communication campaign where we are evolving our everyday low prices to a more emotionally charged statement &#x2013; save money and add something to your life. And we believe this is something that we're using in transition in order to be closer to "Save Money. Live Better" which is, as you know, the way that we are communicating this in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Sam's Club also we decided to start the value -- to showing the value of the membership that we have. And we started doing that showing how many times you can pay off the cost of your membership by buying at Sam's and saving for the price of some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>After going through these three strategies, our consumer have demonstrated us and recognized that we are doing the right thing. So far this year customer account in comparable stores grew 5.7%. And if we consider only sort of performance where we are making a strong advertising campaign, customer account grew an impressive 7.3% in comparable stores.</p>
          <p>Throughout the quarter we empowered the company with new talent that we hire, with new promotions and going through continuous training with our associates. <mark type="inaudible" /> joined the company on June 1 as VP for Strategic Planning. <mark type="inaudible" /> came from executive positions in important companies such as <mark type="inaudible" /> and Procter &amp; Gamble. On June 10, <mark type="inaudible" /> joined also Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico as VP of Operation of Supercenter and Superama, and <mark type="inaudible" /> comes from Kellogg with several executive positions in many countries like Mexico, Colombia and South Africa, among others. And also he did worked for a while for Clorox, having responsibility at regional level for Latin America.</p>
          <p>During June, also <mark type="inaudible" /> -- during July I am sorry, <mark type="inaudible" /> also accepted our offer to join us <mark type="inaudible" /> Vice President in Vips and started his job at the beginning of this month. <mark type="inaudible" />  comes for a very important position in recognized companies mainly the <mark type="inaudible" /> restaurant industry. Also during the quarter, we promoted more than <mark type="inaudible" /> 7.8000 (sic) [7,800] associates to higher positions and we trained almost 48,000 associates by completing almost two million hours of training.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the social responsibility field, I would like to comment that I'm also proud of all the recognition we received in the quarter. Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico was recognized as a company with the best corporate governance in Mexico and fourth in Latin America according to the Spanish consulting company, Management and Excellence. This study use similar metrics as the ones used by the Organization <mark type="inaudible" /> of Economic Co-operation and Development, the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, the New York Stock Exchanges -- Exchange, I'm sorry and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It evaluate corporate governance subjects such as board of director responsibility, shareholders' rights, audit committees' guidelines, transparency, among other things.</p>
          <p>Also for the third time in a row, we were certified by the Mexican women's insititute &#x2013; INMUJERES &#x2013; in Mexico for complying with its gender equality model, thus offering the same job opportunity for both men and women. And related to our sustainability initiatives and our social development actions aiming at nutrition, we received the <mark type="inaudible" /> 2008 award given by the Universidad for Social Responsibility, Latin American Center.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, will you give us more detail in the second quarter results <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Yes, Eduardo. Thank you. Sales, as Eduardo and Rafael mentioned, continue to be driven by an increasing number of customers buying at our stores. Total customer growth was 12.2% during the quarter and average ticket remained flat. In terms of comp stores, all self-service formats had increases in number of customers being the greatest Bodega Aurrera and Superama while Suburbia and Vips had declines.</p>
          <p>As of the first half of the year, the total numbers of customer increased 13.3% and average ticket was flat. Gross margin as Rafael mentioned was strong despite the dropping sales of our higher margin businesses, Suburbia and Vips, and despite the investment in prices. This has been driven by strong improvements in inventory management, efficiencies in distribution and shrinkage reductions. Food inflation has been certainly lower in Walmex than food inflation for the country, by confirming that price increases have been lower at Wal-Mart than they were at the market. That confirms again our commitment with our everyday low prices strategy and customer growth tells us customers are valuing that.</p>
          <p>In addition to customer growth, another important sign from the market is that Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico growth is higher than the market growth. Especially when comparing the self-service business at Walmex against the market by deducting Walmex figures.</p>
          <p>Expenses were pressured by the following &#x2013; expansion. We opened this quarter twice as many stores as last year, 35 this year against 17 last year in the same period. The Bank &#x2013; in 2007 the bank was a pre-operative project, while in 2008, it's a business 100% operational. Vips stores &#x2013; the expenses associated with the closing of this business.</p>
          <p>In utilities, the increase in expenses of energy plants, even though we think this expense will reduce in the future. Also a leaner base in expenses as during last year's second quarter, we initiated the cost reduction plan very successfully. And finally, the strong investment in advertising as Eduardo explained.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it's very important to know that all of those investments were considered in our business plan. So we are still on track for achieving our yearly financial objectives.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at some balance sheet items. As of the end of the second quarter of 2008, our cash position amounted to 8.4 billion pesos. This is equivalent to $813 million. During the first half of the year, the company invested 4.4 billion pesos in fixed assets, paid a dividend of 3.2 billion pesos, and repurchased 33.3 million shares for an amount of 1.3 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Regarding inventories, we had an 1.6% increase, which favorably compares with an increase in installed capacity of 12.6% and 12.3% increase in sales for the last 12 months. This impressive improvement in inventory management will allow the company to improve financial income, and as important as that gives the company a very healthy financial position with no liabilities.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable to suppliers decreased 0.8%. This year we had an additional day of suppliers' payment compared to last year. Without this effect, accounts payable to suppliers would have increased 10%.</p>
          <p>Now, Rafael has some additional comments before ending the conference call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would like to comment that we continue with our expansion program. This considers the opening of 205 units during the year of 2008. As of today, we have opened 25 Bodega Aurrera units, five Wal-Mart Supercenters, two Sam's Clubs, four Suburbias and six Restaurants. This makes a total of 42 units.</p>
          <p>Now regarding Banco Wal-Mart, we have opened already 38 <mark type="inaudible" />. That number of branches will remain and we are starting to open a new concept called <mark type="inaudible" />. <mark type="inaudible" /> are a smaller and less expensive point of customer contact and a promotion that provide a more profitable manner of expanding the bank. We are planning to open close to 400 <mark type="inaudible" /> this year.</p>
          <p>With this, we are now ending our conference call and we will be glad to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
