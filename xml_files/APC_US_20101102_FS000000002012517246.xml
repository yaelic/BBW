          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2010 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Veronica, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. John Colglazier. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Veronica. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Anadarko's third quarter 2010 conference call.</p>
          <p>Joining me on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, and other executives who will be available to answer questions later on in the call.</p>
          <p>As we've done in the past, we have posted additional supplemental information in our operations report that's posted on our website. In addition, last night, we also filed our third quarter 10-Q that we would encourage you to review.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I need to remind you that this presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information available at the time; however a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest presentation, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to review the reconciliation slides attached on our release as well as on our website. We encourage you to read the cautionary notes to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, the company delivered strong reported sales volumes of approximately 58 million barrels of oil equivalent, marking the 15th consecutive quarter that our portfolio met or surpassed the guidance that we provided investment community. This third quarter sales number was behind of our guidance and includes the effects of tanker scheduling in Algeria and both planned and unplanned down time in certain onshore and offshore facilities.</p>
          <p>There are several other highlights in the quarter to mention. First, positive results from our ongoing shale development activities in the U.S. onshore enabled us to enhance the net risk captured resources in our Marcellus and Eagleford shale plays.</p>
          <p>Second, our exploration programs continue to deliver additional world-class discoveries. And third, the portfolio generated considerable cash flow during the quarter while we also sucessed to significantly strengthen our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now I'll walk through some of the more significant operational accomplishments during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. onshore drilling activities remain focused on liquids rich opportunities. As a result liquids comprised about 41% of our total third quarter sales volumes. We also continue to drive down operating costs with a 17% improvement in leased operating expenses per BOE year-to-date relative to 2009.</p>
          <p>In the Rockies, sales volumes for the quarter increased by about 10% over the third quarter of 2009 primarily from liquids focused production growth in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes teams set new production records during the quarter. In the liquids rich Wattenberg field we achieved record oil delivery of nearly 30,000 barrels in a 24-hour period, while in Greater Natural Buttes area the team set a daily gross production record of more than 412 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Laramie County, Wyoming, we spud our first operated horizontal well in the oil-focused portion of the Niobrara Play. The completion activity is expected to commence in the next couple of weeks. We've also drilled four vertical test wells in this play.</p>
          <p>We hold about 500,000 gross acres and enjoy very attractive economics due to our ownership of the minerals in perpetuity by virtue of our land grant position. We also completed the acquisition of 160 square miles of 3D seismic here and we expect to increase our activity in the play by adding additional rigs in 2011.</p>
          <p>In the Southern and Appalachia region, our teams increased third quarter sales volumes by about 9% over the third quarter of 2009, led by the Eagleford and Marcellus shale plays. For advancing development in these two shale plays we have better defined the substantial net risk captured resource potential for each asset. We've talked about the Marcellus first where we've now identified estimated net risk capture resources of more than 6 trillion cubic feet.</p>
          <p>We're consistently seeing wells with IPs of better than 7 million cubic feet per day across our entire core position encompassed within 750,000 gross acres in north central Pennsylvania. During the last week of September, the Marcellus team also achieved an all-time weekly production high of 174 million cubic feet per day gross from 46 producing wells. We're expecting a significant increase in the number of producing wells and overall production as we continue to build infrastructure in the field.</p>
          <p>With the recent start of our 200 million cubic feet a day groove and gathering system and pipeline and other expansions, we are expecting to increase takeaway capacity from just under 600 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter and more than 1.15 Bcf per day by the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Shifting to the Maverick Basin in South Texas, our development activity and positive results in the liquids rich Eagleford Shale indicates that this asset holds more than 450 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk captured resources. Additionally in the Eagleford, we have everything in place from gathering to takeaway to processing capacity and water management systems.</p>
          <p>This provides sufficient running room and addresses the infrastructure needs that will enable us to continue growing our production for years to come. We're now producing on an ADH basis more than 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with seven rigs running on our 400,000-acres that are primarily located in Dimmitt and Webb Counties.</p>
          <p>We plan to increase to nine rigs in the first quarter of 2011. With average EURs of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent combined with today's commodity price environment, we're currently realizing robust rates of return of approximately 65%.</p>
          <p>In the Delaware Basin of West Texas, we're advancing two more oil-focused opportunities in the Bone Spring and Avalon Shale where we hold about 550,000 gross acres. We along with our partners are now running seven rigs in the area. In the Bone Spring, we continue to see IPs of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day with natural gas that has a high BTU content and good market access.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing encouraging results from our first two operated Avalon shale wells that are each approaching 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed about eight exploration test wells in the Avalon shale. The substantial net risk resources in our shale plays and the performance of these assets bolsters our confidence in the capability of these onshore U.S. fields, generate significant value and contribute material volumes and reserve growth to our overall portfolio.</p>
          <p>Switching geography, we're getting closer to achieving first oil from the Jubilee field in Ghana, the first of our three sanctioned mega projects. Once this project and the others at Caesar/Tonga and El Merk are complete, we expect these three mega projects to add about 60,000-barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko in 2012.</p>
          <p>At the Jubilee project during the third quarter, the partnership was in the final steps of commissioning the FPSO and also finished about 90% of the subsea work. This project remains on schedule and on budget, and we look forward to first production prior to the end of the year. We surpassed the halfway point in the construction of the El Merk project in Algeria, which remains on schedule and on budget as well.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, our project team has proven nimble in keeping the Caesar/Tonga mega project moving forward during the government mandated deep-water moratorium. During the quarter topside modifications continued and the first riser and flowlines were successfully installed. We expect to advance subsea work including the installation of jumpers and umbilical in the fourth quarter and to achieve first production on schedule by the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>Also, while the moratorium was in place, we continued to advance development planning for both our operated Lucius project and the Shell-operated Vito projects in the Gulf of Mexico. We also advanced projects in the Gulf for which we have permits. These include the Callisto tieback at independence Hub where the pipeline permit was approved and where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the quarter we also received a work over permit at the K2 field. The lifting of the moratorium last month was a positive step for the industry in the Gulf Coast region and though we are ready to safely resume our deepwater exploration and appraisal activity, we along with other deepwater operators must have greater clarity around the regulatory process. We are hopeful the government will soon begin to process and issue the permits that will allow the industry to put people back to work.</p>
          <p>While activity in the Gulf remains limited, we maintain a very active international exploration program throughout the quarter. In West Africa, our partnership announced the third major discovery offshore Ghana at the Owo prospect in the Deepwater Tano Block where we hold an 18% working interest. This discovery is adjacent to the Tweneboa discovery, both of which lie west of the Jubilee field.</p>
          <p>The Owo discovery well and subsequent side tracking encountered a total of more than 225 net feet of high quality oil pay <mark type="inaudible" />. We are excited by the Owo and Tweneboa discoveries and plan to return to the area to continue an active exploration &#x2013; excuse me, active appraisal program once we complete drilling the Mercury well offshore Sierra Leone. Mercury, which spud in early October, is our second deepwater test in the Liberian Basin.</p>
          <p>In Mozambique, we recently announced a world-class natural gas discovery at the Barquentine prospect. The discovery well located about two miles southeast of our previously announced Windjammer discovery encountered more than 416 net feet of natural gas pay. These two successful wells have proven the presence of a large accumulation in this frontier basin. We are currently designing an appraisal program that will enable us to determine the aerial of extent of this new field, and we've begun preliminary evaluations of potential natural gas commercialization options.</p>
          <p>We have mobilized the drill ship approximately 16 miles to the south in the Rovuma Basin to drill the Lagosta prospect which will be followed by an exploration well at <mark type="inaudible" />. Based on the success at Mozambique to date, we anticipate keeping a rig in the basin with an active exploration and appraisal program for the foreseeable future. As operators of Rovuma Basin Offshore Area #1, we hold a 36.5% working interest in approximately 2.6 million acres with more than 50 identified prospects and leads.</p>
          <p>As we announced in yesterday's news release, we encountered 133 net feet of oil and natural gas pay at the Badik Prospect offshore Indonesia. The well is located in 230 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth just under 13,000 feet and is the first significant discovery on the shelf in the Tarakan Basin. We operate Badik with a 35% working interest and are evaluating an appraisal programs in obtaining 3D seismic data on the block.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, drilling is ongoing at the Itaipu prospect where we encountered oil with accompanying logs indicating hydrocarbons in a zone that wasn't one of our primary targets. So we're encouraged by what we have seen so far.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to drill toward both post and pre-salt objectives and expect to have results in coming weeks. We operate Itaipu with a 50% working interest. With the positive results of our worldwide exploration program we remain on track to deliver the 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net discovered resources that we committed to during our March investor conference.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share with certain items affecting comparability that decreased net income by $0.26 per share. Absent these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community, our net income would have been $0.21 per diluted share as reconciled on page seven of last night's earnings release.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand and we also completed a number of actions that have significantly enhanced liquidity. First we entered into a five-year $5 billion undrawn secured revolving credit facility that replaced and upsized our previous $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement which was due to mature in 2013.</p>
          <p>Second, we completed the issuance of $2 billion of 6.375%, seven-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to retire $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2012.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to quarter end we used a portion of the bond proceeds to return additional $422 million of 2011 debt maturities. As a result of these actions we've significantly increased our access to capital while reducing our near-term debt maturities and we have extended our average debt tenure to more than 14 years.</p>
          <p>These actions strengthen the company and further protect the interest of all of our stakeholders by providing ample access to capital and liquidity to deliver upon our strategy.</p>
          <p>As an update to our previous comments regarding the Macondo well, we remain confident in our publicly stated position and therefore in applying accounting guidelines to the facts they are known today, we've not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event.</p>
          <p>As we did in the last quarter we've again included expanded disclosures in our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday and we encourage you to review that document for more information.</p>
          <p>Related to Macondo, early in the past quarter we implemented a one-time supplemental retention program for all non-executive employees for which we recorded a charge of $30 million during the quarter.</p>
          <p>This program is linked directly to our performance goals this year and was implemented to keep our teams focused on delivering results during the perceived uncertainty surrounding the Macondo event.</p>
          <p>We're pleased that this has been effective as turnover is lower now than before the event and we continue to deliver the results we had targeted. Again, this is performance based and retentive.</p>
          <p>Now to summarize my remarks, the performance of our teams and our portfolio was solid and enables us to again raise our full-year guidance. As detailed in the attachments to last night's earnings release, we are increasing our full year sales volume guidance to a range of 233 to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to year-over-year volume growth of 7%. We've also reduced our capital guidance, as we now expect capital expenditures including expense G&amp;G to be in the range of 5.3 billion to $5.5 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Beyond these updates to guidance as I mentioned earlier, we continue to improve our status as one of the lowest cost operators in our peer group with a 17% year-to-date improvement in LOE per unit and we are well positioned to achieve our resource replacement targets -- or reserve replacement targets, excuse me, at a competitive cost of less than $17 per barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>We believe the success of our exploration teams will allow us to meet our commitment to discover more than 400 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resources during 2010 despite the Gulf moratorium.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is in good shape and as we discussed today we've taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity and reduce near term debt maturities. These actions plus the continued performance of the portfolio provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to continue delivering upon our strategic plan and expectations this year and well into the future.</p>
          <p>In the new year, we plan to update you all on our full year results and then at a later date to provide details on our 2011 capital and operating programs. At this point I can tell you that we expect our 2011 volumes to be well within the estimated range we provided at our March 2010 Investor Conference and importantly we expect to keep capital expenditures in line with cash flow based on the current spread.</p>
          <p>Now we will be happy to take your questions so Veronica, if I could turn it back over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Scott Wilmoth from Simmons &amp; Company. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Directionally speaking what level of drilling activity are you guys planning for 2011 versus 2010 on the U.S. onshore and can you quantify any mix shift changes in terms of oil versus gas directed rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, it looks like we'll be up probably in the order of 15, 10 to 15 rigs year-over-year, mostly in association with the Maverick, Bone Springs and Wattenberg programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquids oriented, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All liquids oriented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so do you have subsequent decreases on the gas side or is that all just incremental rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the incremental rigs. So our decreases associated with the gas side are fairly small because we are not drilling any gas prospects right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then can you give us an update on your joint venture process in the Eagleford and if you guys are considering any JVs maybe in the Bone Springs or Niagara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob Gwin. I will speak to the Eagleford. We still expect to do something there but the terms are more important to us than the timing. So we would probably be looking for something either late this year or more likely early next year to be able to announce. On the other fields we're a little earlier in the science on those fields and certainly it's a little too early to tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, can you just briefly talk about maybe the service cost environment, pressure pumping in the different regions, maybe Marcellus, Eagleford, Permian, Rockies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the very active basins like those you just mentioned, there's pressure &#x2013; inflation pressure on particularly pumping services. Most other services are flat to slightly positive on the cost side. It's hard to say whether that will continue as you look forward. What we see is a number of new equipment coming into the market as well as realignment between the gas basins and the oil basins, so how all that equalizes we're uncertain at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that is working in our favor Scott is a fair amount of extra capital being put to the stimulation side which will have a beneficial effect at some point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks guys. That's all I had.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks. Can you provide any more color on the process you've experienced for getting completion permits on Caesar/Tonga, and then maybe remind us of the timeline that you'll need to be &#x2013; that will need to be maintained in order to deliver on those first production expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, we're working with BOEMRE to get our permits. We've gone through all of the certification requirements that are stated now through NTO '05 and '06. We also have completed our BOP certification and are in the final bits of completing our BOP certification for that work.</p>
          <p>We're hopeful that we'll see those permits toward the end of this year, if not in the next couple weeks and will be put to work &#x2013; we'll put the rig back to work early next year, late this year and have that field online as we anticipate prior to mid year '11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Can you comment, sticking in the Gulf of Mexico, any updates on progress around insurance consortiums or industry spill funds or any of those types of tools that might be put in place to offset some of the financial liability exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's an active effort underway with particularly the API and other associations to do just that and all those issues are being addressed, containment, spill response and mutual insurance, and I have every confidence we'll get to good answers on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Then just one last one. There was a comment that Wahoo South well had been drilled in the ops update. Can you provide any additional information on what was found or what might need to still be done out at Wahoo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jo, Bob Daniels. We did drill the Wahoo South well. It was an independent feature south of the Wahoo discovery. You come across this incline back up on a hide. We were kind of on the North flank of a hide that then runs off our block. The well was drilled to the pre-salt objective. We found reservoir but we did not find the hydrocarbons that we'd been expecting and we're trying to incorporate that into our thinking as to, okay, is there a water contact? Are we just down the plank of this structure? But it is independent of Wahoo itself and does not impact the overall Wahoo assessment. This was a standalone exploratory test and it just didn't work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, any read through on the other offsetting structures that could be drilled around Wahoo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working on that now. There's one off to the West that we may want to go test and then of course the Itaipu structure feeds down into BMC-30, the Northwest corner of that and we may need an appraisal well up there at some point. We will be drilling of course an appraisal well to Itaipu probably starting in January or February of 2011. The rig had to go into shipyard for some mandatory inspections so that put a delay in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>

          <p>Couple of things from me. First of all, going back to Brazil, if you look at the, I guess, the fact that you've taken your big rig to West Africa, you are drilling at Tanu and I guess at some point Itaipu will go down, how are you thinking about Brazil now in terms of the drilling backlog and ultimately its place as a long standing asset, a long-term asset in the portfolio? If you could maybe layer in some commentary around Indonesia also, I understand this was an obligation well that you had <mark type="inaudible" /> the discovery but longer term is that an area where you expect to be active or are these trading chips basically to fund the other parts of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave (sic) [Doug] , this is Bob Daniels. I'll give you some assessment on the activities and maybe my view on what we're going to do there. But in Brazil, we did move the rig after Wahoo South over to West Africa to drill the mercury prospect and then to move on down to Ghana to take care of some activities there in the way of appraisal and exploration work.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the Itaipu appraisal will be done early 2011. That will be a Devon operated rig that they have bringing in, to bring in and we'll learn a lot from that. We -- of course we've tested Wahoo #1 that was very successful. Wahoo #2 was not as successful. We had a lot of mechanical issues and really right now we're trying to incorporate all the information that we've got from the Wahoo 1 and 2 wells. We're waiting on the Itaipu appraisal so that we can get a sense for how big that is and meanwhile working conceptual development planning.</p>
          <p>Ita&#xFA;na is kind of an independent entity. It's up on the shelf and while it does have pre-salt and post-salt objectives, it does not roll into the thinking there on the Wahoo Itaipu complex. So right now it's acquire the data, incorporate it all into our planning, see what it means to us and then the way we typically do it is how it stacks up in our portfolio and what it means to Anadarko going forward versus what the market for it may be. And we constantly do that and we feel like having the information and a good assessment of what that information tells us that allows us to make the best decision.</p>
          <p>The Indonesia well, while you mentioned it was an obligation well; this is a well we've been wanting to drill for a long time, so it was not something that we were forced into. We do have two blocks there, the shallow water block which is the Nunukan block where the discovery was made and then we have the deepwater block immediately adjacent to it to the east, the Bukap block. We operate the shallow water and Eni operates the deepwater one.</p>
          <p>We've got the discovery, we'll be shooting 3D on that block because we see a lot more like it, a lot more features like it on the block, so we would like to again understand what this means to the overall assessment of the block and meanwhile we'll be drilling -- or Eni as the operator will be drilling the Borago prospect which will be outboard on the Bukap block and that should happen the end of the year or very early 2011. So a lot of information to be gathered and then we'll put it into our portfolio and decide how it fits with us or perhaps somebody else.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks for the extensive answer, Bob. If I can just try a couple of quick follow-ups. What proportion of your capital right now would you say is being spent on liquids as opposed to gas? And my final one if I may just for Jim. As the calendar rolls here to 2011, I guess we're expecting some news on Algeria in terms of the tax arbitration that's going on right now. If you could give us some color as to what we might expect there that would be great.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Doug, this is Al. I'm not sure we actually look at it quite the way you've asked the question so I'll probably stumble through the answer a little bit. When you consider the fact that we've got three mega projects that are all oil and they are by themselves about $1 billion of CapEx and you look at the fact that we historically talk about our onshore or development program being around $2 billion to replace production.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at just those two in isolation and you exclude exploration from the equation which is a longer cycle investment opportunity for us, we're well above 50% with our capital spend related to oil and liquids related projects, so you can see as we move from where we were a year ago, well most 40% oil liquids blend to being above 40%, we see that trend in the overall mix continuing to go up over the next few years, primarily because of these mega projects coming online and coupled with the redirection that we had over the last couple years as well as the industry towards gas with liquids components. Hope that's helpful. I can't give you a whole lot more specificity than that. Just not quite looked at it the way you asked the question.</p>

          <p>Doug, this is Chuck. My sense is it's in the order of 70% or thereabouts that's going directly to oil investments, the remainder going to a combination of midstream and gas infrastructure type investments in and around our developed fields. We're also investing heavily in the Marcellus through the JV, but that's not out of pocket CapEx.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Jim, let me start with Algeria. The number in the 10-K from last year was 2 billion. What -- assuming you could say it, what number should we think of at the end of 2010?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's roughly $2.4 billion, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Moving to Niobrara, can you talk a little about &#x2013; can you give us a little more color what you're seeing and I know in the op shop data it said you're going to add more rigs next year but can you give us a little more color there, a little more detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, what we've done is we drilled four vertical wells, test wells just evaluating our acreage, getting a good idea of the petro physics around the area and we drilled one horizontal well. It's really early but what we've seen so far it looks very encouraging to us and we'll be completing that well and then going into sort of a one to two rig program through the balance of 2011 to fill out our data set and make an assessment of the play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how many non-op -- or wells that you have a farm out interest in have you seen data from as far as horizontal wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't know the exact number. It's in the order of 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right and then whoever wants to take the last question. I'm just thinking about the Eagleford JV. Most of the other companies seem to do JVs because they have to for capital funding reasons. I look at your balance sheet. It doesn't look like you have to do the Eagleford JV. So can you walk me through if this play is really good as some people think why would you sell it? I'm still struggling with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Al. It's an understandable question and you're right. Within our portfolio today, it's probably one of the more attractive users of capital and probably for that reason it also &#x2013; while it gives us very good rates of return, our ability to take what we'll say is well above average rates of return within our portfolio and turn them into exceptional rates of return is the motivator. Because of the portfolio we have the ability to look for production growth and reserve replacement without being dependent upon any particular play and being able to be capital efficient. And so as a result, if we can get the terms as Bob made reference to, if we get terms that are acceptable to us we can take and significantly improve what we believe is the rate of return for the capital deployed into that play and that's the motivator. It's just almost as singular as that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right I'll ask you more offline but implied in that is there's somebody taking the other side of that that's getting in theory a lower rate of return, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. I mean, relative to ourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, just by definition, somebody else is on the other side of that trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>True. Their alternative is where else could they make that investment and for the risk associated, get that type of return. We'd like to think that the investor has a very good risk return calculation imbalance, whereas we take from our perspective, and get a much better rate of return without having to use the capital in our case to deploy for development.</p>
          <p>If you use Marcellus as a bit of a footprint for how we might consider additional joint ventures whether it be Eagleford or maybe at some point Niobrara or other places, it's just really strictly not being able to -- or having the ability rather not to have to fund that development. We're not really looking to take capital off the table to your point about the balance sheet. This is really not about balance sheet preservation or balance sheet improvement, but rather about improving the capital and its deployment and its rate of return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right okay. That makes sense. And if I think about total number of wells drilled in the field before you JV it, you mentioned -- I don't know if you mentioned this, or this is in my head, but first quarter next year is kind of the target for the JV.</p>
          <p>I think you drilled 30 wells. You said you spud 30 wells this quarter. You spud another 30, I think, in the first half. So you're at 60. How many more wells do you need to get down before you would JV this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually if somebody were to hit our terms today, it's not really a timing thing. As Bob made reference we're really looking for the terms. I think the fields probably got enough history in it and the plays got enough. And it's not a uniform shale development as we all know at this point. It's a pretty complicated play.</p>
          <p>Ours has extremely attractive EURs relative to our drilling and completion cost. As a result, we have from our perspective a very attractive from an investment perspective case for why somebody would want to come in. So I would tell you today, if someone were to meet our terms, we probably by anyone's estimation would have enough data to be able to support that. So we're not really looking to get to our critical mass of drilling activity to be able to then in turn promote it, and so it's really a function of when the market decides if we see terms that we like and if we don't for the reasons I started with, it's one of the most attractive places we can put capital in our portfolio, we're not looking to give it away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, one nit-pick, one detail question. Independence Hub, growth volumes are falling off a cliff. Net looks like it's staying flat. Can you just walk me through what's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, as you know our Independence Hub has well outperformed our expectations through the years. Now it's pushing almost 800 Bcf of cumulative production, so we've had a great run. When we started with it we thought the resource opportunity was around a TCF so you would expect by now we would be on that decline, as we stated we thought early on it would see production plateau in the order of 18 months. And we extended that quite a bit based upon the work that was done.</p>
          <p>What you're seeing now is many of the smaller fields that make up Independence Hub have begun a very steep decline or have watered out. And the bigger fields, and those fields that typically Anadarko has a larger working interest in have been the ones that have maintained their production through time. And so that gives you that dynamic of gross volumes falling, net volumes essentially falling some, but not near to the degree that the others have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just the gross -- you're just supplementing with your own wells as opposed to taking third party operating wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fields that -- the large fields we have like Cheyenne and those that have essentially 100% Anadarko working interest or the higher working interest fields are the ones that are still sustaining themselves in production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David. The Mercury Prospect probably has a little better image than what we had at Venus. And the primary objective is the tronium, which is where we found the hydrocarbons at Venus even though the Venus objective primarily was a shallower fan. So we're trying to take what we learned at Venus, incorporate that into our exploration efforts at Mercury and beyond over into Liberia. And then meanwhile bring all of the things that we're learning from Ghana up into this area. So it's fan complex, it's a little bit different than Venus, but we certainly had a better image on the seismic data here and we just need to see what we find.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, the timing looks like we're going to spud early December to mid-December. The rig has been secured. They are just in the final stages of getting that rig assignment taken care of but it's all been done. And so we do anticipate spudding in December and we're really looking forward to that. Obviously that's been on our books for a long time and there's been a long drawn out process to get to where we actually get to test the prospect. So we're really looking forward to it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then in Indonesia, part of a rig consortium with several deepwater wells was in my notes, I mean the first prospect Eni will drill is there a follow-up of additional prospects in 2011 in Indonesia as well or are they contingent upon each other or can you give any thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you're right about the rig consortium. We -- it's the Transocean Explorer and we drilled, we had the first slot on that. We used it to drill our Pancang well down on our Popodi block and then it has been with different groups and is coming back to Eni. They will be using it on the Bucap block for this Borago prospect. So that rig consortium, everybody has different slots on it. We've pretty much used our slots. We don't have a whole lot of obligations left on it. Eni has a couple other opportunities to -- or a couple other slots, whether or not they come back on to the Bucap block or go somewhere else we'll have to see what we find there at Borago.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just going on to the onshore program, thinking about the Eagleford and you talked about rates of return, not trying to read too much in between the lines but it seems like -- are there any concerns over getting the terms you want, is that -- is there some degree of uncertainty around that potential joint venture or am I just reading too much into the comments?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'm not trying to send you a signal that's sort of between the lines there, if I was implying that I apologize. Really what I was trying to say was that much like we were early on with the Marcellus as we went out and looked at it, we had terms by which we were willing to take what we thought was a very attractive asset and find a joint venture partner. I think that same discipline you can expect will be maintained as we look at the Eagleford and potentially Niobrara down the road. Because they have on their own very good rates of return at the wellhead our ability to be patient because we aren't under balance sheet pressure is one of the reasons why I'm just saying the terms and what Bob was commenting on that the terms are more important to us than the timing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. So when you all are looking at sort of moving some more activity onshore, and obviously with some of the uncertainty with the offshore Gulf of Mexico right now, when you look forward to I guess 2011 and even through 2015, how does moving a little bit more on shore at this point in time sort of impact your growth and return targets that you've kind of all laid out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Al. I think what you can take from that is that and we were generally looking at taking things that would have been longer cycle investing for us, and reinvesting that same capital into shorter cycle, largely liquids to in some cases very liquids rich opportunities.</p>
          <p>So you have very good rates of return with better cycle time. One of the things that we always have to manage because Bob Daniels has so much exploration success and has had now for several years is that we have to be mindful of how that longer cycle stuff can be brought forward either through monetizations, which we've done a lot of since 2006, about $18 billion worth after-tax. We're not really looking necessarily to sell because that's not particularly tax efficient. So as you think about how we're looking onshore, we always like to improve cycle times even when they're short. So again that promoted aspect of being able to do something that's tax efficient is very important to us. So as we move onshore from an offshore spend, if you think about it moving around that way we're both enhancing the short-term cycle of the investment as well as moving it into things that we believe onshore gives extremely good wellhead rates of return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you got better certainty that you can get active in the Gulf to maybe the extent you were hoping to be in 2011 &#x2013; I'm sorry 2010, which was I think initially around a billion dollars, what would happen? Would that take from onshore activity or would that just be incremental spend over cash flow potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think today that would be a really difficult question to answer primarily because we just don't know what the rules of engagement are yet in the Gulf of Mexico and what that's going to mean from a timing standpoint. Yeah, the moratorium is lifted but the well-oiled comment, the de facto moratorium is in place. How long it takes us to get rigged or joint permits rather and how long it takes us to actually get exploration permits is a real unknown. So as it relates to 2011 capital spending, we'll talk more about that after the first of the year and hope between here and there we'll have a little more clarity around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay fair enough. Shifting to the Niobrara, there's I think clearly a lot of variability in the reservoir characteristics and even some of the well performance. Is it too early for you guys to indicate what sort of things you're looking for there or what you're trying to avoid in some of the drilling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we're trying to encounter of course is an oil saturated reservoir and that's the play generally north of Wattenberg <mark type="inaudible" /> window. We're looking for very good petro physics &#x2013; physical prospects like permeability and porosity, that's why we drilled the four vertical wells to evaluate a greater area where we didn't have a density of data that we felt was sufficient. We &#x2013; the kinds of things that have worked are when we've seen reasonable although that's an undefined term at this point but reasonable permeability that will deliver the types of rates that we need to make a good rate of return. There is some indication in parts of the play that there's natural fracturing or fracturing induced by basement movement where we'll evaluate each and every one of those geological settings as we move forward through 2011 and determine in our mind anyway what the best part of the play is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Chuck, wouldn't you add that we're using 3D there because we can access 3D at a pretty reasonable cost to help us with those issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I think we have going for us in the play of course is that our land grant goes right through the middle of the play and that is, that gives us opportunity to essentially anywhere in the greater play because of our ownership in essentially every other section. And today we're getting a lot of information in from other operators because of our formats. I think we have around 400 barrels a day of royalty oil coming out of the Niobrara today. So we're getting good information. We can assimilate that maybe at least as good as anybody else because of our position. And I think through 2011 you'll see the play mature much like you saw the Marcellus last years ago as going the Maverick in the last couple of years and from that we'll make an assessment of where we want to go and go get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what do you all expect the 3D to show you? I mean, you can't really see fracturing your permeability in that, is it more of the basement moves you're looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's the structural texture of the play. Where there's a lot of faulting there's often times a lot of fracturing and we're also are looking for the different geological settings that may set up an advantaged permeability and porosity relationship that we can work with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last quick one. In the Bone Springs and Avalon, I think you all said 550,000 gross acres. Do you have sort of an estimate in that number there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's around 40% or so of that is net acreage depending on what area you're in. We have a JV with Chesapeake in much of the area and as you go south we have roughly 40%, you go north we have roughly 60%. So the average is in the 40 to 50% range.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk to how many wells you have in backlog in the Eagleford, Haynesville and Marcellus shales and how you see that inventory changing over the next year as you both increase drilling activity and bring on new infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, can you help me out with what your definition of backlog is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wells that would be drilled but either or not completed or not tied in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Today we currently have about 50 wells in the Maverick that we're in the process of drilling or completing or tying in, so we have -- and roughly 50 that are online, so about 50% of our wells are now in that condition.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Bone Springs, we have about 20 wells that are in some state of either drilling, completing or tying in. And in the Marcellus, I would venture to say we have roughly 100 wells, maybe a few more than that, that are also in that same condition.</p>
          <p>And essentially it's just a matter of getting the &#x2013; most of that is getting the infrastructure built to the wells so we can tie them in. There's not any, we're not holding back on the completions for price or anything like that. It's just &#x2013; these plays are in sort of a start up mode and it just takes some time to get all of the equipment to the well to get it into the sales process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess if we fast forward 12 months where you've brought on new infrastructure but you've also drilled a lot more wells, do you think that the inventory in those three plays will be meaningfully down, the same, or up from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My sense in the Maverick and Bone Springs, it should be similar even though and the reason is because we'll be increasing the rig, the number of rigs that we're using and that will keep an inventory along those lines.</p>
          <p>In the Marcellus, I think our inventory will come down pretty sharply as you go through the course of the next six months as we commission and put online a number of different systems, gas gathering and gas sales systems in the Marcellus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and maybe that partially answers my next question which is given that you're not drilling that many gas prospects right now, how should we expect the trajectory of your gas production from here over the next year or two years especially if you do see the Independence Hub starting to fall off at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what? I think it's going to be flat to slightly up but again, we'll give you guidance for '11 onwards starting early next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have some quick ones. With Mozambique what would the threshold be for commerciality for an LNG play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, Bob Daniels. We've done some initial work on that and we think that you need to be over three to four TCF to have a minimum commercial development. And of course, we think we have the potential to be well over that. We've got to drill a bunch more wells and see what everything works out there, but there's a lot of gas up in that northwest -- or the northeast corner of that block particularly and we think we've got a lot more activity to prove that up, but we're pretty confident that we will have commercial volumes there or at least that minimum threshold of that. So that's where we are &#x2013; that's our starting point and now we're out there trying to either prove up new ones or appraise what we've already found while maintaining some exploratory wells in between.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. With Badik in Indonesia you said you found gas and oil. Any sense of how gassy or how oily that prospect was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it was probably a little more gas than oil but we don't have the final numbers on it and then how rich the gas is. We're going to have to get our analysis back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay with the Niobrara, say you don't have great fracture porosities, matrix porosity enough to give it a go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, what the early data suggests is that you can make some pretty decent rates out of reasonable permeable porosities, matrix permeable porosities and we have quite a few Niobrara wells in Wattenberg proper that are in the oil window or in the high condensate rich window and they have very little fractured porosity -- or fracture permeability and so our sense is that yes, we can make some decent rates as long as the matrix is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, some accounting-type questions. You accelerated DD&amp;A in the Gulf of Mexico, any particular projects?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John. This is John Colglazier. We had a well-water out on one of the Atlas wells going into Independence Hub, so it was an acceleration of DD&amp;A on it, so basically just a change in estimate that we accelerated DD&amp;A on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>John, this is Bobby Reeves. No, we're not done with that. We're still in the middle of an adversarial proceeding there. That just relates to a cancellation or rejection of a master separation agreement that was part of the bankruptcy proceeding there. I think we've explained that in the 10-Q filed last night, should give you the details on that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. Question first on Mozambique and the discoveries there, as you look at commercialization options, early days but does it look like LNG is a viable option there or would you be looking more at a local market or maybe pipeline down to South Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob again. Of course we've looked at all of the different options and tried to assess what local market there may be, but LNG is certainly the one that we're focused on because that's something we understand. Our partnership is -- was actually kind of fed up strategically because of the potential for finding gas out here. We have Mitsui as a partner, of course, who is a big LNG player. Bharat out of India is part owner of the regas facilities on the West Coast of India. So we do have a good partnership there that has access to markets and understands the LNG business. And of course, our experience with the Bear Head terminal gave us good experience. The key thing about the LNG is that it is indexed oil prices. And so you've got to think of it differently than North American gas pricing and look at where you think oil is going to go and then run your economics based on what percentage of oil price you'll get for the gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then one other if I could, in Ghana. With the success at Owo and Tweneboa and moving fairly quickly to sanctioning next year, does that have any implications for next phase at Jubilee? Could you do both projects concurrently or would that sort of push out the next phase of Jubilee a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are hoping to sanction both Owo and Tweneboa next year with our operator Tullow. And with regard to Jubilee, what we are hoping to do there is, of course, we're going to get the facility online later this year and then get the data that we need to make a determination what and when we do a Jubilee Phase II. Our initial sense is that we'll see some really good results and that the timing of that Phase II will be within a year or two of  first production.</p>
