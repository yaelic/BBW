          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Annual Report for 2010. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group CEO, Nils S. Andersen.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So good morning, and welcome to everybody to this annual report call for 2010. If we go to the second slide, you'll see the forward-looking statements and all the caution we give you, and while you read that, maybe I'll just say a few words to our result as we see it.</p>
          <p>It is, of course, in dollar terms, our best results ever, and we're very pleased with that. And what is also positive in our minds is that even if the rates and the volumes in the container business was in 2010 lower than they were in 2008, we had an improvement in the result over the two years. Skipping 2009, which we thought was completely say abnormal, we had an improvement of around U.S. $2 billion which came from internal improvements in the container business, and a similar picture goes for the rest of the group.</p>
          <p>We've gone through a major restructuring program over the last three years since the start of 2008 where we started with streamline, and we've taken out more than U.S. $3 billion of costs which has made us much more competitive, and which is really the reason why we feel confident that the results we're showing today are not just the result of effects coming from the outside.</p>
          <p>What we also consider very good is that the cash flow is strong, and it gives us good opportunities to drive growth in the group through investments which are weak, but in better balance than we've seen in the past related to the balance between CapEx and cash flow.</p>
          <p>We are quite optimistic on the long-term future of the group. We see good growth opportunities in developing markets, and we feel that we are well placed there to take advantage of that. So with the &#x2013; in the long-term, we're quite optimistic. If we take the short-term, of course, 2011 there's still a lot of uncertainties, but we are entering the year with a better speed than we did last year, which is positive.</p>
          <p>And all in all, I would say we're very pleased with the result, but really also because it gives us good opportunities to look forward and invest in an exciting future.</p>
          <p>So if we go to Page 3 or Slide #3. We present in the chart here a net result of U.S. $5 billion, which gives us a return on invested capital of 12.2% which is above our ROIC. As I just alluded to before, the improved profits compared to 2009 are obviously a result of better volumes, and in particular, better rates and better oil prices, but also because we have managed to make our business much more competitive across the group.</p>
          <p>We're taking some steps to expand the oil portfolio during the year. We ended the year investing in three licenses in Brazil, and we see that as a big job also going forward to build a very strong oil business.</p>
          <p>We generated a cash flow of approximately U.S. $10 billion, and that meant that combined for our normal standard relatively low CapEx we managed to generate U.S. $5.5 billion in free cash flow, and our debt is now down to U.S. $12.4 billion, which is slightly more than one year's of free cash flow from operation.</p>
          <p>So we feel we have a very strong position, and that, as I said before, enables us to be quite aggressive on the investment side, but keeping an eye on having good balance between cash flow and the dividends we need to pay and the CapEx we enter into.</p>
          <p>And the last bullet points here is that dividend will be increased to DKK 1,000 per share, which is obviously a significant step up compared to last year and it's a 50% increase compared to the year before.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results by activities it's clear that the improvement in the business is coming mainly from Maersk Line, which comes with almost U.S. $5 billion out of the U.S. $6 billion improvement. The rest of the business is mainly oil and the terminal business are bringing the rest, which the rest of the businesses are, let's say, a more mixed bag and I will dig further into that in a moment.</p>
          <p>But starting with the container activities on Slide #4, an improvement of U.S. $4.7 billion coming through improving competitiveness first and foremost. Unit cost reduced compared to 2009 with 4%, excluding bunker cost, and a bunker consumption that is reduced with 10% per FFE transported through slow steaming, a lot of better operational measures such as how we balance the ship, how we load them, how we maneuver in relation to wind and waves and so on, so really good work throughout the organization.</p>
          <p>We're coming out of the year with the highest customer satisfaction that we have ever registered, which we of course are very, very pleased with because that bodes well for the future. And we're also continuing to improve our reliability towards our objective of having 95% on-time deliveries, even though if you compare our shipping statistics to some of our competitors, we do sail on a lot of ports where it's quite difficult to get full reliability into your schedule, so that we consider also very positive.</p>
          <p>The volumes were up 5% year-on-year, which meant that we just got back on par with 2008, but we did lose market share. Main reasons why we lost market share, one of them were that we went into the prices with a smaller order book than many of our competitors, and that means that we have gotten less ships delivered last year than the average for the market.</p>
          <p>The rates increased by 29% to a little bit above $3,000 per FFE, but remaining below the 2008 average; a very good year for the container business all-in-all driven by rate improvements, as well as internal gains in productivity and competitiveness.</p>
          <p>And speaking about competitiveness and looking to the future, if you go to Slide 5 you'll see some key information regarding the vessels we ordered on Monday, which are new; very large, the largest vessels that will be sailing and by far the largest container vessels ever ordered with a capacity of 18,000 TEU each at 26% slot cost advantage compared to standard 13,100 TEU ships.</p>
          <p>And when we mention that specific class that's because that's what our competitors gets delivered this year and the coming years. And we will have a 50% lower CO2 emission per TEU than the average of the current fleet trading Asia, Europe. So major step forward both of course in competitiveness, but also in CO2 emissions, which irrespective of what global legislative system there will be regarding fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, should place us very well for the future.</p>
          <p>We'll start taking delivery of the ships in 2013 and 2015. As you will have noted, we predicted a 6% to 7% growth in the markets in 2011, and a slightly higher growth in tonnage, but we do think that this picture will gradually reverse when we come to 2013. So we believe these ships will fill a niche in the market.</p>
          <p>We already from March, that means next month, starting to take delivery of the specialized vessels we've built for developing markets, which are the Latin America, South America vessels with plenty of reefer capacity, as well as the special ships we built for the Africa trade. And we believe that, that places us well to take market share going forward in those trades.</p>
          <p>If we take the next slide, oil and gas activities. Really, the increase is coming because of an increase of 29% in the average price of oil. We had, as we predicted, a share production that went down with 12% due to falling share per our production sharing agreement with Qatar, and partly compensated with increased production in the U.K.</p>
          <p>We did have a slight lower exploration cost than we had the year before, and the reason for that was mainly a reversal of a reserve we have built for a long-term rig contract which was contracted above market, and also for which we had no need. We've negotiated out of that so we could reverse part of the reserve. So we build &#x2013; we drilled 14 exploration wells, and will continue and actually predict for 2011 a higher exploration cost level than we had in 2010.</p>
          <p>We've also made significant investments in new acreage and new projects during the year. We spent &#x2013; we approved a development plan for the Jack field which we acquired at the end of 2009 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We bought stakes in four blocks, 34, which is a virgin block where we're drilling at the moment, and then stakes in 8, 30 and 32 at a price of $2.4 billion where there are finds in the blocks and even a small production.</p>
          <p>In Norway, we bought stakes in two fields, both in the Zidane and Avaldnes discoveries, and look forward to seeing what can be done further on those discoveries in the coming years. We took a number of licenses, which means that we also working on the early part of the pipeline.</p>
          <p>If we go to Slide #7 drilling a little bit deeper into the oil and gas activities, talking about the future. We have concrete plans for, that means approved and running investment projects, for two new areas. One is in the new area El Merk in Algeria where we expect first oil or actually first gas in 2012, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the Jack field where we expect first oil in 2014.</p>
          <p>We also have a number of discoveries that we are looking into, and we do expect to come out with further information on Angola on the Chissonga find during 2011. We're planning two appraisal wells to be drilled in the first three quarters this year, and expect them to be ready for thorough evaluation of the project.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we are the largest shareholder in the Golden Eagle, Hobby and Pink finds operated by Nexen, and also here we expect to be able to give further information in 2011, hopefully also declaring commerciality and coming up with an investment project.</p>
          <p>Then we're doing work on a number of other finds, which is Culzean, the gas find in the U.K.; Cawdor/Flyndre in the U.K.; the Buckskin find where we are 20% shareowner with Chevron as operator; and Norway, two finds; and in Brazil, the Carambola find, where we are operating and which we just released information earlier this year.</p>
          <p>As it says in the blue box, we expect to have a higher level of exploration activities in 2011 than we had to last year's or we had in 2010 partly because there will be no reversal of reserves, and also because we had some delays in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>In terms of the terminal activities on Slide 8, very good increase in profits for the year, which was driven by, partly by better profitability in the underlying business, but the big jump was really an extraordinary profit taken from sale of our 13% share in the Yantian Terminal in South China.</p>
          <p>If we look at the profitability key figures, ROIC excluding extraordinaries, was 10% compared to the 8.7% &#x2013; or 10.4% compared to 8.7% last year and that is good. Also positive was that the EBITDA margin for the port activities went up again after a series of years with increases now to 25.3%. When you look at the figures, you have to take into consideration that we integrated during 2011 the inland activities, and they have slightly lower margins. Still, by the way, good return on investments.</p>
          <p>Going forward we will have a continued focus on growth and emerging markets. We had growth of 7% in 2010. That meant that we lost market share. We actually did gain market share in 2009, so it's probably a little bit about growth patterns more than any sort of us not investing enough or not growing as fast as the market.</p>
          <p>We had an increase in non-A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk volume to 44% share. This is a strategy for us that we want to continue getting third party carriers in, and we do expect that trend to continue. We have very good cooperation with most of the large liner companies in the world.</p>
          <p>The investments that we made during the year reflects our part or our plan to invest in emerging markets. We bought 50% of a terminal project in Santos that will be more than 2 million TEU when it's finished in 2012, and we also took over the operation of the Monrovia terminal in Liberia. On top of that we are currently investing in expanding a number of places, including the Suez Channel and Jordan and other growth markets.</p>
          <p>If we take to the next slide, tankers, offshore and other shipping, coming back to what I said before was a little bit of mixed bag. We see improved, but still negative result for most tankers. If you exclude the impairments of $111 million, it's more or less a breakeven result in Maersk Tankers, which is obviously still not satisfactory, but does reflect that the current rates in the market and the rates we had in most of 2009 and all of 2010 are simply not very attractive.</p>
          <p>Maersk Drilling has done very well. We put new rigs into operation, and the large rigs are operating and actually starting up with fewer issues than we normally would expect, so very positive development from U.S. $200 million to U.S. $400 million profit there.</p>
          <p>Maersk FPSO was strongly negative. It was basically a result of repair works at Ngujima-Yin, as well as impairments on Ngujima-Yin and another FPSO to the tune of U.S. $200 million.</p>
          <p>The LNG business also took impairments. So when you take the FPSO and LNG together and exclude the impairments, actually there's a slight positive result, but clearly nothing we can be satisfied with at all.</p>
          <p>Supply Service made a profit of U.S. $200 million, which given the fact that there was quite a lot of capacity coming into the market and we had weak spot markets for most of the year, we actually consider good result, and there's also still a good return on that investment. Svitzer improved its results, and we also expect that trend to continue.</p>
          <p>Taking other segments on Slide #10 starting with the Retail business, the Retail business did slightly better than last year. As you may recall, 2009 was a record year, mainly driven by cost savings in a difficult retail market. This year a continued positive development came also with a lot of attention to cost and competitiveness because we didn't really see any growth in the Danish retail market, slight growth in the international operations.</p>
          <p>Very important here is, of course, that the divestment of our U.K. activities with the U.S. $700 million expected gain did not materialize in 2010. We expect it to materialize some time during 2011. It is only pending government approvals.</p>
          <p>And if we take other businesses, still significant revenue with DKK 8 billion, an increase in results and that is reflecting that we had lower losses in Odense Steel Shipyard. We had an improved result from Danske Bank and also the other businesses here under container, construction and so on did very well.</p>
          <p>Going to the consolidated financial information, I'll leave the work to Trond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nils. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll take you through some of the financial information at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>On Slide 11 on the consolidated financials I'll start with the columns to the right, the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter of 2010 we had a revenue of $14.7 billion. That is an increase of $1.5 billion from last year or 11%, and you can see that the fourth quarter EBITDA ends up at $3.8 billion and that is an increase of $1.5 billion, and that is an increase of 64% from last year.</p>
          <p>And you can see that that is, of course, contributing to the elements of competitiveness, as Nils mentioned, but also the oil price, leading us at an EBIT in fourth quarter of $2.2 billion. That is after an impairment in the fourth quarter of $332 million.</p>
          <p>The profit and loss for the fourth quarter is then $824 million. If we exclude the impairment and the gains, we see that the result or the profit for the period, for the fourth quarter is $1.120 billion.</p>
          <p>Going then to the full year numbers of 2010, we have a revenue of $56 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion from 2009, and you also see that the EBITDA ends up at $15.9 billion. That is an increase of $6.7 billion, so we have an increase in the revenue of $7.5 billion, and an increase in the EBITDA of $6.7 billion. The major increase to the EBITDA is, of course, the revenue growth and the margin improvement in Maersk Line. It is the oil price, but it is of course, also the cost savings and the effectiveness coming in to the results.</p>
          <p>The depreciation, amortization and impairment is $6 billion, and the sales gains is $674 million. Considering that the impairment losses during the year is $724 million, the gains and the impairments is basically a wash, so the underlying results for the period is very equal to the reported numbers of $10.6 billion in EBIT number. The profit before tax is $9.7 billion, leaving us with a tax charge of $4.6 billion. That leaves a profit for 2010 of $5 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the operational cash flow from operating activities, we see $10.132 billion. Cash flow for CapEx is down to $4.6 billion, and it leaves us at a net interest bearing debt at the end of the year of $12.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Going to the next page, slightly more details on that cash flow, the cash flow of 2010 at $10.1 billion, as mentioned, including an increase in working capital of $400 million. Total assets is $66.7 billion, and the equity is increased by almost $4 billion to $34.4 billion.</p>
          <p>The return on invested capital during 2010 is 12.2%. The earnings per share in dollars is $1,078 a share, which comprises in Danish kroner DKK 6,061. And as Nils mentioned on the front page, the Board proposes a dividend of DKK 1,000 a share, which is equivalent, at the year-end exchange rates, of $178.15 per share.</p>
          <p>Going then to Slide number 13, you see the development in net interest bearing debt, starting the year, of $18.1 billion and making $15 billion, almost $16 billion in EBITDA. That, of course, have to be taken into account of the taxes paid of $4.6 billion. Of the $4.6 billion, oil and gas tax is $4.10650 billion. That it is very sort of dependent on, of course, the oil price and the development.</p>
          <p>But you also see that the change in working capital is low on $400 million, the financing items on $800 million, the CapEx of $4.6 billion, leading us at a net debt of $12.4 billion. During the year, we have also issued new Eurobond, and we have now 13% on gross interest bearing debt out in the bond market. We have also refinances our primary syndicated bank facility, and do see our position, both on committed financing and on maturity, as well as the dependency on the financial market, at a very comfortable level.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide 14 on the outlook for 2011, we'll refer you to the full outlook statement in our press release and the annual reports, but I will highlight a few major elements in our outlook statement here.</p>
          <p>So for the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk group, we expect a result lower than the 2010 results. Cash flow from operating activities is expected to develop in line with the result, while cash flow used for capital expenditure is expected to be significantly higher than in 2010.</p>
          <p>The group's container activities expect a satisfactory result, but below the 2010 result. We expect the global demand for seaborne containers to grow by 6% to 8% in 2011. The global supply of new tonnage is expected to match or grow more than the freight volume, especially on the Asia to Europe trade.</p>
          <p>Maersk Oil expects a higher level of exploration activities than in 2010. The group's share of the oil and gas production is expected to decline to around 125 million barrels. Maersk Oil results for 2011 is expected to be lower than in 2010, based on an average oil priced around $90 a barrel.</p>
          <p>APM terminals expect continued growth in volumes, and a result somewhat above 2010, excluding sales gains. We have also included some sensitivities to understand the level of sensitivity going into our numbers. I won't go through those in detail, but you can have a look, and that is also scheduled out in our annual report, as well as the &#x2013; this is also specified in our press release.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll leave the &#x2013; I'll leave it back to you, Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the priorities, which is, as you know, an important part of our way of managing the company is to direct the group in certain directions, and the priorities we put high on the agenda for 2011 is our customers first.</p>
          <p>It's really obvious that should be first. It should always be first, but we're putting it up there because we believe that, after a long restructuring phase, it's natural that even, whatever you try to do to become externally focused, you tend to focus too much on yourself. And we want to send a clear signal through the organization that now it is all about the markets, and needless to say, everybody are quite enthusiastic about that.</p>
          <p>The second point is emerging markets. It really covers growth markets, and the intention here is to build on the strong position we already have. We are more than 40% of our turnover in growth markets, and we have strong organizations across the world. So we will, during 2011, look for ways to accelerate our presence in those markets, and we do believe that with a good financial balance sheet and also a good cash flow so this will be a reasonably way and place to invest our money.</p>
          <p>Then we're looking at a transformation of Maersk Oil. You have seen that we have invested, as we've said we would, in getting more oil reserves and resources into the company. But on top of that it's, of course, very important that we also make sure that the company is top notch in all operational aspects relevant to us. That means operation of mature fields and chalk and the areas where we are already today leaders, and placing ourselves to become even stronger in the future.</p>
          <p>And then the fourth priority is winning again, and this is not a prediction of any results, but it means, of course, that we have gained in competitiveness over the last years, and we want at all cost to make sure we maintain that development, making sure that we, all the time, optimize the business so that we really can compete and can invest in areas where we know we have a long-term strong position to build. So it's going to be quite an exciting year. Lots of work and lots of opportunities for a group like ours.</p>
          <p>So we're optimistic and full of energy, and I think the organization is also very encouraged by the good results we had in 2010. So with those words, thank you for listening in, and we're now ready for questions and answers.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> While we're waiting for the first question, let me remind you that the PowerPoint presentation is available for download on maersk.com. Our first question comes from Matthew O'Keeffe from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>

          <p>Morning. Can you hear me there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two operational questions, maybe two financial questions. Just on the operational front, about six months ago, a lot of container shipping lines were talking about a shortage of boxes and the shortage, perhaps, popping up shipping rates to some extent. You haven't mentioned that today, so I was wondering whether the shortage of boxes, is it a problem that's been solved now?</p>
          <p>On the oil and gas business, just in relation to the Brazilian acquisition you made, I wonder why you didn't give us more P-1 or P-2 estimates at the time. Maybe there's something you can tell us now, but it's obviously a $2.4 billion deal so it's on the side.</p>
          <p>And then, two financial questions. Just your sensitive detail of dollar you haven't commented on. I wonder what your working assumption there is. And then finally, on the dividend, obviously, a very welcome change but somewhat breathtaking. I wonder what conclusions you would like us all to draw from your increasing the dividend. That's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will take the operational ones first. And on the shortage of boxes, we believe that that was caused by two things. A few orders placed during 2009 and second half 2008, but also because we were really unprepared for the turnaround in the business. So a lot of carriers had left a lot of boxes in places where they were not needed. So we, for instance, had a lot of boxes in Europe where we had problems getting them back, because we're taking a lot of backhaul which is very heavy. So I think the shortage of boxes should not be a problem, in general, for industry in 2011.</p>
          <p>On the Brazilian deal. Yes, we have not given a lot of detail. We've obviously bought on assumptions that we've taken from the cellar and from our own studies and -- but we would rather be much more sure about that before we start publishing things. We also don't publish reserves and resources for the time being. And on the dollar, as question on dividends, I suggest Trond would answer.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>On the dollar sensitivity, if you take 10% sensitivity on the dollar rate relative to all other currency that we are involved in, we have approximate sensitivity of around $300 million. On the increase in dividend, how you want to interpret it? As you know, we don't have a stated dividend policy as such. But if you look at the history and the trend that we have enclosed in the appendices of the presentation, you see an ongoing trend. And I do believe that this is a response to the solidity of the group, the way we look at the business going forward, but also part of the history of recognitions on the dividends to the shareholders of the history.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Lars Heindorff from ABG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. We can't hear you. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, now we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. A question also regarding the oil price sensitivity. I'm wondering, what kind of BAF recovery have you assumed in the sensitivity that you have disclosed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, a part of the BAF recovery is, of course, a part of our estimates. We have not disclosed the level of that BAF recovery percentage, as we have in our numbers. But the sensitivity is, of course, the portion of the BAF recovery that we're not able to recover in addition to the embankment production of the oil and gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't forget that BAF is relevant really only if you take one-year contracts, because if you take quarterly contracts negotiations, you negotiate a rate, and there's not really much of a BAF element in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then let me turn to the container division then. If you then exclude the impact from the higher bunker prices we see at the moment, curious about what you expect in terms of the development in the unit cost for the rest of your cost base throughout 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit early to say at the moment, but we do expect continued downward trend in unit costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Regarding the oil and gas division, you said that you expect exploration cost to increase in 2011. Can you give us any more meat on the bone? Is that sort of a double up, or how much is considering the amount of activity you have both in Brazil and in the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really hard to give you. I mean, we obviously have an opinion, but we've said as much as we can, and don't forget that, with the relatively limited number of drillings we have, you just need delays of three that will move some hundred millions dollars, so it's very hard to come up with an exact prediction of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then the last question is regarding your CapEx. You also stated that you expect CapEx to increase very significantly. Are we going back to 2008 levels, which were above DKK 50 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually too early to say, because it's a matter of where. If we place an order for 30 box ships, obviously it will be a high level. If we only take 10, it will be slightly lower. It's very, very big chunks that we move and timing is a bit uncertain, but over time, we'll try to get a good balance between CapEx and cash flow, and then there can be deviations in a single year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my last question would &#x2013; also regarding the oil and gas. I haven't done the entire math yet, but it looks like the entitlement share in the fourth quarter in Qatar has been sort of roughly flattish compared to both the second and the third quarter, which is around sort of the mid 50s or something like that. Can you give us an indication about how much you expect that to decline in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've given a figure for the total, and we're not breaking it down at this point in time. For Qatar it depends, among others, on the oil price; because if the oil prices is high, our share will go down more and if it's low, it will decline less. So it's &#x2013; we've given a figure which we expect to be around 125 million. Last year, we hit the figure pretty well. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in addition to that, it's also one effect in 2011 that was not in 2010, and that is the incident we had in the U.K. on one of our fields that is also affecting the guiding on the 125 million barrels a year. So it's &#x2013; not relative to the trend you saw in 2010, it's not only Qatar that affects that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I assume you're talking about the Gryphon field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you tell us what sort of impact that had?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm just guiding you to say that it's not only looking at Qatar on this decline from the 138 million to the 125 million. It's also effects coming from the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Chris Comb&#xE9; here. One quick question regarding your liner outlook. Could you give us some sense of what your assumptions are for underlying liner rates, as well as your bunker price assumption? And secondly, is it too early to give us some color on how customers are responding, coming out of Lunar New Year, regarding rates near term? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to answer to that, on the Lunar New Year. We expect rates to be below 2010 levels, but exactly where, we're not giving a statement on that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Dan Togo from Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Again on containers, you're guiding for a satisfactory result. Could you please elaborate a bit on that? How are we to interpret it? Is it because you see the RACC being more or less in line with WACC? Or are you assuming a small premium here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if it is to be a satisfactory result, it shouldn't be below WACC, so there, I guess that is the guidance, but we really just &#x2013; what we tried to say with the guidance is that we don't expect a return to 2009 figures, or anything close to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you're guiding for production of 125 million barrels of oil equivalent. How would that production estimate be affected if we assume a oil price of $100 per barrel, because that will of course take down the take in Qatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We don't give any details on the contract in Qatar, so we just try to guide as well as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then maybe you could elaborate a bit on how you see the risks attached to your production in Qatar and Algeria, given the latest political turmoil we're seeing. How are you monitoring that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have, of course in Qatar, which is the largest, we have people on the ground and we are very close to the development. We are not, in general, worried about the situation in the Middle East. There may be temporary issues in one country or the other, but we don't consider that a risk to our operation, in Qatar or elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then further on Qatar, you have now, two quarters in a row, highlighted that you see more potential in Qatar. When can we see some more information regarding an additional expansion, or maybe even a new contract, in Qatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, exactly as you say. It depends on when we enter into negotiations with the government on a potential new contract, but we're of course, all the time, in contact with QP and the Ministry regarding opportunities to invest in expanding or prolonging the life of the field.</p>
          <p>But don't forget that the present production level is also a result of OPEC restrictions put on Qatar, so it's not just a matter of agreeing to a new investment plan in our output. It's also &#x2013; we're also talking about, how can we get the maximum out of this field over a long, long time period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, just a follow-up on the exploration cost you're expecting for 2011. You drilled, or had, 11 exploration drillings in 2010. What is the schedule for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just two questions from me. Firstly, on the tanker business. Rates have been fairly chronically weak in that business for two years. Do you see any improvement this year? And then, just to follow-up on that, what's the strategic plan for that business? Do you think, over time, you'll be looking to shrink the fleet? And then the second question is just on your 2011 guidance. Just to clarify, I'm assuming the Netto U.K. potential gain is not in that statement? And just sort of on that specific issue, you sound a little bit less sure about completion and also the timeline. Have there been any problems with the U.K. authorities, getting approval there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tankers, it's true that rates have been miserable for almost all of '09 and all of '10, and the start of this year wasn't too good. At the moment, we actually see rates strengthening a little bit, but whether this is a result of Middle East turmoil uncertainties, I don't know. We have no plans to shrink the fleet &#x2013; shrinking the fleet, and we do expect that the tanker business will, over time, be an important part of the business and we do see long term opportunities as well.</p>
          <p>On Netto U.K., we are in contact with the Office of Fair Trading, and this is a lengthy process. And we hope, of course, that we get good response and approval as soon as possible, but I really can't say much more to the process. But the process is going on, and it has been pretty lengthy, considering the size of the deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, the Netto U.K. potential gain is not in your statement about 2011 earnings, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really can't add to what we've been writing. We're just writing that we're below 2010 result, and so at this point in time, I wouldn't like to give more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Menno Sanderse from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, everybody. First, I'd like to talk a bit about earnings power, Nils. You made a 12% return on invested capital for the group in 2010. Is that a reason for you to open a bottle of Carlsberg, or are you saying, let's stick to the French water because I need to do a lot better than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think 12% is an acceptable, good figure. The group WACC is, of course, lower than that and we do have quite a bit of business in infrastructure, where returns are quite low normally and volatility is low. So we find &#x2013; we think this is a good figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, oil and gas. Obviously, Maersk is not the only one trying to expand acreage. So have you lowered your internal rate of return assumptions, or expectations, on these new acreage and blocks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we had enormous returns on equity and assets in the oil business, because we have very strong traditional, both the Qatar and in particular Danish North Sea has, of course, been profitable over the years, and also in Danish North Sea, the assets are written down quite a bit. So for expansion, we just, by definition, I think we have to assume that we'll get lower returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, and have you &#x2013; I accept that, but have you lowered them, say, versus last year, because there's more competition for these interesting...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have a WACC of 8 point something percent in the oil business, and we wouldn't go into a business that we didn't think was above that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then finally, why do you think the container shipping industry will avoid a crisis like '09, given that capacity is growing at above the month according to your own statement, and clients obviously have suffered a bit, "suffered" last year with higher rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we go into a certain situation, it will be &#x2013; you can see a sign that the industry has learned nothing, and I think a lot of the competitors and I mean we lost money, but at least we didn't get into financial &#x2013; under financial pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we have seen a number of our competitors going very, very close to being in financial trouble. And we just don't think that, that is a way that they will go again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you think if rates would go further down, then people would lay up ships again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we go into a situation like 2009, it would require both a collapse in the global economy, and really all the container lines collectively having learned nothing, and I doubt that is going to be the case.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Peter Rothausen, Danske Markets. A couple of questions, clarification question in respect of the group ROIC of 12%. Is it &#x2013; should we interpret the way that this is the 12% ROIC is the acceptable return? Or is that &#x2013; or do we have a basis to, yeah, to move higher in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we &#x2013; first of all, yes, 12% is an acceptable figure. We hope, of course, to get higher, but we also have to be aware that there's a trade-off between returns and growth and with the return level, in general, in the group of 12%, we also have a good basis to grow on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of your less performing businesses, mainly in the tankers, offshore, et cetera, you're right that you have some priorities there in terms of phasing out businesses or making a turnaround. Could you elaborate a bit more on that? And what the timeframe for that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't specify tankers as an area where we would &#x2013; we have had a program running in 2010 where we've exceeded a number of non-profitable activities, and that will continue, but it's been more on a segment basis. We left terminals in the terminal business, gone out of them and we've also closed unprofitable routes in the container business.</p>
          <p>And we have, obviously, made divestments over the last years and closings. We're closing the ship yards, and we've been selling ship yards. We are also &#x2013; we merged Norfolkline with DFDS to create a European leading company. So we've done a lot of things and we're going to look all the time at the portfolio, but we're not going to say because tankers now is in a downturn then we're going to leave it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In respect of Qatar, it's to be understood the way that you're having proprietary negotiations with the Emir?</p>

          <p>I don't know where we met the Emir, and of course, we're pleased to work in Qatar, so we have good relations to the government and everybody in the country. And we are in constant discussion with Qatar Petroleum on how we can, and the Ministry of Oil, of course, how we can develop the corporation, but that's all I can say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On container side, the outlook that you're giving for a satisfactory result. In terms of unit cost, you expect lower unit cost, as you said that, but can maybe elaborate a bit on that? And also, if I recall correctly, from the Q3 announcement you said expect the group cost level to be on par or that you wouldn't expect any major changes in the absolute cost level in container. Maybe you can elaborate a bit on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really anything to add to what I said before. It's very difficult to talk about cost in general on the group because we have growing businesses, we have shrinking businesses and we have movements all the time. So we don't have as an objective to lower the absolute cost level of the group, but we have missions to become more competitive and that means lowering the relative cost positions in each business unit compared to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. I maybe mixed up the question. In specifically in container about lowering your unit cost, do you expect this to happen? Do you expect the absolute cost level in container to be on par with '10? Or what are your assumptions in terms of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to lower the unit cost. That's the plan, but I can't say more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Final question, follow-up on what you mentioned about CapEx versus cash flow generation going forward. Is this to be understood the way that you're going to deploy all the operating cash flow from the group into CapEx line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not for definition. We're going to invest in the business going forward. We believe that we have very exciting investment or businesses to invest in. We're well placed, and we'll do that, but we will over time try to get a good balance between our cash earnings and the CapEx level we shoot for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That means that we will keep a good strong cash flow position, and a good liquidity position of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it doesn't seem as if we have more questions or time for further questions, so I just thank you for listening in, and we look forward to seeing you after the first quarter.</p>
          <p>That will be when we have come much further in discussions on the Pacific trade, and probably also have much better impression of where the rates will be for the container line, and hopefully we can be more specific in our guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>So we thank you for listening in, and look forward to seeing you or talking to you in three months time. Thank you.</p>
