          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to BCE's Second Quarter Results Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Fotopoulos.  Please go ahead Mr. Fotopoulos.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick.  Good morning, everybody.  Joining me here today is George Cope, our President and CEO and Siim Vanaselja, our CFO.  We did release our earnings earlier this morning and the purpose of the call today is to provide you some additional color on our results as well as to answer as many of your questions as time will permit this morning.  George and Siim will take you through a slide presentation that you'll find on bce.ca and after that we'll move to a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>As usual before we begin I will also like to remind you that our remarks today will contain some forward looking statements with respect to items such as revenue, EBITDA, capital intensity, free cash flow, EPS and dividends.  Several assumptions were made by us in preparing those forward-looking statements and there are risks that our actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For additional information on assumptions and risks please consult BCE's 2008 annual MD&amp;A as updated in BCE's 2009 first quarter MD&amp;A and BCE's 2009 second quarter MD&amp;A, all of which are filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC, and which are also available on our website.  These forward-looking statements represent BCE's expectations as of today and accordingly are subject to change after such date.  Except as may be required by Canadian Securities Laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to remind you that I'm making these cautionary statements on behalf of each speaker whose talks today will contain such forward-looking statement.  So with that out of way, I'll turn the call over to both George and Siim for some brief introductory remarks, then we'll take your questions.  George?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Thane.  Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning.  I'm going to turn now to our presentation and I'm on what's Page Four called 'Delivering on dividend growth model', and obviously we are happy this morning to be in a position to announce a mid-year dividend increase for our shareholders.  The announcement this morning is consistent with the new capital market strategy we unfolded at our February Investor Conference, where when appropriate we would look for opportunities to return cash to our shareholders through buybacks or dividend increases or a combination thereof and at the same time making sure we maintain that dividend within our guided payout ratio.</p>
          <p>We are comfortable with the mid-year dividend increase really for three reasons.  One is this morning's adjusted EPS outlook being more positive than we had anticipated in February.  Secondly, the ability to increase our EBITDA guidance now from being flat or stable year-over-year to a more positive outlook given the cost management across the Company.  And finally, and I think most importantly, the successful completion also of our financing requirements for 2010 that we completed just in June with the $1 billion bond, successful, completion of the $1 billion bond issue.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide Five, briefly an update on our five strategic comparatives.  We had another very strong quarter of service improvement year-over-year and what's really starting to work for the Company is we're seeing significant improvement in service, while at the same time driving out cost on the service side.</p>
          <p>So through the delivery of Same Day Next Day service we're seeing a reduction by way of example in our call centers, significant reductions in terms of repairs, given we're now out to see the customer much quicker and doing those repairs once and out in terms of the customers, any problems that they may have. So continuing to see progress there and quite frankly numbers that we've never hit before in terms of our service metrics, all which we think bodes well in the future for our brand and our position in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Second imperative that clearly we're making progress on is the cost structure being more and more competitive in the marketplace.  There is no doubt we've seen a cultural change in the Company over the last year that has taken hold across all management levels and across the entire organization, in fact, in terms of making sure we're spending money where required and any discretionary spending, quite frankly, continues to be eliminated.  Our Wireline labor costs down year-over-year and our G&amp;A costs down year-over-year are just examples.</p>
          <p>As well, looking for further cost savings, on July 1 we implemented the integration of our Enterprise, SMB and Bell West businesses all under one business unit under St&#xE9;phane Boisvert's leadership and we anticipate there approximately 300 less resources being required and a savings of close to $30 million a year through that move   Also even our new debt issue drives our annual interest cost savings of about $25 million pre-tax when we get into next year.</p>
          <p>On the Wireless side, I'll talk about the operating metrics in a moment and some of the challenges the industry is having, but in terms of strategically, very happy with where we are and setting up for next year the completion of The Source acquisition and the Virgin acquisitions, the announcement of the Palm Pre exclusive to Bell, where we will launch that later this month, and the launch of the BlackBerry Tour.  And important for us, we've never had a response on our website like we're seeing now in terms of bringing the Palm to the market, so hopefully that bodes well for the future for the Company in terms of net adds.</p>
          <p>And then finally, this morning in the press release you may have noted that we've announced we've entered into a roaming agreement with AT&amp;T when we launch our HSPA network, and that's important on two fronts for us.  One is for our customers in the future having access to a tremendous network in the U.S.  But more importantly for Bell also is in the future HSPA clients in the U.S. on AT&amp;T will have the ability to roam in Canada on Bell's new HSPA network, which as I said will launch, as you know, in early 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page Six, on the Wireline side, excellent quarter for our TV business, continuing to see a reduction in the number of NAS losses on the consumer side, down 20% year-over-year.  Pleased to report that our Enterprise business had its ninth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth, even in a very tough revenue environment, which is obviously evident today in some of our results.  And also strategically, did make a minority investment in the Montr&#xE9;al Canadiens.  Just to give some color now to the Street on that, it's approximately a $50 million investment for a 15 to 20% equity position, and really what's securing the positions that we have today with our brand involvement with the Montr&#xE9;al Canadiens with obviously a leading brand in Qu&#xE9;bec and one that we felt very important to have this relationship relative to the competitive market here in the Province of Qu&#xE9;bec.</p>
          <p>Continued to invest our capital, principally in broadband HSPA on track, as is FTTN on track for the household expansions we've talked about.  Also strategically, our subsidiary Bell Aliant, as you would have noticed, launched an aerial fiber-to-the-home strategy in two markets and we'll obviously be watching that development very carefully and learning also with Bell as we see them successfully roll that out in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Page Seven, on the Wireless side, clearly challenges on the metrics side in the industry.  On gross adds I'm actually relatively pleased seeing them flat year-over-year.  Where we obviously are seeing the impact of the economy, one is in the area of postpaid churn.  I believe that's economy plus competitive areas on smartphones is what we address in the future with HSPA.  And probably the most important metric though here being ARPU, seeing it down year-over-year.  And that's really been driven by, we see three key things, two which we relate to economy, one which we relate to competitive dynamics.</p>
          <p>We saw approximately a $2 reduction in usage on ARPU.  So people are actually using the product less in the economy, from a Voice perspective.  And we saw an important development and that is just in the summer in Canada, roaming revenue has always been important and that had about a $1 dollar impact as the amount of travel going on between the two borders is clearly showing up in roaming revenue, be it Canadians traveling to U.S, or likewise U.S. travelling to Canada.  And I doubt very much that the passport rules have helped in terms of travel and obviously we see some of that impact.  So, those two I would say are economy driven and the other area of ARPU is competitive market development, although that's been largely offset by the Data growth.  And so with, it's hard to know when, but with some comfort, I think two of these three causes are in fact economic and over time should see stability there.</p>
          <p>Wireless Data revenue growth at 28% now represents 17% of our ARPU.  It was the strongest quarter we've had to-date on Data Devices and again look forward to, with the launch of HSPA, even accelerating that Data growth relative to our competitors in the marketplace.  Overall, seeing gross adds increase, ARPU come down, yet being able to actually grow our EBITDA margin while you see gross adds up, shows that clearly it's not just our Wireline business focus on cost management, it's across the Company.  So obviously we like to see the ARPU stability but you can see here hopefully, from an investor perspective, a real, real focus on our Wireless business from cost management as well.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page Eight, on the Voice side, I mentioned already, nice again to see the improvement in our Local Access business on the consumer side. We think that's being driven by our branding work, our service improvement and our winback bundling work in the marketplace.  Worth noting that our Local Access revenue slowed for the fourth quarter in a row, down from 8% Q2, '08 to a decline of 5.8% in Q2, '09.  We are however seeing an acceleration in NAS losses for business.  That is principally driven in our SMB segment and we believe not competitive reasons, but we believe principally the economy.  And we also see that in our toll, where SMB, small, medium business toll, is also less than we had seen in the past, and again we believe economically driven.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page Nine.  We had an excellent quarter in our Video portfolio, a quarter we would just like to bottle and repeat over and over again if possible, having revenue growth like we've seen here with ARPU increase, and most importantly now also seeing net adds of 20,000.  And that's before the impact of the new wholesale agreement that we've entered into with TELUS should start to help us even going forward, with subscriber growth.  Continue to focus on our HD leadership position in the marketplace with seven new channels launching and obviously this product is helping us on a bundling perspective with our Internet and our home phone services.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wireline Data, I think a reasonable quarter in terms of Data Service revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year.  Hardware obviously a different story, but low margin and quite frankly, not a focus of the organization or something that we're concerned with.</p>
          <p>On the Internet side, Residential up a little bit year-over-year, SMB down, so that the net adds, in essence, are up a little bit, but the most important element here is really the Data Revenue growth where we saw an increase in ARPU on the Residential Internet side, of 10% year-over-year. And that's really being driven as clients move from DSL to FTTN, so that our investment in FTTN is starting to pay out as we see subscribers migrate to higher usage and higher ARPU rate plans in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So in summary, looking forward, we obviously want to continue to make measurable progress on our five strategic imperatives.  It's a quarter that clearly, I think, indicates that we are all over our cost management, enabling us to drive the EBITDA growth to 3%, and in this economy revenue continues to be a challenge.</p>
          <p>On the Wireless side, I think we're putting in place the strategic elements for the launch of the 2010 HSPA network. The introduction of Bell Mobility and Virgin to The Source stores will not happen 'til January 1, 2010, even though we've closed that transaction, because they have an exclusive arrangement with Rogers Wireless 'til then.  We will though, by the end of this quarter, have Bell TV in over 500 Source stores, by the end of this quarter and they will begin selling Bell TV's products.  We mentioned already the opportunity on roaming for HSPA and with today's announcement with AT&amp;T we think that bodes well for the future for us in terms of roaming revenue opportunities.</p>
          <p>And again in summary, pleased to be able to announce today's dividend increase, given our outlook for performance the remainder of this year.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Siim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone.  I'll begin with the highlights of our overall financial performance for the quarter on slide 13.  Our top line growth saw a slowdown this quarter that's clearly a reflection of the challenging economic environment we're in.  Fortunately the revenue decline is principally on the product side and as you know, equipment revenues carry a nominal margin.</p>
          <p>Recurring service revenues were essentially stable in both the Wireless and Wireline segments.  We delivered continued solid performance in Video, Residential Internet, IT Connectivity and ICT Services and we saw a continued slowing in the pace of residential line losses which improved for a seventh consecutive quarter.  While we continue to see challenges from the weaker economy in parts of our business, we are encouraged that the economic contraction appears to be on the path to stabilizing and we remain very well positioned in each of our markets.</p>
          <p>Importantly we're executing very well in our cost reduction programs to reduce labor expenses, G&amp;A and discretionary spending.  And with that execution, EBITDA for Bell improved nicely to growth of 3% in the second quarter, and that growth is after the impact of a lower Canadian dollar this year and higher pension costs.  Pension and FX impacted year-over-year EBITDA growth this quarter by approximately $65 million.  In fact I'm pleased to report that this quarter was our best pre-pension EBITDA growth performance in the past five years.</p>
          <p>Margin also improved, expanding by 1.8 points to 40% this quarter, compared with 38.2% in the second quarter last year.  And as George mentioned a moment ago our ability to take out costs &#x2013; costs out of our base is clearly becoming one of our key core competencies.</p>
          <p>On CapEx we increased our spending in the second quarter on planned investments in HSPA, the accelerated rollout of FTTN directly to residential neighborhoods and fiber to MDUs.  And in line with that higher level of investment, Bell's capital intensity ratio increased to 18.7% in quarter. While that's above our full year guidance level of 15 to 16%, we remain right on target on a year-to-date CI basis at 16%.</p>
          <p>A few quick observations on earnings.  Adjusted EPS grew 9.4% year-over-year, or $0.05 per share, driven by our higher EBITDA and the accretion from fewer outstanding BCE common shares.  Depreciation was up, but in line with our expectation, due to the commissioning of the Nimiq 4 satellite late last year and the new Bell campuses.  Our statutory EPS for the second quarter was unchanged year-over-year at $0.45.  That reflects higher restructuring costs which amounted to about $0.13 per share this quarter compared to $0.06 last year. And of course those restructuring costs are incurred to accrue obligations for workforce and real estate downsizing, which will positively impact our performance for future periods.</p>
          <p>We generated $520 million of free cash flow for the quarter, very much on track with our guidance.  So, on balance we delivered a solid financial result with EBITDA and adjusted EPS coming in ahead of guidance for the year and we remain in a very strong position with our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>So, let me turn to our segmented results beginning with Wireless.  Wireless Service revenues were largely stable year-over-year.  This reflected the impact of lower Voice ARPU offset by growth in Data revenues, which George discussed.  So continued traction on the Data side and Wireless, but a significant drag from the economy on overall Service revenue growth.  The highlight in the quarter for Wireless with EBITDA, which grew about 6%, that yielded a 2.8 point improvement in margin to 46.6%, evidencing the benefits of our disciplined spending on subscriber acquisitions and customer retentions as well as tight control over labor costs.  And that performance underlines our continuing commitment to grow our Wireless business with a disciplined focus on profitability.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Wireline segment, Bell Residential Services continued to demonstrate good defensiveness to the economy.  We maintained good momentum in Video and Internet subscriber acquisitions and revenue growth, which contributed to a 9% year-over-year increase in average revenue per household.  The pace of Local revenue, Voice revenue erosion slowed, as George discussed.  Much like the first quarter of this year, we continue experiencing a more challenging environment in our business market. The softer SMB market in Ontario and Qu&#xE9;bec resulted in higher Local Access line disconnections, reduced toll, and fewer installations, and we saw a decline in low margin Network Data equipment sales as SMB customers continued to spend more cautiously.</p>
          <p>In Enterprise, we experienced the continued trend of lower product sales as well.  However, those declines in Connectivity Services as well were offset by good growth in IP Broadband and ITT Services to deliver good overall EBITDA contribution.</p>
          <p>Lastly a very successful quarter in Wireline in terms of labor savings from workforce reductions over the past year and a continued focus on reducing G&amp;A and discretionary spending, to deliver Wireless EBITDA growth of positive 1.7% and a margin increase to 38.1% this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, with adjusted EPS growth over 9% year-over-year in the quarter and close to 5% higher year-to-date, we've got good support for our announcement of the higher common dividend.  I wanted to bring your attention to the effective tax rate for the quarter and our expectation for the balance of the year.  At our February 2009 guidance session, you will recall that I said that with expected favorable tax allowance adjustments from the resolution of tax positions, we projected our effective tax rate for 2009 to be approximately 20%.  It's important for me to point out that these favorable tax adjustments, forecast to be in the range of 0.25 to $0.30 of adjusted EPS, are expected to occur in the second half of the year, but they didn't contribute to our earnings this quarter.  Therefore you should expect to see our effective tax rate in the second half to be significantly lower than in the first half, all of that to get us to the average rate of around 20% for the year that we talked about.</p>
          <p>On Slide 17, free cash flow before common dividends was 520 million for the quarter, bringing our free cash flow for the year-to-date to $792 million, all very much in line with our plan.  Higher year-over-year capital spending of 96 million reflected increased strategic investment in HSPA, our fiber build and our IP backbone network.  And higher year-over-year restructuring payments of 47 million were in respective workforce and real estate reductions.</p>
          <p>We incurred higher year-over-year cash pension funding in the quarter of $41 million, again that's entirely consistent with our plan.  On June 12, the federal government guidelines on temporary relief measures for the funding of solvency deficits were announced.  Those measures extended the solvency funding period from five years to 10 years and they deferred the filing deadline for actuarial valuations with OSFI from June 30 to the end of the 2009 year.  And most importantly we continue to await the outcome of the federal government's consultation process on pensions to see whether any additional policy reform measures are introduced before the end of the year.  And certainly any reform measures would be welcome and represent upside to the funding trajectory that we've provided guidance on.</p>
          <p>On the free cash flow walk-down chart, I highlight the improvements we're making in working capital, which is from a very strong focus in discipline over cash collection.  That effort has brought our receivable balances down and improved the aging of our receivables by approximately four days sales outstanding, or DSOs, year-over-year.  So overall then, we're clearly on track with where we need to be in order to deliver our free cash flow guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. With our focused execution on cost reduction through the first half of the year, the delivery of EBITDA and adjusted EPS ahead of guidance, the completion of The Source and Virgin acquisitions, which will now begin to be fully consolidated into our financial results in the third quarter, and with the confidence in our positioning as we enter the second half we are revising our 2009 financial guidance for revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS upward.</p>
          <p>Our increased revenue guidance from stable to growth in the range of 1 to 2% reflects the impact of the acquisitions as well as a modest step up in Bell's top line trajectory in the second half compared to the first half of 2009.  In terms of EBITDA, we are increasing our guidance from stable to 1 to 2% growth.  This principally reflects our substantial progress on cost reductions and the run rate going forward that will be generated.  It also takes into account some potential margin pressure from higher revenues in the back half of the year, recognizing that any incremental EBITDA from the acquisitions of The Source and Virgin will really be nominal.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our improved outlook for EBITDA, we're now calling for adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.40 and $2.50 per share.  Our free cash flow guidance remains at 1.75 to 1.9 billion for 2009 and takes into account that we will be absorbing higher restructuring costs from the incremental head count reductions we're undertaking.</p>
          <p>I'll point out that our 5% dividend increase maintains our dividend payout ratio within the lower end of our target range of 65 to 75% of adjusted EPS.  And to close on guidance I should mention that our revised ranges are sufficiently broad to allow for the economic uncertainty that we're up against and the competitive dynamics that we see in the marketplace.  So, we live in volatile times and we've set the revised guidance ranges accordingly to give us appropriate headroom for some upside or downside depending on how the rest of the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>Lastly before we move to Q&amp;A, let me take a moment to discuss our solid balance sheet and liquidity position.  During the quarter, we saw an attractive opportunity in the debt capital markets and we raised $1 billion dollars of five-year notes to bolster our strong liquidity position. At an interest rate of 4.85%, that's about 245 basis points below the 2010 debt that we are refinancing. And at June 30, that put Bell into a cash balance of $1.75 billion.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, we are funding the closing of our acquisitions, which amount to approximately $360 million.  We will be early redeeming $600 million of Bell M-16 notes that are due in 2010 and we will be repaying on maturity in December of this year Bell Series EC debentures of 150 million.</p>
          <p>So after free cash flow to be generated in the second half, net of common dividends and some lease repayments, we expect to close 2009 with a cash balance slightly under $1 billion. And of that closing balance, 400 million is earmarked to meet our remaining 2010 debt maturities.  But, with all of that, we project a surplus year-end cash balance of approximately $500 million.</p>
          <p>Now as we execute against our plan in the second half of the year and gain more clarity on our outlook for 2010, we will assess and make determinations on the use of that surplus cash.  Those decisions of course will be consistent with our capital structure objectives and the capital markets model that we've established for the Company.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it back to back to Thane and the operator in order to move to your questions.</p>

As always, I'll be more than happy to answer your questions separately after the call if there are any remaining questions.  So with that, Patrick,  can you please explain the Q&amp;A polling instructions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  George, a question for you about the dividend growth model that you had put up a slide earlier. It seems to me that cost cutting has been a huge benefit for the Company and it's great to see the 7 to 11% EPS growth that you're targeting this year.  But it seems to me that it's harder to replicate going out into the next couple of years -- you have got, incrementally, I suppose there's fewer low hanging fruit on cost cutting, it gets a little bit more challenging.  You're still looking at more competition coming in the Wireless business, fewer tax benefits like you had this year.  And I'm just wondering how do you sustain that dividend growth model when, at least looking out, it seems to me that EPS is going to be challenged to continue growing in positive territory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah well, a couple of things, Jonathan, I appreciate the question because clearly we're, our focus for the shareholder should be obviously beyond this year in running the Company.  A few things.  Clearly, we do have to continue on the strategic imperative of lowering our cost structure continually.  So that's part of that strategy and you're right that it always gets tougher every quarter you go forward, but it is, we continue to see opportunities and we're going to execute on those going forward and into next year as well. That's part of that process.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with the capital intensity ratio that we're running the business at at 16%, you'll notice that our depreciation and amortization is much higher than that, and ultimately if you run the business at that C/I over the years, you get some help that way.  Thirdly, reduction in our debt cost drives the ability for EPS going forward.  And fourth, I'm optimistic and very bullish, in fact, on the launch of our HSPA network and the strategic moves we've made over the last year in our Wireless business that we will be getting our proportionate share of revenue and EBITDA going forward.</p>
          <p>And I think it's fair to say the type of ARPU decline we've seen in the industry, what we're really trying to put our &#x2013; is understand, and I know every analyst is as well, how much is economy and how much is competitive dynamics.  And my &#x2013; our assessment would be, as I mentioned before, really the decline is the economy and the competitive dynamics have been offset by the Data opportunity that we've seen.  And so any stabilization or return to something normal on the economy side or some growth, we think we would anticipate seeing improvement in things like usage and roaming going forward, which we hope will bode well versus flat Service revenue in Wireless, which is clearly not a model we want to drive going into 2010 and 2011.</p>

          <p>Now, if I look at your 2009 guidance, though, it seems to imply that you're expecting a fairly big acceleration in revenue year-over-year through the back half of the year.  Now, I think Siim had mentioned that some of this was due to the acquisitions, but otherwise you are expecting a ramp up.  Is that linked to the future EPS growth, that you are expecting a big acceleration and if so, where is that coming from?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the, really the back half, we think on the core Bell business, the hardware side of that business we continue to think is going to be soft. On the recurring revenue side, our goal continues to try to have stable revenue there, on the recurring revenue.  That's really where, as everyone knows, on the line where the profitability and cash flow is.  And then the real, the uptick is having The Source in our numbers, as Siim just mentioned, in the back half of the year, does give us revenue.  But in fairness, I think everyone knows there's a really minimal EBITDA contribution that comes from that.  That investment is for strategic reasons, for Wireless growth and TV growth into 2010.  So, that the EBITDA growth really isn't off the back of that revenue improvement.  The EBITDA growth is off what we're continuing to do, which is incredible tight cost management in the organization.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much.  Question's on Wireless, and wondering what we might expect for the second half of the year, when you get the Pre and these other smartphones, are you guys going to start to push a lot harder on the COA expense because your results are obviously dramatically different than what we see from Rogers, where they have this huge drag on margins from smartphones, you guys don't seem to be seeing that yet. Is that just something waiting to happen and we should expect to see a little bit of margin pressure as you go through that initial smartphone ramp up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good, I think it's fair to say as we launch HSPA into 2010, there are some smartphone subsidies in that particular portfolio that we're not incurring and we will see some of that, obviously, and we continue to see, by the way, in our smartphone portfolio.  But part of this also is we do &#x2013; we have changed compensation to our distribution channels and what have you, to try to pull some of that back.  And clearly the other side of it from our end is, we absolutely have to keep the head count and network operating expenses really in line so that we can offset things that we may see on either the COA or COM side.</p>
          <p>But I hear your point.  I think, quite frankly, our gross adds, if you compare us to the leader in the market at the moment, we see where the gap is and we think we have strategies to close that gap.  But I do think you are right that there is a higher subsidy on some of the HSPA devices we'll be carrying forward, but that really starts to affect us in 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me shift the question over to the access line count on the consumer side, I mean, obviously on the business side, I think what we are seeing is a continuation of the economy, George, you mentioned that. If there is anything else going on there, please let me know.  But I really want to focus on the consumer side more.  Seems like your trend on improving the year-over-year access line loss continues there.  You mentioned winbacks bundling, particularly with the satellite product.  I am going to judge from that strong subscriber number is the main thing.  Could you indicate whether that in fact is the main impact on the improvement in numbers on the consumer side? There is also a couple of other things that continue to impact that number and I am just wondering what their impact is, what the level of impact has been. One is gross losses to the cable side.  From their numbers, particularly Rogers, it seems like that's declining.  How much of an impact is that having?  And then this issue of Wireless substitution which, we haven't really seen much of in Canada, but in the U.S., clearly it's having a major impact.  Can you give us a sense of those three major impacts on access line losses and whether you think any of those are going to change in 2010 relative to '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'll try to give a quick answer to it.  I mean we have a, everyone knows we have a focus on branding and service and winbacks in that space.  And so we're trying, and every month is a new month, trying to see stability and, and as we've seen here, fortunately, improvement year-over-year in the absolute number of local access lines we've lost.  And obviously our goal will be try to maintain that into 2010 and until we get there, we can't, we'll just have to see what happens.  It's so hard to forecast that.</p>
          <p>The Wireless substitution issue, it is, we've not seen an acceleration and I know it's, I think we talked about it every call and I'm sure we'll continue to talk about it on our every call.  I do think there, if you look at Ontario and the results of our competitor and us, I mean something tells us there may be a little bit of Wireless substitution acceleration that we've seen relative to the past, where some of that -- but it's really not been material yet and so obviously if we see increase in substitution, that's always the challenge on the NAS side.  I think what we're trying to do, as everyone knows, is can we get the number down year-over-year or keep it flat and have it, as everyone knows, be less important, if you will, in our financials as a percent of our revenue base over time.  And that's the number one challenge of every ILEC with a Wireless asset that's there and that's our challenge.  I think we're, on a relative basis, doing fine, but we'd love to do better.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much.  Another question on Wireless.  As we look ahead to 2010 we're going to have three competitors all with essentially identical networks.  The goal clearly is not just to get the new customers who don't have Wireless today, but the very good customers out there who are spending a lot of money.  So, my question is conceptually how do you do that from where you are, given, without disrupting pricing in the market? I know distribution will be improving for you but presumably distribution isn't a key factor in your competitors retaining those customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well Glen, I mean I know you so well.  I think if I unveil that, we'll be unveiling our strategy against our competitor.  I know that's not quite how you mean the question.  I think it's a building blocks issue for us.  We were under distributed.  People do re-buy, we all know, on a 36-month basis.  Literally everyone in Canada turns their handset over and because of contracts, a lot stay with current carriers and because of the quality, quite frankly, of the networks all three offer in Canada, they stay with current carriers. But distribution we think is one element of that, we think the other element of that is branding. We think we're doing some very positive work there.  And we think the third element of that is making sure that our handsets and our network allow high-end users to use those devices everywhere in the world and also to make sure that we're at no disadvantage on handset portfolio and those type of things that we've struggled with over the last year and half, as CDMA has, if you will, begun to run its course.</p>
          <p>We think we'll be in a very different position than we've been in the past there, and I think things like the AT&amp;T roaming agreement, for us are incremental revenue opportunities for us that we never would have seen and frankly are market share opportunities for us on revenue that we're going to work hard on a global basis to accelerate.  And then from then on I think investors will have to watch our performance against the other two and that we think we were putting the building blocks in place to capture, as you know our target's been, a third of the subs, a third of the revenue and a third of the EBITDA, or more than that on the EBITDA side, through better cost management.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we do believe that our capital intensity ratio in Wireless, because of our unique build in Canada with one of our competitors, should permanently be lower than one of our other competitors on a C/I basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful, thanks.  And a follow up on the Voice ARPU decline, we saw, you gave us a bit of a breakdown in the introductory remarks, could you give us a bit of a sense of how much of this sort of decline in usage in Voice there, how much is overage, how much is LD, how much is the recurring monthly fee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually when I said the usage, that actually was usage, not the access fee.  We would view the access fee piece where we would, I will &#x2013; we would bucket the access fee with Access declines in the competitive part I talked about, and that's been more than offset by the Data side.  The real, and so the issues around economy as I mentioned, you've got a couple dollars on the usage side and also on the roaming side, about a dollar.  And that's probably as detailed as I want to go for competitive reasons, but I really wanted investors to understand the separation between economy and competitive dynamics.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Good morning.  George, nice to see the dividend increase.  Can you talk about how you are thinking about balancing dividends versus buybacks and will this represent, is this sort of a one-time mid-year update and will you still retain sort of year-end as being the main focus for any dividend increases?  In other words, is there opportunity at the end of the year for you to revisit the dividend payout again, or are you moving to sort of a mid-year cycle on the dividends?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Siim answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So Simon the way we look at it is that dividend increases need to be funded out of sustainable earnings growth and EPS &#x2013; earnings growth and free cash flow growth, and we believe that we can continue to look at the dividend on a regular basis as we have been doing.  And as our business progresses and delivers on our earnings and free cash flow growth objectives, that we'll have the ability to continue to see dividend increases.  In terms of share buyback, that's really a function of excess cash, free cash flow after preferred and common share dividends.  And the issue for us there is to look at an appropriate balance of investment in the business, maintaining a proper capital structure for the Company and then returning excess cash back to shareholders through our normal course issuer bids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another thing I'll add to it.  We are not moving to a mid-year dividend annual increase model.  You would anticipate at our Investor Day to be clarifying our use of capital for shareholders.  What we did, given the strength we have and our commitment to the shareholders that we are going to return capital when we're within our guidance on EPS, we would have been below that payout ratio and we think that would have been inconsistent with what we actually just shared with everyone in February and that's why we increased the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning.  First question is on the Wireless and it's for George.  You mentioned,  you gave us some very good breakdowns on usage and roaming decline and what caused some of the ARPUs, but it sounds like those are volume driven, but when we look at your results it looks like the MOU that's reported is, continues to be up moderately, I think about 3 to 4% on a year-over-year basis.  Maybe you can just help us sort of reconcile the thinking, like what are some of the moving parts that's within that?</p>
          <p>And then the second part to the question is more longer term, when we look at just the Voice part of Wireless Voice business and when we look at the usage of Bell versus its competitors, when we look at the reported numbers, it continues to be 100, 200 minutes below TELUS and Rogers. It does translate into higher Voice revenue per minute.  So with all the new competition directed at Voice and at the lower end category, just wondering how you would look to protect that revenue stream going forward and then how you can mitigate churn potentially down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think churn mitigation is going to come from the incredible network we launched in the New Year on our quality side, I'm very comfortable with that.  In terms of, back to the key question, on the Voice, you could see MOU expansion.  One of the main reasons is literally every subscriber today takes unlimited evening and weekend rate plans that can be anywhere from $5 to $15 and we always see that on every new add and so that drives your overall MOU.  But within the buckets on the principal time of the days where you actually see the impact and the economy, you have unemployment rise in Canada and people on the business side, where frankly you're close to 100% penetration in the business market, a decline in employment means a decline in use of Wireless and we're seeing that. That's really the view there.</p>
          <p>And then I think on the MOU Voice versus our competitors, I just view that as opportunity for the Company, positioning with the handset portfolio into the future that allows us to access international roaming market in the corporate space in a way that we've been able to do somewhat over the last year and a half with the global BlackBerrys that we have, but not to the fullest extent we'll have as we go forward with our new network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think the gap is primarily driven by roaming, is that sort of how we should look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the gap was also driven by, we were over indexed in some of the low usage categories because of the handset portfolio we had over the years that we've changed in the last 24 months.  The handsets that you carry are a direct function of the ARPU you generate and so we, as people know, over the last two years we've moved our handset portfolio significantly, and we know now it can compete. So we think it's part of that, we think it's distribution, all fronts, we think it was branding and we're working on all those elements and look &#x2013; it's all about results so it will be either in the execution or not and that's what we've got to do going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much.  Good morning, George.  As a leader who's built his strong reputation on Wireless profitability, I'm wondering how you feel about the smartphone subsidy model in Canada, in particular given the fact that one, subsidies now seems to be recurring in nature with carriers offering upgrades just a year off to the previous purchase, which is subsidized, to the new $99 iPhones in the market, which seems to be putting a lot of pressure on other smartphone pricing.  Verizon reduced virtually all their smartphones to $99 last weekend.  And three, some of your own very aggressive pricing in the market, particularly targeted against Rogers, I think you have a $45 <mark type="inaudible" /> price for Voice as well as Data,  Does this really make any economic sense in your mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would never do something that doesn't make economic sense.  So, then that's the first principle. Probably should end on the start on that and on your ending comment.  I think the EBITDA margin we're generating in our Wireless business speaks for itself around our view of cost controls and how you try to get a balance.  I think we got all of the balances right because ARPU, obviously if ARPU had improved not because of the economy, I think we'd have a different view of where we were standing, but that's economic.</p>
          <p>In terms of the competitive dynamic on smartphone, I think we've all seen it, I mean it is a expensive product that brings about an improvement in ARPU, but upfront is a high COA.  And quite frankly, that's not dissimilar to what we all saw seven or eight years ago, I guess probably ten years ago now, when we migrated from analog to digital.  Those who've been in the industry for years will remember subsidies quite frankly equivalent to today's smartphone subsidies.  And over time smartphone competition will increase as there'll be more smartphones in the market and that subsidy for competitive reasons will come down.</p>
          <p>We're in a unique position right now where the market is dominated by a very few on the smartphone side and I think over time, I think like the Palm Pre and other products in the market are what you are going to have to look to to see some of that change.  Clearly, upgrading clients who are on contracts, on a 12-month cycle, is a challenging model and we're not doing a lot of that, and frankly EBITDA growth in the industry speaks for itself.  And so, if we don't see EBITDA growth in Wireless, you'll see people have to adjust their strategies and I think that's where shareholders should take some confidence in Bell and its track record in knowing how to drive EBITDA growth in Wireless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a quick follow-up, George, to your ARPU comments, you said that a lot of the ARPU pressure is because of the economy and that will improve and that Data was offsetting SAF.  My observations in response are, don't you think that as the economy improves, you're also unfortunately going to have new entrants coming in as well as continued dilutions in your discount brands, isn't that going to offset the economic improvements?  And while Data may be replacing SAF, isn't it true to say the Data margins are a bit lower than the 100% margin you get off SAF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I agree with every one of your points.  I think the only, the point is I don't think investors should be buying Wireless in Canada on an increasing ARPU model which we saw for years.  I think the issue is, to your point, the trick here is, can you not have a declining ARPU as you go forward in a competitive environment?  Data offset that. Then you've got to run other costs to buy tough, to offset your point on margin on Data.  So I'm certainly not going to say the model's easier, it's got trickier going forward and we got to manage to that.</p>
          <p>And the last thing, the, you asked about pricing in the marketplace.  There is some aggressive pricing in Toronto right now and ours is completely, as anybody who's followed will know, it's a direct competitive response in the market and we'll continue to be competitive and respond accordingly and through that, that means you have to be the leader in cost reductions and we're clearly that and we'll continue to be that.</p>

George, you talked about some of the early benefits on your FTTN network, can you talk a bit more about the &#x2013; your strategic plans longer term for that in relation to, I guess what Aliant is doing with the FTTH?  And tied to that, obviously your thoughts on the competitive environment given the DOCSIS 3.0 <mark type="inaudible" /> we're seeing from I guess most of your competitors at this point?</p>

          <p>Yeah, we continue to see and I'll come back to that.  I appreciate the question on the Bell-Aliant initiative.  On FTTN our goal, as we talked about, is to continue to add footprint.  We see a number of things on the FTTN footprint.  We see a reduction in churn and increase in usage and an increase in ARPU and we're very comfortable with our FTTN strategy.  With the rollout of the technology we have the capability for an IPTV rollover when we feel appropriate, or layover when we feel appropriate.  And so we feel pretty comfortable there.</p>
          <p>I would say the fiber-to-the-prem on aerial, Aliant has a very unique footprint in North America that, we couldn't find another footprint that was 92%, I think that's the number, 92% aerial for Aliant, and I have to be -- if we were 92% aerial at Bell Canada, we too would be looking at that strategy that Karen  is pursuing.  Now what we are going to do, there are some of our markets today that we haven't done FTTN and aren't in our current FTTN projection that ultimately are more aerial and  the cost model that Karen puts in place at Aliant will be one that we'll follow really carefully and may give us an opportunity to expand our Broadband footprint in a way we hadn't seen a few years ago because of the prohibitive cost of fiber, even with aerial at that point.  When you get into a less dense population in fact, there is a bit of a crossover we think we're seeing where the fiber direct-to-the-home through aerial may be just as effective as the fiber-to-the-node.  So, I would stay tuned for us to look at that; it doesn't mean we're changing our FTTN approach at all.</p>

          <p>Well, we've got to compete with it, obviously, in the marketplace and meet the demands of the customer and that is what the FTTN strategy is driven by, and ultimately through bonding strategies, is driven through that and that's what we're going to have to do to compete with it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for taking the question.  George, perhaps you could talk about, you've talked a lot about cost reduction, but I'd like to know how the costs trended though the year, the first half of the year and how they would compare to the second half of the year, and I noticed, I think Siim brought up the point that there's an additional 300 employee savings out of the converting your Enterprise and SMB and your Bell West initiative.  Is there more to come on that front and how much could we expect in the back half of 2009 and perhaps run rate going into 2010?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you quite all that Peter, but just to give you a sense, I mean you may recall, if you were on the call, we had a retirement program we put in place, an offer that we put in place at the beginning of the year.  Most of those people will actually leave the Company at the end of this year.  And so we actually will see a continual reduction in number of people in the organization through that program that we put in place, and added to that is the point you've raised on top of that, is the integration that we're doing from July 4, on our SMB enterprise Bell West.  And then quite frankly we are not adding, as resources leave the Company through someone wanting to work somewhere else or just leave the industry, we're also not adding resources back anywhere on a management perspective, in the Company.</p>
          <p>And so that's what you will see and then the 100-day plan work continues to flow through because the 100-day plan was launched last year, you may recall, in July and a lot of those reductions only began to show up in October-November.  So some of that benefit flows through the remainder of this year as well.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Further to that, George, what's your normal attrition rate and is it specific to management, you are talking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not going to give you that, but just the point, I think to try to give investors comfort is, we're comfortable with the guidance on EBITDA and people can tell that that's principally being driven through cost. When we're talking about revenue on the Services side, being pretty, trying to drive that flat, you can tell that we're doing it on the cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much, George.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add that in our earnings guidance we, back in February had talked about restructuring costs due to work force reductions in the range of 250 to 300 million.  We now expect with the additional retirement incentive programs that we've announced, that that number will be in the 350 to $400 million range.  It obviously doesn't change our overall guidance with respect to adjusted earnings and in terms of the cash restructuring costs, those haven't changed either, because of the timing of exits, we still see the overall cash restructuring and other costs as being in the range of about 375 million for the total year.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question is from Rob Goff, Haywood Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  It's Rob.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi, Rob.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trying something new.  A question for you on the AT&amp;T deal, can you go over the mechanics of it in terms of traffic volumes on the inbound component of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure as best I can.  We have a roaming range that we've entered into with AT&amp;T which we're absolutely thrilled about.  We think this is very important for us.  It gives our customers access to clearly the leading network on the HSBA side in the U.S. and more importantly for us, future HSPA subscribers who buy handsets in the U.S. when we turn on our network will have the opportunity to roam on to Bell, in the U.S., I mean in Canada, and so ultimately that will be revenue for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so is this in terms of exclusivity here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No comments on exclusivity, it's a roaming agreement.  We just really look forward to having customers who buy products in the U.S., when we turn on the HSPA network, roam on Bell Canada in Canada.</p>
