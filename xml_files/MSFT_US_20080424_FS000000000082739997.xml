        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon everyone. The strength of our first quarter results demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model. As you will see, our broad span across geographies, product categories and customer segments is a tremendous asset in any economic environment and produced third quarter results of 14% revenue growth normalized for the tech guarantee and 27% earnings per share adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits, beating our earnings per share guidance by $0.02 to $0.04.</p>
          <p>Let me mention a few highlights of our third quarter performance before turning to guidance. When looking at the drivers of revenue growth this quarter, it's clear that we are reaping the benefits of the diversification of our business. In the first two quarters of the year our core business of Client and the Microsoft Business Division significantly outperformed our expectations. In this quarter the Entertainment and Devices Division drove our results. Despite the tough economic environment this has allowed us to deliver consecutive earnings per share growth of 29%, 32% and 27% this year adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth in the Client and Microsoft Business Division businesses when normalized for the prior year results, for the impacts of the tech guarantee and retail launch spikes had combined growth of $700 million or 9%.</p>
          <p>Server and Tools had yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth while kicking-off our largest enterprise product launch in the company's history. Our consumer businesses of Entertainment and Devices Division and Online Services business grew revenue a combined 57% or over $850 million. And the treasury department continued its excellent work delivering investment income exceeding our forecast and managing to avoid any significant write-offs in our portfolio despite the massive dislocation in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we expect a strong finish to what has been an excellent year. Revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year remain largely inline with our January guidance and significantly above our expectations upon entering the year. Since this time last year, our revenue outlook for fiscal year '08 has increased by about $3 billion, operating income margins are expected to expand by over a point and earnings per share guidance is higher by $0.18.</p>
          <p>On a more macro level there has been some uncertainty regarding the strength of the IT spending environment, but our businesses has remained robust in the face of that uncertainty. While, clearly no business can be immune from the impacts of an economic slowdown we remain confident in the benefits of our diversified business model and the investment approach we have taken in recent years.</p>
          <p>We've delivered earnings per share results above the high-end of our guidance every quarter this year, and have raised our full year earnings per share guidance in each quarter. We are now expecting earnings per share growth of 33 to 35%, this year normalized for legal charges and tax benefit, which is an outstanding achievement in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>With those high level themes, I'm going to turn over the call to Colleen for more details of our third quarter performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Chris. It was an excellent quarter with normalized revenue and operating income growth of 14% and 15% respectively. Normalized EPS growth at 27% was five points above high-end guidance; revenue growth was driven by continued enterprise customer demand for our core products, as well as consumer demand for products and services in the Entertainment and Devices Division and our Online Services business.</p>
          <p>Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue. I will discuss top-line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I will review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter last year unless otherwise specified.</p>
          <p>Revenue was $14.5 billion adjusting the year ago quarter by the 1.7 billion of revenue recognition primarily related to the technology guarantee program for Windows Vista and Office 2007, total revenue grew 14%.</p>
          <p>We estimate PC unit growth rates moderated from our January expectations by a couple of points in mature markets partially offset by an extra point of strength in emerging market resulting in an estimate of approximately 8 to 10% for the entire PC market during the quarter. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, 30% from multiyear agreements, 25% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses.</p>
          <p>Annuity sales mix continues to increase on both the year-over-year and sequential basis while Enterprise Agreement renewal rates were in line with historical trends. As we guided our unearned revenue balance was consistent with historical seasonality patterns and remained roughly flat on a sequential basis at $12.1 billion up 18% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our contracted not billed balance remained above $11.5 billion, and increased sequentially up well over $1 billion from where we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company grew 14%.</p>
          <p>Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment, starting with Client. Client revenue of $4 billion was down 24% or down 2% adjusted for the tech guarantee. Adjusting that further for a retail launch bump from last year Client revenue would have been up 4%.</p>
          <p>Let's break down the main drivers behind Client revenue first for OEM license units and then for OEM revenue. During the quarter, our OEM license units increased by 5% about 4 points lower than the overall hardware market. We believe this reversal of the OEM unit trend, outpacing that of the PC market, was primarily driven by three factors. One, last year OEMs particularly in the system builder channel rebuilt inventories levels following the launch of Windows Vista, driving OEM unit growth over 20% during that quarter and making it a tough comp.</p>
          <p>Two, inventory levels at our OEM partners this year were higher than normal exiting fiscal Q2 impacting this quarter's purchases.</p>
          <p>Three, we believe there was an increase in shipments of unlicensed PCs, particularly in Asia. While we feel generally feel good about the gains we are making against piracy for the year, piracy is a tough battle and an area where we will need to continue investing in order to make progress.</p>
          <p>Looking past the individual quarters, PC market growth was up 12 to 14% year-to-date with OEM license units growing about a point faster, which is inline with our historical rate of progress against piracy. OEM revenue declined 25%, but grew a point when normalized for the tech guarantees in the prior year.</p>
          <p>The four percentage point difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth was caused by two roughly equivalent factors, namely the increasing volume in emerging markets, and a channel shift to large OEMs from the system builder channel. Partially offsetting these impacts was an increase in premium mix.</p>
          <p>Premium mix grew five points during the quarter to 76% driven by an increase in the consumer element of the mix, while the business portion was unchanged. The remaining roughly 20% of client revenue comes from the commercial and retail licensing portion of the business, which declined 18% or was down 13% after adjusting for tech guarantees.</p>
          <p>Normalizing last year's Windows Vista launch bump at approximately $225 million, growth would have been up 23%. We continued to see healthy growth in the commercial portion of the business and sales and software assurance were once again strong as evidenced by the 29% increase in the client volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. Since the launch of Windows Vista revenue for the Client business has grown 16% with a licenses growth rate of one to two points above that of the PC hardware market. Over 140 million licenses of Windows Vista have been sold life to-date and Service Pack 1 was released in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to Server and Tools, revenue of $3.3 billion represented an increase of 18% marking its 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Customers continued to gravitate towards premium versions of Windows Server and SQL Server as well as to annuity contracts.</p>
          <p>The increased billing mix of annuity contracts drove the unearned revenue balance for the division up by over 35% versus last year. Our consulting and support services revenue increased 24% as we've experienced high demand following the recent launches across our product line. The third quarter also marked the launch activities for the new versions of our flagship products in the Server and Tools division namely Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. These products bring powerful new tools to our customers and partners looking to turn their IT departments into a strategic asset.</p>
          <p>For example Windows Server 2008 with virtualization technology will help customers increase reliability and flexibility of their server infrastructure, reduce costs and increase security. Online Services business grew revenue 40% to $843 million this included $143 million from the addition of aQuantive. Online advertising grew 39% or was up 29% excluding the $47 million of ad revenue from aQuantive.</p>
          <p>Our online audience continues to grow. Live IDs increased 18% to 448 million, while usage deepened with search queries and page views up from the prior year. In the quarter, we announced a number of acquisitions including Caligari for collaborative 3-D modeling, YaData for customer micro segment management and Rapt for behavioral targeting. And of course in February we proposed to purchase Yahoo!. Chris will go into more detail about Yahoo! later in the call.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Business Division revenue was $4.7 billion down 2% but up 9% adjusted for tech guarantees in fiscal year 2008. Adjusted for last year's retail launch bump of about $150 million, revenue would have grown 13% with business customer revenue growth of 17%. Our expanded portfolio of productivity products are thriving with SharePoint revenue up over 35%, Unified Communications up over 20% and Dynamic Customer Billing up 13%.</p>
          <p>On the strategic front we announced the acquisition of Fast Search &amp; Transfer to enhance our enterprise search offerings. During the quarter we also held our SharePoint and Convergence conferences which both saw record attendance by customers and partners. And we expanded on our software plus services vision by announcing that the beta of SharePoint Online and Exchange Online will be open to companies of all sizes.</p>
          <p>Entertainment and Devices Division grew revenue 68% to $1.6 billion, over $300 million above our high-end guidance driven by the sale of 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles. High holiday demand for Xbox 360 consoles during the preceding quarter in which Xbox 360 outsold PlayStation 3 by over 1 million units in the US led to a short channel inventory for much of this quarter. However, according to US NPD data by March Xbox 360 had reclaimed its monthly console sales lead over the PS3.</p>
          <p>With retail inventory restored to more healthy levels Xbox 360 is well positioned as the industry anticipates next weeks launch of Grand Theft Auto IV. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Danger which closed last week and announced the November target release date for Gears of War, the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest selling video game of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased by $370 million primarily driven by higher Xbox 360 console sales, growth in our consulting business, expansion of data center operations and the addition of aQuantive costs. After adjusting the year ago quarter for the impact of tech guarantees, cost of revenue held flat at 17% of sales.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased almost $1.9 billion or up 33% primarily due to $1.4 billion of legal charges relating to the European Commission fine assessed in February. Adjusting for that charge in the current quarter and $150 million of legal charges in the same quarter of last year, operating expenses increased $600 million up 11%. This is favorable to our expectations due to lower head count driven cost and some shift of marketing expense into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating income was $4.4 billion, after adjusting for the impact of tech guarantees and legal charges, operating income grew 15% one point faster than revenue growth. Investment income and other totaled $401 million for the quarter as the treasury team continued to do an outstanding job in challenging capital markets.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%. During the quarter we settled a 2000 to 2003 examination with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our previously accrued tax provision by $1.4 billion which was partially offset by the non-tax deductibility of the European Commission fine resulting in our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we repurchased 30 million shares or $1 billion of company stock and paid out over $1 billion in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.4 billion, down 4% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.47 which was $0.02 to $0.04 above our guidance after adjusting for the offsetting impact of the $0.15 EPS charge from the European Commission fine and the $0.15 EPS benefit from the resolution of the tax examination.</p>
          <p>So in summary, our diversification across geographies, product lines, customer segments and product lifecycles produced 14% top-line and 27% bottom-line growth. This allowed us to generate over $7 billion of operating cash flow, the second highest level in the history of Microsoft.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our fourth quarter guidance and our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Colleen. I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of our expectations for the fourth quarter, followed by a preliminary view of fiscal 2009. I also note that we have about twice the number of people on the call as normal, so for some of the newcomers I'll also make some brief comments on our proposed acquisition of Yahoo!.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. We have assumed the following macroeconomic conditions for the reminder of the year. We expect the software spending environment to remain mixed with positive overall on a global basis, especially for the positioning of our products and the value they offer.</p>
          <p>Like you, we're cautious on the reported economic softness in the US, but at this point we have not seen any significant spill-over to our businesses. We continue to benefit from strong underlying growth in non-US and emerging markets which has also been assisted by stronger international currencies.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, we expect PC hardware unit growth of 9 to 11%. Growth will continue to be driven by strength in emerging markets; however, we are tempering our forecast for growth rates in mature markets.</p>
          <p>To go through our detailed fourth quarter guidance, and year-over-year growth rates, we expect revenue of 15.5 to $15.8 billion representing excellent growth of 16 to 18% over fiscal 2007. Revenue guidance by business unit is as follows: for Client we expect revenue growth of 7 to 11% for the fourth quarter. The guidance assumes OEM units will grow in line to slightly ahead of the PC hardware market and underlying PC market dynamics in the consumer and emerging market segments will drive OEM unit growth in excess of OEM revenue.</p>
          <p>Server and Tools revenue should grow 18 to 20% in the fourth quarter. We expect corporate demand for our server products to remain strong, which will drive double-digit growth across the breadth of our server platform products and services.</p>
          <p>For the Online Services business, we forecast revenue to be up 37 to 41% for the fourth quarter. Microsoft Business Division revenue should grow 15 to 16% on continued demand for the 2007, Office Suite, SharePoint and Office Communication Server. Lastly Entertainment and Devices Division revenue is expected to grow 32 to 34% driven by strong demand for Xbox 360 consoles and games.</p>
          <p>Turning back to company wide performance, operating income for the fourth quarter is expected to be between 5.8 and $6.2 billion, representing 46 to 54% growth over the prior year, which included the Xbox 360 warranty charges. Excluding those charges, operating income should grow a very healthy 15 to 22%. Fully diluted earnings per share expected to come in at $0.45 to $0.48 for the fourth quarter and this guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 30%.</p>
          <p>So, with our fourth quarter guidance, we arrive at the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2008: revenue of 60.1 to $60.3 billion representing year-over-year growth of 17 to 18%. Operating income of 22.6 to $23 billion, excluding the European Commission fine of 1.4 billion this quarter, operating income would have been 24 to $24.4 billion. And for fully diluted earnings per share, we expect $1.87 to $1.90, representing growth of 33 to 35% when normalized for legal charges and tax benefits.</p>
          <p>With the close of the Fast Search &amp; Transfer acquisitions since the last time we provided you with guidance in January, we've updated our fiscal year '08 guidance to include an estimate of about $50 million of in process R&amp;D and integration costs related to the acquisition. From balance sheet perspective, we are maintaining our previous forecast of total unearned revenue balance to finish fiscal 2008 up 14 to 16% over prior years. Contracted but not billed, should also finish 2008 up from current levels.</p>
          <p>With that, let's turn our current thinking about the next fiscal year. Remember this represents our preliminary view prior to completing our internal budgeting and planning process, which occurs during the fiscal fourth quarter. This guidance does not include any impacts from our proposed acquisition of Yahoo!.</p>
          <p>Our current forecast for fiscal 2009 revenue is 66.9 to $68.0 billion, which represents growth of 11 to 13%. On an absolute basis this represents an increase of approximately 7 to $8 billion of incremental revenues. We expect operating income to be between 26.7 and $27.4 billion or growing 18 to 19%. Excluding the European Commission fine in fiscal 2008, operating income is expected to grow roughly in line with revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Although the mix of our COGS and operating expense of business is still preliminary, we expect operating income margins to remain generally flat year-on-year, which includes the impact of that $0.5 billion of additional expenses related to recently announced acquisitions including Fast and Danger, which were not in our forecast when we saw many of you in New York in February. We look forward to providing more detail on the fiscal '09 investments on our fourth quarter earnings call and our fiscal Analyst Meeting on July 24th.</p>
          <p>So, for the rest of the income statement, we expect investment income to be lower in fiscal '09 due to lower yield from the investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rate environment, but we're also modeling a decline in our tax rate to 28% in fiscal 2009 driven by continued shift in our earnings mix towards lower tax rate jurisdictions. We expect fully diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19, representing growth of 14 to 15%.</p>
          <p>As always, I'll remind you to think about the guidance that we have provided. You must also consider the risks. These include competitors, legal, execution and general market risks such as foreign exchange movements, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spending, changes in the piracy rates for our products, and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license-only can have an impact on revenue, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods.</p>
          <p>I'd like to wrap up with a couple of final comments. First, as you consider the performance we are delivering in fiscal 2008 and the preliminary view of fiscal '09, they're great examples of the growth model we've had for the company, which I've outlined previously. It begins by focusing on the growth opportunities where we can differentiate ourselves through software, in particular business IT spending, but also increasingly online advertising and consumer entertainment.</p>
          <p>Add to that a truly global approach to our sales, two-thirds of our revenue driven from users outside of the US and about 15% in high growth emerging markets. These opportunities set the stage for healthy broad-based revenue growth across our businesses. That revenue growth allows us to reinvest into our existing business, pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities while continuing to grow operating profits.</p>
          <p>Operating profits, combined with reductions in our share count and improvements in our tax rates drive earnings per share growth. If we achieve the guidance we have outlined today over the three-year period through fiscal year '09, during one of the most difficult economic environments we've faced we will grow earnings per share approximately 80%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, before handing the call back to Colleen I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposal to acquire Yahoo!. With or without a Yahoo! combination, Microsoft is focused on the online advertising market, which is expected to double by 2010 to $80 billion. Although Yahoo! would accelerate our efforts, we have an existing strategy that is already centered three key pillars. Drive, innovation in search, increase value to advertisers and publishers through renovation and scale and grow user engagement across our MSN and Windows Live properties. We have an extremely talented engineering team, a great portfolio of advertiser and publisher tools and key assets in information content, communications and social networking. Lastly, we're committed to compete in online advertising through organic investments, partnerships and acquisitions, such as aQuantive and Rapt.</p>
          <p>With respect to Yahoo!, we've been clear as evidenced in the size of our offer premium that speed is of the essence for the deal to make sense and get folded into our online strategy. Unfortunately the transaction has been anything but speedy, and has been characterized by what would appear to be unrealistic expectations of value. Our initial offer was an extremely generous more than 100% premium for Yahoo!'s core business and our view on value is shaped by the long-term value of the company and we intend to remain disciplined in our approach.</p>
          <p>The strongest argument that I've heard on why we should increase our bid, simply that we can afford to, is not one that I favor. We've yet to see tangible evidence that our bid substantially undervalues the company. In fact, we see the opposite, Yahoo! continues to lose search share and profitability continues to decline year-on-year. The results that they announced on Tuesday were in line with the guidance that they gave on their last earnings call on January 29th after which their stock price closed at $19.05 and Wall Street analysts' consensus on value was significantly decreased.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our recent letter to the Yahoo! board, unless we make progress with Yahoo! towards an agreement by this weekend, we will reconsider our alternatives. We will provide updates as appropriate next week. These alternatives clearly include taking an offer to Yahoo! shareholders or to withdraw our proposal and focus on other opportunities, both organic and inorganic.</p>
          <p>But that being said, I would like to remind you that we are here today to discuss our earnings and we hope you understand that we can't go beyond in the Q&amp;A session what I've just said.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand the call back to Colleen. So, we can get started taking your questions. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. I know it's early, but I was wondering if we could maybe dive a little bit into your fiscal '09 guidance, in particular you are calling for something around 12% revenue growth here. With the US economy looking like it's getting weaker it doesn't sound like you have included any kind of recession in your forecasting, but can you maybe characterize your view of your business and how insulated it would be from a US based downturn and how solid that number looks, if the economy starts to get weaker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure Charlie. The first thing to comment on is in line with some of the prepared remarks that we made. One of the great things about our business from my perspective is the diversification and the diversification across geographies and across business types. So, clearly we, like everyone else, would be impacted by an economic downturn if one was to get worse from where it is, but we have built in what we consider to be an appropriate level of conservatism at this stage for next year. And I'd just remind you that 2/3 of our business is now outside the US and some portion around 15% is in very strong growth emerging markets. So, a very good geographic spread and also clearly a weak US dollar helps us in that perspective.</p>
          <p>The other thing to mention is this year would be one year that most people would say has been one of relatively difficult economic conditions. So, this is a year where if we finish out along the guidance that we've talked about, we will have grown revenue by 17 to 18% and earnings per share by 33 to 35%. So, if we can turn in a performance like that in what a lot of people are finding to be a particularly difficult year then that gives me a lot of confidence in our business model going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon guys. Chris, the FY '09 EPS guidance is quite robust. So, could you give us a sense of what does that assume in terms of the investment required for your goals in the Online Services business. And if for whatever reason you don't get Yahoo!, do you have to come back and revise down the margin for a build versus a buy decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, see, there is a reasonable amount of additional growth in our expense line for the Online already embedded into fiscal year '09, Sarah. So, we will obviously give you more detail in three months because we haven't completed our internal budgeting. But if you look at the makeup of the expense growth then it's around 20 to 25% of that growth will be to drive our Online Services division and for those final numbers to be determined in the next three months. The balance of, we'll go into, other high growth areas in the other divisions, into things like building our sales force in particular outside of the US. And then we're getting other impacts like FX and so forth coming in as well. But, there is already a reasonably high proportion of expense growth allocated to the Online Services area and also in terms of CapEx, we're expecting to spend more next year, and that's embedded in our numbers as well, than this year. So clearly if Yahoo! was to happen, we'd have to overlay that impact, we would still think about spending, I would think virtually all of that money in terms of organic growth anyway. If Yahoo! wasn't to happen, could we consider other investments? Yes, but we'll cross that bridges when we come to it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds great. And just one very quick one, the currency impact on the quarter, could you just give us a sense for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, around 3% benefit, both on the revenue and the expense side, so if you like, in the expenses it's a negative sort of 3% impact, broadly speaking in both revenue and expenses.</p>

          <p>And the next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks Chris and Colleen. Two quick ones, I know piracy is a difficult thing to solve for each quarter, but I know your comps here are getting tough in the second half of calendar year '08. So, how should we think about your progress &#x2013; the progress you made in the second half of '07, how much of a tough comp does that give for the Client business than in the second half of '08?</p>
          <p>And then my follow-up question was just about the buybacks, I believe I read in your Q, you cut them to about $1 billion this quarter. Should we expect that level to stay until we know the outcome of the Yahoo! transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Yeah starting with piracy, you're right, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and I've talked to you and other investors about this. It's difficult to look on piracy on a quarter-by-quarter because we can see individual enforcement actions make a big difference in any one quarter. So, we had a very good performance in the first two quarters of the year. The first and second quarter of our fiscal year; a relatively weak performance, in fact it was a negative in this quarter. So, overall for the year we still think that we will drive unit growth 1 to 2% higher than underlying market growth as a result of our combating piracy. But relative to the first couple of quarters when we had very good performance that's a little lower.</p>
          <p>So we still think it's a positive trend overall but you are correct. It does get progressively harder. In this particular quarter we had a couple of distributors had a particularly high distribution of unlicensed PCs in China due to some market conditions there. You can have that sort of one-off impact. So it's much better to look at it on a year-by-year rather than a quarter-by-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to understand that topic because that means that in the September and December quarter of calendar year '08, you have got pretty tough comps. I mean, is that the situation where we should expect your OEM to be below PC shipments for you guys? For your revenue to grow less than PC shipments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are talking about for the fourth quarter or for the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm talking about for September and December given the tough comps you have. September and December of '08 you have got tough comps in piracy versus September and December of '07?</p>
          <p>'</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the next year but I just don't want to get into...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...too much guidance. We still think that we will grow units more than PC demand. But for the same you'll get the same impact that you've seen for this year which is to the extent it grows faster in emerging than mature markets etcetera, then revenue will be slightly lower than unit growth and that will probably wash-out to mean that your revenue will be broadly in line or slightly just slightly below overall market growth. But, we still think that our unit growth will be higher than market growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the buyback question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the buyback, yes, you are correct; it was low this quarter in particular because of the Yahoo! transaction. I want to maintain the most amount of flexibility for that transaction in terms of our cash build up and how the final transaction might work if it does. Therefore I don't tend to get into quarter-by-quarter and I don't want to get specific but also we just from a legal perspective it's difficult for us to be too active in the buyback market, so I would expect us to be relatively modest from a buyback perspective until we get clarity on Yahoo! one way or the other.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. A couple of questions, one is &#x2013; when you just look at the guidance philosophically Chris. Compared to the last couple of years at the same time of the year when we were giving guidance for the upcoming year, I think guidance has been generally either below consensus or bracketing consensus, seemingly conservative giving you the opportunity to outperform as you execute on your model. I am just curious this time around, I think the guidance test certainly is, I think as Charlie indicated in his question assumes some US actually a reasonable level of execution on the revenue side range of 12% growth, but I am wondering on the earnings side, if you were not giving enough flexibility for potential spending in the online business, if the Yahoo! transaction were not to come through. Just philosophically, I guess my question is how do you think about guidance relative to the trend? It seems like there is a bit of a change here. I am just curious what your thought process there is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure there is a few trends you've referred to there, so I will try and take them in turn. From a revenue point of view, as I mentioned to Charlie, I feel very good about our revenue forecast, 11 to 13% for next year. I think that's very good in the current economic environment and as I see it, I think that is a testament to the strength of our particular investment model &#x2013; business model and also the fact that we have made a lot of investments in the past. We've talked to investors about the benefits of those investments and I think that is starting to pay. Clearly in this year where we have driven revenue by over 16% and next year 11 to 13 feels very good. So I feel good on the revenue side.</p>
          <p>On the operating expense side, I think we're making at this stage plenty of provision for what I consider to be appropriate OpEx, not just on the Online Services, but across the whole business. So, I don't feel bad that, we are leaving anything out there. Clearly, if we were to make another acquisition or to acquire Yahoo!, that does change the game, but in terms of allowing us to do what we want to do organically and through some level of acquisition, not only on Online Services, but in other businesses, I feel good about the level that we have built-in at this stage.</p>
          <p>And overall earnings per share growing 14 to 15%, I guess some assumptions there about buybacks and investment income. I mentioned the tax rate is starting to come down and I talked about this at the last of couple of financial analyst meetings, that we are now in a period where you can expect to see our tax rate start to go down year-after-year, not only in fiscal year '09, but in fiscal year '10 as well as a result of the changes in our business model. So, if you look at the individual parts of guidance for fiscal year '09, at this stage I feel they're hanging together very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also the bookings growth rate that coming in at 14%. Do you think Chris that is more indicative of what we should expect over the few quarters, because I think, and right after the product launches you had 30%. And then it looks like we've seen some deceleration, but is this the real run rate going forward given that we're entering a more matured aspect of the product cycle?  Thanks a lot, that's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you would expect over the long term, bookings growth and overall revenue growth to be broadly the same as each other. So, if we can continue to get bookings growth excluding Vista unearned impact, but general bookings growth in the mid-teens, that would support low to mid-teens revenue growth, if that's a mature part of the cycle, then it's pretty healthy from my perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a follow-up to Heather's question, and it has to do with the anti-piracy efforts. First, the September, December quarters we saw some big benefits from that, and actually seemed to take us by surprise and you by surprise in this quarter, that looks to have reversed. Chris, you mentioned, I guess government crackdowns and, we had heard some of those in the second half of last year. Is there any other color you can give us on that, because, trying to understand this and obviously, it's going to be a fight as you move along, but if it's always going to be, kind of you get foot, and you give up a yard kind of thing, just trying to figure out what you see in Asia, this quarter, why would it sort of reverse?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly on that, I'm just curious why you expect an acceleration of PC growth into the next quarter especially given the macroeconomic backdrop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, on piracy or more particularly unlicensed shipments, which to a large extent becomes pirated, you are true that on a quarter-by-quarter basis it can move around quite a lot. And hopefully you recall particularly in the first quarter that I said, don't take too much from this positive number, you can get an aberration like this on a quarterly basis, and you could have a negative one by implication and that's what we've seen this quarter. So again I just reinforce, you really need to look at things like piracy on a long term basis and average them out to really get a sense of how it's happening. In the first quarter in particular we saw a very strong performance in our Russian subsidiary, which helped enormously when you spread that volume over the total business.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, in China because of some specific market dynamics that happened in that country, you saw a relatively negative performance. You've got to wash those things out. You've got to look at it on the course of the year. We still think for the year, we're going to have PC unit growth of 11 to 13%. We think we're going to ship our units of 12 to 14. So we still think we're going to pick up 1 maybe 2% of shipment growth relative to overall market growth and that washes out the unders and overs and that's how I prefer to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to put that into a little more context too on the unlicensed PC aspect, John, just keep in mind that when we were looking at the PC units, OEM units that was one of three factors that we've talked you through in bridging that. That is one of three factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of overall PC demand, what I would say is we started the year believing that we were going to have about 9 to 11% in terms of unit shipments. The third quarter came in at 8 to 10. So, broadly speaking it was in line with where we started the year. It was a little bit weaker in mature markets, which I think picks up some of the economic issues that we're seeing in particular in the US, but it was stronger in emerging markets. So the mix was different to what we thought, but the overall market was about in line 1% low, which is a rounding error really, to where we started the year. What we saw really was a particularly strong performance in Q1 and Q2. So it's difficult to continue to extrapolate an out performance, 8 to 10 I don't feel bad about and if we can end the year at  11 to 13 which is how we feel relative to a starting point of 9 to 11. We still feel that's a good robust year, but obviously on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Again, you can read too much into an individual quarter. If you look at the year it looks pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How could you, I mean given the macro backdrop it just seems kind of odd that you would assume that PC sales would increase in this current quarter versus the 8 to 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are talking about 9 to 11 for the fourth quarter relative to 8 to 10 for the third quarter. So, it's a 1% change and don't forget the third quarter, this quarter lapped Vista launch last year. So, you've got some aberrations on a year-on-year basis. But accelerating from 8 to 10 to 9 to 11 third quarter to fourth quarter doesn't feel like it's &#x2013; we haven't got the foot on the accelerator very hard to achieve that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. I was wondering if you can talk a little about the integration of aQuantive and I guess, where does that sit relative to your estimates and how is that tracking I guess to your plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure there is a number of ways of looking at how it's integrating, the first and most important is from an employee integration point of view, given that the real revenue potential is some years out. From an employee point of view we couldn't have been happier. All of the key executives have remained, Brian McAndrews is doing a great job leading that, and has taken a broader role inside Microsoft in terms of driving that part of the strategy. We've integrated in my view the cultures very well and we've got people from aQuantive taking a broader role in Microsoft, people from the previous Microsoft working inside and helping drive aQuantive strategy. And they are very active in thinking about the way in which they can not only build aQuantive as it was but use the financial and other resources of Microsoft to even &#x2013; to make aQuantive go faster. So, if you take that as a sort of first determiner of how well things have gone, I'm extremely happy with that.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the underlying business, leading indicator would be just number of publishers we are getting on board. Again that's very healthy. We've talked through the quarter, I think we've made a few announcements that there is 96 I believe new publishers of various sizes has just switched on to the Atlas Publisher Suite in the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Since we announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually since we announced sorry. So very good growth in the underlying dynamics of the business. From a profitability point-of-view, we are carrying the cost of the acquisition. But we are managing to achieve the results that we talked about despite the fact that at this stage it's early days for aQuantive and we're carrying in particular some of the non-cash charges associated with the acquisition. So the revenue growth is still ahead of us, from a cost point-of-view we are inline but it's a negative, from a publisher business point-of-view good early indicators and from a people point of view it's excellent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Chris, operating margins for the fourth quarter appear to be going down just a tad versus the third fiscal quarter. Just explain some of the dynamics around that? I realize you guys have just made some acquisitions. Is it mainly head count related? Is there some mix shift going on between the businesses? Anything to do with E&amp;D Obviously it's kind of a strong quarter with Grand Theft Auto, I'm just trying to get the dynamics about that?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure, the problem with looking at margins for the business overall is you inevitably get quite a lot of difference between the individual businesses and how they make up one quarter. So that's the first statement and it's best again to look the year overall where we are looking at margin expansion, but if you look at the trends through the quarter, like quarter one was 43% and quarter two was 39.6, quarter three was 40.3, quarter four was 37.6, overall 40. So, in any one quarter you can get quite different movements and that reflects a) the mix of business and b) if you have a strong Xbox quarter, you get a lot of the COGS associated with that that tends to decrease the margins. Fourth quarter we get a lot of marketing and signup costs associated with our enterprise businesses, which generally are buying annuities. So we don't get a lot of the revenue associated with it, we get some of the costs but then we get the benefits of that revenue flowing through for the next year.</p>
          <p>So, the sort of short answer to your question is there is nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. We typically see it as, we typically see it, if you look back on previous years, it's a low margin quarter relative to, first, second and third. There is nothing unusual about this fourth quarter, it's part of the normal cycle.</p>

If I could just ask a really quick follow-up actually to John's question just on the acceleration in PCs in the fourth quarter; one of the comments you had about last quarter was just the inventory levels being a little bit higher heading into the third quarter, I assume those have been drawn down to levels that you feel more comfortable with heading into the fourth quarter?</p>

          <p>Yes, although just to be clear. I think John's questions was PC units overall and inventory levels tends to be a comment about our shipments to OEM. So, those are very tightly related to each other, clearly, but in answer to your question, yes, inventory levels are more normal. Although I will say it's quite early in the quarter. Sometimes we get that information over the next few weeks, but there is nothing again there is no &#x2013; there is nothing that we have seen that is unusual going into this quarter and that's embedded in our guidance.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Kirk. We are running out of time, but we do have time for at least one more question, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Chris, just drilling into the Client line item that was clearly probably the biggest disappointment relative to all of our models and understanding the licensing change, but when you drill into what's happening with Vista and XP, are you still happy with what you're seeing in the Vista upgrade cycle, are you still seeing more units of Vista or sorry XP going then you like and that would obviously have an impact on the pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's with respect to the quarter &#x2013; the third quarter in particular, there is really no Vista related issues at all, in terms of the impacts, firstly the overall PC market, unlicensed PCs, which is not a Vista issue, emerging markets growing faster than mature markets that's not really Vista issue, a bit of channel shift to larger OEMs, again, not a Vista issue. And obviously I think if we sell a unit of XP relative to selling a unit of Vista, we're still relatively happy because of the realization and so there is nothing in the third quarter that is specific to Vista in terms of the walk through from the overall PC market down to overall Client revenue. I guess the only Vista impact really is the launch last year and the very strong comparables that we have but that's not really comment about this quarter it's more a comment on the year ago quarter and the comparable.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, if you look at whether it's Vista or rev rec or from a mix standpoint, we can let you know. We are up a bit, sequentially in terms of Vista mix. I shared with you 140 million licenses sold. So, I think things are tracking well and as expected from our perspective.</p>
