        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's great for us to have the opportunity to explain what we've been up to in the first half of the year. And so, we'll get straight to it. In April, I described some decisive actions that we were taking, including important changes that we were making to shape the future growth of Tesco and I'm pleased to be able to report progress in a number of these areas.</p>
          <p>Firstly, in the UK, where we've started on our journey to improve the shopping trip for customers and we're stabilizing the performance of the business. Second, having taken actions to reduce our level of new space growth in the UK and given more focus to driving the performance of our existing stores, I'm even more certain that that's the right thing for us to have done. Third, we've invested in extending our reach, our range and our capability online. Fourth, at Tesco Bank, 2.8 million credit card customers enjoyed a smooth transition from the RBS systems to our own. And fifth, we agreed a deal with Aeon, confirming our exit from Japan.</p>
          <p>So, we're getting stuck in to making necessary changes in our business. But, of course, things have not gone all our own way. Whilst we didn't expect the European economy to improve, the continued uncertainty and the very real financial pressures experienced by households across Central Europe have taken their toll. And in Korea, the emerging shopping hour regulations I described in April have had a material impact on sales and on profitability and they're going to continue to do so for some time to come.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Fresh &amp; Easy is not where we want it to be. Losses have improved slightly before the impact of currency and like-for-like sales did pick up in the second quarter. But I said in June that we needed more from Fresh &amp; Easy and that remains the case today. Accordingly, future capital will be very tightly constrained. I'm going to come back to each of those challenges a little bit later on.</p>
          <p>But when we last met, I described how I believe the industry in the UK had been running up the down escalator, and how we were going to take a different approach in the future. Less space growth overall, fewer new, big stores, more focus on smaller stores, and more focus on driving growth through our existing stores and our Internet offer. I'm even more convinced today that that was the right call. And that's not just because others have followed our lead on space, although that's certainly good from an industry perspective. It's because I've seen what a difference we can make by redirecting some of our capital expenditure into our existing stores, into making superstores and Extras the beating heart of Tesco in the UK, the very best stores they can possibly be.</p>
          <p>And finally, it's because when customers do have money to spend on general merchandise and on electronics, they're increasingly looking to a different source of retail experience, more clicks than bricks. Any retailer who wants to survive long term needs to have a strong offer online. And I believe that any retailer who wants to win in the long term needs to be multichannel. And so, as you know, we're investing more online and are reducing our opening program for large stores. We're building more Expresses and investing a greater proportion of our total capital expenditure on our existing stores, reflecting the fact that refreshes and remodels must be our clear priority. That will be good for us and it will be good for customers. It will also be good for our shareholders. It'll support improved performance, it'll lead to better returns, and it'll drive stronger cash generation.</p>
          <p>It's been a very important half year for our UK business. We committed significant revenue and capital investment to improving the shopping trip for customers and our plans for building a better Tesco are on track. Customers have started to notice and respond to the changes we've made and our trading performance has begun to show some signs of improvement.</p>
          <p>When I first laid out the plans to you in April, I described them in terms of six key areas. And I'll use that to give you a brief progress update this morning. Before I do that, though, what's really happening here is that Tesco is changing. It's running less hot, it's loving the stores we have, it's reducing new store growth, it's competing harder online. It's a very different Tesco than it was two years ago. It'll be a very different Tesco in two years' time.</p>
          <p>But now, into the details. On service &amp; staff, we've completed the recruitments, the training, and the deployment of 8,000 colleagues we said we'd put back into our existing superstores, Extras and into a few of our metros. That work was done in two phases. The first of those phases focused on the fresh food department, and that was done by the end of Q1.</p>
          <p>The second phase, which extends into other parts of the store, only a few weeks ago, that was completed, and that's gone mainly into the food and grocery departments. I think if you visit our stores today, you can begin to see the results; improving standards, improving availability, improving presentation of products and most notably, in fresh foods.</p>
          <p>In April, I described that the like-for-like sales improvement of 1.1% from the first phase of labor in our 200-store pilot was a good start. That level of uplift was maintained as we went from the 200 to the 500 other large stores. And as you know, our overall sales performance has improved a little bit against the market, a testament to the hard work of all of our 300,000 colleagues.</p>
          <p>Importantly, customer perceptions of availability, service and quality, as you can see in this chart, have all started to show signs of improvement. I'm particularly pleased that the 8,000 extra staff have resulted in the staff visibility going up by 17 percentage points. Top left, even of more importance, the fresh food looking well cared for, up 11%, that's Q1 on Q2 in the stores that have had the investment.</p>
          <p>Our work on stores and formats, that's also made progress. It's got two main parts, refreshing the look and feel of our existing estate and then, ensuring that our new space program is fit for purpose. On refresh, we've completed over 230 stores in the first half. The refreshed stores, I hope you can see, look warmer, better signed, easier to shop, and I hope that many of you get the opportunity to see a few during our Investor Tour next month.</p>
          <p>We've also started to reallocate space in some of our existing stores. The building a better Tesco plan is a food-first one and we've been giving space back to food in some of our stores, where we previously tried to fit in a bit too much non-food.</p>
          <p>I'll give you an example, if I may. You may know that I was with the UK team and the odd journalist in Bishop's Stortford last week. It's a great store. It's in a great location. It's been there for more than 20 years. But six months ago, it wasn't the best food shop in town. It is today.</p>
          <p>You can see what we've done here and look at the floor plan, how before and after. We've reduced the amount of non-food by 20%. We've given it back to food. Customers used to walk through the doors and see this. And now they see this. I know which one they prefer and I know which one I prefer.</p>
          <p>On new space, we're on track for around a 40% reduction year-on-year, with a much bigger proportion of what we opened going into Express. In fact last week, the Caf&#xE9; Matthiae in Richmond became the 1,500th Express store in Richmond.</p>
          <p>We described our plans to deliver better vendor price promotions, coupons and loyalty as price and value in April and we've made some good progress in this area, too. Our investment in on-shelf pricing this time last year has resulted in better prices for customers, but our price perception suffered because of the increased couponing in the market and the promotions by some of our competitors in Q4.</p>
          <p>We've continued our budgeting investment in price in the first half, made our promotions clearer and sharper and we made them more relevant for customers. And we've corrected the low level of couponing that we ran in Q4.</p>
          <p>More importantly, though, we launched Clubcard Bonus in the first half. We mail over 7 million customers with highly personalized offers. And this is in between our normal quarterly Clubcard statements. These mailings offer customer discounts or points on the products that matter most to them. The initial mailings have been incredibly successful. Customers love them and we've seen much higher redemption rates and better sales-to-cost ratios than previous mailings, all thanks to dunnhumby. Clubcard Bonus is reinforcing loyalty and building trust in the company.</p>
          <p>One of the first and most tangible changes we made in the stores was the successful re-launch of Tesco Value as Everyday Value, and hopefully, you had a chance to see it outside when you were on the way in. Since its launch back in April, nearly 80% of customers across all demographics have bought the new range. Sales of that range are growing more than 10% faster than the business as a whole. And even last week, we added another 100 products to the range, including new frozen and chilled convenience lines.</p>
          <p>And my dad was telling me last night, he went into Walton and bought five ready meals, five ready meals for a fiver. But being 84, he tried to defrost it, didn't realize he could cook it from frozen. It didn't go as well as he expected. Hopefully, his tea will be all right tonight. This is important, of course, because consumers are very hard pressed. Look at the rise of the discounters. This is one of the ways in which we can compete, and I'm very pleased with the performance. Well done to the team, some of them whom are here today helped develop it.</p>
          <p>Range and quality work's also begun, though, on the new &#x2013; on the core Tesco range. We have 2,000 new or upgraded products under the Tesco brand so far. Notable improvements in the first half include the re-launch of our bakery offer that you'll have seen upstairs. Don't worry, that equipment is headed to a store near you soon, so it's not going to waste and the bakery product, please, take it on the way out and enjoy it, including 30 new artisanal breads and a brand new patisserie range.</p>
          <p>And in chilled ready meals, significant quality upgrades, packaging improvement, and better range segmentation. That work's got a long, long way to go, but week by week, there are more and more new upgraded products appearing on the shelf. As an example, we will be re-launching our entire fresh meat category in just under a month, supported by an improved store presentation.</p>
          <p>Now, what do I mean by all that? Well, this is what I mean by that. This is a picture I took of Amersham store last year. You can &#x2013; it was taken with my phone; not a particularly good picture. I wouldn't have been proud of it anyway, even before we put up the sign saying we thought you might be a shoplifter, and if you are, we'll send you to prison. I never thought they'd let me show it publicly. And the reason that they said that I could was, this is the photo not taken by me of that same department from that same angle last week. It's a lot better, isn't it?</p>
          <p>A meat department Dad would have been proud of in his store in Allerton and one I am proud of. And it's not just presentation, because it isn't in the end about presentation and wooden fixtures. That's a nice backdrop. What it's about is a review of the product itself. 150 products will be upgraded. New lines will be introduced, improve the cut, hanging our beef for longer, and seeking out the very best products. That's what I mean when I say building a better Tesco.</p>
          <p>In July, we appointed Wieden + Kennedy, our first new creative agency in over 15 years. They're going to be heavily involved in our brand and marketing work and be helping us to have the different conversation we know that we need to have with our customers. I'm not going to share the output of that work today but you'll start to see the first signs of the new marketing campaign before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Personalization and localization are very key to our plan. For most people, the Tesco brand is defined by the stores that they visit each week. Ensuring that each store has the strongest, the most relevant range for its customers is a key step along the journey to winning increased loyalty.</p>
          <p>We have the systems. We have the processes. We have the supply chain to do it. We're now using them in a way that we weren't using them before. Tailored ranges to different catchments have been launched in grocery categories such as bottled water, herbs and spices.</p>
          <p>Here's an example of how we've improved the segmentation of our wine offer. More upmarket in some stores, we have finest and even a fine wine selection and in others, more focused on helping customers find what they want, with recommendations like the Simply range, Great With range and a block of Special Offers for those who don't know much about it, just want a good deal or something with fish or, you know, I've heard of Sauvignon Blanc, let's just get one that's nice and simple. The insight and capability provided by dunnhumby underpin all these and there is a lot more to come.</p>
          <p>So far, I've talked about the first five elements of the building a better Tesco plan. Care about retailing basics, they are very necessary improvements. They're long overdue. But the sixth element is very, very different. Our clicks and bricks strategy is a sea-change for us, and I think, for the industry. I've said it before, but it means less big new stores. It means greater digital connections to our customers. It means starting here at home. But it means spreading it around our world. We're determined to be a winner in the Internet revolution, not a victim of it.</p>
          <p>We've brought new innovations to our online grocery business in the first half. Already the leading online grocer in the world, in May, we became the first mainstream retailer in the UK to offer our customers a subscription service, which enables them to save money when they place regular orders at tesco.com, &#xA3;36 for a quarter, as many deliveries as you want. 70,000 customers have taken up that offer.</p>
          <p>It's very popular, unsurprisingly, amongst our most loyal customers. Average basket size for customers using the Delivery Saver is slightly larger than our grocery.com service as a whole. We've also accelerated the rollout of Click &amp; Collect for groceries, with drive-through collection points like this one at Seaton's store, now in 90 stores across the country. You don't even have to get out your car, have your shopping put in the boot.</p>
          <p>We've made considerable progress, too, on Tesco Direct. We started 2012 with 38,000 items available online. In April, it was 75,000 to do. Today, it's 200,000 and growing at about 10,000 a week. It includes products sold now by 14 third-party marketplace sellers, who've already signed up to sell products through the Tesco website.</p>
          <p>We've also increased the number of Click &amp; Collect desks, like this one, to over 1,300, with more than a third of these in Express stores, bringing a new level of convenience to customers.</p>
          <p>We've also taken some significant steps towards the creation of a complete digital entertainment service online. We complimented Blinkbox, which is video streaming, with further acquisitions, buying the Internet radio service We-7 in the first half and the e-book platform Mobcast just last month. Together, these businesses give us the building blocks to provide a credible, innovative offer for our customers.</p>
          <p>But, of course, there's much more to do and much more that can be done. One of the exciting aspects of this work in the UK is that every change that we've made sparks another set of opportunities, things that we can do even better. And I am continuing to devote a significant amount of my time to the UK. It's still the biggest priority for the group as a whole.</p>
          <p>It's genuinely a team effort and the management team that's now been in place for over six months, is strong, it's experienced and as driven as any I could want. Now, you're going to hear today in the audience is thanks to this team, thanks to you meeting in Baldock with me every week, that we've achieved the progress that we have so far.</p>
          <p>I'll turn now to our businesses outside the UK. We've been challenged by two factors; the Eurozone crisis and its effect on consumers in Europe, the trading hour restrictions in our biggest market, South Korea. Both have been significant and both have impacted performance, especially difficult for us in a year when we had big investments in the UK.</p>
          <p>To give you a bit more color on Korea, back in April, we knew that the passing of regulations allowing regional authorities to impose opening hour restrictions on all large retailers in the market would have some impact. Initially, it wasn't clear how many regions would apply these restrictions or how severe to individual stores they would be.</p>
          <p>By the end of July, however, 24-hour trading had been prohibited in all of our stores and we were having to close every other Sunday in almost every region across the country. These restrictions hit Homeplus hard. Our stores typically be more than 20% of trade on a Sunday. And one of the things that customers particularly enjoyed about Homeplus was that more of our stores were trading on a 24-hour basis than any of our competitors.</p>
          <p>None of this changes the fact that Homeplus is one of our most successful, highest returning businesses outside the UK, but it does mean that its profitability will continue to be severely impacted whilst the regulations are in place. Elsewhere in Asia, our third largest market talent had a good first half. Sales and profits up on top of a strong performance in the first half last year. They opened 150 Express stores in the first half, and they will be the first of our businesses outside the UK to have 1,000 convenience stores trading, and that will happen in the next few months. We're going to take a step towards being a multichannel business in Thailand with the launch of grocery home shopping in Bangkok later in the year.</p>
          <p>In China, the more cautious stance we described in April is serving us well, in a market where new store development was significantly outpacing consumer demand. Many retailers putting down more space in the market; few seeing that translate into profitable growth. We'll still open 16 hypermarkets in China this year, and that, as you remember, is only part of the program that we'd originally planned for the year. The new focus has enabled us to scale back our regional and our central overheads, and showing it's more appropriately sized for the current pace of growth in the business. China remains strategically important for us. But as I've said before, it's more of a marathon than a sprint.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we expect it to be tough for some time to come. Consumer confidence in almost every one of our markets is lower than at the same point last year, and many households are facing real financial pressures. Take the Czech Republic for example, already one of the worst-affected markets by the crisis, but customers hit by a 4% increase in the lowest rate of VAT at the start of the year, and there's already talk of a further increase later this year. There's increasing unemployment, there's falling disposable income, and that's taken its toll on like-for-like, particularly in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>While general merchandise and electronic sales have been impacted across the region, clothing has picked up, as the F&amp;F offer continues to be sought after by customers, and the range is increasingly benefiting from our skill and our scale, because we've combined the buying, merchandising and creative teams across the region with the UK, leading to quality, price and design improvements from which the UK itself is beginning to benefit as well.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget the big picture either. What's happening in the UK is going to happen in Europe. The Internet is the fastest-growing retail channel. We are proud that Tesco grocery home shopping has launched in cities including Warsaw, Krak&#xF3;w, Poznan, and Wroclaw in Poland, in addition to Prague in the Czech Republic, and just a few weeks ago, in Bratislava in Slovakia.</p>
          <p>Our investment in the future in Europe will be more focused than ever on smaller format stores and the emerging online channel. Both will benefit from our skill and our scale, as we can deploy our blueprint format and our systems quickly and in a very capital-efficient way because of the capability that you know we have in Bangalore. Over half the space that we've opened since the start of the year in Europe is in smaller stores, including the 30 new franchise stores in the Czech Republic for Zabka.</p>
          <p>At Fresh &amp; Easy, whilst their offer continues to improve, the performance of the business is not where we wanted it to be. Although losses came down slightly before the impact of exchange rates, they didn't come down as much as we would have liked. Our like-for-like sales performance got better in the second quarter, but weighed down by a disappointing first quarter.</p>
          <p>More of our existing stores have crossed over the store profitability line. We're going to focus our efforts even more in the second half on getting further stores across the line in the second half. But I am very clear that Fresh &amp; Easy needs to do better and as a consequence, we're keeping an even firmer grip on new capital for the business. We'll open only a handful of stores in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>Four months on from the migration of the final credit card account, we can be proud of the bespoke modern bank we've created through our 7 million existing banking and insurance customer accounts. It's always difficult for us to make decisions that affect the short-term performance of the business, and slowing down the project added in additional cost and delayed the marketing of new and existing products.</p>
          <p>However, when I look at the bank today, I know it was the right call for the long-term, ensuring a smooth transition for our credit card customers and avoiding the substantial systems issues faced by others in the retail banking sector.</p>
          <p>The bank has now resumed the launch of its new products, starting with mortgages, launched softly in August. <mark type="ph" /> Prices (26:04) will follow in November. And we've picked up the pace of marketing existing products, introducing new loan rates and new credit card deals. Tesco Bank is getting back to growing again. Free from migration, it can pick up the rates of its profit growth in future years and that will be important.</p>
          <p>But another measure, and equally as important, of the success of the bank is the contribution it makes to the UK. It will be a powerful driver of loyalty, achieved by offering great value, relevant products and services to millions of Tesco customers, provided by Tesco people using Tesco systems, not a third party. Tesco people, Tesco systems, Tesco products.</p>
          <p>In summary, and for now, we've embarked upon our journey to build a better Tesco. The key first step was to make the right calls. And I believe we've done that, on the UK, on space growth and on capital. Having made those calls, we've got on with implementing change, improving our execution in the UK, stabilizing the performance of the business, reducing our new store program, putting more behind our multi-channel strategy.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's not easy to drive change in the current environment and you've seen how events in Asia and Europe haven't helped us in the first half. But this has not weakened our resolve and I'm confident that the steps we've taken move us closer to a Tesco which delivers sustainable growth, improving returns and strong cash generation. There's much, much more to do and I'm pleased that we have a strong team now in place, highly experienced, energized and focused. Together, we're making progress towards becoming a global leader in multi-channel retailing.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening and I'll now hand you over to Laurie. Laurie?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philip. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my presentation with a summary of the group results, followed by a brief commentary on our segmental performance. I'll then cover the balance sheet and cash flow position, including an update on property, capital and returns. So group sales for the half year were &#xA3;36 billion, up 1.4% at actual rates, but up 3.2% at constant rates.</p>
          <p>Profit reduced on the key income lines, largely reflecting the margin reset in the UK we announced last January and the unhelpful macroeconomic environment. Group trading profit was down 10.5% to &#xA3;1.6 billion and underlying profit declined by 8.5%. Group profit before tax decreased by 11.6%. Our underlying diluted earnings per share was 17.08p and this has decreased by 7.9% at constant tax rates.</p>
          <p>The board has decided to maintain the interim dividend in line with last year at 4.63p per share. By doing this, we are demonstrating our confidence in the group's growth prospects beyond this year and progress that is being made in implementing the UK plan.</p>
          <p>Net debt at &#xA3;7.2 billion is &#xA3;0.4 billion lower than this time last year. And that's driven mainly by a reduction in capital spending and the benefits from our property divestment program in Thailand and South Korea. Consistent with previous years, this is higher than the year-end debt of &#xA3;6.8 billion, reflecting the cash outflow from the final dividend payment.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the segmental performance. In the UK, despite trading conditions being tough, we're in line with our plans and projections. As a result of our six-part plan, our sales performance improved during the first half. Like-for-like lifted from negative 1.4% in Q1 to 0.2% positive in quarter two. Our actions to improve our competitiveness have started to gain traction with customers. The volume improvement was stronger than the headline like-for-like change between quarter one and two.</p>
          <p>And within the mix, grocery like-for-like strengthened and we saw a promising turnaround in fresh foods' performance. And clothing like-for-like also showed a marked improvement. In contrast, hardlines like-for-like remained mid-single digit negative throughout the half, not helped by the continuing structural decline in CDs and DVDs and games, and the early effect of reducing non-space in some existing stores.</p>
          <p>Overall, total sales growth excluding petrol was 2.7%, driven by strong new store growth of 3.3%. This increase puts us back in the pack. And in food, our growth actually outperformed the market.</p>
          <p>Our trading profit and margin performance reflects our planned investment and is consistent with the guidance we gave in April. Trading margin was 5.2% in the first half, around 90 basis points lower than this time last year, and tracking in line with our expectations. We expect a similar margin for the rest of this year for reasons that I explained at the prelims.</p>
          <p>The results of our Asia business have been significantly impacted by change in the regulatory environment in South Korea, our largest market outside the U.K. The legislation has affected not just our own trading, but also that of our tenants as well. Profits were down significantly in Korea during the first half as a direct consequence. And based on our current understanding of the situation, we anticipate the profit impact to be approximately &#xA3;100 million for the year and weighted towards the second half.</p>
          <p>Asia profit was down 1.7% at constant exchange rates in the first half. But looking beyond the regulatory impact in Korea, Asia profits were up mid-single digits, driven by a strong performance in Thailand.</p>
          <p>In China, we're adjusting our approach and having more capital discipline. Firstly, by taking a more focused approach on our expansion. Secondly, concentrating on leasehold standalone stores while developing out our committed Lifespace malls. And thirdly, by closing a small number of underperforming stores. And finally, by restructuring some of the regional support costs to lower overheads. The costs linked to this restructuring represent most of the &#xA3;38 million restructuring charges accounted for in the first half.</p>
          <p>In Europe, profits were down by 28%, not helped, of course, by adverse currency movements. And in constant rates, profits reduced by 21%. The key issue here is the further deterioration in the economic environment and consumer confidence. Inevitably, discretionary spending has been hit hardest, and we have taken action across our markets to mark down and clear overstocks. This had particularly impacted general merchandise and has contributed to around &#xA3;20 million of margin reduction year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our relative performance remained strong, with us gaining or holding market share in the majority of our countries. And we've decided that &#x2013; and we've achieved that, sorry, on nearly 20% lower capital year-on-year. We've continued to absorb the Hungarian crisis tax charge within our trading profits at a similar level to last year and are hopeful that we'll see a relief from early 2013, when the sunset clause legislation takes effect.</p>
          <p>Fresh &amp; Easy delivered a small reduction in losses in the first half at constant rates, with like-for-like sales performance strengthening through the period. As previously announced, we're adopting a more measured approach to capital and are continuing to focus on store-level profitability. We've reviewed the size and shape of our central cost base to ensure it's aligned with that of the business in the near term; and as a result, reduce the number of rolls. This will lower overhead cost by some &#xA3;5 million this year.</p>
          <p>These changes will help the pace of loss reduction during the second half, but more importantly, the trend towards our store-level profitability in established stores remains strong and will continue. As a reminder, I showed you this graph at the preliminary results in April. The 30 stores on the right of the line were already making a positive contribution. Since then, as you can see, an additional 25 have crossed over to positive EBITDA, taking the total now to 55 stores and we expect a further 30 to cross over the line in the second half.</p>
          <p>Next year's store opening program is significantly smaller and that's partly about capital discipline, but it should also contribute significantly to the rate of reduction and losses. The immature stores still drag on performance, so not adding new and initially loss-making stores will help a lot. To gauge it for you, our like-for-like stores improved their profitability by $18 million in the first half and that was almost balanced by the drag effect of the new stores we did open.</p>
          <p>As Phil mentioned, we're very pleased to say that the bank has now successfully completed its migration and I said at the prelims that we held back our marketing in new and existing products during the final stages to maximize our contingency capability. As a result of this and, also, weaker conditions in the insurance markets, revenue fell by about 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Trading profit for the bank did increased by 114% to &#xA3;94 million. However, this reflects the additional &#xA3;57 million of PPI that was taken in last year's numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, in common with other retail banks, we've also continued to review the level of provisioning for PPI and in the past six months, we, like others in the sector, experienced an increase in claims and therefore, feel it's appropriate to increase our provision by a further &#xA3;30 million. This leaves our net provision of &#xA3;78 million at the half year, which is similar to the net provision that we had at the full year. The bank's income statement has benefited from a one-off credit following the settlement of a dispute with a former business partner.</p>
          <p>Excluding PPI, fair value and the one-off credit, the bank's baseline profit was flat. And by managing our risk profile, we've seen our bad debt position improve for both credit cards and for loans and our bad debt asset ratio has improved from 2.7% to 1.8% and in light of this, we've released a provision of &#xA3;10 million.</p>
          <p>The bank's overall capital and funding position remains strong, with the risk asset ratio strengthening to 16.9% and the Core Tier 1 ratio increasing by 150 basis points to 16.8% from the year-end. This will be helped further by the termination of the insurance distribution agreement that we had with RBS, resulting in &#xA3;259 million of capital being repaid to us before the year-end.</p>
          <p>Entry in the mortgage market has been a significant milestone for the bank. We've begun lending at a range of loan to values of up to 80%. We have two products in the top five lead tables and the initial customer response is encouraging after only a few weeks. So, to sum up on the bank, although the conditions in the motor insurance market remained unhelpful, with migration now complete and with a strong funding position, we can now begin to fulfill the bank's potential.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the group balance sheet. Group capital expenditure in the first half was &#xA3;1.6 billion and that's a marked reduction compared to the first half of last year. We now expect the full year CapEx to be &#xA3;3.2 billion, significantly cutting our spending versus last year by 16%, and this is largely driven by the reduced new store opening program in the UK.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from retail activities in the first half was &#xA3;1.3 billion, and that was down &#xA3;0.6 billion on last year. A third of this is attributable to the reduction in operating profit. The other components are &#xA3;0.2 billion from a one-off pension contribution and &#xA3;0.1 billion from working capital outflow, driven by the timing of rent and other payables.</p>
          <p>That timing will normalize and combined with the work that we're doing to reduce stock, we should see a more normal capital inflow of around &#xA3;0.3 billion by the yearend. Net debt improved year-on-year by &#xA3;0.4 billion and we expect to see a similar level of improvement in net debt by the yearend and this is in line with our plans to deleverage further.</p>
          <p>Despite the small reduction in net debt year-on-year, net finance cost rose by &#xA3;75 million for two main reasons. Firstly, the non-cash movements in IAS 32 and IAS 39, which moved adversely versus last year, the substantial credit on the revaluation of the minority interest in the Homeplus buyback and also, the impact of marking-to-market some of our hedging contracts were the key drivers.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our decision to issue &#xA3;1.2 billion of new bonds several months ahead of retiring some maturing debt in September of this year, so we had some double running. We successfully completed our first property transactions in Asia in the first half. And in line with our stated objective of releasing more value from our international property portfolio, our property profits were &#xA3;324 million in the first half.</p>
          <p>The listing of our Thai property fund generated &#xA3;379 million of proceeds by releasing value from 17 malls while still anchored by a Tesco Lotus hypermarket, but we completed that just after the yearend.</p>
          <p>The listings continued to trade well, but we're currently in the early stages of injecting a further five malls, which we'll complete in the second half of the year. We're also pleased with the strong demand for the sale and leasebacks of the four Korean hypermarkets in August, and this raised further proceeds of &#xA3;300 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the balance sheet, our IAS 19 pension deficit on a post-tax basis has increased to &#xA3;1.8 billion. This was due to the increase in the discount rate for valuing the funds and future liabilities, as well as lower than assumed asset returns &#x2013; decrease, sorry, in the discount rate. In anticipation of the outcome of the 2011 triennial actuarial evaluation, we've made a one-off contribution of &#xA3;180 million to the scheme earlier this year.</p>
          <p>I normally update on four key financial metrics, around capital, debt and returns, and our commitment to deliver improvements in these metrics remains. However, the speed with which the improvements are delivered are clearly more challenging in the current environment. For example, it was already clear that hitting our ROCE target in 2014-2015 timeframe was challenging. We acknowledged that in April and of course, it's even more so today.</p>
          <p>We remain determined to improve our returns and we've demonstrated our continued commitment to this with the changes that we've made to our capital investment plans. However, as you know, the ROCE measure is much more sensitive to the numerator, profit, than the denominator, capital employed. The external factors we are facing, not least the new regulations in Korea, clearly have a significant impact on ROCE. And as a result, it's a full year measure, so we'll really clear this up for you at the full year.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, it's been a challenging first half, which reflects both the planned investment in the UK and some deterioration in the external environment, particularly the specific challenges in Korea.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we are more competitive and executing better at home, which means we are well on the way to stabilizing the performance in our key market. The building the better Tesco plan is starting to deliver the kind of performance and improvement we all want to see.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I shall now hand back to Phil.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Laurie, and it's good to &#x2013; and I think by looking forward, and that's, for me, what Tesco is all about these days, a team that's looking forward, not back, a business that's innovating, not standing still, a focus on making what matters most to our customers better every day and resolve, a fierce resolve to a greater Tesco that delivers more for its shareholders.</p>
          <p>So thanks for listening to us. Laurie and I would now be delighted to take your questions and I need to give you some housekeeping rules and some logistics. If you want to ask a question, just raise your hand. When we come to you, take the mic from the back of the seat in front of you and press the button.

          <p>The biggest single <mark type="ph" /> difference (45:00) of the numerator I guess is the UK. So it's been nearly a year now since your announcement in January. Could you give some sort of indication of what your future expectations are for the UK operating margin, please? Is this a new base from which you don't really expect to grow? Or is this a new base from which you do expect to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you say, Andrew, at the prelims, we laid out pretty clearly the margin progression, and stated actually that 5.2% was the operating margin for the first half. And this is the new base that we see, a similar margin performance for the second half of the year. So we'll get sales growth. There'll be no margin deterioration or very little margin deterioration. So we should get back to a much better performance in terms of profit year-on-year in the second half than we've had in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I want to see us grow our profit in the UK in 2013 on the back of sales growth. I think it's very important we don't take out too much, we put more back in for customers. So, whenever we can, we'll be doing that. But next year, start to see it build. That's our objective.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Well, why don't we just go one behind you, gentleman on the end and then the lady next to him? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're doing on the general merchandise side, because you've given us an example of space reallocation? It looks like that's progressing in quite a few stores. What's the magnitude of this thing that you're trying to do here? And what have been the results so far and what should we think about in a year, two years' time? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've talked a lot about customer perceptions on service, quality, availability, et cetera. You've not talked about customer perception on price/value, in terms of any metrics you can give us there, that'll be helpful.</p>
          <p>And finally, just help us understand the &#xA3;100 million Korean impact this year in terms of the dynamics, how that's actually &#xA3;100 million this year when, really, it's only about six months or seven, eight months in terms of full impact of Sunday close...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll let &#x2013; thank you. I'll let Laurie take the question on Korea. But before he does that, there are 500 or so stores in the UK that are superstores. These are the stores that opened beginning around the end of the 1980s all the way through to most recent &#x2013; kind of, we opened another superstore, a new one, in the first half of the year. We also opened an Extra in the first half of the year. Those stores, we're going to correct the amount of space that we put to general merchandise and when we do the Investor Tour next month, we'll take you to one and show you what we've done. I showed you in my introductory remarks.</p>
          <p>So, that means more food, less general merchandise in the stores. We've got quite a lot of clearing up to do in general merchandise, anyway. We said a year ago, our range, it had got a bit tired. There's quite a lot of stock that we're working through. There are improvements coming into categories. We've very, very big on traditional media. That's where the investments come in to digital media, because it's falling at about 25% a year. So, I expect GM to get back to positive like-for-like growth in 2013, 2014. Online is where the big, big expansion in range will come. It'll be contracting in our stores.</p>
          <p>Customer perceptions on price and value, well, they took a bit of a dent in Q4, because for customers, price and value, it's all about what's in &#x2013; what's their net cost of doing their shop and with so much couponing and us not playing hard, that was difficult. I think some competitors have done very well with their comparisons to us. Nice that they choose to compare themselves to us, by the way. It's stable. It's not improving, but we hope to see it start to regain something during the course of the next six to nine months, because we've got our own plans in that respect.</p>
          <p>But for us, building a better Tesco is six parts of a plan, not one part of a plan. And what I don't want to be and what we won't be, anymore, is just following slavishly somebody else's agenda. We're going to follow our agenda, and then, you'll see how that performs. You'll see outperformance, because our relative performance should at least start to get in line with the pack, and then we expect it to do better than that. Already in food, it's doing that. Yes. Already in food. So, onto Korea and &#xA3;100 million, only six to eight months, why so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Am I answering you, or... So, let's be clear on the facts. So, South Korea, so far, in the first half of the year, we've been closed five Sundays, all our stores. On a Sunday, we take 20% of our trade. Some customers are adjusting to trade with us on other days. So, we're recouping somewhere between 20% and 30% of the 20% that we lose. So, net 14%, if you like. It not only impacts ourselves, but as you've been around our South Korean stores, you know we've got a lot of tenants in there, as well. So they're effectively closed. We lose the tenant income.</p>
          <p>The second factor is the 24-hour trading, and we're one of the very few retailers in Korea that does 24-hour trading. And we've not been able to 24-hour trade for 13 weeks. So combine those two effects, the Sunday trading hit us by about 2.9% negative like-for-like, and the 24-hour trading, about 1.5% negative like-for-like. That's the first half.</p>
          <p>And of the &#xA3;100 million, to size it for you, we said it was more second half weighted. It's about 30% this half, 70% the next half. Now, what justifies that is in the second half of the year, roughly 10 Sundays, we will be completely closed in our Homeplus stores and we'll have 13 weeks of 24-hour trading closing.</p>
          <p>So, the step-up with more Sundays closed is roughly about 5.7% negative like-for-like and about 1.5% negative like-for-like again from the 24-hour impact. So, of course, flowing that forward through to next year, you get the &#xA3;70 million impact that we're absorbing it in the second half of this year, lapping a &#xA3;30 million impact from the first half of this year next year. So, there will be some more impacts for the first half of 2014 and then we should start to lap it.</p>
          <p>Now, that's what we know now and it's less certain than you would think it would be, given it's legislation and regulation and that's because the industry is challenging the regulator, but it's not achieving what they thought it was going to achieve. So, things could change but we thought, particularly in terms of consensus where the Asia consensus to us looks too high and that's the core reason that the Korean business is going to &#x2013; its profits are going to be down about &#xA3;100 million year-on-year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Caroline Gulliver from Espirito Santo. A couple of questions. The first one is actually just a follow-up on the price and the value in the UK. And you already touched on this, but just to clarify, are you saying that you're happy that your competitors are at least advertising that they are &#x2013; they can price match or better Tesco? And I think it even goes as far now as Ocado saying that they will now price match Tesco, including promotions. So, are you comfortable with that? And do you feel you're doing enough on the other aspects of price and value?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on China. Is there more that you can do on scaling back the regional costs and head off the central costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Am I happy? Well, they like to compare themselves, and that's their business. For us, what's more important is what we do in our stores, in our communication and I think we've got very good plans. I have to ask myself, why do they keep comparing themselves to us, particularly those who claim to be so much cheaper, as some do. We were playing a song. We were playing Ken Dodd's Happiness at a meeting recently, so maybe that's quite appropriate.</p>
          <p>In China, no, I don't think we can cut back more, because it's three regions. We've already taken a big cut. It's now proportionate for the size of the business. What that business now needs to do is benefit from its renewed focus. I'm not opening so many. I'm loving the stores that it has and getting some performance out of them as we watch what happens in the market because, as I've said, so many people are finding it tougher.</p>
          <p>Another question? Why don't we just move straight along that row and so the gentleman there whose telephone rang earlier in the middle of Laurie's speech.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. A casual observer of the results like myself might note that you're not doing very well in quite a lot of countries. Should you not be closing or seeking to close down or seeking solutions to more of these countries, because we've heard for a very long time about how returns are going to rise. And you've got these mature countries that are at the top and the immature at the bottom, sort of thing. Should you not be acting a bit quicker? We've talked about the U.S., but there are a few others as well.</p>
          <p>And secondly, you're investing in online non-food in the UK in a big way, increasing the number of lines. Can you just remind us what the losses were in the first half at Tesco Direct and when you expect to make some money out of all this investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first. Laurie can take the second. How's that? I don't think we need to make any radical actions in any of these countries. Whoever would have imagined that the world would be in the state that it's in, with economies starting to contract, consumers starting to be squeezed. We've got a network of stores. We should make the best of them. We can see prospects for convenience to grow in those markets. So, no; no plans to close down any more countries. We think that the strategy that we have is right. We're going to have to test it out, as many people are finding is necessary these days.</p>
          <p>Our online non-food and this big investment and losses and so on, Laurie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So year-on-year, the losses were about the same, Philip. So we haven't improved our overall losses, so we haven't declared it or disclosed it separately. The mix is improving, so we are moving out of categories that have been dragging down the profitability, particularly electrical, which we were selling at pretty much zero margin. And building a range; you will know that we've moved the range from 35,000 SKUs at the end of the year. We're now nearly up to 200,000. And as Philip said in his presentation, there's a lot of marketplace suppliers, that you don't have the risk of the stock and you do have the income that you get from the products that they sell.</p>
          <p>We haven't really kicked in the step change benefits that we talked about of utilizing Tesco's distribution system, which we feel is a big cost competitive advantage that we've got for the future and that's going to come in the future as we get really through most of the second half of the year. It's a quite a big change and we want to make sure, similar that we did with the bank, make sure that we do it carefully and not end up disappointing customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we &#x2013; and I'm sorry, we launched today our domestic electrical <mark type="ph" /> venture (57:11) brand, T-H-X, which is all about hair care. That's exactly where we should be playing in this space. We've been selling other people's brands at low margins. And a year ago, I said, you've got to do more of selling your brands, because using your global supply chain, you can have it manufactured, designed well, manufactured in the factory, brought over to the UK, sold across the whole of the group. So, T-H-X is a good example of that. You'll see more of that and that's going to give us a more profitable online general merchandise and in-store general merchandise range. And I think that the sellers are another important ingredient in the mix.</p>
          <p>Should we move along the row?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, just to follow up, so that means about two or three years more of losses, do you think, in non-food?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>What it will mean is reducing losses, not increasing losses, that's what we're aiming to do. And eventually, that will turn into profit. But it is a clear strategy of ours to be a multi-channel retailer in the UK. They say our share of food is about 30% and our share of general merchandise is down at 4%. That's the opportunity but what we've got to do is not do it through big stores when everyone is buying it online. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Dave McCarthy at Investec. Two or three things. First of all, you're talking about reallocating space. You know that one of my big beefs is the amount of footage that's going down. So, although you're cutting back on your opening program, a lot of that is in the non-food and actually, you're reallocating space within your stores up to 20%. So, can you give us what the increase in the food space that you're going to be doing both this year and, indeed, next, including that allocation?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the margin, you said a flattish margin into the second half. Of course, usually, we see a higher margin in the second half than the first half. So, can we take a message on what the UK margin is going to do in the first half next year? Is that going to rebase further or are you guiding us to a flat margin first and second half going forward, so, just on the balance of the business?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just a question on what you've just said there, Philip, about the U.S., where you said you're not going to exit countries. And I think the debate about when the U.S. breaks even is completely irrelevant. The real question is, when is it going to stop destroying shareholder value? When is it going to be meaningful? I mean, it's a business in turnover terms about a tenth of the size of what you do in London. You've got a very heavy, top-heavy management team out there that was designed there to build a much bigger business. You wouldn't tolerate this kind of performance in any other region, so why haven't we seen any sort of a &#x2013; the management team brought back to help out in the UK, where they have been missed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, the new store space expansion is coming down. Over 2 million square feet going in at, some years it was up as big as 2.5 million square feet. It's going to be 1.4 million, 1.6 million square feet this year. I don't anticipate it's going to go up in future years. I anticipate it's going to do the opposite. I think it's going to continue to come down. And we are investing significantly in our own convenience, which is a lot of food space.</p>
          <p>In terms of, what does that mean for food footage, we'll have to get back to you, because I really haven't done the calculation. But it's reducing in real terms. It's reducing from where it was in prior years, and much more focused now on convenience. Gross margins, half one and half two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're basically guiding you towards flat margins. So, 5.2% for the balance of this year. 5.2% next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may be better, but that's the guidance that we think is appropriate to give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S., we've made &#x2013; in the first half of the year, we have made management changes. We put some new executives in there. And one of the things that they've been doing pretty fast is looking at how we can improve the performance of our existing business. I'm more focused on this point than anybody else. My job is to deliver shareholder value. You said it, I'm saying it, that's what I intend to do. You know what happens when I focus on something. It improves or it doesn't. And we're in the let's-get-it-improving mode. If it does not deliver shareholder value, then we do something else. I still believe there is a fine chance that it will, but we're keeping very close eye on it, indeed.</p>
          <p>So, another question? Why don't we just jump behind that last question there, and then we'll come along this row to you, sir? So, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John Kershaw at Exane BNP. Just a couple from me. You've clearly flagged the six core points, but I suppose the underlying questioning from a lot of people is, there is structural elements, I think, there as well and a lot of your core capital employed is in the large format stores. So, even as you shift to smaller formats, does not the drag of the large formats bring your underlying performance down? Why should we be so convinced returns can continue to go up at home and abroad?</p>
          <p>On the UK, how do you neuter the discounters, because clearly, they have got a lot of momentum, even though still fairly modest market share. And finally, just on Europe, perhaps break out, clearly, Czech Republic was weak, but it feels like it was weak in most market in profit terms. So, a bit more color, please, there.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where are you, John? Oh, there you are. So, Europe, actually, you read the economic stats like I do, actually quite a sharp &#x2013; shock in the first half of this year for Central Europe. In fact, the Czech Republic went into negative for the first time. Hungary's been in negative GDP growth for three quarters now.</p>
          <p>And Poland's growth, which wasn't really affected or it didn't seem to be affected by the recession or the euro contagion effect, it dropped from about 5% growth to 2% growth. So, the economies have been squeezed quite a lot for our Central European businesses. I have to say our Slovakian business has gone from strength to strength and pretty much our market share in the region, it's either improved or held, so we're doing well in a very tight market.</p>
          <p>We've invested into the Internet in grocery home shopping terms in the Czech Republic and Poland and just coming in Slovakia as well. So, we're capturing quite a bit of nice growth because of that. But we are up in a startup situation. So, it's not making profit for us yet, but it's very capital-lite. It's only a couple of million pounds to actually launch the Internet into those countries.</p>
          <p>We've vastly reduced the space rollout similar to what we've done in the UK, so there are very few hypermarkets now that we're building and we believe we've got the best locations already in Central Europe. And in fact, our space, we'll be down about 30% new space year-on-year. There's a big focus on the small format. You know that we bought Zabka and Koruna last year, and we're just ramping that up, more franchise stores, but also a great source of Express formats for ourselves.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the shape of the year, obviously, it's been a very hard half with negative 20% at constant currency in Central Europe. But we were lapping the half last year of about 9% profit growth. As we've come into the second half, actually, our profits went down by mid-teens last year. So, we're lapping a softer half. You remember we talked about the impact of the new Polish depot that we opened, was actually quite significant on the Polish business, because it didn't work and we had to work around it. So, that held our profits back quite a bit.</p>
          <p>We've got a very good step change program in Central Europe, given the benefits of what we've been doing around the world, but bringing the Central European countries together. We've actually invested in electronic shelf-edge labels in Hungary. That will be completely rolled out by the year-end and we're going to start implementing into Poland. So, that also takes out quite a bit of labor as well. So, hopefully, that's enough color for you on Central Europe.</p>

          <p>It's clearly &#x2013; on the discounters, it's clearly their time. Families are very hard-pressed, and for them, shopping more locally makes sense. Avoiding the temptation of big stores makes sense. I think I remember this conversation being had about 12 or 15 years ago. Now, they're a much bigger, a more potent competitor.</p>
          <p>Our Everyday Value range now is absolutely one of the ways that we can help compete against them. Their marketing is good. They've been at the top of their game, we haven't. Our six-point plan is all about getting back on form and we expect that we can do that. And we expect that we will do it and return this business to growth.</p>
          <p>On the cyclical point, so I think Laurie's really started to cover many of them, because he &#x2013; I would say, our stores are in great locations. Some of them are too big, so we will be downsizing them. We've already begun to do that in Central Europe, take a 15K, make it an 8K, take a 10K, make it a 6K. Add more mall, hand over some space to partners who open retail next to us. That's good for the strength of the destination itself, because you've got more choice, because they're in good locations, people are driving past them anyway, so they'll pop in, more entertainment. It's good for us, because we haven't got the overheads that we would have had. And we've got a store that's tighter and more compact.</p>
          <p>The investment in convenience, the fact that we're opening &#x2013; we've hardly opened any more hypermarkets in Central Europe. We'll open a few in Turkey. We won't open very many in Asia, largely now, it's 1K supermarkets, it's convenience stores. So that's another reason why, I think, shareholders should have confidence that we can deal with the strategic issue, the systemic issue, I guess, you'd say.</p>
          <p>The investment in online, the online business is another example. And the fact, actually, that as we start to really understand what makes a hypermarket fit for the future, we modernize and refresh our extras, you've seen those. That's another reason why.</p>
          <p>As we come through this period of those subdued consumer sentiments, you should see the performance improve. We'll come right along the end of this row. Thank you. The gentleman there, then we'll come over here.</p>

Both Metro and Carrefour have indicated that some of their assets in Eastern Europe would be up for sale. As you know, they are mostly made up of hypermarket assets. So, just to be clear, could you consider looking at these assets? Will it be a maybe or is it categorically a no?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two or three questions, if I may, short ones, hopefully. Firstly, Philip, do you have a clearer indication now as to when you will stop being Chief Executive of the UK as well as the group?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of Fresh &amp; Easy, from when you took the hospital pass on, do you feel you're more or less optimistic about reaching <mark type="ph" /> Dave's (1:09:54) ambition of not destroying shareholder value?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just in terms of capital expenditure, from what you've said about you're focused on small stores and digital, is it not a case that you can structurally change your capital expenditure hereon? I think you talked about &#xA3;3.2 billion for this year. Can that not be quite materially cut down by hundreds of millions, if not billions in the future? And if not, what are you going to spend it on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, my chairman is in the audience. So, he constantly asks me about when I'm going to give up running the UK, and the answer to him is, when we're ready. And it's so important for the shareholders &#x2013; it's actually so important for the future of the business that we remain strong at home. Think of some of the other players who have stumbled at home and never recovered. We're not going to do that. So, he knows, also, I love it. So therefore, I'll stay with it until I'm sure that we're through the woods. And you'll be the last people to know when that is, but customers will tell us and that's really the thing I'm looking.</p>
          <p>I'm very focused on what the customers are saying. The UK team are here now and I couldn't do it without them. So, it's not just me on my own. And I do get time to do other things, believe me. But the fact that I am there and we can make the call, the important calls, make such a difference to us, I think.</p>
          <p>On Fresh &amp; Easy, we're still there, because I think there is a prospect of us delivering value for shareholders. And until I feel that that is not the case, we will be there. When I feel that it's not the case, we'll be doing something else. Now is not the time for that.</p>
          <p>It's only five years old. Toddlers learn to write about then and when they use their pencil, they write it on a bit of paper and they don't get much on their hands, then you give them an ink pen, it gets all over their hands. They stumble, don't they? We stumbled a bit on the first half. We've just changed so much, again, of our chilled space. The underlying stores have improved their profitability. The new ones are a drag.</p>
          <p>We've put in new management. We've put in a guy who worked with me for four or five years and did a similar job on the on the compact stores in Korea and he's at it. So, I know I'm here to deliver shareholder value. Believe me, I'm focused on it. Believe me, so are they.</p>
          <p>On capital expenditure, we'll update you when we get to the end of the financial year. You make some very valid points. Thank you. Another question here? We'll just come straight up here. Yes, gentleman here on the right in the gray suit, blue shirt. You, sir. Yes, you just looked that way. Yes, and then we'll go to your right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; you read an awful lot about price and we look at it so often. There are a weight of indifferences on a shopping basket. Some players have decided just to talk about price. That's all they're talking about. And others are talking about quality and then, comparing their prices to us. We're here. We serve a broad church. That's why our range architecture starts with the leading brands, who are having a bit of trouble at the moment, because they're high-low, our finest position, our own label in the core, and Everyday Value and then, other brands built around it.</p>
          <p>And we think that our architecture does a great job for us. And the differences are really on a basket, the customer is imperceptible. Now, we tried a few years ago to explain that with something called real baskets. And it didn't really &#x2013; it didn't work, really. It wasn't quite understood, but it is the truth. And that's how we tend to look at it. What matters most to us is our customers say, that's good value from Tesco. I can get what I want on the key lines at the right price. So it's not about, we aren't going to fight anybody on price. It's not about we're going to give up our price position at all. Indeed, a year ago, we invested very heavily in it.</p>
          <p>But this job in the UK is about six parts of the plan making us even stronger and, ever so importantly, that's been enough. We're not going to be somebody else, because we aren't. We are us. We are Tesco. We are the market leader. We do serve a third of the nation. We do a good job of it. Now let's make sure we have a different conversation with our customers, who get to understand how good we are. That's the job for 2013. I'm not giving up our price position. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've got the best store locations in the UK. 25 years of developing it, longer than that, perhaps. You will see some repurposing of space. In our future store pipeline that we are consented, we are actively now negotiating to reduce the space of 100,000 square foot stores down, because we just don't need them very big.</p>
          <p>Some of our 80,000 square foot stores, we're going to end up downsizing them too, very early stages. The first ones happened in the second half of the year. So I don't think rationalization is necessary. And I don't need many stores and think, why did we put that there? I don't &#x2013; sorry. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Samuel, HSBC. Two question on the UK. The first one, can you come back on the decrease in operating margin? To what extent was it due to gross margin?</p>
          <p>And the second one is on Click &amp; Collect concept for grocery. I think you have 90 sites at the moment. What's the potential and how is the profitability versus delivery to home and versus a store? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. The decrease in our operating margin is largely a consequence of putting in more to our operating costs in terms of labor, in terms of product quality, which also affects your gross margins. So largely it's below the gross margin line. More into stock loss, more into waste, more into in-store labor, but that's really where it comes.</p>
          <p>On Click &amp; Collect grocery, Ken's here, so why don't you &#x2013; you've got a microphone somewhere there, I think. So, Ken Towle runs our online businesses in the UK and around the world. I think there's a question about profitability, wasn't it, how far it can go. Ken?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:12) as a variation of that is a way of extending accessibility to Tesco. We make money from it. It's a slightly cheaper service for us to offer, because we don't deliver out to customers, customers come in to us to collect. One of the reasons why it is profitable is as with our grocery home shopping service, it gives us incremental sales. So, we're not just moving customers from one channel in the business to another. We're able to grow sales.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we're right at the beginning of this. As some of you know, it's quite big on some parts of Continental Europe. But we think it's another way of accessing growth and being more convenient for customers. And the response we've had from customers has encouraged to go as fast as we have been.</p>

          <p>Hi. Al Johnston from Citi. Just two questions. The first question on the new store remodels in the UK. I might have missed it, but can you share a little bit more data in terms of uplift on fresh and perhaps uplift elsewhere in the store, where it's relevant?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the U.S. Your CapEx has been running at around $10 million per new store in the U.S., roughly speaking, whereas the dollar store sector in the U.S., similar-sized stores, are able to deliver new stores for less than $1 million apiece and they're relatively similar. Can you explain why the capital intensity of that business? Those are the two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm going to give both of those to Laurie. So what are we saying about new store remodels and what's happening to sales uplift? And why is it $10 million a throw in the U.S. on average and $1 million for the dollar stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the key difference on the Fresh &amp; Easy U.S. question is the dollar stores are not refrigerated stores, so we spend a lot in terms of putting in refrigeration into a Fresh &amp; Easy store. It's much more varied in terms of the categories, frozen and chilled, and very little ambient, actually, as it goes.</p>
          <p>We're also putting in further services like coffee machines, like eating areas that are not in the dollar stores. The fabrication of the building, because it's chilled, has to be far more robust than a non-chilled store. So those are the key drivers. And we've actually been gradually built &#x2013; pulling down the average cost of build of a Fresh &amp; Easy store as well, in that we were new to the market.</p>
          <p>The average uplift for the remodel, the refreshed stores, we're saying it's a contribution of about 1% like-for-like. Now, we've done about &#x2013; we said we'd do 25% of the space, it's mainly focused on big stores. We're about halfway through that by the half year and we'll complete before Christmas the 25%.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To come back on those two points, are we to &#x2013; have you got many freehold stores in the U.S.? Are most of the stores freehold or a portion of them? And then on the uplift, just from what you're saying, are you saying essentially Fresh is up 4% to 5% within the store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct, because there's hardly any impact. In fact non-food is probably down, because we're taking out non-food space. If you take the Bishop's Stortford store that you may have been to, it was roughly 70/30 non-food &#x2013; food to non-food. It's much more 80/20 now to food versus non-food. So, all the uplift is really coming in the food department.</p>
          <p>And then your second question, which is about freeholds, the structure in the U.S. is quite different. Quite often, you end up owning the store, but you don't own the land. So, the traditional freehold, leasehold structure that we know in the UK and Europe is quite different from the U.S. and you end up actually going into strip malls, but the building's yours and you refurbish the building. Net net, standalone freehold stores, which do exist, there's very few of them actually in our U.S. business, less than 10%.</p>

          <p>Hi. Marc de Speville, Redburn. Just two questions, then, to finish off. First of all, coming back on Fresh &amp; Easy once again, can you give a bit more color regarding the nature of the stumble you said in H1, why the loss didn't really narrow very much? Is it a problem of maybe having trouble weaning customers off quite high couponing levels, for instance, or what exactly are you looking for, looking to improve? Specifically, what went wrong? What needs to go more specifically right? First question.</p>
          <p>Second one, back to the UK, there's talk then that volumes can go up or down or slightly up or depending on levels of inflation, but obviously you bank sales values &#x2013; you're banking the sales values, not the volumes, right? What's your view on price volume elasticity that you're feeling from consumers now versus a year ago? Generally, economists are saying that the pressures on disposable incomes in theory, on paper, are coming down a little bit as this income track has improved a little bit. How are you seeing that from what you see on <mark type="ph" /> customers (1:22:45), looking specifically to the ability to raise &#x2013; to pass on the incoming wave of commodity cost inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first half, Fresh &amp; Easy was all about not generating the like-for-like growth that we expected as we tried new things and couponing is one of them. Changing the range in Fresh very significantly was another of them. And that's what they're playing around with. They don't have many other places to go, other than the gross margin and the operating costs and the mix. So, that's where they've been and we'll see what happens in Q3 and Q4.</p>
          <p>On the outlook for the UK consumer, we track a group of families. We've been tracking them for quite a while. We call them Tesco families, because they do video diaries for us. They're resigned to this being the new norm. They see the disposable income squeeze and they're having to become very savvy about how they shop. We have a family, a middle-income family in Britain, man, wife, three daughters. And the father was talking to the diary and saying, we used to go out every weekend and I used to have &#xA3;50 I could spend on treating the family. I'm now working Saturday morning, basically having the same disposable income, because I'm working an extra half day, and we can afford &#xA3;50 a month, not &#xA3;50 a week.</p>
          <p>So, what that's meaning is, they are looking around for deals more. You have to have good deals. And they're looking very hard at the ongoing price of staples. So our reaction has been this massive increase and rebranding and reformulation of Everyday Value, which is 10% sales uplift in the business that really was sort of flat first half like-for-like. That's all it really was.</p>
          <p>So, they're making their own choices. And the louder you shout about promotions, the louder they look straight through them to what the real ongoing price is. So you have to be the right price at the right time on the right things and let your basic product range speak for itself, because they're too &#x2013; it's too open and transparent a world these days that they'll be fooled by someone banging at soap powder at half price and working out I only have the sales at half price. That great quote to end from me, 85% of coffee sold in supermarkets is <mark type="ph" /> on deal (1:25:15). It never sells really at full price.</p>

          <p>Anyway, thank you very much for your questions. It's always good to hear where you're coming from. Hope you understand where we're headed. We're headed for a business that will be very different in a few years' time. It's already different. I thank you for your patience and I'll look forward to seeing some of you at the Investor Tour we're going to do next month and again in a few months' time. Thanks very much. Take care. Bye-bye.</p>
