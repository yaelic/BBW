          <p>Good morning. This is the conference operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. You will have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, to the Credit Suisse First Quarter Results Call. I am joined by our CFO, David Mathers. I'll make a short introduction and David will take you through the detail, and then obviously we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>We delivered a strong, balanced, high-quality set of results with underlying pre-tax income of CHF2.2 billion, underlying net income of CHF1.6 billion, and an underlying return on equity of 19%.</p>
          <p>This performance demonstrates that our business model generates stable, high-quality earnings, and underscores the strength of our client-focused capital-efficient strategy. Despite the continuing challenges in global markets, we've maintained a strong momentum with clients, gaining market share and generating over CHF19 billion of net new assets.</p>
          <p>Taking a quick look at our businesses, I think you can see the impact of our client-focused approach. In Private Banking, we saw strong asset inflows and improved transaction-based revenues, offsetting a decline in net interest income.</p>
          <p>In Investment Banking, we had significant quarter-on-quarter revenue momentum in U.S. Dollar terms, driven by continued positive market share momentum and the impact of client flow sales expansion across securities, and this lead to a strong return on equity for the business well in excess of the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we had solid asset inflows and posted higher quality results, reflecting increased fee-based revenues and lower operating expenses.</p>
          <p>We had anticipated the regulatory developments we're now seeing. We've continued to build on our already very strong capital position with a Tier 1 ratio of 18.2%, a Core Tier 1 ratio of 13%, and a Basel 2.5 Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we announced two transactions to create up to 70% of our maximum potential issuance of high-trigger contingent capital suggested under the proposed Swiss regulations, and we reduced our net deferred tax assets by CHF800 million and increased shareholders' equity by CHF800 million.</p>
          <p>Funding is a continuing area of focus, and our spreads remain tight. We have a conservative approach to liquidity management and we believe that our debt maturity model is best-in-class, all reflected in a tightening of CDS spreads during the quarter. Spreads were also positively impacted by the buffer capital note transactions.</p>
          <p>We've continued to work closely with regulators to build a more stable financial system. In line with their expectations, regulatory developments show that progress is being made toward a more level playing field for the global banking industry. So overall, this was a strong, high-quality quarter in which we made good progress on capital and in meeting the challenges of the emerging global regulatory regime.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to David.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning. I'd like to start my presentation on Slide 5 with an overview of our financial results for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We achieved underlying revenue of CHF8.4 billion, pre-tax income of CHF2.2 billion, and net income of CHF1.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were CHF1.28. The pre-tax income margin was 27%; and post-tax return on equity, 19%. Total net new asset inflows were CHF19.1 billion, with particularly strong contribution from Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>We also show the reported results on this slide, which includes CHF617 million of fair value movements in the quarter. This falls into two components. First, the fair value movement on owned debt was CHF309 million this quarter, driven by a significant narrowing in our credit spreads. Our senior debt spreads narrowed by approximately 15 to 20 basis points, while the movement in our hybrid Tier 1 instruments was more extreme, at approximately 100 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>This followed the issuance of the buffer capital notes in February, which further boosted our already strong existing capital position and, particularly for the hybrids, accelerated the market's recognition of the pull to par due to the higher probability these instruments will in fact be called on the first eligible date. The second component is a charge of CHF308 million in respect of standalone derivatives related to our funding, and this is the standard mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide 6 now for an overview of the divisional results. In the Private Bank, we delivered a solid performance in the first quarter. We achieved strong net new asset inflows in Wealth Management of CHF15.7 billion, equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 7.8%. Net revenues were stable compared to the first quarter of 2010, with a lower net interest income offset by a positive trend in transaction-based revenues due to early signs of improved client activity.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate and Institutional business, which is predominantly based here in Switzerland, continued to benefit from an environment underpinned by the strong fundamentals of the Swiss economy. The overall pre-tax income margin was 30%.</p>
          <p>We continued to invest in the franchise, albeit balancing the post investment, with achieving efficiency gains across the business. Total operating expenses remained in line with the 2010 quarterly run rate. Within the quarter, we kept the total number of RMs unchanged, for this included gross hires of 70 RMs, 70% of which were senior.</p>
          <p>Let me now look at the Wealth Management results on Slide 7. Revenues were broadly stable at CHF2.4 billion. Pre-tax income for Wealth Management stood at CHF623 million, and the pre-tax income margin remained stable at 26%. Wealth Management's gross margin declined slightly in the quarter to 118 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let me now focus on revenue trends on Slide 8. As you can see from the slide, our first quarter revenues were reduced by CHF180 million due to the adverse impact of the strengthening Swiss franc. Excluding this, revenues grew by 6% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>If we look at the components of these revenues, including the FX impacts, transaction-based revenues improved by 11% due to higher brokerage and product issuing fees, which included strong demand for structured products. Recurring commissions and fees were essentially flat on a like-for-like basis, although you will note, on a reported basis, they dropped by 5%. That reflected the one-off gain that we took in the first quarter of 2010, but as you may recall, we changed the estimates for certain fund management fee accruals. Net interest income was 4% lower due to lower deposit volumes and lower margins.</p>
          <p>Let's focus more on that on Slide 9. You can see here how net interest income has contributed to revenues over the last few years. Net interest income has suffered both from the impacts of foreign currency moves, leading to lower average deposit volumes, and from the lower reinvestment rates and on our deposits.</p>
          <p>This roll-off effect has a material lagging impact which means we probably have another quarter or so of adverse impact from low interest rates on our Wealth Management business. Our estimate is that if interest rates didn't increase, but instead remained at current levels, the further margin reduction would be another CHF20 million from the current level of net interest income.</p>
          <p>Through trends towards increasing interest rates, we'll start to counterbalance this at some point. I would note that a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curves of the major currencies would, once fully reflected across our deposit and loan base, lead to an incremental CHF75 million to CHF100 million of revenues per quarter.</p>
          <p>On Slide 10, you can see how transactional revenues have contributed to total revenues. Since 2007, there has been both an absolute decline in transactional revenues, and a fall in gross margins due to reduced client activity and adverse change of product mix. We are now seeing signs of recovery in clients' activity from the low point reached last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 11. We had strong net new asset inflows of CHF15.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 7.8%, which is well above our 6% KPI target.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Corporate and Institutional Clients on Slide 12. Pre-tax income remains strong at CHF232 million in the first quarter, with a pre-tax margin of 50%. Net new asset inflows were also strong at CHF2.3 billion. And the continued strong results in this business reflect both the high quality of the loan book and the resilient fundamentals of the Swiss economy.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the Investment Bank on slide 13. The Investment Bank produced a strong result in the first quarter. Significantly improved revenue levels in Fixed Income, Sales and Trading reflected an early sign of a payback in the investment that we'd made to build out our client franchise, with market share gains achieved in most of our flow businesses. Many of our Fixed Income businesses had strong results in the quarter, particularly Securitized Products, Rates and Credit.</p>
          <p>The solid equity sales and trading result benefited from an increase in client volumes, as well as our sustained strong market share positions and a significant improvement in the performance of our Equity Derivatives business. We achieved solid underwriting and advisory results in the first quarter, with particular strength in high yield issuance.</p>
          <p>Slide 14. If you look first at the bottom table of this slide, you can see that in U.S. Dollar terms, the Investment Bank has achieved significant year-on-year revenue momentum. Net revenue has increased 8% compared to the first quarter last year, and we're up 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. In Swiss franc terms, our revenues decreased 6% against the first quarter of last year. Pre-tax income totaled CHF1.4 billion and the pre-tax income margin in the Investment Bank was 28%.</p>
          <p>If we focus first on our Fixed Income results on Slide 15. The investment in our client flow business model is beginning to deliver, and we believe we've outperformed the average industry growth this quarter, capturing market share in our target areas. In U.S. Dollar terms, Fixed Income revenues were CHF3.3 billion this quarter; an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have strong results in Securitized Products, driven by increased client flows in non-agency RMBS; in Credit, driven by robust leverage finance activity, including strong new issuance and results; and in Rates, resulting from higher client flows as it began to see the benefits from our expanded distribution footprint.</p>
          <p>Slide 16. As I mentioned earlier &#x2013; as I mentioned already, the impact of our investment in the fixed flow sales force expansion is beginning to positively impact revenues. One key internal measure, sales credits, were 19% higher in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010, with good contributions from both Rates and FX.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Equities business on Slide 17. The solid revenue levels were driven by higher client volumes and improved investor risk appetite, with particularly strong contribution from the Derivative business, as we saw improved client activity resulting from an intensified coverage effort over the last year. In U.S. Dollar terms, total equity revenues were slightly higher than in the first quarter of 2010. We had a strong result in Cash Equities and Prime Services from mixed market trends.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Underwriting and Advisory business on Slide 18. In Swiss franc terms, revenues increased by 5% compared to the first quarter of 2010. In U.S. Dollar terms, revenues improved by CHF164 million or 20% compared to the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of individual business lines, the strongest performance was in Debt Underwriting, where revenues improved significantly compared to the first quarter of 2010. We also saw an improvement in M&amp;A activity. Only Equity Underwriting lagged due to lower issuance volumes in the quarter. Both our M&amp;A and our underwriting pipelines for the balance of 2011 remain strong.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 19. This shows a long-term view of our market share progression, touching briefly on the major businesses. In Equities, we maintained our leadership position in both Cash Equities and Prime Services.</p>
          <p>In Fixed Income, we have significant momentum across those products that are being driven by the franchise build-out, and there's still room for improvement, especially in Rates and FX.</p>
          <p>Underwriting and Advisory, we have consolidated our leadership position in global high-yield underwriting. We also maintained our number-one position in our total share of wallets within emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Slide 20. This is the chart that we use to illustrate market positions, the trading environment and the revenues of our key business in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. The key points that I'd highlight for you on this slide are, first, Prime Services, Cash Equities and Securitized Products are businesses where we continue to have market leading positions, and this was clearly a particular benefit in RMBS business this quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, the sales force expansion benefited the overall revenue contribution to the Rates business as we improved our market share on a high level of clients' activity compared to the 2010 quarterly average.</p>
          <p>Third, in Leveraged Finance, a good market environment continued into 2011, driven by a combination of strong investor appetite and greater refinancing activity.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. Total compensation expenses in the Investment Bank of CHF2.4 billion, increased by 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, due primarily in Swiss franc terms the to CHF70 million of increased social security taxes resulting from the timing of the delivery of deferred compensation share awards in the first quarter of the year. And note these were actually delivered in the second quarter last year. Partly as a consequence of this, the Investment Bank comp-to-revenue ratio stood at 48% compared to 49% in the full year for 2010, and 44% in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Non-compensation expenses increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by CHF34 million of high litigation provisions, but also an increase in regulation-related professional and consulting fees.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Asset Management on Slide 22. Our strategy in Asset Management is delivering better results through increased scale, strong investment performance, a focus on restructuring, and general improvement in efficiency.</p>
          <p>The quality of our revenues has improved, with our fee-based revenues increasing by 9% from the first quarter of 2010, adjusting for the FX impact. We achieved solid net new asset inflows of CHF4.5 billion this quarter. And I point out this is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive inflows, reflecting strong investment performance and our product's expansion.</p>
          <p>We also benefit from lower operating expenses. And I point out that the 4% reduction in cost this quarter is sustainable and results from the successful implementation of a number of efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>Slide 23. Pre-tax income in Asset Management was strong at CHF172 million, with a pre-tax margin 29%, and consolidating the good progress that we made in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 24. Strong net new asset inflows of CHF4.5 billion were well distributed across product types, with particularly strong contribution from our Asset Allocation business, MACS. Equities and hedge fund inflows also benefited from an expanded product offering and increased client activity.</p>
          <p>Slide 25. This slide shows the 9% increase in fee-based revenues, adjusting for the currency impact from the strengthening franc. On the same basis, operating expenses have fallen by 4%. And as you can see, we both exited from a number of loss-making businesses and grew a number of businesses that are already delivering a high incremental return.</p>
          <p>Finally for Asset Management, on Slide 26, this shows that historically, we had a good fourth quarter. The reason is the timely recognition of performance fees. The majority of performance fees are recognized in the second and the fourth quarter of Hedging Griffo and in the fourth quarter for York, where you may recall that we acquired a substantial minority interest in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 27. Given the increased focus on Eurozone countries this quarter, we've updated the numbers that we provided with our fourth quarter results. As we stated then, and as you can see here, we have limited exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign exposure in the countries that we lay out in this slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. We continue to maintain our position as one of the best capitalized banks globally, with a 100 basis point improvement in the Basel II Tier 1 ratio to 18.2%. Our Core Tier ratio, or CET1, which excludes hybrid capital, also improved to 13% from 12.2% as at year end 2010.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, adjusting for the incremental risk-weighted assets and capital reductions, the pro-forma B 2.5 Core Tier 1 ratio also increased by 50 basis points to 10.2%. I would note that the regulatory capital base includes a CHF423 million accrual for our quarterly dividend accrual, in line with the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>On Slide 29, we've repeated a simulation of the illustrative model on how the CET1 ratio could develop from now to the beginning of 2013 under the rules as laid out by the Basel Committee and by the Swiss Expert Commission.</p>
          <p>On the left of the slide is the capital development, and on the right, risk-weighted assets. This slide assumes current market expectations and, as such, does not represent forward-looking statements made by Credit Suisse management.</p>
          <p>As at the end of the first quarter of 2011, the estimated pro forma CET1 ratio was 9.2% and by the beginning of 2013, the CET1 capital grows to CHF40.2 million, and dividing by CHF330 million to CHF350 billion of RWA under the new B3 rules would give a B3 CET1 ratio of 11.8%.</p>
          <p>Slide 30. As we've said on previous occasions, we expect our residual net deferred tax assets to be substantially reduced by the beginning of 2014. Deferred tax asset utilization is very much on schedule, with a balance reducing by 9% this quarter. The primary move has been our U.S. Deferred tax assets, due to strong performances by businesses in the Americas. But I would note, this results in the slightly higher effective tax rate this quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 31. We showed this slide at a recent industry conference. And the key points to note are the high-trigger Buffer Capital Note transactions that we announced in February have secured over 70% of the high-trigger Contingent Convertible Cap requirements that's required for 2019.</p>
          <p>Compared to our existing hybrid Tier 1 and Claudius capital, the indicative spreads over senior debt on these transactions at the time of issuance are lower before our existing hybrid Tier 1 capital. So I think we've proven that we're able to transition an important component of our capital structure into the new regime at equal or even lower versus financing costs.</p>
          <p>I would also note that of the public transactions, nearly 50% was allocated to the traditional institutional investors, with a further 18% to hedge funds. And as we noted earlier on, we have seen a sharp narrowing of spreads, particularly in senior debt and our hybrid Tier 1, partly as a consequence, we believe, of the issuance of this debt.</p>
          <p>Slide 32. Much of the public attention of Basel III focuses on capital requirements. But as importantly, the Basel III regime also proposes new liquidity and funding requirements. And we thought it might be useful to give an indication of how we might stand on these potential new rules.</p>
          <p>First, in terms of liquidity, the proposed Basel regime, known as the LCR or Liquidity Coverage Ratio, has a number of marked similarities to the existing Swiss regime, which we operate under already and have since the second quarter of last year. On the Swiss regime, we have an excess short-term 30-day liquidity of CHF119 billion, or 127% coverage ratio, as calculated by the Swiss rules. The cost of this increased liquidity buffer is already factored and taken into our results, creating a drag to our overall pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>Second, if we look at the net stable funding rules, whilst the final definitions are still in flux, based on our current understanding, we'd estimate that our ratio stands at 94%, with future funding plans taking us above 100% by 2013, well ahead of the potential implementation date.</p>
          <p>Finally, just to conclude, on Slide 33, I would like to touch briefly on the revised ROE targets that we laid out back in February, particularly as they relate to the Investment Bank. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, we have an ROE target for the Group of greater than 15%. And in particular, this is meant with regard to the period following the Basel III implementations when we will have accrued a still-higher equity base.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2011, the Group achieved a 19% underlying return on equity. However, this already reflects the capital base which is high under the existing Basel II rules, with a Tier 1 ratio, as referred to before, of 18.2%.</p>
          <p>If we just assume the minimum cap on the business that would have been required under the old but full extent B2 rules, using our former B2 target that you may recall was 12.5%, our returns for the Group as a whole would have been 23% for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now on the same base, assigning 12.5% equity to the Investment Bank's B2 RWA, this business would have made 22%. As you can see, it's slightly lower than the Group return, but it's still well in excess of our cost to capital.</p>
          <p>So let's now look at the same analysis under Basel III, which is the real focus. Using the projected minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10% on the increased B3 RWA usage, on this pro forma basis, in full year 2010, the ROE for the Investment Bank was 11% but has now improved to 16% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly, this is a pro forma analysis and it's almost two years before we enter the Basel 3 regime. But I think what this analysis does show is that the returns in the Investment Bank met or exceeded our cost of capital last year, even the larger B3 capital base, and that the first quarter results show considerable improvement from this level.</p>
          <p>So on this note, I would like to conclude my presentation and hand you back to Brady.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. I guess at this point, we'd like to open it up for Q&amp;A. So operator, if you can let us know when there any questions queued up, we'll start to work through them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Morning. I've got three quick questions, please. First one for Brady; I wonder if you could expand on your comments about the emergence of a more level playing field for regulation, and specifically, where do you think the SIFI buffers might get set? And do Swiss regulators think it's already captured in your current higher capital requirements or does it need to be added on? And what do you think is the chance for the potential cost of subsidiarization of the Swiss Retail business? And could that result in lower potential buffers going forward?</p>
          <p>The other two questions, just a bit detail for David. First one, on Slide 29, you used to indicate that potential deductions for financial stakes and DTAs were about CHF6 billion from 2013. Where does that number sit net of your DTA recovery?</p>
          <p>And secondly, to get your net stable funding up from 94% to 100%, what do you think the increased interest costs might be? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. I'll take the first one and, as you say, we can have David address the other two.</p>
          <p>I guess, obviously on this question of emergence of a more level playing field, we can give our opinion, obviously. You're all extremely knowledgeable about it, so you'll have your own opinions. But I just think, obviously with the recommendations in the UK of their Commission there, which talked about 10% common equity ratio, also referred to contingent capital and bail-in type capital, some of the announcements that have come out of Sweden, our view is that these are encouraging &#x2013; well, these are indications that we could &#x2013; that we are &#x2013; seem to be moving to more of a level playing field. But obviously the question will be, how far will that extend, what other countries we'll end up at, et cetera. And we obviously don't know that.</p>
          <p>But clearly, there have been a few indications, I would say, recently over the past quarter that things are sort of &#x2013; seem to be migrating more towards that 10% common equity level which is where we are. And also, with more discussion around contingent capital-type instruments, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So in our view, obviously one other things people thought when Switzerland first came out with the regulations was that it was going to be very difficult for us to be competitive on that basis. We've obviously had a slightly different view, because our view was that the contingent convertible market was going to be very accessible at reasonable cost, and the 10% fee T1 ratio requirement was something where other countries would move more towards that, so &#x2013; and I guess all we're saying is we feel like we've had some vindication in that recently, if you look at just some of the moves. And obviously, we'll see. It's a longer process and it takes time, but we'll see how that actually moves on.</p>
          <p>With regard to the SIFI, I guess the G-SIFI surcharges, et cetera, I guess our view would be that I think the Swiss regulatory requirements, or the recommendations at this point, are in excess of whatever would be required by a G-SIFI sort of charge. So I don't think there is any &#x2013; we don't believe there is any real prospect of us having any additional capital requirements on top of what we already have.</p>
          <p>And I'd say, as you know, this whole issue around the G-SIFIs and the SIFI surcharges is obviously a process where a number of countries and institutions are involved, et cetera, but I think our &#x2013; we continue to believe that, in general, there will be a G-SIFI list and there will be capital, additional capital, above the 7% minimum required on that. Whether that's 1.5%, 1%, 2% in addition or more, I don't know, but we continue to believe that, that will transpire over time.</p>
          <p>The question of the subsidiarization you mentioned about Swiss Retail, et cetera, again, I think if you look at what the Expert Commission recommended and what their focus was, it was really on these issues around capital and really ensuring the capital liquidity, et cetera, where with that &#x2013; there wasn't as much of a focus on issues of, as you say, subsidiarization.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there will be, and I think our view is that regulators around the world are going to be working with the banks to ensure that people have plans in place, resolution-type plans, et cetera, contingency plans, but actually don't think that this whole subsidiarization issue is really one that will have much of a role.</p>
          <p>But again, I guess it's a process, and as you know, there are debates around that in the various different countries, so we'll see how that develops. But in our view, that's not going to be a major feature of the service solution on the sort of too-big-to-fail issue.</p>
          <p>So David, do you want to address the other one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. So on those two points, I think I started to talk about potentially, as you say, CHF6 billion of potential deductions which begin to phase in from the beginning of 2014 at 20% per annum. I think that in terms of our deferred tax asset utilization, I think, clearly seeing the usage of CHF0.8 billion this quarter, of which CHF0.5 billion was in DTA, and now pricing up to our NOLs, I think does show the progress that we're actually making, which we talked about before.</p>
          <p>I think the CHF6 billion estimated reduction is probably a little bit on the high side now. Probably the number is going to be more like CHF4 billion, but it's clearly very subjective to how the numbers move over next couple of years. But it's probably slightly better than we indicated before, in fairness.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the incremental interest costs to achieve an NSFR of 100%, and I would say the rules are still a little bit in flux. We wanted to give our best estimates today of 94%. We'll see how that pans out as these get locked down over the next year or so. But I guess to give you some idea, I think we probably need incremental debt funding of the order of CHF15 billion to CHF20 billion, which is readily achieved within our funding plan. And the interest cost on that, I think my view on spreads, your view on spreads, but it's probably in the CHF200 million to CHF250 million level, basically. So most of the way there, the incremental cost sum, but not &#x2013; they're not that substantial.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Kian Abouhossein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. A few questions. First of all, the Basel III numbers, you have some nice slides. Could you tell me, if I take a fully loaded basis, what number would I get for the Basel III number?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Glencore. We clearly have a bit more numbers, and you have a JV with Glencore. And I'm just wondering, what is it that is not working with Glencore, considering your Commodity business is still not where, I guess, you want to be? And you have been in this JV for a very long time. What is the end game for your Commodity business? How do you see that developing?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on FICC, Slide 16, which is very useful. And despite headwinds, it looks like you're making good progress. I wonder, where do you want to be? So if we take first quarter, the 100%, where should the 119% be? And where is it coming from? From what segments will you expect an improvement? And are we done in terms of head count increase, another 100 people? And how do we see the comp ratio developing in that context as you move in higher up the percentage increase in client business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Kian. Could I just ask, to clarify in your first question, you mention the Basel III number; are you talking about Slide 33, the return...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, no. Slide 29, where you have the 11.8%. My understanding, that's not fully phased. And I just wonder, on your numbers, I have made some estimates, but I'm just wondering what would be the fully phased number, if I look at Slide 29?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me &#x2013; maybe I can start with your second question on the Commodity business, and then David can come back on the other two.</p>
          <p>As you say, I think in commodities in general, we have &#x2013; as you say, we have had a cooperation arrangement with Glencore over a number of years, and that's actually worked well and they've actually been a great partner in that. And obviously, they have been a &#x2013; I think they've actually been a terrific partner to have in the Commodity business.</p>
          <p>I think our issues are really around, we want to make sure that we have a Commodity business that's focused on areas which really are synergistic with the rest of the business overall, and where we think we really have an edge and we can really build that. Because as you know, it's a business that is a little bit different from many of the other businesses in the financial &#x2013; many of the other sort of more financial product-type businesses. And so it's one where &#x2013; our view is that we need to be focused and we need to sort of build out those areas carefully, in a disciplined way. But we think we can actually build some real capability there.</p>
          <p>So I think our &#x2013; we've had a good ongoing relationship with Glencore in that area. We continue to have a cooperation arrangement there, and we will continue to have that. But we will also continue to, in a disciplined and focused way, build out the Commodity business. So I think that's &#x2013; hopefully that's responsive to that question.</p>
          <p>Do you want to, David, then take the Basel III question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, as I &#x2013; so Kian, just in &#x2013; just running through. So I think I understand the question. Clearly the Basel III RWA is fully loaded. So CHF400 billion and then the CHF330 billion, CHF350 billion basically deductions which, taken under the 2.5, were actually grossed up under Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just for the sake of clarity, just to give the B2.5 numbers we gave the pro forma Core Tier 1 ratio at 10.2%, that was after CHF30 billion of incremental RWA for B2.5 and a further CHF2.9 billion in deductions. So if we were to gross it up, you'd be thinking about CHF292 billion as a pro forma B2.5 number.</p>
          <p>In terms of the CET1 ratio, so we've given numbers here of 9.2% on the basis of the CHF330 billion to CHF350 billion post-mitigation RWA, rising to 11.8% by the 11th January, 2013 checkpoints.</p>
          <p>Now I think clearly, and just in terms of definition for that, I think that we have had clear discussions with the FINMA, and I think by virtue of the progress of Basel III and the Swiss Expert Commission recommendations, we have considerable clarity of our capital ratio definitions.</p>
          <p>So I think, as you're aware, essentially we've given that there. It's obviously the shareholders' equity deducting the dividend which goes for approval to the AGM on Friday, and the accrual for the first quarter, which means implicitly that, that includes goodwill, as you know, which is included. It also though deducts for the cloudiest preference share issue, and also things such as the pension fund filter. So that's the number as we know will be defined by our regulator from the beginning of 2013.</p>
          <p>I think one can get different ratios from that. I'm sure you can calculate those. I think what I would say is, as an answer to I think Jon's question earlier, the deductions we talked about before of CHF6 billion are probably on the high side. I'd probably work more towards CHF4 billion. And I think that's probably the only comment I'd make beyond that, basically, Kian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you also wanted to talk about the Fixed Income business on Slide 16. I think the point I'd make there is that we wanted to give some illustration of how the benefits from the sales force expansion, which we talked about last year, have actually come through. I think you could see that the primary target for that was Rates, and that's where we've seen the primary benefit. The expansion of the Flow Rates business is a relatively capital-efficient business and fits well on our business model. And I think you've kind of seen that both in terms of these sales numbers, as you can see from the bubble chart, also in terms of our reported revenues from the Rates business in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And I think in fact, we would expect further momentum that &#x2013; as we actually build on that. There is plans for incremental sales as beyond that, but it's a relatively balanced process, just infilling where we are now. I wouldn't expect that to be that expensive in terms of incremental cost.</p>
          <p>Away from the Rates business, we've clearly obviously also added in businesses as such as FX, Credit and Emerging Markets. I think in Emerging Markets, our objective there is to shift it from being more of a, you might say, hub-and-spoke structured lending-driven business to an onshore business. We're making progress on that. There's probably still further to go over the next two years.</p>
          <p>I think your next question then was actually on the comp-to-revenue ratio for the Investment Bank; is that correct, Kian? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm just wondering kind of how should we think about headcounts going forward? And how should we think about the comp ratio? Because clearly it might over-accrue and that's why the number looks maybe higher or &#x2013; how should we think about the number of comp of what you would engage in, and what you think is reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we feel we've made a conservative and appropriate accrual for variable compensation in the first quarter, albeit that it's clearly difficult making a full year projection for compensation against full year results, particularly in the first quarter. It's more uncertain at this point than perhaps it might be later in the year.</p>
          <p>I would point out though that if you look at the first quarter compensation-to-revenue number, now, it's &#x2013; we don't accrue to a ratio, it's a result. You can see that it's 48.4% compared to 49% last year, and compared to 44% in the first quarter. So increased by about 4% from the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 201.</p>
          <p>Now within that, as you can see, we actually delivered our stock awards in the first quarter &#x2013; rather, in the second quarter; it shifted by about a month &#x2013; and that triggered approximately CHF70 million of higher social security taxes relating to that award. That's approximately 1.5% of that increase. And most of the rest really reflects deferred comp accruals, as opposed to anything else. But I think we're trying to balance here, I think, a conservative and appropriate accrual. We're also making decent returns for our shareholders. Clearly, in dollar terms, this is actually record first quarter revenues for the Investment Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just very briefly on head count, can you just see how we should think about that developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as you're aware, we announced that we were in negotiations to buy a hedge fund administration business last year from Fortis. So at some point later this year, I think, probably in the second quarter, you will see an increase in head count in the Investment Bank. However, most of that staff is actually processing-based, and so the head count will go up. But I think that will not have that much impact on the incremental compensation accruals. So I don't think you should expect to see ex that, that substantial changes in the balance of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the other &#x2013; Kian, it's Brady again. I just wanted to add to what David said on Slide 29. I think one of the things you wanted to make clear was that I do think that we feel that we've gone a long way down the road to getting pretty certain around all these issues.</p>
          <p>So when you look at Slide 29, it's pretty &#x2013; it's I think pretty well laid out in terms of how we see the capital progressing. We've shown obviously that we can raise the contingent capital. And it obviously puts us in a pretty good place. And so I think &#x2013; it's one of the things I think that is a little bit different in terms of our situation from many others, is that we're actually &#x2013; we've got a very clear, I think, view of how we're going to progress and how we're going to get there, and hopefully Slide 29 helps to demonstrate that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Derek De Vries of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Derek. Just two questions, if I might. First, we saw Julius Baer announce a settlement with German authorities, and given your situation in Germany, is that something you would consider, something of similar sort of &#x2013; pay a fine and move on? Is that something you're discussing?</p>
          <p>And then I guess my second question is more of broader question, even broader than that one, just on the Basel stuff, the Basel III, the capital requirements, funding issues, issues like Germany, private banking issues and securities litigation, how much management time is being consumed by those types of regulatory and litigation issues today? Where was that number 12 months ago? And if you look two years into the future, do you still anticipate a large percentage being consumed by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think taking your second question first, Derek &#x2013; and by the way, thanks for the questions &#x2013; I actually think, to be honest, I think we actually feel like we're in a much better position now than we were, say, a year ago. we &#x2013; as I said, one of the nice things about our situation, I think, is we've got a clear view of what our capital requirements are, how we can meet those requirements, how we need to continue to evolve the business and mitigate different aspects of it, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So it's actually been quite refreshing over the past six or eight months to be able to have certainty around a lot of these issues. So with the Basel III framework, with the capital framework in Switzerland, with our rating of the contingent convertible, et cetera, it actually puts us in a very &#x2013; puts us in a proactive position. The worst thing is when these things are undecided and you don't &#x2013; you can't actually do anything because you don't know exactly what the requirement's going to be or what direction they're going to go in.</p>
          <p>So to be honest with you, I actually think that on most of these issues we've been very proactive about it. So you're talking about funding, you're talking about capital, you're talking about the Basel III, et cetera. We've been very proactive about it and we feel like &#x2013; actually, I feel like we're in a really strong position from a management point view in terms of the issues and having our arms around them, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So to be honest with you, they're taking a lot less time now than they did a year ago. So I think that's actually a really positive thing, and it allows us to really focus on the business and deliver &#x2013; really delivering.</p>
          <p>These other issues, as you say, some of the regulatory and some of the litigation-type issues, et cetera, as you know, it's very much just a feature of the industry right now. And if you look probably at most of the banks that you cover, and if you really look at any country around the world, there are a lot of regulatory and a lot of litigation issues out there. It's probably just a feature of the industry anyway, but there's clearly a lot going on in that area right now. And I don't view that as being any more intensive now than, again, than say we've been over the &#x2013; at any point over the past two or three years.</p>
          <p>So I think in general, we feel that we've got kind of a fresh &#x2013; we've got sort of &#x2013; with certainty around these issues, we have actually got a sort of nice platform, a strong base to actually manage the business from and to make real business and resource allocation decisions, et cetera, which is actually quite good. And frankly, until others get certainty around it, it's hard. Until you have certainty, it's hard to know which direction to take your businesses in, et cetera, and that's probably the hardest part.</p>
          <p>With regard to Germany and what's going on there, I think, as you know, we basically don't really have much to add to what we've said in the past. We obviously continue to cooperate with the authorities there. We believe that globally, we've had a really state-of-the-art compliant cross-border banking business, and so we'll see how that develops. We really don't have anything to add.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions. First of all, I do apologize for going back to Slide 29, but we seem to be dancing around a little bit on this. I think, Brady, you've given us some fantastic disclosure here and it's very much appreciated. But I suppose what we were saying to you is, the 11.8%, if you take in the goodwill and obviously the deductions, we're probably down somewhere north of 8%.</p>
          <p>And I guess the question is, when you look at what Morgan Stanley did last week, Goldman Sachs around 11%, Barclays around 10%, and obviously Italian retail banks now at around the 10% mark, does it matter that you're that kind of level? Or is your view that look, we're a strong bank, strong credit ratings, and it doesn't matter? It's 2019 that matters. Or do you think there may be a competitive issue? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second one is just on the Wealth Management business. And I think, Brady, we had this chat at this time last year. Great business, great inflows; the pre-tax margin now down, it's just 25.6%, I think. I know the dollar weakness is an issue, but as we saw yesterday, you've now got UBS up sort of up towards the mid 30s.</p>
          <p>Is there anything else you think you should be doing apart from just doing a good job of trying bring in the money and run the business? Or is it a time when you have to look a little bit at the cost base or how you can just accelerate what you obviously want to do in terms of moving to higher pre-tax margin? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I guess on the first question, I think our view is that we have a very strong capital position pretty much no matter how you look at it. So there are obviously lots of different ways to look at it, as you say. Slide 29 is, as you say, it's actually fairly complex and it probably only contemplates about a third of the different ways you could calculate and the different kind of things that you could bring in.</p>
          <p>So to be honest, there are lots of different ways to look at it. But, 18.2% Tier 1 ratio under Basel II today, I think, and obviously that includes hybrids, et cetera, which we still believe certainly are effective capital. You've got these CET1 ratios. You've got &#x2013; and they fully incorporate obviously all the transitional elements, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In addition, on top of that, we have now CHF8 billion of contingent convertible high-trigger capital in place. I think the level of capital that we have in place is extremely strong. And so to be honest with you, there are lots of different ways you could look at it, but my view is it's &#x2013; the strength of our capital and funding is actually a competitive advantage. And if you look at the client flows that we have coming in, and there is no bank that has come close to our net new asset gathering over the past three years; no bank that's come anywhere close. And I think that's an indication of the trust that clients have in the firm, the fact that we are one of the few banks that didn't take a government bail-out through the crisis, and the fact that we have a very strong liquidity and capital regime.</p>
          <p>So to be honest, I think that's actually a competitive strength of ours; nothing else. So I don't know, David if you have anything you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I agree with Brady. I think the point to really focus on is clearly the CET1 ratio does not include any of the buffer capital notes. And as Brady said, there's CHF8 billion of that now in place, CHF3 billion in issuance. I think if you look at the debt spreads we referred to earlier on, 15 to 20 basis points narrowing in the quarter for our senior debt, 100 basis points Tier 1, I think shows an awful lot about the confidence of the market in our funding.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of detailed points, Slide 29, as I said, I think the reduction's probably more like CHF4 billion rather than CHF6 billion.</p>
          <p>I think one point which &#x2013; one small point of detail that I would focus on is the RWA number, I think, is conservatively stated. And I point out basically that we've still left our RWA numbers at the same level as we did for last October, even though of course in currency terms, we're now talking about a dollar-to-franc level closer to the 90 level. Now we did that, I think, on the grounds of being consistent. But clearly, the equity obviously has been restated for that; the RWA hasn't. So if you factor that in, that will also change your numbers.</p>
          <p>And I think last but not least, we talk here about a ratio of 9.3% right into 11.8%. Well, that sounds good, but I'd also point that our CET1 ratio under B2.5, which we don't report until the end of this year, actually improved by 50 basis points this quarter already. So we showed significant earnings retention to actually drive that. Clearly, you're seeing that as well in terms of things such as deferred tax reductions.</p>
          <p>I think equally &#x2013; I think it's important, and clearly the capital markets don't just look at the capital ratio, they also look at the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the NSFR, which I think we've given some reasonable disclosure there, just in terms of, I think, the strength of our position.</p>

          <p>I think on your second question around Wealth Management business, I think obviously we've been through a lot of the dynamics of the business, and I'm sure you're fully &#x2013; you get sort of the dynamics of steady interest rate margin aspects, et cetera. We're obviously pleased to see the transactional volumes going up. That's obviously a nice trend. If that continues, that will obviously be a positive.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that, as we've described to you here, that interest rates over time are probably not going down from here; they're probably going up. And as they do, you can see there is significant benefit that will come into the business. So I think on sort of the revenue side, there's obviously &#x2013; given the amount of assets that we've gathered, given the strength of the franchise overall, our view is we've really taken a step change in our position in this business over the last three years versus competitors, and that's going to have us positioned extremely well as the business continues to improve.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the issues around efficiency in the costs side, we have tried to be &#x2013; continue to maintain our investment in the business, but to be very disciplined about how we do that. And so we've had pretty continuous efficiency measures in place around pricing, around cost measures, front-to-back efficiencies, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there are impacts as well to the business, as you know. There's strong net new asset growth and as things come in, obviously they &#x2013; assets, as they come in, tend to depress gross margins, those new assets, et cetera. But we do believe that we've got a great platform to increase our breadth of product sales, et cetera, which will, we think, improve the revenue productivity of these assets over time as well.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are some structural issues. The cost of doing business is going up in the business. Regulatory costs, et cetera, is a fact of life. That's going to be one of the things that we're going to need to continue to deal with over time. But I think our view is that we still are very optimistic about our position in this business. As I say, I think we've actually &#x2013; there's been a step change in the relative position over the past three years in this business, and that &#x2013; we think that puts us in a really good place to benefit as things do continue to improve in the business. And so as a result, as that happens, you'll see real, obviously, improvement in the overall profitability business, but also in the margins in the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a quick question on the risk-weighted assets in the Investment Bank which were down in both Swiss francs and dollars. I'm just wondering if there's anything specific in there, or whether it's just sort of quarter-end volatility relative to average for the quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that there's anything in particular we'd highlight. I think, from an internal point of view, yes, we put in shadow reporting for B2.5 back last year, and we are actually managing the business on that basis already, even though we don't actually report on that basis, to the year-end.</p>
          <p>So within that, I think the B2 number coming down is fine. I think it's in line with the general approach we have towards being very capital-efficient. So I don't think there's anything in particular to note. I think it's clearly an important part of how we measure the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Two questions. Well done on the results this morning. I thought that was good, because you've been able to covert the try of market share gains in Investment Banking. The question would be, when can you covert those tries in Private Banking? Can we expect it in the second half of this year? Can we expect it next year? Because that's basically obviously the one area that is still missing versus your crisis efforts, I would say, between '07 and '09.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the draft projects on the TBTF law. when you read this draft project, it seems that the rights of the creditor of low-trigger CoCo is extremely, very low. All these CoCos will be issued in Switzerland. The capital, in case of conversion, will be used to actually bail out the Swiss subsidiary. Aren't you a bit concerned that people investing potentially low-trigger CoCos end up owning a small Swiss bank at the end of it, even if it's a tail-end risk? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jacques-Henri, thanks very much for those questions. I think, as you say, we are pleased to see that in the first quarter. As you note, the Investment Banking clearly are beginning to see the progress in the monetization of some of those investments in building market share. And we think that Investment Banking, that market share momentum, continues and is something that we will hopefully continue to see the benefits from over time.</p>
          <p>And as you say, in Private Bank as well, clearly the market share gains are there. The net new offset inflows have been strong, as we've said. So clearly those are there. When will we actually see that convert is, I think, largely dependent upon overall market conditions. As we've said, we've been encouraged by the progression in the transactional side of the business, and hopefully that will continue. It's obviously probably somewhat contingent on overall market conditions and the psychology of the investor base, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But also, as we said, the interest rate margin aspect of it can be a very important aspect. And if we do start to see interest rates rising, which again, we're not predicting that they go up at any certain rate or any certain time, but we do believe they're more likely to be up than down over the next period of time, that will also obviously help to convert that.</p>
          <p>I also do think that just the passage of time, as you know, net new assets come in over time, you do get more cross-sell, more &#x2013; you get a broader participation of the product offerings, et cetera. And we still do believe that those are programs that we're very focused on and are ongoing. So I guess it's not a very specific answer to your question in when will we actually see that, but obviously we hope to see that over the quarters to come.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on &#x2013; as you say, on the &#x2013; you're talking about, I guess, the contingent convertibles, low-trigger or, I guess, any of the contingent convertibles. Obviously...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's more than the low-trigger ones which the drafter was basically saying, tough luck for you, creditors, if you get converted, it's going to go into the Swiss bank. And if there's any money left, then you may get some money back, but you're not sure what you're going to be the owner of, or the creditor of, at the end of the process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the issue, Jacques-Henri, I think is to step back and look at the way in which the contingent capital was actually structured by the Expert Commission, with reference to Basel III. So clearly, the way which it works, and this is supposed to take obviously effect from 2019, is there's a minimum CET1 ratio of 10%.</p>
          <p>Now in order to trigger the high strike requirement, you'd have to drop that to 7%. Within between 7% and 10%, as you know, there's been, I think, an intensive regime from the Swiss regulators to &#x2013; over things like dividend payments, variable compensation, et cetera, which is clearly designed to preclude the trigger when you actually get to 7%.</p>
          <p>But let's just say you go through that phase and you do hit 7%. On CHF350 billion, CHF340 billion of risk-weighted assets, CHF300 billion, you're talking about approximately CHF10 billion of net losses required to actually trigger that. Okay, so you trigger that. Then essentially you're back at 10%. The low strike kicks in at 5%, and if the RWA is still at the same level, that would require a further CHF15 billion of net losses before you're actually triggered.</p>
          <p>So I think it's pretty early days in terms of the market for low strike CoCo, because I think we've made it clear we focus on the high strike in the interim. But I think if you look at it from the view of a potential purchaser, you're talking about CHF25 billion of net losses after a period of close supervision to actually get there. I think, in the context of the business model that we have for Credit Suisse, I think we describe the conversion of the high strike convertibles as remote and highly unlikely. I think is &#x2013; I'm not sure how you come up with it, but it's clearly extraordinarily remote. And I think that is probably what is going to be the primary interest that we will actually see from a buyer of those instruments.</p>
          <p>I think it is also fair to say that &#x2013; I think this was said last October &#x2013; we'd seen reverse inquiries for the high strike CoCos. We have seen significant reverse inquiries for the low strike CoCos as well. So I think that it should be a perfectly viable instrument once you actually look at the cushion of losses that have to be incurred and the business model that Credit Suisse operates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Some numbers type questions, I'm sorry. Firstly, on the Wealth Management net interest income, I was just wondering what duration the deposits are invested at. So if we do see that 100 basis point rise, how long before we see the revenue impact come through?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the loan off charge in the CIC division. Just wondering if the reason it remains so low is because there are no new loans going bad. Or is it because you're still seeing recoveries from loans that went bad five or 10 years ago? So I guess to think of it another way, will we see that loan loss charge pick up when past recoveries are exhausted, or do we need to see a deterioration in the Swiss economy for that to happen?</p>
          <p>And then finally, given the higher contribution from cost currency hedges this quarter, perhaps you could just go over what economically those accounting items are, and why we should strip them out? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think, just answering those questions in order, the duration &#x2013; an average duration of deposits is about 18 months. So I think you would say about 18 months for the full impact of high interest rates to actually come through. And you're clearly seeing the final tails of the roll-off from past interest rates, both in this quarter's results and the sort of CHF20 million that we talked about in the presentation.</p>
          <p>I think the CIC, you see a number of net zero. That does reflect new accruals on loans we're actually making, but offset by releases on past loans which are basically offset. So we had new provisions of CHF41 million, releases of CHF29 billion, in terms of that. So we are making new loans, but I think our credit experience is actually resulting in releases off the existing loan book. And I think that &#x2013; as I said, I think reflects A, the fact that the loan book itself is of a high quality; and B, the Swiss economy obviously remains very strong.</p>
          <p>I think on third point then, just in terms of the fair value and debt moves, as we've said, there were 617 million of those, of which just over half related to fair value and debt and was clearly accelerated by the strengthening of our capital position further in the first quarter, was about the capital note issuance.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the other derivative moves, that also relates to our funding. And I think we've touched upon this in the past. There's two components of that. Firstly, where we actually have issued debt in euros and then swapped it to U.S. Dollars, which occasionally we do from a funding point of view, the loan is &#x2013; we don't fair-value elect on our loans anymore, because I think we find the fair value and debt volatility are helpful.</p>
          <p>So the loan is then accrual-elected and you have mark-to-market volatility on the swap from euros into dollars. So clearly, the duration of that will match the loan over the course of the loan where it's actually redeemed net out to zero. But during the lifetime of the loan, you actually get volatility.</p>
          <p>And I think these numbers I just gave, the euro one, is probably the most important one because you've seen a move in the euro-based interest curve against the dollar, primarily driven by the ECB's moves in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The second component is much smaller. I think you may have seen this elsewhere, which relates to the receiver swaps. And again, that's been driven by basis curve moves in the quarter. And again, it zeros out over the lifetime.</p>
          <p>So that's the essence of it. But I think the unusual move from our point of view was very much triggered by the issuance about the capital notes which A, drove our senior debt spreads down; and B, triggered this 100 basis point-rally in our Tier 1 hybrids as people looked toward the first call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Yes, I've got one question on your Structured Products business. In a previous presentation, you've said it represents about 40% of the RWA increase on the Basel III. And this time, you basically say the returns are expected to be good under Basel III. Just wanted to get a sense, how would those returns, on a kind of pro forma Basel III basis, compare to the kind of average for the Investment Bank 16% that you achieved in the first quarter? Clearly, the RWA inflation is disproportionate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think, we obviously have looked at the Securitized Product business, and particularly the RMBS business, under Basel III. As you said, its mitigation is part of our plan for that business going forward. That said, and I think it's difficult to &#x2013; we have looked at this, and the projected return on capital for the RMBS business under B3 post-mitigation is actually, I think, at or slightly above the Investment Bank average. And I think that reflects the scale benefits we actually have for the market leadership. Just for the sake of clarity, that is also true for the credit business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So will that be true for the High Yield Products business, including Levy Finance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true for that business as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And if I could just follow up, what is the current kind of Group tax rate guidance we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>28.6% in the first quarter. I think clearly, in terms of deferred tax utilization, our Americas business has performed very strongly in the first quarter. The effective rate on the deferred tax is 41%. So therefore, as we utilize those deferred tax losses in the United States, that comes through at 41%. If, on the other hand, we utilize the tax losses in the UK where there was &#x2013; well, then the rate would be around 27%, although of course that will change with the latest budget rules. So that's the kind of balance we have in terms of the regional mix.</p>
          <p>Net-net, I would say at this moment, at or around this level is probably a reasonable expectation for the expected tax rate for full year 2011. And within that, I would also say we would expect to see significant further deferred tax utilization.</p>

          <p>Hi. I would have one question, please. You're subject to Basel 2.5 since the beginning of the year, and at the same time, you have maintained or improved your ranking in the various league tables, suggesting that there has been no repricing of Basel 2.5 additional costs; otherwise, you would have probably declined in the league tables. Is it fair to think that way? Have you seen some repricing related to Basel 2.5 in market prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's difficult to comment. For us, truly, I think you're aware the B2.5 rules take effect at the end of this year. I think the reason we're giving pro forma numbers is just because I think we wanted to be, I think, open and transparent, and everyone would see how it actually tracks. And I guess, obviously, the other European banks will follow. The U.S. Banks are clearly on a slightly longer timetable.</p>
          <p>So I think it's probably too early for us to say clearly we have or have not seen much impact yet from B2.5. I'm not sure you really expect it this early in 2011. So I think it's difficult to comment on &#x2013; given where we are in the regulatory timetable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, as you know, it also &#x2013; this is Brady &#x2013; we do continue to have good momentum in almost all &#x2013; across the business, really. And so that's one of the reasons why we continue to have confidence that we'll be able to, as we continue to evolve the business and respond to a number of these &#x2013; the different capital requirements as they come into place. We continue to have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to maintain our leadership in those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. And we do run it on a pro forma B2.5 basis already internally, how we actually operate the business. So I think the returns remain pretty strong notwithstanding that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you think possible to pass onto the clients the additional costs related to Basel 2.5 at a certain point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's a difficult question. It really depends on a much broader range of issues. What I would say actually is probably refer back to an earlier question which I think, in terms of the expected B3.5, B3 returns to the RMBS business, I think those returns are at or above the Investment Bank overall. I think that does reflect the leadership we have in that business and the improved scale upon as we get.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, I think it's difficult to say too much. Clearly we're not in some of the much more complex, exotic structure products which will be much more affected by Basel 2.5 or Basel III still to come. So it would be difficult. we're actually not in those businesses greatly, so it'd be difficult to see &#x2013; to comment on the repricing.</p>

There's obviously been a lot of disruption to the markets and that obviously has had an impact on overall client volumes, et cetera. On the other hand, as you know, the markets have tended to be fairly resilient in the face of those changes. And so, you can see that from our market shares and the volumes that we experienced in the first quarter overall.</p>
          <p>I think specifically our businesses in the Middle East and our franchise there, we actually have a strong franchise, but it tends to be more focused in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, areas that were, I think, less impacted obviously by some of the disruption there. And so we've actually had relatively minimal impact on our business overall from events there, but obviously, we continue &#x2013; they obviously do have an impact on the broader world economy and markets, and we obviously continue to be vigilant in that respect. But in general, our franchise in the Middle East has not been materially affected by the events there.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a clarification, please. Slide 33, where you do the pro forma ROE, I assume that's on the same basis as Slide 29, i.e. without phasing in, i.e. You're ignoring the deductions and the goodwill. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; thank you, Jeremy. I think in answer, on Slide 33, we just wanted to give an illustrative example on the basis of a 10% common equity requirement. So that 10% common equity will clearly include things like goodwill, which are actually part of the equity base under the rules. So that's &#x2013; and the RWA basis we viewed is actually consistent again with what we said on Slide 29, i.e. Basically CHF330 billion to CHF350 billion, and the IB's component of that. So it is consistent with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I think, Jeremy, it's &#x2013; thanks for the question. This was our attempt to really try to get out this fundamental question of the returns in the Investment Bank, how they compare the overall returns, and how they'll compare it on the Basel III. So this was what we thought was one of the most &#x2013; I don't know, one of the clearest ways that we could try to lay it out in a way that was helpful. Obviously, there are different ways to calculate, the different basis you could use, et cetera. But we thought this was actually one of the sort of clearest ways, but there are obviously different ways to calculate the returns, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So just trying to &#x2013; we're just trying to get out &#x2013; obviously one of the questions a lot of people have had is, will, how's the Investment Bank going to look in terms of returns, particularly under Basel III? And so we obviously were trying to take a stab at being able to help with some of the thinking on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, we also include a supplementary slide in the appendix on Slide 41, which actually lays out the basis of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'll see the RWAs in the Investment Bank projected from CHF137 billion under B2 to CHF247 billion post-mitigation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, but I want to be clear on the goodwill, because I think, as you sense from the questions on this call, I think a lot of people are trying to look at it on a full look-through basis. And on that basis, the returns would be quite a bit lower on the Slide 33, but thanks for the clarification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes,  I see your point. Clearly on the return on intangible equity that wouldn't be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you had to carry equity in that division to cover those additional deductions, including the goodwill, then the ROE would be lower. Yes, I take your point on tangible.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no further questions at this time, Mr. Dougan. Please continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for the questions. I would just like to sum up briefly, reiterating some of the things. We do think this is a strong set of results. They do, we think, demonstrate the power of the business model to generate stable and high-quality earnings.</p>
          <p>Underlying pre-tax CHF2.2 billion, underlying net income of CHF1.6 billion, underlying return on equity of 19%, and CHF19 billion in net new assets, we think provides strong evidence that the client-focused strategy is having a real impact.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we anticipate a lot of the regulatory developments that we're now seeing, and with an 18.2% Tier 1 ratio and Basel 2.5 Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, we think we're strongly positioned there.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our transactions to create our high-trigger contingent convertible capital structure clearly, I think, was a clear demonstration of the importance of that market. We also reduced our net deferred tax assets by CHF800 million, increased shareholders' equity by CHF800 million.</p>
          <p>Funding continues to be an area of focus. Our spreads remain very tight, and I think as David mentioned, tightened considerably during the quarter. We do have a conservative approach to liquidity management and we think our debt maturity model is best-in-class, and all that being reflected in the CDS.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, as we said, we do think that we are ahead of the curve in terms of certainty around the structure of our capital, on the asset weightings, et cetera. We do &#x2013; we are encouraged by a more level playing field beginning to emerge. We'll see how that develops.</p>
          <p>But overall, we think it was a strong quarter. Good progress on capital and are meeting a lot of the challenges there. And as we stated in our outlook, we do expect the market environment to remain constructive. We also expect clients to remain active with an increased appetite for higher-return assets and comprehensive advisory services.</p>
          <p>But obviously, the macroeconomic recovery continues to be gradual and it continues to be impacted by external and market events. Nonetheless, we do have substantial momentum across all our client-based businesses and we remain well prepared to continue to capitalize on our improved market positions.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for joining the call.</p>
