          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on our call today are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner, Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen, and Chief Operating Officer Ralph Alvarez. Ralph is joining us via phone from the U.S. Regional Operators Association meeting.</p>
          <p>Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on investor.McDonald's.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it over to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mary Kay. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that McDonald's delivered strong first quarter results. Global comparable sales were up 4.3%; operating income increased 5% in constant currency; and EPS reached $0.87, a 17% increase in constant currency. Our sales momentum is continuing, with April comparable sales trending at least as strong or better than the first quarter in every area of the world.</p>
          <p>McDonald's is well positioned for continued growth. Our global system is aligned around the right strategies to manage in the current global economic environment and to seize future opportunities. We remain focused on our customers and restaurants through our Plan to Win. Every day, customer relevance is job one at McDonald's. We all know the state of today's consumers. They're scaling back and being more discerning about what they purchase. This means a strong value proposition is critical, from price to product to experience.</p>
          <p>McDonald's offers strong value across our entire menu board. Our value menus around the world offer predictable, everyday affordability and our core menu, including iconic products like the Quarter Pounder, provide great value at the mid-tier. This tiered pricing and across-the-board value means we are in a position to grow our market share, not only in the near term but in the long term as well. In addition to great tasting core menu offerings, we continue to offer the choice and variety our customers want. New sandwiches and beverages, from McCaf&#xE9; coffees here in the U.S. to regional burgers like in the Parmareg in Italy, appeal to our existing customers and bring in new ones.</p>
          <p>We're able to provide this quality, choice, and value because of our global supply chain. The collaborative relationship we have with our suppliers is a true competitive advantage enabling us to obtain and secure quality and quantity of ingredients we need at competitive and relatively predictable prices. To deliver the best experience to our customers we have to get even better at the basics of our business. That's why we continue to strategically invest in our restaurants so we can continually improve both operations and ambience. We know we're making progress. Our customer satisfaction scores are improving in nearly all of our major markets.</p>
          <p>Additionally, initiatives that make McDonald's even more convenient, such as extended and 24 hours, drive-through enhancements and delivery, strengthen our relevance and drive sales. These strategies are playing out successfully in every area of the world. In the United States, we're managing well in spite of the economy. Our convenient locations and extended hours, great tasting foods, strong value, and continually improving customer experience, make us a part of so many consumers' everyday lives. Our continued emphasis in these areas has served us well.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to see good sales results in most of our markets despite the negative impact of the Easter shift and one less day due to leap year. Of our big four markets, France, the UK, and Russia remain strong. In Germany, our brand is strong. We have a good management team in place and we continue to gain market share. But sales in this country were soft for the first three months of 2009, primarily as a result of the economy. However, they improved month to month during the quarter. In fact, March was positive despite the Easter holiday shift. And the sales trend is even stronger in April. And I'm confident we will manage through the current European environment as we have in the past.</p>
          <p>Results remained strong in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and were led by continued strength in Australia, where most of our restaurants have been re-imaged and represent our brand very well. In addition, the majority of our Australian restaurants have a McCaf&#xE9;, and we continue to have new product news. Japan, as you know, is also performing well. But we have seen a slowdown in China due to the economic environment there. We remain confident, however, in the long term growth potential of China and are doing the right things to drive sales and profit today and well into the future.</p>
          <p>In addition to our Plan to Win strategies around customer relevance, strong financial management contributes to our profitability and returns. Our disciplined approach to controlling costs and investing to grow the business provides flexibility and strength. As a result, we have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry. This allows us access to capital when we need it and provides our owner-operators continued access to the credit necessary to reinvest in their restaurants.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength is also a positive for our shareholders. We are on track to meet our three-year target of 15 to $17 billion of cash returned to shareholders by the end of 2009. To date, we've given back $12.9 billion toward this target. And in the first quarter, we bought back 14.6 million shares totaling $823 million and paid a dividend of $0.50 per share for an additional $553 million. Looking ahead, I'm confident we will maintain our momentum by continuing to focus on our customers and restaurants and the financial discipline that drives our growth strategy of being better, not just bigger.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and now I'll introduce Ralph Alvarez, our Chief Operating Officer. Ralph?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim, and good morning. We're pleased to report that each area of the world is contributing to our strong business performance, and we grew market share in every major country. In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.7%, and operating income grew 6% to $725 million. The strong comp sales drove both U.S. Company-operated and franchise margin improvements. The Company-operated margin increased 50 basis points, and the franchise margin was up 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our McOpCo margin growth benefited from the refranchising strategy, partially offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. Our support of iconic core products continued to deliver results. First quarter advertising focused on the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, and we are still benefiting from the McNuggets promotion at the end of last year. The emphasis on core products has generated average check growth and increased restaurant profitability. The U.S. business also remains on track with the rollout of McCaf&#xE9; beverages. This summer, we'll be advertising beverages, core favorites like the Big Mac, and strong value offerings like dollar drinks, Dollar Menu, and Chicken Snack Wraps. Our U.S. business has excellent momentum and will continue to deliver results.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continued to take market share despite a decline in Europe's informal eating out category. Europe's comp sales for the quarter were up 3.2% despite an almost 2-point hit from the shift of the Easter holidays and leap day impact. Their sales have been driven by three and four price tier menus, the mid-time food events, as well as extended hours. Restaurant reimaging and a strong focus on drive-through execution is improving our brand performance.</p>
          <p>While Europe's top line has remained solid in most markets, margins have been impacted by several factors. On the franchise side, our refranchising strategy helped grow franchise margin dollars but negatively impacted the margin percent. This strategy has the opposite effect on Company-operated margins; it helped the percentage but reduced the dollars. Europe's franchise margin declined 130 basis points in the first quarter, with 70 of those points due to the refranchising strategy. This impact will lessen as the year continues. Higher occupancy costs and sales building incentives also impacted margins. However, this impact will also decline in future quarters.</p>
          <p>Europe's Company operating margin declined 70 basis points. All of this and more was the result of the margin declines in Russia and our Eastern European markets. While their sales were strong, commodity costs were higher because these markets import 30 to 50% of food products denominated in either euro or U.S. dollars. The net effect of these countries was a 200 basis points impact on Europe's margins. While the currency volatility in Russia and Eastern Europe is challenging, the long term opportunity remains strong. We continued to capture market share and will grow new restaurants at an appropriate pace.</p>
          <p>In summary, with Europe's strong baseline momentum and decelerating commodity costs, we are on track for another strong year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. Comparable sales were up 5.5% for the first quarter, and operating income increased 11% in constant currencies. Results were led by strong performances in Australia and Japan. Australia's success was driven by a focus on chicken, and Japan's reintroduction of the Quarter Pounder menu contributed to its momentum. In addition, our convenience initiatives of 24 hours, drive-throughs, and kiosks continue to positively impact the business. Markets are also aggressively working to ensure value initiatives are strategic, branded, and support baseline growth.</p>
          <p>In first quarter, the franchise margin in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa improved 120 basis points. This was driven by the relative impact of foreign currency translation and the comp sales growth. Company-operated margins decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to softer sales in China. Economic weakness in China has impacted our sales and margins, especially in southern China, where many factories have closed. Still, our underlying business remains strong in China. We are confident in this market's long term potential and are ensuring that we maintain traffic momentum through a strong focus on value pricing and strong operations.</p>
          <p>We will continue to open new restaurants. We opened 62 in the first quarter, with an expectation that 140 will be built this year, slightly down from our previous estimate of 175.</p>
          <p>In closing, our position as a strong market leader in just about every country where we operate is an advantage we continue to leverage. Our business momentum is strong, costs are moderating, and we continue to reinvest in our restaurants for long term success.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Bensen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ralph, and good morning. By now our headline should be pretty clear. McDonald's global business is fundamentally strong. Our better, not just bigger approach continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against a backdrop of weak global economies, our consumer relevance strategies drove systemwide sales up over 6% in constant currencies in the first quarter. This contributed to consolidated restaurant margin dollars reaching nearly $1.9 billion, up 3% in constant currencies. Company-operated margin dollars accounted for 30% of this total and declined primarily due to the impact of refranchising.</p>
          <p>As a percent of sales, Company-operated margins declined 30 basis points to 16.2%, as increases in the U.S. were more than offset by declines in Europe and Asia Pacific. As Ralph said, Europe's decline was primarily due to impact of importing goods in Russia and Eastern Europe, and Asia Pacific's decline was mainly due to China. Franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies to $1.3 billion, representing 70% of total consolidated restaurant margin dollars. This is up from 67% last year and 64% in first quarter 2007, reflecting our evolution toward a more heavily franchised structure.</p>
          <p>Since 2007, we've refranchised about 770 restaurants, including about 90 in the first quarter. This shift explains in part why constant currency franchise margin dollars are growing at a faster rate than Company-operated margin dollars, a pattern we expect to continue as we refranchise more restaurants. As a percent of revenues, consolidated franchise margins in the first quarter were flat at 81.4%, driven by strong global comparable sales, offset by the impact of refranchising and operator incentives. Our evolution toward a more heavily franchised structure reduces total revenue dollars. This is because we collect rent and royalty income as a percent of sales from a franchise restaurant instead of 100% of sales from a Company-operated restaurant.</p>
          <p>The benefit of such a structure is a more stable and reliable cash flow and improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin. In the first quarter, combined operating margin percent increased 150 basis points to 27.6%, benefiting from refranchising and ongoing G&amp;A control, as well as currency translation. G&amp;A declined 2% in constant currencies in the first quarter and is expected to decline for the full year, although there will be fluctuations between quarters. We remain committed to G&amp;A discipline and further increasing combined operating margin over time.</p>
          <p>Next let me update you on a couple of other topics: our commodity and currency translation outlooks. While commodity markets remain volatile, the global recession has dampened demand for commodities worldwide, creating opportunities to reduce costs. In the U.S., this is beginning to work its way through our suppliers as the quarterly increase in our grocery bill is down sequentially from 10% in the fourth quarter last year to 6.7% in the first quarter this year. We expect the cost increases in our basket of goods in the U.S. to continue to moderate for the remainder of the year. Our full-year outlook remains for our basket of goods to be up 5 to 5.5% in the U.S.</p>
          <p>It's important to remember that we manage our basket like a portfolio, seeking to achieve the best overall results. Our goal here is to remain competitive and predictable. The last couple of years, this strategy resulted in our costs not rising to the same degree as either the commodity markets or the food component of the PPI. And it meant we could consistently deliver value across our menu while achieving industry-leading Company-operated margins. Consequently, you shouldn't expect to see the same level of decline in our grocery bill this year as you see in the cash markets, since our baseline is somewhat lower. And the 5 to 5.5% increase is our best estimate today. But opportunities remain within this projection, and we are optimistic that we'll be able to finish the year at the low end of this range.</p>
          <p>Europe's basket of goods increased 9% in the first quarter. Similar to the U.S., we expect the cost pressures to lessen as the year progresses. Our full-year outlook remains at 4 to 4.5% increase. These figures represent the weighted average for total Europe. However, with 40-plus countries, a number of different dynamics come into play.</p>
          <p>This was the case with Russia and Eastern Europe in the first quarter, where commodity costs were disproportionately impacted by the significant weakening of local currencies. We took a number of steps to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuation, including purchasing goods and services in the local currency to the extent possible. This helps create a natural hedge. However, due to the local supply chain infrastructure, Russia and many markets in Eastern Europe import 30 to 50% of their products. These purchases, primarily beef and chicken, are denominated in either euro or U.S. dollars. As a result of this, these markets are facing a more challenging commodity cost environment. Our opportunity to effectively hedge these exposures is significantly limited due to high costs and/or lack of an active market. We remain confident in the long term opportunity in Russia and Eastern Europe, even as we navigate these short term economic challenges.</p>
          <p>In addition to purchasing in the local currency where possible, we work to mitigate the impact of currency translation by financing our businesses locally, as well as reinvesting a significant portion of our local earnings back into our international markets through capital expenditures. We also typically hedge a portion of the royalties we receive from our international markets. These efforts help to lessen the economic impact of fluctuating currency rates, but there will always be a financial recording impact because of the need to translate international revenues and earnings to U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Since last year, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly against virtually all foreign currencies and has remained at a relatively high level. This resulted in a negative impact on first quarter earnings of $0.08 per share. The majority of this impact, about $0.06, was due to four currencies: the euro, the pound, and the Australian and Canadian dollars. These currencies declined between 13 and 27% versus the U.S. dollar since first quarter 2008. The next most significant impact was the Russian ruble, which was down 29%.</p>
          <p>The currency markets remain volatile and difficult to predict, but to give you some perspective, at current exchange rates, we project that currency translation will negatively impact both second and third quarter earnings per share by about $0.11 each, dropping to about $0.02 in the fourth quarter. And we know rates will continue to change; however, we hope this gives you some idea of our current expectations. History shows currencies tend to balance out over time. Our focus remains on managing for the long term strength of our business as we navigate short term volatilities.</p>
          <p>In closing, I think our first quarter results are a testament to the strength of our business model and its flexibility to deliver in a variety of environments. I'm confident we can sustain our global momentum and grow our business, not only in the current environment but beyond.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for questions. Please press *1 if you have a question and *2 to remove yourself from the queue. To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Jeff Farmer at Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As it relates to McCaf&#xE9;, I was just looking for a little bit more color on what you've seen in the past when a new product transitions from the pre-advertising to local advertising to national advertising phase? So I guess asked another way, do sales slowly build throughout all three phases, is it a step-by-step function, or do sales meaningfully accelerate when you go national?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Jeff, thanks for the question. This is Jim Skinner. It varies by product and introduction. We have a long history of course of introducing new products, both in terms of testing and then rolling out nationally, if you will, depending on what country you're in and then advertising when we get up to scale. And it fails, but it changes based on the marketplace. Ralph, do you want to talk a little bit about our experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We had that modeled in our testing that we do for new product rollouts, and usually when we do go to national &#x2013; and like Jim said, it varies by products depending if it's a completely new product that you're educating the customer, or one that they're already familiar, and you're just educating them about our offer at McDonald's. But national &#x2013; there's nothing like national advertising, because you get to be in program advertising on prime network TV. That only happens on national, and always stronger than what you could replicate locally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The next question is from Steve West at Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, real quick, just kind of a housekeeping question. How many McCaf&#xE9;s do you guys have right now in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now in the United States we're right about the 10,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, 10,000 still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>10,000 stores and moving toward conclusion sometime in the middle of the year, May or somewhere in that timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the question I have with China, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with the shorter term? You mentioned you've got some pressure there; we've seen some negative comps I guess in probably February and March. And what is your really &#x2013; your short term outlook there for China and the same-store sales results there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we really have a long term outlook for China, I think, first of all, Steve, is the way we're looking at that marketplace with enormous opportunity. We opened our 1,000th restaurant there last November, and even though there's a softening of the economy right now, we look at it for the long term, and we're opening about 150 restaurants there this year. Our target was 175, but as the marketplaces develop around those additional sites, we'll be opening those as well. But we've opened 62 already this year, and we're in it for the long term. And managing appropriately relative to the environment we find ourselves in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question from Matt DiFrisco at Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you also talk about &#x2013; has anything changed with the timing as far as the ice machines &#x2013; I guess for lack of a better term, smoothies? Or what's also going to have the frappuccinos or the frozen drinks in there, the timing of that? Would that be still middle of this year starting to see them rolled out in greater scale and also greater testing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that's &#x2013; Matt, whatever we've said about that, and I think we remain on track for rolling those additional items out throughout the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from John Glass at Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Can you go back to the commentary on the European margins? Should we expect the pressure that you experienced from importing food to Eastern Europe, does that occur until we lap it through the next year, or are you able to do something about that either hedging or somehow &#x2013; or getting alternate supply? And then also you mentioned that you've had some costs for sales building initiatives in Europe. How long do those &#x2013; when did they start and how long do they persist, and maybe what are those initiatives that you're presently funding for the franchisees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John. It's Pete. I'll talk about the Company-operated margins there, and then Ralph will talk a little bit about the franchisee incentives. We expect the cost of those imports to moderate as we move throughout the year. The fourth quarter is when we'll start to see the greatest decline, but as we mentioned, some of those costs are denominated against the euro, and those local currencies actually started depreciating against the euro throughout the year last year. So it wasn't until late in the year that they started depreciating significantly against the U.S. dollar. So we're probably seeing the peak of the impact from those imports here in the first quarter, but it'll still be with us primarily for the rest of the year, but to a lesser degree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>All right. John, on the franchise side, the operator incentives we've had in place, they'll moderate throughout the rest of the year. At the high end, they've been 30 basis points, so it's not a significant piece of it. But it's something that we do with our operators being in there together to drive new business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Could you comment on the breakfast trends that you've seen in the U.S. specifically? And maybe more broadly if you've seen any changes in the day part trends that you've been seeing as the Q1 unfolded?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, thanks for the question. Breakfast has continued to contribute to our success here in the United States, and wherever we're selling breakfast around the world in the various markets. Ralph, do you want to talk a little bit about the breakfast day part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our U.S. breakfast business has, as we talked about, been very strong for years. It continues to be positive on sales and guest counts this year. We're a leader in that area. And if you've seen our advertising focus during the first three, four months, we've been advertising breakfast pretty heavily. So we continue to see growth in that area, and it's a very profitable piece of our business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd like to go back to the European margins again with a couple of questions. You mentioned the refranchising activities there pulling down the franchise percent margin, I guess, in Europe. And could you elaborate a little bit on that? Are you giving incentives to buyers of those properties? Is that what's sort of playing out? And then just to go back on the Company side, so if I understand what you said correctly, the entire Company-operated margin decline is related to the Russian-Eastern European pressure, and ex that you would have been up in other Company-operated markets in Europe in terms of percent margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, it's Pete. You interpreted those comments correctly on the Company-operated margins, that those &#x2013; Russia and Eastern Europe were more than the total decline. And on the franchise margin side, this is really &#x2013; looking at some of the sales-building initiatives that have been successful around the world, things like reimaging and 24 hours, what these incentives typically are are reduced rent for a period of time to provide additional cash flow for the operators to invest in these initiatives, which as you know build really long term, sustainable sales for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and if I may add there, Joe, on the refranchising piece, the majority &#x2013; or there's a greater skew of restaurants who are refranchising that had underlying leased properties versus purchased properties, and those have significantly lower margin. And as those move onto the franchise side, it dilutes the franchise margin percent, and so that's what you're seeing. We'll start lapping again some of the large amounts of restaurants we refranchised last year, and that's why you'll see that percent erosion moderate. The net-net is significantly higher combined operating margin and a system that has more franchisees running our restaurants, which we believe is very healthy for the customers.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You've had the Dollar Menu since late '02, and that's seemingly been enough for the value credibility of McDonald's, and you've stayed away from discounting your premium items and large degrees of couponing as well. Do you think that might be ending and we'll have to end in select markets where you see traffic weakening, like a Florida, Germany, where you're getting significant traffic pressure? In other words, will you choose to defend share versus profit in select places? And secondly, given that competitors such as Wendy's and Burger King will have declining food costs, we believe, in the second quarter, are you worried that others will push that sort of discount button more readily heading into driving season? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Jim. I don't see our relationship of the everyday affordability and the Dollar Menu and the value across the menu changing relative to strategy. I think that we have Value Menus in every country around the world. There are some markets where franchisees decide to do some additional marketing around value orientation of products, depending on what their current environment dictates, but I don't see us dictating any change in strategy around that. And then I don't see necessarily any concern at least on our part relative to what might happen with others and what they decide to do around this because of their declining food costs, if you will, even though I don't know the details around that. But I don't really see anything changing there in our relationship in terms of how we're going to market our value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, and just adding, first, Florida, our business is very strong in Florida. Don't know about others, but ours is very strong, and so we've pulled the everyday value, predictable everyday value, equation there now for the last 18 months, and we're taking significant market share, and that's kind of what we do in all the areas of the world. Germany, we grew market share. Our business in Germany is high volume, and we're making sure that we protect traffic as we deal in these type of environments right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks. One follow-up on the McCaf&#xE9;, then a question. Can you tell us what percentage of the product sales of the McCaf&#xE9; in the U.S. are at the breakfast day part versus other day parts? And then my question is to Ralph. On the U.S. Company-operated margins, up 50 basis points year-over-year: That, if I have my numbers correctly, is the first time it's been up year-over-year since the December '06 quarter. You mentioned refranchising a contributor to that, but you've been refranchising for a couple of years, so if you can just drill down a little bit more as to really the contributing factors there, is there a product mix shift maybe with the, I don't know, Double Cheeseburger or McDouble, or are there levers that you're pulling on controllable costs and the sustainability of that increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ralph, do you want to address both of those questions, including the coffee and McCaf&#xE9;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah, on the McCaf&#xE9;, it's more than 50% of the coffee happens at breakfast on the McCaf&#xE9;s. There is some seasonality relative to McCaf&#xE9; as to the hot or the cold drinks obviously, but it's definitely more of a breakfast, as you would imagine.</p>
          <p>On the U.S. Company-operated margins, the switch to McDouble from Double Cheeseburger helped the margins. The core menu advertising of nondiscounted, just our everyday strong values on Quarter Pounder with Cheese and McNuggets, helped. We still had high commodity costs in the first quarter, so that offset it. That's why the rest of the year we feel very good about McOpCo margins in the U.S. as costs moderate, and we had both of these pieces. And the refranchising continues to help us. We refranchised &#x2013; I forget the exact number, but around 400 or so restaurants last year in the U.S. And again, most of those have underlying leases and so it's just a switch that lease cost shows up on the franchise margin side, not on the Company side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Actually just one follow-up on the discounting and then a separate question. Specific to the discounting, I'm just wondering whether you think perhaps casual dining, where they're doing significant discounting, perhaps would take back some share or whether on the other end you might be losing to food at home, where they're reducing prices? I know you guys are still running probably 4% plus menu pricing, so just curious on the outlook for that.</p>
          <p>And otherwise, just on the balance sheet, you mentioned obviously we're coming close to the end of 2009 and the 15 to 17 billion's on target. I know you haven't put out targets beyond that. But I'm hoping you could talk maybe broadly whether or not those type of levels are sustainable if the markets remain at the current levels? How about maybe debt pay down? Just wondering your priorities. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll let Pete answer the question on the projections, but when you're looking at the indexing of food away from home and the discounting that's going on by people who are selling products relative to food at home and all of the other indexing that we take a look at relative to our trends in the business and our traffic and guest counts in the business, we're not really seeing any signs of impact relative to our share. As I had mentioned, I think we're &#x2013; not think we are &#x2013; we're growing share in every market we're operating in today, or virtually every market in this environment. And so we're not seeing any impact of that right at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jeff, regarding the cash return targets, I think it's premature to give any specific guidance beyond 2009, but I think if you look at our business model, I think we'll continue to generate a significant amount of cash flow. We'll continue to invest significantly in the business at the great returns that we're generating and the cash flow after that we'll use to pay dividends. We've shown a commitment to dividends, and we believe those are important, and we'll have some share buyback as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to reinforce the traffic piece from Jim, every major market in the first quarter grew comparable guest counts if you consider the impact of leap &#x2013; having one less day, and that's again why &#x2013; and that's obviously, market share is all based on traffic, and we continue to grow market share, as Jim has said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just kind of want to touch on the international side a bit. I was wondering if you guys could talk a bit about what's different about the Chinese consumer and what's going on in Germany, what has gone on there, versus some of your other international markets that remain very strong. Just if you could talk about what the differences are and what gives you comfort that you're not going to see this kind of slowdown spreading to other places as we move through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ralph's just been in those markets recently. Ralph, you want to talk a little bit about our consumers in Germany and China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. Yeah, Jason, I'll take China first. In China, we grew traffic on a comparable basis, besides the new stores, for the first quarter, but we had average check decline. And in China, there are other convenient alternatives that are less expensive than Western QSR and obviously than McDonald's. And so that's a unique phenomena. There's very few places of the world where you have that, and so we're doing what we need to do to continue our long term traffic building there. And as that economy turns around, those are loyal McDonald's customers. So that's unique to China, and some other smaller markets, but none of our bigger markets.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the German consumer &#x2013; first, Germany is the European country of the big three that has had the largest GDP decline and that's impacted the psyche of the consumer there and obviously their pocketbook. And so we've increased what's on our one-euro menu there to be more aggressive on that side, and we will continue to advertise more heavily those type of items. But it's been, again, unique to Germany. That's the way their consumer is. We have high volume there, so we just looked at the market share numbers for first quarter and we grew market share in a strong way, but just the IEO [informal eating out] market in Germany declined at a pretty strong rate. So that's what we see. We're not seeing the same effect in our other large countries in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Just keeping on Europe for a moment and Germany, it's a tough macro environment and you're gaining share. What's the competitive landscape? Are other people, other competitors starting to discount a little bit more, and would you expect them in order to keep up their share there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, the issue in Germany is more the consumer sentiment and what they end up doing. We've got a very strong position in the marketplace there, more than three times bigger than the next competitor on a guest count basis. So it really is much more about what we're doing and how the consumer's feeling than it is about competitive actions in the marketplace.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I actually had a couple of follow-ups, Ralph, on what you were talking about. Why is it that we're not seeing sort of the weakness in UK, because consumer sentiment there isn't strong? And also I think as it goes back to China, you guys worked on a menu re-engineering in terms of prices. You're saying it's still weak there. Have you seen an improvement in the comp trend? I know it's a lumpy quarter because of the New Year's trend, but I'm just curious if when you lowered those prices if you saw the desired response. And then my question was related to the Angus test market results, it sounds like that's a product that you actually might roll this year. And can you kind of give us a little color about shifting between the burgers on the menu and what the test market read is on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the UK piece, we had a very strong quarter in the UK, as a couple things are happening. First, our brand strength there over the last two years, it's the best turnaround of our business anywhere. We've got a very strong management team. As you know, the media and the press there were not always on our side. That's changed significantly. We've reimaged a lot of restaurants, and there had been some stimulus in the marketplace from government. They did a temporary reduction of VAT, that 2% reduction that happened in late December. That put a little bit more money out there for those that are spending, and so it helped retail sales. And we're benefiting from that and continuing our trend. So &#x2013; and as I mentioned, we just were looking at first quarter market share numbers in the UK, very strong growth in market share for us.</p>
          <p>When you look at China and the prices, the reason for what we've done in China is, as I mentioned earlier, the early signals are with some trade-down from Western QSR down to Chinese QSR, and their meal prices for Chinese QSR were maybe 30, 40% below what a traditional Western QSR meal prices were. And so we want to make sure at lunch that we became close to competitive in that area in order to limit trading out of the category into a different convenient option. And so we like what we're seeing with what we've done. It's dilutive to margins obviously and to average check, but this is a long term gain, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maintain that type of traffic.</p>
          <p>And relative to Angus, we will have Angus out in the U.S. market at some point this year. We know what it can do from the different marketplaces, and what &#x2013; as you've seen that we've done, is we've significantly increased our advertising against our core menu, which has everyday great prices on our Extra Value Meals &#x2013; Big Mac, QPC, Chicken McNuggets &#x2013; and this is an option for those that are a little bit hungrier and want to spend a few more bucks. But the rest of &#x2013; it will be supplemented by strong value advertising at the same time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Actually just quickly for me at this point, remaining on China. Was the reduction in unit growth a function of less openings in south China, or is there something else that I should read into that given your positive long term view of the market? Are you changing formats, drive-throughs, what have you? And secondly, on China are you seeing the improvement in April relative to March that you're seeing broadly in the region, or is there something different with China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the slowdown on the openings, it's 25 to 35 openings, John, and much of it is in the south because a bunch of factories have been closed there. But it's sort of across the board, really, when you look at it, when you reduce openings from 175 to 150. We're really looking at each of the marketplaces, and when the surrounding area is not developing appropriate to maintain pace with the opening, we have a slight pullback there.</p>
          <p>Relative to your second question, Ralph, can you just talk about that for a minute?</p>

          <p>Yeah. Our trends are comparable. They're not stronger in April in China.</p>
          <p>And then one thing on the China development. Like Jim said, it isn't necessarily we're pulling back on any format like drive-through. We will actually open less drive-throughs because those are usually in areas where we were counting on more infrastructure growth, homes, roads, et cetera, and that's where some of the pullback has happened. And so there'll be less drive-throughs, but because of that, not because of we're changing the format of what we're opening.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. There's been a lot of discussion around value this morning, but looking at the more premium side of the menu, and thinking of the Angus burger opportunity, do you see an opportunity for a bigger push on the premium side, perhaps to capture or further capture trade-down share? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff. I think the balance is going to remain about the same. As you know, we've been testing the Angus for a while now, in several markets, and we held off actually in terms of moving that product to a national rollout. And whenever we decide to go for it, it's going to really continue to be an approach that balances out the menu relative to value across the menu, including premium sandwiches and our iconic core sandwiches, and then the tiered pricing that we're using and the Value Menu. And so it's really not a shift in strategy but a continuation of strategy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could update us on the percentage of sales you're getting today from the Value Menu or from the Dollar Menu. And then also, are you seeing any if at all impact from competitors who've rolled out their own dollar menus, Sonic or KFC? And then lastly, when I think about same-store sales for the June quarter, can you talk about how difficult a comparison you have given the rollout last year of Southern Style Chicken for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the Dollar Menu, obviously with what we talked before where over 50% of customers stayed with the double cheeseburger at $0.20 more, what's Dollar Menu has dropped into the 10% range from the 14% type range we had talked before. And so that's, as we mentioned earlier, that's helped margins, and it's maintained traffic. We're not seeing the competitive impact. We look at cress data, which gives us a pretty good look at what other folks are doing, and our Value Menu is the one with traction, and we continue to advertise it so customers know that their favorites there are available and need to be top of mind.</p>

          <p>You know, we don't project comps, and while we had a successful launch of the Southern Style Chicken last May, we have a tremendous amount of momentum in the U.S. business, and we feel comfortable that momentum will continue.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And last year, Pete, the reality is if you look at our U.S. sales, comp sales last year, they were 3% in the first quarter, 3.5 in the second, 4.5 in the third, and five in the fourth, slight increases each quarter. But not significantly different; the range is from three to five. And so we're really going against very steady baseline growth in the U.S., and we're building on that. We had a 4.7 in the first quarter this year even with the leap year impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a question on beverages in general and the McCaf&#xE9;. Just relative to that 18.3% Company-operated margin in the U.S. in the first quarter '09 and about 18.5% for all of '08; will the incremental sales of specialty coffee products improve that margin? And secondarily, just on the allocation of advertising dollars, where do you see that coming from to market the specialty coffee initiative? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. I think if you take a look at the accretion to margins relative to McCaf&#xE9;, there's no question if we sold 100% of our sales were McCaf&#xE9;, it would be accretive to the margin in a big way. But we haven't really sorted out the product mix yet relative to what will happen as we go to advertising on a macro basis, and so it remains to be seen. But the expectation of course would be that the beverages would be beneficial to the margins.</p>
          <p>And the second question, Pete, do you want to -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about advertising dollars, and obviously we're seeing softness in the advertising markets, not only television, but across all medias. And we're going to use that as an opportunity to stay aggressive in getting our message out there and use that as an opportunity to do even more advertising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Mitch, there's been a resetting really of the base media costs across the industry, and we're taking advantage of that opportunity to take a look at where our spend can either increase or remain the same and still get additional GRPs and reach to our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to add a couple things there, Jim, on the Company-operated margins, an 18.3 in the first quarter, which is obviously winter, is very strong margin in the U.S. And so it was a great performance by our U.S. business. And on the advertising, we are very conscious of making sure that we are strong on our core menu advertising at the time that we're rolling out a new product, that we do not get distracted on that. And we're fortunate with the current media environment that we'll be able to do both.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. If you could just add on Angus to that as well in the media question. And then I have a question as to the composition of your comps. When you say your comps are up four and change and you attribute that to chicken, breakfast and beverages, can you sort of provide a &#x2013; of that 100% increase, 50% was breakfast, another 25% beverages, and chicken adds the balance. And when you talk about beverages and the Caf&#xE9;s being 50% of the mix coming at breakfast, is that included when you look at the allocation of breakfast and how well breakfast is doing? Or do you wholly separate out the beverages when you look at what it contributes to your comps? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Howard, it's Pete. We don't get into that level of detail in terms of providing the drivers of the U.S. I think it's fair to say that all of those items are working together, and as you know, that they're consistent with the strategies that the U.S. business has followed because those are areas that we see huge opportunity in. We're going to continue to focus on those, and we think together those are going to continue to be big drivers of the U.S. business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on the Angus, Angus is much more part of our core offerings. It's burgers, it's beef, that's who we are. And so we look at that as an extension of our burger line and something that's very close to what McDonald's stands for.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. The next question is from Keith Siegner at Credit Suisse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just really quickly to follow up on one last question on China. Given the weakness that you've seen kind of along the southern regions, does this change at all kind of the strategy for how you approach the country? I mean, I think back in December at the Investor Day you talked about going after the top 150 markets. Does this maybe change the focus, broaden out the scope a little, really go for the long term, get into some of the smaller regions? And maybe use franchisees a little bit more heavily as part of the growth? How might you approach that, given what you've been seeing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question, Keith. And we at the moment are not changing our strategy. It remains the same. And when you look at China, and we're in this for the long term, just opening our 1,000th restaurant, and yet it only represents about 2% of our operating income. So the long term strategy there remains. We're looking at the big cities, and we're not franchising there yet on a wholesale basis because we're still working on franchise laws and making sure that we have a viable franchising model before we do that. And so we continue to be pretty much a Company-operated system there in China today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The next question is from Paul Westra at Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. I have a follow-up question on the U.S. margins. I was hoping to get maybe a little more detailed update on maybe what line items you see as greatest opportunity to deliver improved margins say over the next year or two, perhaps hear some specific efforts under way that can try to gauge how much more upside there might be to the McOpCo margin number. I guess in light of the fact that I think that 18.3% number is better than a 20-year high, it might theoretically limit upside, but on the other hand we're seeing some significant leverage elsewhere in the restaurant industry by other competitors who have significantly worse business trends than you do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's Pete. And then Ralph could maybe chime in, but obviously we think our biggest opportunity is to continue to drive comp sales. And our focus on the top line is going to give us the most leverage in the U.S. business. And with the momentum we're seeing and the pipeline, we're very optimistic around the top line. But structurally, as we've said also, we expect commodity costs to moderate as we move throughout the year, so these higher commodities as they work their way through the supply chain, will provide us some additional benefit. And we're always looking at ways to be a little bit more productive from the labor side.</p>
          <p>And probably from a headwind perspective, there are minimum wage, national minimum wage increases coming later in the year. Now a great majority of our system is already over the minimum wage, so we don't see that as being a huge impact, but it is something on the radar screen that we're looking at. But again, driving the top line is going to continue to be our greatest opportunity, and we don't see the margins hitting some theoretical peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Really, Pete, not much more to add, other than we don't expect the inflationary year we had last year this year, or it's not the long term trend. And so that will always help in a business where we have a fair amount of fixed costs and get leverage off of sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have another question from Joe Buckley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'm going to ask two, and they're at kind of the opposite sides of the globe. But in China, going back to China for a moment, if the comp was negative for the quarter, I think the sense I got is that January-February on a combined basis were up. So did sales get materially worse in March? And if so I'm kind of curious what you think might have driven that.</p>
          <p>And then separate from that, going back to the U.S., I guess Europe too, but U.S. on the food-cost side, are you locked in on food costs? Is there a reason you're not going to benefit from declining food costs? Because it seemed like through 2008, the food price inflation numbers kept rising pretty dramatically. So you definitely were susceptible to what was going on in the commodity markets in 2008, and I guess I'm wondering why you wouldn't be benefiting from that at some point here in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Joe, I think we did say that we, over the course of the year, will benefit from it as it passes through our supply chain on the food costs in the United States. And yes, we do some out-contracts and some hedging, as we've communicated in the past. But we expect to see some benefit accruement as we move through the year.</p>
          <p>And what was your second question? What was his second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China, was it -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was really about specifically about March in China and trends, and maybe, Ralph, you can talk about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. So adding to, on the commodity costs one, one section of it is proteins have not moderated in cost. And that's a big piece of our menu, so they're not growing at the pace that they were, but there's less supply out there of beef and chicken. And that's not allowing for the benefit that there is in some of the other commodities. And so that's what you see, but we'll definitely get better throughout the year.</p>
          <p>In China, March was not as strong as the combination of January and February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jim Baker at Neuberger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the other countries in corporate line, where it seems like you had about a $20 million reduction in restaurant margins and about a $14 million reduction in operating profits. You could comment on what's happening in Latin America and Canada particularly, and also the corporate expense.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Jim Skinner: Ralph, do you want to respond to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our Canadian business is really the &#x2013; we don't have any Company-operated restaurants in Latin America any more, but our Canadian business had a good sales and guest count month. They got impacted by the commodity costs a little bit more up there, and we've been stronger on our value proposition for both breakfast and rest of day as we're building our traffic. So Company-operated margins in Canada were dilutive to last year, and that's what would show up in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then also, at the corporate side, the corp G&amp;A expenses are down as we continue to just exercise good G&amp;A discipline and keep a watchful eye over that spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have time for just one more question. John Glass [Morgan Stanley]?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sounds like rolling into summer you're going to start nationally advertising the specialty coffee or the McCaf&#xE9; business. But right now five of the seven products, or the majority at least of the products, are hot beverages. And I think last summer you'd indicated that you'd seen the cups per week slow down materially in the summer given that hot coffee doesn't sell as well during that period. So the question is, is summer the right time to nationally advertise those products? Or better time to wait till fall? Should we at least moderate our expectations of the initial impact of that advertising at the very least? Or do I have it all wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not going to tell you when we're going to start national advertising. Proprietary information, but there's never a bad time to nationally advertise a high-quality product. So we'll make that determination as we move through this period, and as we get closer to what could be considered the time we'd be able to launch this new product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In addition to that, we've got a strong mix of iced coffee and Frappes that are part of the &#x2013; and the other cold drinks, and we're going to be strong on drinks this summer, on cold drink advertising, as we were last summer. And so we'll make sure we strike that right combination. But our business &#x2013; definitely don't sell more of the hot items in the summer &#x2013; but our business is much steadier than the rest because our customers are very regular. And so, like Jim said, we'll be out there all year when we've got a new product, supporting it in a strong basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well, thanks, everybody for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to emphasize that our global business is fundamentally strong, and we are well positioned for continued growth. Our financial discipline remains in line with our growth strategy of being better, not just bigger. And we are successfully controlling costs, at the same time investing to grow the business. Our system's ongoing alignment around our Plan to Win is producing measurable results in every area of the world. Customer-relevant strategies around food, value, convenience, and experience have earned us a place in consumers' daily lives.</p>
