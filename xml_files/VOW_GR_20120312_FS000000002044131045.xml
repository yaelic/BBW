          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's 10 o'clock and I would like to welcome to the Annual Media Conference and Investors Conference of Volkswagen AG here in Autostadt. Many of you know the procedure already for the morning. In the morning, you will hear the speech by Dr. Winterkorn and he is going to give you a review of the last year. This will be done by Professor Winterkorn and this will be followed by a detailed analysis by the CFO, Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, and after that, Professor Winterkorn is going give you an outlook for the coming months.</p>
          <p>And after the speeches, Dr. Winterkorn and Mr. P&#xF6;tsch would like to invite you to a Q&amp;A session and after a short lunch break at around 12 o'clock, then we will have a specific Q&amp;A session for our guests from the investor and analyst community and my colleague, Christine Ritz, will guide you through this.</p>
          <p>Just one comment before we start. We also try and I think &#x2013; you know as well that we also try to respond to trends and the latest developments and this year, it's reflected by the fact that our Annual Report for the very first time is available as an iPad app, which you can download. And we also distributed it at some of the stands here with &#x2013; where we have iPads and there you can check it out. So in addition to the financial figures and indicators, you can also take a look at the multimedia magazine pad.</p>
          <p>So much for the words of introduction. I'd like to hand over to Professor Winterkorn now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to our Annual Media and Investors Conference. You find us in a good and optimistic, and above all, confident mood today, first of all, because cars are more popular than ever before. At 62 million vehicles, the global passenger car market last year reached a new all-time high. And then secondly, because no one embodies this car boom better than the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>In 2011, our company reached new heights in every respect. In terms of unit sales, revenue and earnings, we achieved new record figures. We, again, significantly outperformed the market and we made substantial progress, not just in our key financial figures, but also in terms of the environment and sustainability. More about that later on, and about our ambitious goals on the way to becoming the world's most environmental carmaker. The fact is that the Volkswagen Group has seamlessly extended its string of successes in 2011. We are still firmly on track to the top of the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Turning to our key figures. At 8.3 million deliveries, the Volkswagen Group sold over one million more vehicles than in the previous year. Revenue increased by 25.6% to &#x20AC;159.3 billion. And to top it all off, operating profit rose by more than half to nearly &#x20AC;11.3 billion. In addition, we have to add our &#x20AC;2.6 billion proportional shares of the operating profit from our business in China. That healthy performance is reflected in our financial earnings, as our Chinese joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.</p>
          <p>Our group's success is built on sound and, above all, broad foundations. We have recorded growth in all regions of the world, even where we faced headwind. In Europe alone, for instance, we saw a growth of 11.3%. By contrast, the overall European market rose by a mere 3.6%.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific region, we also continued to extend our leading position. China, our second home market, above all, is and remains a particularly strong driver for the group, with vehicle deliveries of around 2.3 million units. However, we are also seeing strong growth in other key markets; in the Unites States, there, we were up by 23%. Russia grew by 74% and India rose by 109%. In all these regions, we clearly outpaced the growth of the competition and in all these regions we also increased our market shares. So as you can see, the Volkswagen Group is systematically leveraging its growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Apart from our strong global presence, this is due, above all, to our multibrand strategy. In the 2011 fiscal year, all group brands saw clear growth. This helped us to significantly expand our share of the global passenger car market to 12.3%, which is a whole percentage point more than in the previous year. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand is, and therefore remains, a powerful driver for the group. Last year, for the first time, it delivered more than 5 million vehicles. Its excellent growth in the United States, a key market, is especially encouraging. We were up by 23.3% there. Our new plant in Chattanooga and the U.S. Passat have put us squarely back on track for success there.</p>
          <p>Our product highlight was undoubtedly the up! last year. The up! proves that Volkswagen can also earn good money with small cars and without compromising on quality, design or technology.</p>
          <p>Audi is in the fast lane now on its way to the top of the premium segment. With more than 1.3 million deliveries, the brand has already passed its first core competitor. This is matched by impressive earnings figures. Audi is increasingly occupying pole position in terms of profitability, too. New models such as the Q3 demonstrate the brand's significant potential for conquest sales. This small premium SUV opens up another promising growth segment. What's more, our colleagues from Ingolstadt have again underscored their role as technology pioneers on a broad front, from hybrid drives to lightweight design to intelligent vehicle networking.</p>
          <p>&#x160;KODA has been part of the Volkswagen family for 20 years now and has long been much more than a hidden champion. In 2011, the brand recorded its ninth successive record year. At 880,000 vehicles, &#x160;KODA's deliveries have increased more than fivefold since 1991, particularly as a result of cooperation within the group. The goal for deliveries is to rise to at least 1.5 million units by 2018. This growth will be fueled by vehicles such as the Rapid for the Indian market, offering high quality at a low price. This is precisely the combination that millions of people the world over are looking for in China, India and Russia, but also, increasingly here in Europe as well.</p>
          <p>SEAT, too, is recording an upward trend again at around 350,000 vehicles. In fact, the brand saw clear double-digit growth in Germany and France. Consequently, SEAT has held its ground well in European core markets, despite the difficult environment, and the brand is shifting up another gear in the current year by expanding into China, where sales of the Leon will be starting in the coming days, with promising new models such as the Mii and with an emotional new design language embodied by the Toledo Concept. So as you can see, SEAT is currently reinventing itself and I'm certain that this new SEAT will be a real source of strength for the group.</p>
          <p>The luxury segment is a demanding but extremely high growth business. Bentley demonstrated this impressively in fiscal 2011 and around 7,000 vehicles and almost 37% increase in deliveries, our luxury British brand is back in the black, following the temporary blip caused by the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Bentley also intends to grow rapidly in the coming years and more than double its unit sales. Bentley stands for emotional contemporary luxury. This is clearly expressed by vehicles such as the new Continental GT convertible and the Bentley SUV concept car, which we are currently presenting in Geneva now. Lamborghini, too, has heightened the pace considerably. In 2011, the brand delivered around 1,600 vehicles, an increase of 23%. Lamborghini benefited from the growing demand for exclusive super sports cars, especially in China, the Middle East and the United States.</p>
          <p>The Aventador is Lamborghini's impressive new flagship. Its lightweight carbon fiber monocoque weighs a mere 147 kilograms and the Aventador is yet another example, therefore, of our group's expertise in lightweight design. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles too continued its upward trend and sold more than 0.5 million vehicles for the first time ever in 2011. Continued internationalization in particular is the driving factor here. In Europe and South America, the brand continued to extend its already strong position and this month, the Transporter and the Multivan are being launched in China and Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>Following the successful international launch of the Amarok, a further variant debuted in 2011, the Amarok Single Cab. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is also setting new benchmarks in efficiency. The new Multivan BlueMotion, for example, has a fuel consumption of only 6.4 liters per 100 kilometers or 44.1 Imperial, 36.7 U.S. miles per gallon.</p>
          <p>Now let's move from lights to heavy commercial vehicles. In 2011, Scania set a new record with sales of around 80,000 trucks and busses. And its operating profit was 13.6%. This continues to be highly encouraging.</p>
          <p>Recently, the cyclical heavy trucks business showed signs of slowing down, but our colleagues in Sweden have reacted quickly and systematically, among other things, imposing a temporary cut in production. At the same time, Scania is working hard to extend its lead as the premium provider in the commercial vehicles business. Among other things, this is demonstrated by the new highly efficient Euro 6 engines that represent a milestone when it comes to cutting fuel consumption and emissions.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you already know that the Volkswagen Group acquired a majority stake in the voting rights of MAN SE on November 9 last year. Since then, this brand, with its centuries old tradition, has been a permanent member of the Volkswagen family, contributing a broad range of vehicles, products and services. The combination of MAN, Scania and Volkswagen means that a new top player has now arrived on the truck market.</p>
          <p>Working together, we can take the initiative in the global commercial vehicles market. Together, we can chart a long-term stable growth route in this cyclical business and together, we can leverage synergies, invest strongly in new technologies and make jobs crisis-proof.</p>
          <p>All options are open to us when it comes to the further structuring of an integrated Commercial Vehicles group. What matters most is close cross-brand collaboration based on a sense of trust, and this is something that we have really stepped up in recent weeks and months. The focus here at present is on common strategies in procurement and for technical projects, such as powertrains and state-of-the-art production technologies.</p>
          <p>The key figures illustrate exactly how powerful MAN's contribution to the group is. MAN SE closed fiscal year 2011 with record unit sales and revenue. And in the consolidation period from the 9th of November to the 31st of December, it delivered close to 25,000 vehicles. This healthy performance by MAN and Scania also demonstrates the overall potential that lies in the commercial vehicles market. Despite all cyclical fluctuations, this business offers excellent prospects in the medium and long-term and it will increasingly turn into our second strong pillar on our path to becoming the leading mobility group.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, for financial &#x2013; Volkswagen Financial Services too, 2011 was a successful year. Operating earnings jumped by 29.1% and for the first time, exceeded the &#x20AC;1 billion mark. Of course, Financial Services is not only an important earnings contributor, it is also a sales driver for our brands. More than one-third of all group vehicles were financed or leased through our Financial Services division in 2011, which means about 3 million units. These figures reflect, on the one hand, our consistent and systematic internalization strategy. Last year, for example, we were granted our financial services license in India.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, Financial Services is developing innovative product packages that allow us to offer mobility for everyone. A good example here is our car sharing program called Quicar or Quicar, developed jointly with the Volkswagen brand. One topic that captured our and your attention last year was the integrated automotive group with Porsche.</p>
          <p>By acquiring Porsche Holding Salzburg, we significantly increased our sales capacity. Porsche Holding Salzburg is one of the world's most efficient and most profitable sales organizations. And what's more, we are enjoying smooth, successful operational cooperation with Porsche AG on a large number of technical projects and in many business fields. However, there are still some hurdles to cross on our path to full integration. All parties involved are continuing to work full speed ahead on achieving the integrated automotive group with Porsche at conditions that make good economic sense. What I can tell you today is this. The integrated Volkswagen and Porsche group will happen.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to conclude by summing up fiscal 2011 as follows. Volkswagen didn't just turn in a sparkling performance with its outstanding figures. Its sparkle also extends to fantastic new cars, satisfied customers and of course, a clear strategy for the future. And there's something that's really important for me at this point. Our success is underpinned by a strong workforce that now numbers more than 500,000 people. Our vehicles, technologies and services benefit from their passion and their outstanding skills.</p>
          <p>My Board of Management colleagues and I would therefore like to express our sincere thanks to the entire workforce. But we have more to offer than just words, because at Volkswagen, the principle is that record results also mean a record bonus for the workforce. So this year Volkswagen AG employees will receive a profit share of &#x20AC;7,500. That's almost 90% more than the year before.</p>
          <p>So much for my review of 2011. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will now explain our key figures to you in detail. Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to welcome you to today's Annual Media and Investors Conference in Wolfsburg. As Professor Winterkorn has already said, Volkswagen can again look back on the very successful fiscal year. The number of vehicles we sold worldwide was up again on the record level of 2010 to a new all-time high of over 8 million. This was a new record level. We see this as a proof that we can meet our customers' expectations. And it also shows that we remain on the right track with our products. This growth is also positively reflected in the financial data. We further increased our profitability and impressively demonstrated the robustness of our group.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen increased its sales revenue and operating profit significantly in fiscal year 2011. The Volkswagen Group's sales revenue reached &#x20AC;159.3 billion, which means up 25.6% year-on-year in the reporting period. Our operating profit reached a new record of &#x20AC;11.3 billion. Consequently, the Automotive Division improved its return on investment to 17.7%, which is well above our 9% minimum required rate of return. This is an impressive achievement on the part of our company.</p>
          <p>Another important performance measure in the Volkswagen Group is the Automotive Division's net liquidity. At &#x20AC;17 billion, this remains high, even after the equity investments in Porsche Holding Salzburg and MAN SE. In light of the still very volatile global economic environment and the associated uncertainty, we will systematically continue our strategy of disciplined cost and investment management, with a view to further increasing the group's profitability and thus, its competitiveness.</p>
          <p>We have established a strong position, and our sound finances mean we are well prepared for the future. This continues to give us the financial flexibility we need for our investment and to implement our Strategy 2018. Expanding our production capacity in growth markets will help to reinforce our position in those markets and improve the quality of our earnings.</p>
          <p>In light of our company's highly encouraging performance, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are proposing to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of &#x20AC;3 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;3.06 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>We not only managed fiscal year 2011 very well in terms of our operating business, we also forged ahead with the group's strategic development. In March 2011, we acquired Porsche Holding Salzburg for &#x20AC;3.3 billion. On the 9th of November, after obtaining the official approvals from the authorities, we completed the mandatory offer for MAN and now hold 59.58% of the voting rights and 57.33% of the share capital as of 31st of December. Our figures, therefore, contain Porsche Holding Salzburg for 10 months and MAN for just under two months.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to take a detailed look at the past fiscal year. A glance at our income statement shows that we increased our sales revenue by 25.6% year-on-year to &#x20AC;159.3 billion. Since our cost of sales rose more slowly by 24.6%, gross profit improved by &#x20AC;6.5 billion to &#x20AC;28 billion. As a result, the gross margin increased from 16.5% of sales revenue in the previous year to 17.6%. At &#x20AC;14.6 billion, distribution expenses were higher year-on-year due to the expansion of business. However, the ratio of distribution expenses to sales revenue declined. The &#x20AC;1.1 billion increase in administrative expenses to &#x20AC;4.4 billion was driven primarily by volume growth, the initial consolidation of companies and stricter banking regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>Our total operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;11.3 billion, a clear improvement of 57.8% on 2010. The operating margin improved from 5.6% to 7.1%. We were able to achieve this improvement in our performance, thanks to the tremendous commitment and hard work of all of our group's employees. These figures do not include the proportional share of the operating profit recorded by our Chinese joint ventures, amounting to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. These companies are included using the equity method and are therefore, only reflected in the group's financial result. Last year's figures impressively demonstrate that the Chinese joint ventures continued their positive growth trend.</p>
          <p>The financial result increased by &#x20AC;5.8 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;7.7 billion. This was due firstly to higher income from the measurement of our equity accounted investments, which primarily include our Chinese joint ventures and Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH. Secondly, the updated measurement of the put/call rights relating to Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH had a positive effect of &#x20AC;6.6 billion in total.</p>
          <p>The financial result was negatively impacted by the switch in accounting for the Suzuki shares from the equity method to fair value and for the MAN shares from the equity method to consolidation, full consolidation. However, these were purely non-cash book effects, so they didn't have an effect on cash.</p>
          <p>Our total profit before tax amounted to &#x20AC;18.9 billion, twice as much as in the previous year. The income tax expense amounted to &#x20AC;3.1 billion in the past fiscal year, representing a tax rate of 16.5%. It should be noted that the effects from the re-measurement of the options relating to Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH have no impact on the tax expense.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group generated a record profit after tax of &#x20AC;15.8 billion in fiscal 2011. Allow me to note at this point that you will find the presentation of the key indicators for the fourth quarter of 2011 on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, following this overview of the Volkswagen Group's income statement, I would now like to look in greater detail at certain line items and the factors affecting them.</p>
          <p>Last year, we lifted group sales revenue by &#x2013; or to &#x20AC;159.3 billion. That means we increased it by &#x20AC;32.5 billion compared with 2010. At &#x20AC;23 billion, volume growth was the biggest factor driving this performance. The figure also includes the consolidated sales revenue of Porsche Holding Salzburg at a good &#x20AC;5 billion. Price and mix effects contributed a combined total of &#x20AC;4 billion to this improvement.</p>
          <p>Scania brought a positive effect of &#x20AC;1.6 billion and the initial inclusion of MAN contributed &#x20AC;2.7 billion. With an increase of &#x20AC;2.3 billion due to the volume-related factors, Volkswagen Financial Services again made a significant contribution to the group.</p>
          <p>Before I look in more detail at the changes in operating profit by brand and business field, allow me to say an introductory word about our group structure. The Volkswagen Group continues to consist of the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. The Automotive Division now comprises two business areas, the Passenger Cars and Light Commercial Vehicles Business Area on the one hand, and the Trucks and Busses, Power Engineering Business Area on the other. The business areas are presented in detail in our current annual report.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 57.8% and thus, at a faster pace than sales revenue. Strong demand for vehicles and financial services lifted the Volkswagen Group's operating profit significantly year-on-year to &#x20AC;11.3 billion. It's not only the rate of growth that's impressive, but above all, the fact that all brands, without exception, improved their operating result.</p>
          <p>Despite the upfront costs for the modular transverse system, the operating profit of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand rose by &#x20AC;1.6 billion to &#x20AC;3.8 billion and the operating profit of the Audi brand by &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;5.3 billion. This impressively demonstrates the high level of market acceptance for our attractive products and the success of our sustained cost and process optimization.</p>
          <p>The &#x160;KODA brand contributed an operating profit of &#x20AC;743 million to the group's performance. In addition to the high volume, mix effects and cost reductions also had a positive effect here.</p>
          <p>The SEAT brand's operating loss narrowed significantly year-on-year by &#x20AC;86 million to minus &#x20AC;225 million. However, our Spanish subsidiary is still facing a dramatic decline in demand in the overall Spanish passenger car market. Additionally, upfront expenditures were incurred for new products.</p>
          <p>Conditions in the luxury segment continued to improve in fiscal 2011, enabling Bentley to again report a rise in sales figures and thus, return to profit. Its operating result rose by &#x20AC;253 million to reach a profit of &#x20AC;8 million.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, where strong sales pushed up earnings, also recorded a very positive performance. Operating profit here was up &#x20AC;217 million on the prior year figure to &#x20AC;449 million. The Scania brand performed well in the reporting period, beating its prior-year figures. Despite the sharp fluctuations in markets for heavy trucks and buses, Scania demonstrated its considerable competitiveness by generating an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention in particular to our new brand, MAN, which we consolidated in the group as another successful brand on the 9th of November, 2011. In the past fiscal year, MAN benefited from the recovery in both the commercial vehicles business and in the mechanical engineering sector. In the period from November to December 2011, MAN contributed an operating profit of &#x20AC;193 million to the Volkswagen Group's earnings.</p>
          <p>Lifted by volume growth and a positive trend in risk provisions, Volkswagen Financial Services generated an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the past fiscal year. This corresponds to an increase of almost 30% compared with the previous year. Please note that the figures for the brands and divisions also include intra-group transactions, in particular inter-company profits, whose elimination is contained in the Other category. Additionally, this category includes the depreciation and amortization expense from the purchase price allocation for Scania, Porsche Holding Salzburg and MAN.</p>
          <p>If we analyze the reasons for the encouraging trend in operating profit, we can see that volume, mix and price effects totaling &#x20AC;5.9 billion were the largest positive factors. An improvement in product cost, due primarily to optimized procurement activities, again had a positive effect on operating profit. We reached a contribution of &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the course of 2011. This clearly shows how systematically we are working on our cost structures and improving our margins, so that we can meet future challenges in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>The negative effect of &#x20AC;2.6 billion arising from fixed cost and depreciation and amortization expense is primarily attributable to the group's growth and to development costs related to the expansion of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Scania helped lift operating profit, despite the fluctuations in the truck market. As expected, however, the operating profit at MAN was not enough to offset the higher depreciation and amortization expense from the purchase price allocation in the early phase after the acquisition. Together, this reduced the group's operating profit by &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>In turn, the Volkswagen Financial Services Division contributed around &#x20AC;300 million to the improvement in the group's operating profit.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, return on investment is the Automotive Division's core financial management instrument and therefore, the key target variable for the financial assessment of all strategic and operational decisions. The Automotive Division achieved a return on investment of 17.7% last year, again, significantly exceeding the prior year level. This enabled us not only to earn our current cost of capital of 7% and thus, achieve a positive value contribution of &#x20AC;5.6 billion, but also to significantly exceed our 9% minimum required rate of return.</p>
          <p>The figures impressively demonstrate that we have systematically increased our operating profitability while maintaining our investment discipline. In all of our investment decisions, we will continue to ensure that our upfront expenditures are focused on safeguarding the future of our company and generating adequate returns.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services Division lifted its return on equity before tax from 12.9% to 14.0%. This was thanks primarily to the year-on-year improvement in profit, due to volume-related factors.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the consolidated balance sheet. The Volkswagen Group's total assets at the end of fiscal 2011 amounted to &#x20AC;253.6 billion, a year-on-year increase of 27.2%. This was primarily the result of the positive business performance, the acquisition of Porsche Holding Salzburg and the consolidation of MAN. Despite the increase in total assets, the group's equity ratio improved by 0.6 percentage points to 25%.</p>
          <p>Equity in the Automotive Division was strengthened by the positive earnings growth. As a result, the equity ratio in the Automotive Division rose slightly compared with the previous year to 35.9%. Equity in the Financial Services Division increased by &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;10.9 billion. In addition to the good earnings performance, the inclusion of Porsche Holding Salzburg's financial services business and of MAN also had a positive effect here. The division's equity ratio was 10.1%.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to individual items in our cash flow statement. At &#x20AC;17 billion, net liquidity in our Automotive Division remained at a high level at the end of 2011. This by no means negligible figure puts us on a sound financial footing and demonstrates the company's solid financial base.</p>
          <p>The earnings growth increased gross cash flow by &#x20AC;3 billion to &#x20AC;15.4 billion. Despite the expansion of business, working capital again recorded a cash inflow of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. As a result, cash flows from operating activities, which is the sum of gross cash flow and changes in working capital, increased by &#x20AC;3.2 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;17.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Investments in property, plant and equipment contained within investing activities were &#x20AC;2.3 billion higher in 2011, at around &#x20AC;8 billion. Because sales revenue increased significantly, the ratio of investments in property, plant and equipment to sales revenue rose only slightly year-on-year, by 0.6 percentage points to 5.6%. In addition to our production facilities, we invested mainly in expanding our model range and modularizing our vehicle concepts. Our modular system strategy plays a central role here. The modular transverse system or concept will enable the Volkswagen Group to manufacture top-quality volume and niche products at competitive cost structures for the long term and worldwide.</p>
          <p>It initially entails considerable upfront costs in order to adapt a range of production plants in the Volkswagen Group to the new platform. This affected earnings in fiscal year 2011 and it will also be reflected in the years 2012 and 2013. In addition to these synergy-driven efficiency enhancements, our investments continue to center on the ecological focus of our model range.</p>
          <p>Within investing activities attributable to operating activities, the acquisition of equity investments led to a cash outflow of &#x20AC;6.6 billion. This figure includes the acquisition of Porsche Holding Salzburg at &#x20AC;3.3 billion, the increase in the stake in MAN SE at &#x20AC;3.5 billion and the equity investment in SGL Carbon SE at &#x20AC;224 million, less cash and cash equivalents acquired attributable to Porsche Holding Salzburg and MAN.</p>
          <p>Due to the higher volume of equity investments, the Automotive Division's net cash flow therefore declined by &#x20AC;3.7 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The figures show that financially, we are on the right track. Volkswagen entered 2012 with a sound net liquidity position.</p>
          <p>We will continue to invest in our forward-looking product portfolio with prudence and appropriate cost discipline. Our strong position in the global markets will help us to leverage the group's strength and systematically increase our competitive advantages.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention to a recent &#x2013; a new publication. This morning, we published the notice convening Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft's Annual General Meeting in Hamburg on the 19 of April, 2012. In addition to the standard resolutions that appear in all Annual General Meetings, the agenda includes a proposal to create new authorized capital, which would be effective for five years.</p>
          <p>This is a standard procedure for large stock corporations keen to safeguard flexibility in their financing activities. The proposed authorization is intended to replace an authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting last year, which we have not yet used. Last year's authorization also allowed preemptive rights to be granted to ordinary and preferred shareholders, or those rights to be disapplied. However, the old authorization only allows preemptive rights to be disapplied or excluded in cases where new ordinary shares are issued.</p>
          <p>By proposing to include preferred shares in the potential disapplication of preemptive rights, we are primarily addressing the high level of acceptance that Volkswagen's preferred shares enjoy among investors. As a result, these could also become more important in principle for acquisitions as well. They are by far the more liquid of our two share classes and are included in the DAX.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to sum up the year 2011. We can look back on a very successful fiscal year. The Volkswagen Group generated profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG of &#x20AC;15.4 billion in fiscal 2011. This corresponds to basic earnings of &#x20AC;33.10 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;33.16 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>Many thanks for your attention.</p>

          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, 2011 was an outstanding year for the Volkswagen Group. But 2011 also saw the continuation of a long-term success story and with it, another stage on our path towards becoming the world's best carmaker. It's not up to us to decide what the best carmaker actually has to do. That's a matter for our customers, employees and business partners, shareholders and investors, media representatives, policymakers and ultimately, everyone who lives in Germany, Brazil, China, or anywhere on the planet.</p>
          <p>All of them, or at least the majority of them, we hope will answer the question of who is the strongest, fairest and most environmental carmaker in the world by saying, the Volkswagen Group. That is our long-term goal and that is, in fact, at the heart of our Strategy 2018.</p>
          <p>You will recall that in 2007, we launched our master plan, which aimed to combine good and large. Our Strategy 2018 combines economic success with financial strength. Equally, our Strategy 2018 also means responsible conduct towards our customers, employees, the environment and society. That is the basis for the complete repositioning of the Volkswagen Group in the past four years.</p>
          <p>Today, we want to look at what we have achieved so far with our Strategy 2018. At the same time, we want to look ahead at what we must and will do in the years to come; first, in terms of deliveries and profitability; second, in terms of employee and customer satisfaction, and third, with our commitment to the environment and to society.</p>
          <p>Allow me to start with our clear quantitative growth targets, in other words, deliveries, volume and profitability. We are on the right track in terms of volume growth. Our goal of 10 million vehicles is now within sight. Last year, compared to 2007, we delivered around two million more vehicles, which is an increase of more than 30%.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our global market share grew by 2.7 percentage points. In Europe, China and South America, the Volkswagen Group is already the number one. And in the other regions, too, we are steadily gaining market shares. In the United States, for example, the Volkswagen brand recorded an increase of over 42%, making it the best February in 40 years.</p>
          <p>The unbroken automotive boom is providing an additional tailwind for our growth plans. By 2018, the global market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles could top the 100 million level. Our direction is therefore clear. Volkswagen will build on existing strengths and take advantage of additional opportunities. And that is why every generation of our vehicles is better than the previous one and it's why we're selectively moving into new segments and niches. And that's also why we are continuing to invest in our core markets, at the same time as we are reinforcing our presence in growth regions.</p>
          <p>In China, from now to 2016, we will be investing some &#x20AC;14 billion and opening new plants in Foshan, Yizheng and Ningbof. In the medium term, we will increase our production capacity there to around 3 million units per year.</p>
          <p>In the Russian city of Nizhniy Novgorod, we recently started producing the &#x160;KODA Yeti together with the GAZ group. In the medium term, up to 110,000 Volkswagen and &#x160;KODA vehicles per year could roll off the production lines there.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we are currently building a new engine plant so that we can continue to substantially increase local value added. And, Audi is looking at establishing its own production facilities in North America. It will make a decision on this in the next few months.</p>
          <p>In the ASEAN region too, we are also upping the pace. In Malaysia, we've already started producing the Volkswagen Passat, with the Polo and Jetta soon to follow. And Indonesia, the Transporter and Multivan are rolling off the lines.</p>
          <p>In Europe, too, and in Germany, we are also making major investments in our plants and locations. For example, in Hanover, starting in June, production of the Amarok will start, which will secure the future of that plant.</p>
          <p>Whenever we are active, there's one thing our customers can rely on, the greatest diversity in the entire automotive world, with 10 strong brands from economy to luxury, with more than 240 different vehicle models, from the up! to the 50-ton truck.</p>
          <p>Despite all this, the small vehicle segment shows there is still uncharted territory for Volkswagen. Worldwide, we're anticipating growth rates of nearly 50% for this segment. However, in Europe, growth ought to be at about 18% alone. We now have our own attractive response to this demand in the shape of our cross-brand New Small Family.</p>
          <p>In the first phase, the Volkswagen up! and its siblings from &#x160;KODA and SEAT will attract additional customers in Europe. Starting in 2013, we will take the next step into growth regions. In Brazil, we intend to sell up to 150,000 vehicles a year in the medium term, using a localized version of the up! and in India and China too, we are currently examining market opportunities. The New Small Family is a symbol of our greatest strength, close cross-brand collaboration in which we leverage synergies in development, procurement and production in a way that is unrivaled by our competitors.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, financial strength is the basis for healthy growth. Our return on sales before tax has risen from 6.0% in 2007 to 11.9%. Without the non-recurring effect from the re-measurement of the put/call options mentioned before, we would be at 7.8%. This means that we are already close to our target return on sales of 8%.</p>
          <p>However, I would like to add that what's crucial, it's not a snapshot, but rather establishing a high return on sales on a sustainable level. And that is why at Volkswagen, our strict cost and investment discipline policy applies, even when our coffers are full. In concrete terms, this means, first of all, that we have launched the largest investment program in the history of our group. In the period up to 2016, we will be investing &#x20AC;62.4 billion, plus &#x20AC;14 billion in China, in all the relevant areas that are key to the future, in new products, technologies and plants.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are developing new and intelligent instruments to help us cut costs permanently. A good example of this is the Material Costs Forum. This is where development and procurement work together at a very early stage of a project to search for solutions that not only meet technical specifications, but also simplify procurement.</p>
          <p>Across the group last year, this helped us save more than &#x20AC;1 billion, despite increasing commodity prices. Our modular strategy is the lever when it comes to costs. At Audi, all vehicles from the A4 up to the A8 are already based on our modular longitudinal system. We are now rolling out this systematic approach to the entire group, with our standard modular system for large sedans or saloons, with the modular system for the New Small Family, with the modular diesel and infotainment systems, and above all, with the Modular Transverse system for all the group's future vehicles in the Polo, Golf and Passat segments.</p>
          <p>The new Audi A3 that debuted in Geneva is the first model based on the Modular Transverse system. In the future, more than 40 models will be built using the common system. Of course, we need to initially recoup our substantial development and startup costs. In the medium to long-term, however, the Modular Transverse system will deliver substantial costs or substantial savings in unit costs, one-off expenses and the production of our vehicles. Production time alone, for instance, will be cut by around 30%. The transfer of the modular system principle to production is the next logical step that we're talking.</p>
          <p>Our factory of the future is highly flexible and it can produce a wide range of models and brands on the same production line. This opens up entirely new opportunities for us to ensure optimum capacity utilization at our plants across the entire group. So as you can see, The Volkswagen Group has laid the foundations for moving into a new dimension in terms of profitability in the long term, too.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to the second qualitative set of issues in our Strategy 2018, the satisfaction of our customers and our employees. Customer satisfaction, ladies and gentlemen, is quite simply the be all and end all, because in our business, only satisfied customers are a guarantee of long-term success. Since 2007, customer satisfaction has been growing continuously and in individual markets such as China, Volkswagen and Audi already lead the field.</p>
          <p>This is what core industry studies are telling us about the satisfaction of new car buyers. That's good, but it's not good enough, because in the long term, we also want to lead the industry when it comes to customer satisfaction, in all the relevant markets. And we're also asking our dealers to help us in achieving this goal. Audi's Customer Round Table brings together dealers, sales and marketing and development. Volkswagen brand dealers collaborate in what we call Customer First workshops to exchange ideas for getting closer to customers. And our new Customer First bonus rewards importers and dealers whose customers are especially satisfied.</p>
          <p>However, good service in the showroom and in the workshop is only part of the story. What really matters are our vehicles. And here too, our modular systems are the keys to even greater customer satisfaction, because they allow us to stake out a position in niches quickly and profitably and to align our models with specific market requirements at low cost, because they allow us to roll out assistance systems and all powertrain types from the TDI to hybrids to electric drives in all vehicle classes and brands, and because they unlock additional flexibility to invest in new vehicles and new technologies.</p>
          <p>For our customers, this means even greater diversity, even more innovation and products that are even more closely tailored to their specific wishes. At the same time, however, our modular strategy confronts us with new challenges as far as quality is concerned.</p>
          <p>Let me once again say here very clearly, the Volkswagen Group must not and cannot ever achieve growth at the expense of quality. And that's why we've totally revised our quality assurance organization and made it much faster worldwide, and that's why we are systematically rolling out Volkswagen's culture of perfection to all corners of the group, among other things, with our Quality in Growth program. And this is already paying off. Since 2007, we have cut the number of TGW or incidents by around one-third across the entire group.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 2007, we deliberately set ourselves the strategic goal of making Volkswagen an employer of choice. There is a simple equation behind this. If you want to build the best vehicles, you need the best team, one that is highly qualified, fit and above all, highly motivated. Our annual employee opinion survey is a key management tool for achieving this. With more than 300,000 participants last year, this is one of the most extensive employee surveys anywhere in the world and the results are quite impressive.</p>
          <p>Currently, 91% of group employees say they are happy to work at Volkswagen. That is six percentage points higher than the first survey four years ago. And our appeal as an employer for graduates and experienced top experts is also growing continuously. Volkswagen and Audi now count among the most attractive employers in Germany, Europe and worldwide for engineers and economists.</p>
          <p>In the Volkswagen Group, it is not only the tasks that are growing, but also the capabilities and expertise of the workforce. All in all, now, we employ around the world 0.5 million people, 170,000 more than in 2007. Even without our new colleagues at Scania and MAN and Porsche Holding Salzburg, we have in the last four years created around 64,000 jobs worldwide, more than one-third of them in Germany. So as you can see, there's an upbeat mood among the Volkswagen workforce and we want to keep it that way for the long term. And that is why our employees share systematically in our company's success, and that is why we also offer good prospects to our agency workers, wherever possible. In 2011 the Volkswagen Group gave some 3,300 agency workers permanent jobs in Germany alone. And that is why we are investing in young talent like no other automotive group. This year, we will recruit 4,800 apprentices or vocational trainees and for the first time, more than 10,000 new graduates. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our investment in the future of the group and of the regions where we develop, build and sell our vehicles.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this brings me to my third point, responsibility. For a company such as Volkswagen, it's not enough to build good cars and be financially successful. That's because there's one thing that recent years have demonstrated beyond doubt. Businesses must act responsibly if the economy is to function properly. Our responsibility and commitment for our employees, for society and the environment is therefore not just a key element, but at the very core of our Strategy 2018.</p>
          <p>We are committed to our responsibility for a successful, profitable growth of our company and also for ensuring secure, good jobs for training and the future of the younger generation for education, science and culture and above all, for an intact environment.</p>
          <p>It is our mission to help bring about individual mobility for as many people as possible in the future as well, mobility that is affordable, safe and environmentally responsible. We have already achieved a great deal here in the past few years. Our European new vehicle fleet already averages just 137 grams of CO2 per kilometer, 27 grams less than in 2007.</p>
          <p>In Geneva, we launched a fundamental environmental restructuring of the Volkswagen Group. We intend to make Volkswagen the most environmental carmaker in the world. We intend to offer the most efficient and most environmentally friendly models in each segment and in each vehicle class we are active in, and we are proactively committed to the 120-gram goal. In other words, we will reduce CO2 emissions of our European new vehicle fleet by 30% between 2006 and 2015. This is not an empty promise. It is a firm commitment. That is why we are making each new vehicle generation, on average, 10% to 15% more efficient. That is why we are rolling out our efficiency technologies, such as start-stop and recuperation, as standard in all new models, and that is why we're making 2013 the year of e-mobility, with the e-up!, followed by many more hybrid and electric vehicles from our group brands. And that is why we are investing &#x20AC;600 million in developing renewable energy sources and making production at our plants 25% more environmentally friendly by 2018.</p>
          <p>This ambitious environmental program is being supported by a very powerful effort, both technical and financial. Well over two-thirds of our entire investment program in the period up to 2016 will be spent directly and indirectly on environmental protection; on increasingly efficient vehicles, powertrains, technologies and on environmentally compatible production. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our commitment to sustainable, good corporate growth, and to a healthy balance between economics and ecology.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I can sum up our achievements so far as follows. Our Strategy 2018 is coming to bear in our deliveries and profitability for our satisfied customers and employees, and in the environmental restructuring of the group. Nevertheless, we are also aware that we haven't yet reached our goal and that there is still plenty of work for us to do. It's like a game of football or soccer. The second half is always that bit more challenging, that bit tougher, especially because we've decided to step up the pace another notch.</p>
          <p>2012 will certainly be a very demanding year for us. The risks are growing. In particular, the debt crisis in Europe will continue to weigh on markets. But I'm still convinced that the Volkswagen Group can approach the coming months with confidence, above all, because this year, we will again be launching more than 40 additional new models, successors and product enhancements across the group. These include such compelling vehicles as the new Audi A3. This model is and will continue to be the benchmark in the premium compact segment. The new edition of the Golf, our most important vehicle, will also be launched this autumn. And I can already tell you today that the new Golf will be a quantum leap.</p>
          <p>Our current sales figures underscore the fact that we're not letting up. We've recorded a sparkling start to the year. In January and February, we delivered some 1.3 million vehicles worldwide, more than ever before. And at 7.7%, we, again, grew faster than the market. For the coming months as well, I can say that despite all economic uncertainties, we remain cautiously optimistic. In 2012, we will sell more vehicles than in the previous year. Once again, we will grow sales revenue. And our goal for operating profit is to repeat the high level we achieved in the previous year.</p>
          <p>The foundations for this are, to my mind, the most attractive range of models in the automotive industry and our group's strong position worldwide. Above all, however, we have our sights firmly set on our long-term goal. We intend to and will make the Volkswagen Group a beacon for the automotive industry, financially successful, environmentally, a leader and socially responsible.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
