          <p>[Starts Abruptly] Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available in Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>In this call, Emerson's management will discuss some non-GAAP measurements in talking about the company's performance and the reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained within a presentation that is posted in the Investor Relations area of Emerson's website at www.emerson.com.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Lynne Maxeiner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeremy. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Emerson, and Walter Galvin, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter 2009 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales were down 21% to 5.3 billion. Underlying sales declined 20% with mature markets down 24% and emerging markets down 13%. In fourth quarter, four out of five business segments increased revenue sequentially from the third quarter. We delivered strong gross profit margin of 38.1%, up from 37% in prior year quarter with significantly lower volume and inventory reductions in this quarter versus the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit margin was 16.9%, up 220 basis points sequentially from Q3. Earnings per share were $0.67, down 24% compared to $0.88 in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow was strong at 1.352 billion and we delivered record-setting free cash flow of 1.209 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong and flexible. We continued our progress in reducing inventory. Operational inventory was reduced by 250 million in the fourth quarter. While the shape of the recovery is uncertain, Emerson is well positioned with a strong best cost position and significant new product efforts launched.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the P&amp;L. Again, sales down 21% to 5.322 billion, underlying sales declined 20%, currency subtracted 2 points and acquisitions added 1 point.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the quarter of 897 million or 16.9% of sales, the decline primarily driven by deleverage on lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and inventory reduction, which was partially offset by benefits from rationalization, cost reductions, and material cost containment.</p>
          <p>Net earnings of 506 million in the quarter, diluted average shares of 755.3 million, no shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter '09, which leaves you with an EPS of $0.67. We have established good momentum in the fourth quarter and our aggressive actions are taking hold.</p>
          <p>The next slide, underlying sales by region. In Q4, the U.S. was down 21%. Total international in the quarter was down 20% with Europe down 29%, Latin America down 20%, Canada down 30%, and Middle East/Africa down 16%. This gets you to a total underlying sales decline of 20%. Currency subtracted 2 points and acquisitions added 1 point, which brings you to the consolidated sales down 21%.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal year 2009, the U.S. was down 18% and total international was down 13%. Asia declined only 2%, Latin America was down 7%, and Middle East/Africa and Canada each down 6%. Total underlying sales were down 13%. Currency subtracted 4 points and acquisitions added 1 point, which gets you to a consolidated sales down 16%. Emerging markets now represent 32% of total sales.</p>
          <p>Next slide, some income statement detail. Gross profit dollars of 2.028 billion or 38.1% of sales, a 110 basis point increase from the prior year quarter. We are seeing the benefits from rationalization actions and cost reductions.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A was 21.2% of sales, which gets you to an operating profit of 897 million or 16.9% of sales. Other deductions net were 177 million. We had a 62 million increase in restructuring, which was partially offset by a 22 million one-time impairment charge for the Appliance Control business that was recorded in the fourth quarter of '08. Interest expense of 63 million gets you to the pre-tax line of 657 million or 12.3% of sales.</p>
          <p>Taxes in the fourth quarter were 151 million for a tax rate of 23.1%, resulting from planned restructuring of international units to utilize a net operating loss benefit and international income &#x2013; international pre-tax income mix was favorable.</p>
          <p>Slide six, the cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow in the quarter of 1.352 billion, up 4%. Capital expenditures of 143 million gets you to a free cash flow of 1.209 billion, up 16% and a record level of free cash flow in a quarter for Emerson.</p>
          <p>Trade working capital balances are at the bottom of the page. We have aggressively been reducing inventory. The inventory balance has been reduced more than 200 million sequentially from 6/30/09 and more than 600 million from 12/31/08.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the business segment P&amp;L. Business segment EBIT of 791 million or 14.5% of sales. Excluding restructuring in the quarter for both years, business segment EBIT margins were flat. We had a positive impact from cost reduction programs and rationalization benefits, and volume deleverage was partially offset by material containment and price.</p>
          <p>Difference in accounting methods was 41 million. Corporate and other, 112 million, up 7 million, and interest expense of 63 million, up 22 million primarily from the change in debt mix and lower interest income, gets you to a pre-tax earnings of 657 million or again, 12.3% of sales.</p>
          <p>Next, we'll review the individual business segments. First we'll start with Process Management. Sales in the quarter down 13% to 1.645 billion. Underlying sales were down 13%, currency subtracted 3 points and acquisitions added 3 points.</p>
          <p>By region, the U.S. was down 6%, Asia down 9%, Europe down 21%, and Middle East/Africa down 7%. EBIT dollars of 286 million or 17.4% of sales, the decline driven by volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expense of 25 million. We did see a sequential margin improvement of 260 basis points from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Inventory for Process Management was reduced approximately 85 million since June 30, '09 and approximately 180 million from 12/31/08. Process Management introduced the next generation Delta V process-control system as well as new wireless devices, as we have continued to invest in new technologies.</p>
          <p>Slide nine, Industrial Automation. Sales in the quarter of 822 million, down 36%. Underlying sales were down 37%, acquisitions added 3 points and currency subtracted 2 points.</p>
          <p>By region, the U.S. was down 42%, Europe was down 36%, and Asia was down 27%. We see broad-based weakness across the segment with the power generating alternator business down substantially.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 63 million were 7.7% of sales, negatively impacted by volume deleverage, including inventory reduction and higher restructuring of 14 million. We did see a sequential margin improvement of 270 basis points from Q3 on essentially flat sales.</p>
          <p>We have seen order trends stabilize at very low levels for Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation also aggressively reduced inventory by approximately 50 million since June 30, '09 and about 220 million since 12/31/08. We expect end market conditions will remain very challenging in the near-term for Industrial Automation.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Network Power. Sales in the quarter of 1.338 billion, down 22%. Underlying sales were down 20%, acquisitions subtracted one point and currency subtracted one point.</p>
          <p>By region, the U.S. was down 20%, Asia was down 8% and Europe was down 36%. EBIT dollars of 178 million were 13.3% of sales. Margin increased 70 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by cost reduction savings from repositioning efforts and material cost containment, which was partially offset by volume deleverage.</p>
          <p>Network Power had restructuring spending of 118 million in FY '09 focused on improving the operational efficiency and strengthening the global competitive position of the business segment.</p>
          <p>We recently announced the Avocent acquisition. Avocent will significantly enhance Emerson's solutions portfolio for the data center infrastructure management.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, Climate Technologies. Sales in the quarter of 913 million, down 10% with underlying sales down 10%, currencies subtracting two points and acquisitions adding two points.</p>
          <p>By region, the U.S. was down 11%, Europe was down 20% and Asia was up 4%. The growth in Asia was driven by China's stimulus programs and growth is expected to be strong in China in early 2010 for Climate Technologies.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars were 147 million or 16.1% of sales, a margin expansion of 250 basis points, impacted positively by cost reductions and effective management of price cost exposures. Order trends have stabilized for Climate Technologies and we have seen modest improvement. We expect the U.S. residential GFI to be positive in the second half of fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Appliance and Tools. Sales in the quarter of 760 million, down 22%. Underlying sales were also down 22%. By region, the U.S. was down 21%, Europe was down 25%, and Asia declined 6%.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 117 million were 15.4% of sales. Margin increased 330 basis points driven by cost reduction benefits and effective cost price management, which was partially offset by volume deleverage and negative mix. We also had a $22 million charge in the appliance control business last year in fourth quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>We expect residential and consumer markets to recover gradually as we progress through 2010, but the last couple of months have been very tepid.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, overview of the full year results. Sales for the full year of 20.915 billion, down 16%. Underlying sales were down 13%, emerging markets were 32% of total sales, and international was 55% of total sales. Operating profit of 3.167 billion or 15.1% of sales, the decline driven by volume deleverage and aggressive inventory reduction.</p>
          <p>EPS from continuing operations of $2.27, down 27% from the prior year. Dividends per share increased 10% and fiscal year '09 was our 53rd consecutive year of increased dividends. The Board of Directors voted to increase the December dividend to $0.335 per share.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow of 3.086 billion, down 6% and free cash flow of 2.555 billion or 12.2% of sales, essentially matching 2008 the level.</p>
          <p>It's been a very tough economic environment as we all know, but Emerson is fundamentally a stronger company on all key metrics, which will drive stronger operating performance when the recovery starts happening in 2010.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne. It's good to be here this afternoon. I appreciate everyone taking their &#x2013; waiting until the end of the day for this call, but as you all know, in November, we always have a two-day Strategy Board Meeting offsite to talk about what's going on within the business and where we're going to try take the position or the company.</p>
          <p>First of all, I want to thank everybody across Emerson from the operating units to corporate for the tremendous efforts in what I would call an extremely challenging economic environment around the world. A lot of actions have been taken and I'll talk about a little bit of that in a few minutes. But a lot of tough actions have been taken. These are permanent actions and actions that will fundamentally change the underlying cost structuring and positioning of the company as we go forward into 2010 and 2011 and 2012. But a very difficult time period.</p>
          <p>And as I look at it today and talking to the board, it's pretty clear to me, in this last 18 months, we are fundamentally on change relative to the markets we serve around the world. The financial shock, the economic challenges we are facing here both in the United States and in the Western Europe, I fundamentally see the mature markets struggling for the next several years relative to generate the normal level of underlying investment growth. I think it's going to be a very challenging time period. However, I think the emerging markets will continue to grow and offer up very solid growth opportunities for companies like Emerson. And because of that, as we've been looking at our restructuring effort here, we have been making some fundamental changes that will truly impact this corporation for a long time.</p>
          <p>If you look back at, back in the 2001 time period, when we started the last downturn, we were about $15 billion company. We had about 15% of our sales in emerging markets. We had around 360 manufacturing places around the world, and 21% of our manufacturing located in best-cost locations.</p>
          <p>If you look as we come out of this in 2010 and where we're going to go in 2010, we're going to be, as I said, around the 21 billion level of, say, sales level. We will have over 33% of our sales in emerging markets. We will have 250 manufacturing locations and we'll have 36% of our manufacturing in best-cost locations.</p>
          <p>If you roll forward a couple of more years, I think you're going to find the company will be over 40% in emerging markets and over 40% in emerging markets or best-cost location for manufacturing. So you're seeing the footprint changing for Emerson to a very positive way from a cost structure standpoint and a growth standpoint.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at what's going on inside this company right now, it's not just trying to figure out, how to get through a recession, we are fundamentally trying to figure out how to reposition this company for strong growth with higher levels of profitability and higher levels of return and cash generation when the markets start growing again, which they will, as we all know. I don't think that's next week, but that it will start growing again.</p>
          <p>But, if you look at what's been done this year, to be able to generate within $25 million of our record-setting free cash flow last year with our sales down 4 billion and our operating profit down $900 million was a testament to some very strong efforts by our operating people. And it made our balance sheet so much stronger and allows us to go out and do the acquisitions and allows us to increase our dividend, again, working on that 54th year, not quite there, but we've got to work through this year. That is the execution by the operating team that I'm extremely proud of.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we reduced our inventory by over $500 million across this company. So, we had a goal to get down under 18 -- $1.8 billion of inventory by year-end and we did do that relative to our base company. So that's a tremendous accomplishment at the same time that we were able to protect our profitability at the gross profit line. Our GP margins were flat year-over-year even with all this restructuring and all this inventory reduction.</p>
          <p>The other key thing that we looked at is: are we investing in the future? It's one thing to sit here and say, okay, let's cut, cut, cut. Cutting will not create a long-term viable growing valuable company. And if you look at what we're investing in this year as a percent of sales, we increased our R&amp;D and we focused very much on a lot of major new product introductions which are now starting to roll out, which will be the building blocks of growth as we go forward in 2010 and 2011, which is the whole game plan. My fundamental belief is you gain your biggest chunk of the market share in an upturn in the first 18 to 24 months of an upturn.</p>
          <p>So fundamentally, I believe the company is extremely strong at this point in time. We have two extremely challenging quarters left as I talked about in August. We're ready for that, our cost structure is ready for that, our inventory is in line for that, and now we just need to continue to execute from day-to-day as this business goes forward.</p>
          <p>But as we move into 2010, the economics will continue to be struggling for us relative to the U.S. and to Europe, and we will see them turning around in the second half of the calendar year of 2010.</p>
          <p>I just came back from China and the economics there have continued to improve. Our business has continued to improve, so I again see China and I also see Asia growing for Emerson in 2010 as those key emerging markets have turned around and got the worst behind them.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, the company finished the year strong. We had committed to everyone on this phone that as we got our restructuring done in the first half and the second half of the year, the profitability will continue to improve. And even &#x2013; and that has come forward, as you see that fourth quarter and even the third quarter. But if you move into 2010, what you're going to see is we still believe our underlying sales will be down next year because of our fiscal year ending in September, not a calendar year, but it's a September, and so we have those two tough quarters ahead of us. Our profitability is in a situation we believe that will be flat or slightly down on the current business that we have today, and that is a tremendous accomplishment given what we're going to be seeing underlying sales again being down for the whole year.</p>
          <p>On a total basis, if you look at consolidated sales right now, we'll be &#x2013; our feeling is today we're going to be plus or minus 2% within the sales level that we currently see as we finish the fiscal year 2009. So, I like where we are right now. The battle is not over with. The global positioning of the company has continued and you're going to continue to see, as we move forward, that we will continue to add companies to our portfolio and we will now start moving into a position where, like we did in their last downturn, as we started coming out, we will sell some of our assets off as that marketplace comes forward.</p>
          <p>So, before I open up and turn it -- open up for questions, again, I want to thank all the operating people, the corporate people for the work they did this year, a lot of tough work. You do not go about restructuring the company to the tune of around $300 million and we did have over 20,000 people leave the corporation in the last 12 months. We closed 25 facilities.</p>
          <p>Before fiscal year 2010 is out, we will have another additional, say, another 10 facilities that we will impact and we will have &#x2013; continue our restructuring at the half level, about the half level we did this year. But we have not finished the job in this downturn relative to restructuring and getting the job behind us from the standpoint of making this company stronger and ready to grow again. Fundamentally, the foundation of the company will be rock solid and really strong relative to where we want to go as we move into the second half in 2010 when once again, we could see our top line growing like we have in the past.</p>
          <p>So with that, I want to open the lines and offer up the lines to answers and questions for the various people out there.</p>

          <p>Tough year, two days of tough board meetings and last week I was in China, week before that we had two days of planning conference. So I've talked a lot, Bob, let's put it that way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And you just said something I want to clarify. You said the profitability would be flat-to-down on the current business basis. I mean, exactly what did you mean talking about 2010 on that basis, I mean?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, forget Avocent, are you saying that op profit is going to be flat in 2010 before Avocent, is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said, it'd be flat or slightly down, yes, which would be a major accomplishment given our underlying sales will be down somewhere in that five to 7% next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's, Bob, as you well know, the restructuring, the actions we've been taking for the last 18 months are permanent actions. We are fundamentally changing the cost structure of this company. So we will be delivering pretty good levels of profitability even in underlying sales.</p>
          <p>The one thing Walter is pointing out to me is that in that assumption, we're assuming pension costs will be a little bit less than $50 million hit to us this year. And we did &#x2013; as you'll see in the proxy, we did this award in October, the next tranche &#x2013; the next four-year program for our performance share program, which is a long-term program, which will hit us about $100 million on a delta basis versus last year. So we're able to &#x2013; we're going to be able to hold our profitability even with those two headwinds coming at us.</p>

          <p>The -- okay. And just another couple of questions. I mean, what's going on out there with destocking, restocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not much going on right now with -- I would say, from the standpoint of the inventory levels, we still see a drifting down in total. If you think about the slope, Bob, it's less severe right now, it's flattening out. From our perspective, we got to where we wanted to get on our inventories by the end of the fiscal year. So we're pretty steady right now and I would say you'd probably see a little bit more decline of inventories the next two or three months as, based on the order pace we're seeing from our customers, but it's not a drastic number right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question from me. Like I say, our E&amp;C analyst is talking about some big projects coming to life around the world, some things that weren't even on the board are being put on the board. I mean are you starting to see any activity on that side, big projects that would benefit process any time soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are. I think the projects are being put forth and being bid on. I think you're starting to see some projects that have been shelved be reinvigorated and let's say rebid and relooked at. I don't see that's going to help us at all in 2010. I think that will be more of a 2011 type of benefit for us, Bob, because by the time they get out there and get going, it's going to be a while before they get underway.</p>

          <p>One final question, sorry. I mean, in Asia, you were quoted as saying the company will have down sales for the next couple of years, I guess you meant down '09 and '10; is that what you meant?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, she didn't understand me. I mean, the only thing she got right was that Emerson was spelled E M E R S O N. I mean, it's &#x2013; so, no, I did not say that. I said that I expected our underlying sales to be down in 2010 and that we'd start recovering in late 2010. I don't know where she got that from.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A question on Process. You accelerated the restructuring there recently. It seems to have paid some handsome dividends maybe a little faster than expected. Could you give us a little more color on how you see margins play out over the next few quarters just briefly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Process profitability will be down again next year, as we've said. On a quarter basis, you have to be very careful with Process. It's a function of mix of our System Solutions business and our product business and we had a very strong mix in that fourth quarter. I would expect Process, I think I've been saying all year long, to be down 12%. Next year underlying sales growth will be down 12%. And I would expect their margins to continue to slip down and operating profit level into that 16, 18% range next year. It's going to be &#x2013; it's going to slip back down again. I would say the next -- I mean, I don't have a forecast for the next six months, I just look at the total year, but I would expect them to really struggle in the first half. They had a record, record first quarter last year and they were up, I think 12 or 13% in sales in that first quarter. So I think that from my standpoint, I look at the operating profit margin, it's going to be in that 16 to 18% next year and I expect them be down 12% underlying.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, in terms of Climate, you mentioned, you talked about Chinese orders being pretty strong here, at least helping the overall order growth rate. And then just earlier you talked about growth in China for the first quarter from stimulus. How do you think the sustainability of the growth in China is going to play out over the next several quarters? And then, how do you think about American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and the benefits in the U.S.? It seems like you're not really seeing much now, how do you think that plays out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative to China, I fundamentally believe the economies have turned and you'll see for the next 12 to 18 months, a pretty good underlying growth in China, which will allow us to continue to see pretty good growth for our business for the next year. I don't think my management team is focusing and forecasting that yet, but I believe it's coming. I think it's &#x2013; given the infrastructure type of investments we're involved with, the environment is much better. I've been there like twice within the last 60 days, I think, or maybe 75 days and I've noticed a continuing positive trend. I don't see an issue there.</p>
          <p>Relative to North America U.S. stimulus, you have to understand from my first standpoint, it should never have been done. I think it's a waste. And from my standpoint, we are seeing slight benefits, but I don't think it's &#x2013; if I look at what's going on in Asia and I look at what's going on in the United States, there's two different approaches. One is to actually create long-term critical mass infrastructure wealth creators and one is transfer payments. And so, which one is going to win in the long-term? China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. Material costs for the early cycle businesses, climate, appliance. With steel moving up and some other commodities moving up, how concerned are you about that in terms of margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not concerned. I think what you're going to see here, fundamentally you're going to start seeing a shift going on &#x2013; we've had a pretty good price/cost relationship. It's been slightly green this year, it was a little bit less than 1% underlying price across the whole company. And net material inflation in line with that, but we're still slightly green.</p>
          <p>As I go into the first half of next year, we actually &#x2013; I think the commodities are such that we'll probably have a little bit of negative price, our net material inflation right now is actually negative, so we'll still be green. I think that will shift as you move into the second half of the year and what we're talking about internally at the company is, get ready because we're going to have to start raising prices a little bit. But net, net, next year I think we'll be close to zero to slightly, slightly negative on price. And our net material inflation will be slightly negative, so we'll be okay.</p>
          <p>There is not that strong of underlying demand out there yet. I mean, I know people keep thinking it is, but if you look at the actual results that people are reporting. It is yes, beating what people think. But the last time I looked at my underlying sales for the quarter, they were down 20%. I think they still are down 20%. And if I look at the next quarter my underlying sales, they are going to be down somewhere around 15%. That is not what I call strong demand.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's a possibility, Mike, it's a possibility, it's possible. But if I was to put &#x2013; a betting man, that would be a good bet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still &#x2013; we're still seeing some benefit there with a couple of customers here in North America for the people that &#x2013; what's he's asking is, there is a refrigerant change going on effective December 31 of 2008 going from R-22 to 410A. And it's not the same thing as the 10 SEER or the 13 SEER, Mike, because people do not want to have the refrigerant out there. There can be some pull-up and we're seeing &#x2013; it's more of a mix change for us. It will be at a higher price point, but we are still seeing some pull-up of product and prebuild for the older products. So we're seeing a little bit of both and I think it's still going to be a net net of positive for us. So that's -- when you ask me could they possibly be one that has the first positive, the answer is yes because of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...SEER standards. I imagine it's good for you as everybody migrates higher. But what does that do to your production capabilities and does it ultimately challenge you to deliver different product to different regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's going to be a big issue for us because we think it's going to go down to two probably major regions. It won't be more than two. I think it'll be two. And we can deal with that. I mean we have more than that today. So I think we can deal with that, I think my biggest concern with that whole transition is that it will negatively impact the underlying unit volume. The prices will be higher, but the underlying unit volume will be lower because the cost to the end market will be higher. And I think that will cause a little bit of repair business, which will be okay for us, but I think that will fundamentally &#x2013; could change the underlying volume of the market here in North America during that time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just looking to year end now, we've had a very tough year. I doubt anybody is going to want to be aggressive here in the final quarter in terms of production. If you look at HVAC specifically and then across your other major businesses, what are you hearing as far as shutdown schedules and holiday schedules at your marquee customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing yet. A little bit early. I anticipate &#x2013; I do anticipate that people will do some shutdown, Mike. But I think going back, I think it was Bob Cornell asking me about the inventories. I can't remember who exactly asked about the inventories. I think the inventory levels in most of our customers are in a very, very good shape. And so they have it pretty well mapped out at this point in time and they've already got their shutdowns built in. So I think based on the forecast I'm giving, underlying sales growth for that first quarter, we have that massed in and the wildcard will be will there be any demand, that people have gone too far and they need to bump the schedules back up. But I am not anticipating that it will get worse.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Dave. Your comments on your outlook for the first part of a recovery being the best point for share gain, looking at the Delta V process launch, next-gen and last cycle, you had some really good share gain. Is this more in the area of defending that prior share gain, people responding to that or how do you see the different areas really of opportunity in the first 18 months or so, I think you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think I look at across the business, what we fundamentally try to do and I think we talked about this in the last couple of conference call, maybe a year ago now is between the OCE and then also the businesses, we sat back last summer, in the July, August time periods. Okay, now what are the 25, 30 key projects that we -- and development efforts that we need to make sure we protect as we go into this downturn. And because what we want to do is launch those projects and there'll be a significant level of sales in the years, second half of 2010, 2011 and early 2012.</p>
          <p>And so we look at across the company, it's not just Process. So you will see a lot of different programs, which are very critical relative to say energy efficiency or other some kind of solution effort right now that's going on with the mega trends that will allow us to take advantage of when the customers also start spending money. So we spent a lot of time thinking through when the recovery comes, where's that money going to be spent first and do we have the right new technology and innovation to get that dollar. So we did that last time and it really helped us, I think, to outperform our competitors.</p>
          <p>And if you look at where our spending was this time, we're doing the same thing and our percent of new products went up in the last 12 months. Our E&amp;D as a percent went up. If you look at the spending on a global basis, it went up, because -- as we repositioned that. So I -- you're going to see it across the board. It really is the best time. The first 18 to 24 months of recovery to go after and gain that market share. It's not relative to -- it's not price. It's all about innovation and technology and new products and we have them, we don't have to wait.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And any comments on book-to-bill in general maybe Industrial Automation specifically and also some general thoughts on FX in the first quarter and for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The book-to-bill, I don't &#x2013; I mean from the standpoint, I don't think it's changing that much. I mean it's &#x2013; we have about a two or three month, I would say, lag from GFI to our shipments. And if you look at our orders right now, I think it's &#x2013; four of the segments are getting better. So from a trend line, they're getting better and one of them is pretty well stabilized. So our business is, I would say, as I told the board, I think our business is, yeah, we got a tough quarter coming ahead of us right here, but we've got the worst behind us from the standpoint of getting things.</p>
          <p>The question is how fast that will come back up and how sustainable will when it comes back up. All the GFI numbers are trending up. The leading indicators are trending up. But it -- when you get out into late 2010 and early 2011, you're not looking at very high levels of growth relative to the GDP or levels of GFI at this point in time and there's a lot of reasons for that. So, as I look at the first quarter, I think we're pretty well got it dialed in right now. And we're probably looking at a couple of points of currency benefits, wouldn't you say Walter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think if you look at the Industrial Automation, we're still going through the &#x2013; they had a record quarter relative to the alternator business in the fourth &#x2013; the fourth calendar or the first fiscal quarter last year. And that correction is still underway, as they try to &#x2013; as our customers still correct their channel and also their own inventories. And so I think Industrial Automation, if you look at the, just overall indicators both from Europe and the United States, where they're very strong and those marketplaces are not looking at much recovery yet, they're stabilized and then you've got the alternators driving it down, probably for the next two quarters and then you'll start seeing some improvement in the second half of the year in Industrial Automation. Both Process and Industrial Automation are still in the &#x2013; let me &#x2013; are in the later cycle and they're still going to &#x2013; still struggle for the next six months. And then you're going to see our climate technology, our tools and storage and you're going to see Network Power. That will be the fourth one coming back up. That will come in the middle of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, you probably know better than I do since you're looking at the numbers, I'm not. But -- so they were -- for the fourth quarter they did what, 7.7? Okay, they did 7.7%. I think we'll be &#x2013; yeah for the full year, yes. Yes.</p>

          <p>I think it will be tough in the first part of the year. The first quarter, we have -- our production plans are still down 30, 40%.

In total, I think we're pretty stable, but they in particular are still haven't finished their downturn.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First question I have is on restructuring spending. How are you thinking about that for 2010, what are your expectations, Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the last call, Lynne, remind me, that we said around 125 to 175. If I was going to use a modeling number, I would use 150.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as you think about pricing issues, particularly within Industrial Automation given the excess capacity that's still out there, how are you -- what are your expectations for pricing sort of stability in the environment over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I don't think price is a big issue. Everyone around the world is going through a major restructuring effort, some more than others, and I think we have done a significant amount of restructuring, as I talked about earlier. From a price pressure standpoint, I think we are in pretty good shape. I think you're going to start seeing commodities start picking back up and you'll see a little bit of inflation. It's not going to be very fast in 2010, maybe picking up as you go into 2011.</p>
          <p>So net, net I think our net material inflation will be negative next year because of what's going on with our businesses around the world, and as our shift away outside of the mature markets. And you will see a slight negative price, maybe zero to slightly negative versus this year we are close to one positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're not talking about big numbers. So there is not some price war going on out there, that's a fool's game.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just the last question on Asia. I know you talked about it longer term, but in the quarter as I look at trends for &#x2013; IA was down 27% in the fourth quarter, Network Power was down 8%. Is there something specifically going on in Asia in those businesses that we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, you guys around a quarter, I don't think there is not much going on. I actually thought that we would &#x2013; we'd actually turn positive in the fourth quarter underlying. We did turn GAAP underlying &#x2013; GAAP was positive, but you have &#x2013; we're starting to see some of the businesses come back and engaging in order and the inventory reductions there are going down. You're seeing India doing pretty well. We're seeing China coming back. I just think you're seeing the normal course of a start up, just like you're going to see in the United States where you have some pieces come back sooner than other pieces and I think that's what going on.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dave. I think this is the first time that you've laid out a strategy or a goal regarding your percent of revenues from emerging markets and you're already the lead among your peers. So and this is &#x2013; I can almost call this is your 40-40 club goal. So what's the timing and what is optimal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Within five years and what's optimal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>40% within five years. I know based on what I see &#x2013; if you think about what's going on globally right now, and you think about the mature markets, the U.S. and Western Europe, which are continuing to increase their debt loads and they're going to have a much more challenging time in trying to grow in these marketplaces because of the structural problems we're seeing in this country. You're going to see these emerging markets be the growth place and we are already very, very strong and what we've done with this last 18 months is strengthen that position.</p>
          <p>And so what I was telling you how much we have changed in the last 18 months, and in the next 12 months, we're going to make it even bigger. You're going to see this company go from, when I first started, running the company around 20% emerging market manufacturing, 20% emerging market sales. We're going to go up to 40, 42, 45 in the next five, six, seven years. It's where the market is going and we are a player and we do extremely well there, as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then within the two-day meeting that you've just been through on the strategy, what can you share with us in terms of key themes and what about &#x2013; how does the tone differ from where we were a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tone differs fundamentally is the fact that you heard me talk about emerging markets and one tone, clearly it must have been a key theme for me, and it was a key theme. I think the key tone to me is that the mature markets growth in the next five, six, seven years will be 100 to 150 basis points lower than we've seen for the last 10 years, as I look at those markets and I think the emerging markets are going to be a key level of growth. The opportunities are still there. The growth rate will be slightly less, but it'll be still strong enough to drive that percent change that I'm talking about.</p>
          <p>And you're going to continue to see a mixing change of our business as we take into &#x2013; from a technology and market space we got from an acquisition and we are going into the mode here in the next 12 to 18 months &#x2013; 24 months that we will start selling some assets off that we are in that period here where when things start recovering, we're going to do that. So you're going to see a little shifting going on here in the company, which is the theme that I talked with the Board about for the last two days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the higher priority, the acquisition side or divestiture side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have underway already in this fiscal year $1.4 billion of acquisitions. I think as I look at the rest of this fiscal year, we'd like to do another 500 or $600 million of acquisitions. So that's one thing and that's timing wise. And I would like to get a couple divestitures underway in this fiscal year &#x2013; closing towards the end of the fiscal year or hopefully in the mid &#x2013; towards the end or as we roll into 2011, somewhere around that time period. So that will be starting up. That's the timeline and that's the priorities.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the net inflation, price inflation for the year. Could you just talk about maybe what it was in the quarter? So price for the year was a percent. That means in the quarter it was probably a little less than 1%? And then what was the &#x2013; you mentioned in a few of the segments, materials management, what was that benefit in the quarter year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's much changed. I don't think there was much change in the price impact for the quarter versus the year. I think we're pretty much in line, I mean, from a net &#x2013; I mean, it's a little bit, it's slightly positive to flat for the quarter. So we've got more pricing upfront. So it's slightly flat to slightly positive for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the net impact?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net impact was positive. Slightly positive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how much of your &#x2013; - again can you quantify your raw &#x2013; what that inflation number corresponds to, so what's the size of your buy that you're talking about when you talk about materials inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't &#x2013; we won't do that. But we'll give you &#x2013; we'll talk a little bit more about this in February, but I won't quantify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly in the quarter, where &#x2013; which segments were above that 1% price, and we can figure out which ones were below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean from a net net standpoint, from a net positive for the whole year, I would say that the only one that was &#x2013; I don't look at it by segment all that much, but I would say the only one would be some of our network power guys were probably a little bit below that. I would say the industrial guys, the process guys were all slightly above it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't move around that much quarter-to-quarter. So I am looking at &#x2013; the Climate Technology guys, the Process guys were all slightly above Industrial guys. So I would say Network Power is slightly negative.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>One last question. When it comes to the Climate business next year, there is a little bit of buzz about perhaps some pent-up demand in the U.S. You tend to take more of a conservative approach than most out there when it comes to these HVAC stories. What's your sense as to that &#x2013; the degree of likelihood that there is some pent-up demand out there in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Every indicator tells me that you're going to see a strengthening as we move into the spring, Steve. But you know my opinion. I want to see the whites of the eyes of this recovery before I believe it. The North America HVAC marketplace has had three down years, That is a new record probably &#x2013; maybe since the Depression, maybe &#x2013; I don't know if we even had air conditioning in the Depression, but three down years. So I'd like to see the recovery, but every indicator tells me that we're going to see a second half &#x2013; spring &#x2013; when I talk about second-half, Emerson, that's spring type recovery there. So I would bet there is going to be one. The magnitude of it, I don't know, and I'm not a big pent-up demand guy at this point in time.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, John.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dave. I wanted to ask a question on different tack. If demand were to actually begin to come back much more quickly, first, are your factories positioned to handle that sort of a near-term ramp up? And secondly, what about the supply chain, I mean, less Emerson and more to do with your own suppliers, are you planning for that as a sort of scenario and sort of what could be kind of an outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; at this year's strategy session in September, each of the businesses, we went through that scenario that what happens given the significant restructuring and we had to get the restructuring done, and the plants repositioned, which we have in most cases. Can we handle a different upturn? And the answer is yes, we can. I think we can handle that from our own facility standpoint.</p>
          <p>And then quickly, what are your top 10 component supplier issues and -- because that will &#x2013; as you pointed out, John, will be the key issue for us. Our suppliers who also have cut way back, can they come back and recover? I think this is going to be &#x2013; we're in a period right now between now and the spring of 2010 that you as an operating company need to stay extremely close to what's going on from a customer standpoint and your production standpoint, and keep your antenna up as high as possible.</p>
          <p>We talked about that at the Board level today, or yesterday and the business leaders all gave them their assessment of this same situation because I would say right now that is our number, number one key issue, because we've got our operating levels to where we want to be right now. We've got our inventories where we want to be right now. Now let's see what happens when we have sudden surges, because you will have in the early stages, John, as you well know, early stages you'll have some sudden surges in things and you have to be able to react. I think we can, the key thing is our suppliers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud, I mean, what's characterized this recession was the liquidity crisis and presumably a lot of the smaller suppliers may still be having financing issues. Have you been...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've gone through that process. Our Board requested and we've done that and we keep a very close monitor on that because we were concerned about that very issue. We are in pretty good shape. We have multiple suppliers and our suppliers liquidity-wise are in pretty good shape. We've been doing a lot of testing on that to make sure of the case. I'm more worried about &#x2013; what I'm worried about from my supplier standpoint is: have they taken their capacity down too rapidly and not able to come back up within the weeks that we need them to come back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your factory is presumably --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're in pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your factories presumably, you could un-furlough some of those workers or do some other things if in fact you needed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got Walter, we've got Lynne, you got me, and Ed Monser, a couple of other people we can throw in there. You know, we're pretty productive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm pretty busy, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't mention your name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I know. Thanks. Okay. So another question here. As you see your mix increasingly shifting to emerging markets, Dave, you mentioned the targets over the next few years, what are your thoughts towards possibly either creating or carving out a platform that may be more sort of emerging market specific or are you, let's just say, ex appliances, are you happy with the existing four as you've sort of had this big anchor into the Western countries transcending into the emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see &#x2013; you're not going to see a platform change relative to just pure emerging markets. I think what our platform structure is going to be is we're going to move to or transition towards here in the next several years, in five years, six years, is that you're going to have three or four global type of platforms with a very strong emerging market presence in those three or four global platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last, which of the businesses do you think you've taken or could still take the most amount of market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have opportunity &#x2013; I don't think there is any one business that's unique in that regard. I think we have &#x2013; we don't have 100% of the market anywhere. So we've got plenty of room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but the last cycle you took a ton of share in Process. Is there any one business that's positioned to sort of benefit similarly kind of on a somewhat unique basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think all the major businesses are pretty unique including Process. I think we are staging ourselves for a nice run here when we come back out from a lot of technology innovations that's coming into the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the strong cash generation this year, the low pension funding requirements next year etcetera, I mean, how do you think about share buyback at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we look at what we have going on right now, where we've already committed $1.4 billion in acquisitions and we're talking about another five or $600 million, our share buyback next year will be less than $100 million at this point in time. So it will be a small number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in IA, Industrial Automation, the margins ex the restructuring were actually quite high, 10% plus it looks like. Is that &#x2013; is there anything unique in the quarter that explains that margin strength or should we look at that as sort of a basis for going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The underlying margin of that business historically is a solid double-digit margin. That's a very &#x2013; if you look at the competitors around the world, if you look at all of us, it's a fairly stable business from a standpoint of profitability and then when you go through a dramatic downturn like we have here with huge inventory liquidation and things like that, you see &#x2013; and restructurings, you see the margins get hit so &#x2013; but historically you're looking at a 12, 13, 14, 15, 16% type of EBIT margins with this company. So 10% in the quarter is not unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess I'm just looking Q3 to Q4 on relatively flat sales ex-restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The restructuring, the benefits that we got -- I mean, we've spent a lot of money restructuring, the benefits start flowing through. We've got the inventory. From a Delta standpoint, it's still dropping, but it's coming back in line, so that reduction, that will slow down a little bit. So the restructuring has been helping. But things are starting to get in place for everything we've been working on for last 12 months there. That's not unusual. That's why we do the things we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For modeling purposes, you've said that restructuring gets cut in half, Dave, but does it stay high in the first half and trail off and how are we going to model that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would model front-end loaded. I'd model &#x2013; we're going to be probably pretty high in the first two quarters. I mean it's hard &#x2013; I'm not an expert. Even I and &#x2013; I run Emerson. It's hard for me to get that close by quarter, but I would say if you model that we're more upfront and I'd put more in the first than I'd put in the second. What do you think, Walt?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two guys here. We've probably got 60 some odd years with the company. So that's what we'd do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's what I had. Now, you haven't talked about Avocent. I mean, for our modeling purposes there, assuming that we hit Jan 1, I mean, what sort of sales should we &#x2013; when you're thinking about OP, I mean, what sort of &#x2013; how do we get to the $0.10, $0.11 dilution we're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't really want to talk about that until we get the deal closed. I mean we don't own this company. But we're talking about approximately $400 million for nine months. That's what we said in sales. And it's a reasonably profitable business and so I'm not going to give anything more than what I said before. So I mean, you can look at the transcript from the last time, but that's &#x2013; we'll talk about it in February. Good try.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I apologize it's so late in the afternoon. But we had a long board session today. And I appreciate your support this year. It's been a very difficult year. Again what I'm really pleased about is, as we've done the aggressive restructuring starting in the middle of 2008 and going all the way to where we are right now, the operation boys have got this done, both from a restructuring standpoint, now the cash standpoint, the balance sheet standpoint. So we're in a very good shape.</p>
          <p>We know we have six more challenging months here, but from my perspective, as I look at that next six months from where I was looking six months ago, I'm in a lot stronger position, and I am much happier about where we are. So I'm looking forward to growth as we come into the second half of 2010, and I'm looking forward to once having some positive things to talk about with our shareholders on the phone. And I want to thank you for all your support. And I hope you're happy we did give you another dividend. We're not a company that cut the dividend this year. Amen.</p>
