          <p>Good day and welcome to the Presentation Results Merck KGaA Q3 2009 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Michael Becker. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our third quarter results conference call.</p>
          <p>Before I begin my short overview, I would like to introduce Markus Launer, our new Head of Investor Relations. Some of you may know him from his stint at SGL Carbon and Altana. He will be heard at the end of the introduction and in future, of course, also at the start. With us today on the call are Elmar Schnee, Head of Pharmaceuticals, and Bernd Reckmann, Head of Chemicals.</p>
          <p>I'll begin with Slide Number Six where you can see that total revenues rose by 2.7% compared to the year ago quarter. By and large, our diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals and chemicals helped us to cope sales-wise rather well with the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>However, our core operating result, as well as all other profit lines, shrank by around one-third from last year for reasons only partly related to the economy. There are three factors that caused this gap between sales and result performance.</p>
          <p>Factor number one, selling and research and development costs increased by nine and 17%, respectively. These are investments into the future mainly by our Merck Serono division, but no relation to the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Factor number two, the margin at Liquid Crystals has declined to 34% from 47% in Q3 of 2008. This is clearly downturn-related, as Bernd Reckmann will explain later on.</p>
          <p>Factor number three, our semi-trapped cash in Venezuela is threatened by a massive devaluation as this country has seen three years of inflation in excess of 20% with no foreign exchange correction whatsoever. Therefore, we have built a provision of &#x20AC;52 million into our operating expenses to protect ourselves for this devaluation.</p>
          <p>On this occasion I would like to mention the very serious situation of our hospital business in Greece where our receivables have surpassed &#x20AC;50 million because of non-payment. It is very likely that we will build a reserve for these overdues in Q4.</p>
          <p>The good news from the P&amp;L stems from administration costs, which are down 6% and the tax rate, which is 22% after 26% previous year. For the administration costs, you have to refer to Page 29 of the appendix, by the way.</p>
          <p>The really good news is the free cash flow, as detailed on Slide Nine. The free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments reached &#x20AC;430 million, an increase of &#x20AC;201 million. This development is due to good working capital management and almost no tax payments in the third quarter. This way the weaker profit was more than offset. The acquisition of the Chinese pigment supplier Taizhu and the sale of generic businesses are behind the adjustment for our free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments.</p>
          <p>Key balance sheet data for the Group are on Slide 10. Comparing the figures to December 31, 2008, the main difference is the &#x20AC;750 million bond. You find the effect in cash and financial debt. &#x20AC;207 million out of the total pension provisions of &#x20AC;1.25 billion are now covered by financial assets. The progress of this coverage will be shown on a quarterly basis in a separate line because we want to be held accountable what we do with this linked financial asset.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt on the face of it were &#x20AC;441 million versus &#x20AC;477 million at the end of last year. Excluding the pension funding, net financial debt would only be &#x20AC;234 million, confirming the strengthening of our financial position.</p>
          <p>This concludes my financial introduction and now Elmar will take over to give you some more insight into the third quarter's developments in the Pharmaceutical business.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let's now start with the key financials for Merck Serono on Slide 11.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono continues to substantially contribute to the results of the Group. We posted a 6% revenue increase compared with the year ago quarter. Sales growth of 7% was mainly driven by the ongoing double-digit sales increases of our leading products Rebif and Erbitux. Royalty income was down 10% versus last year, but increased compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that the quarters might show fluctuations due to the booking of the royalties that are based on estimated sales. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that royalty income is based on the existing patents, which expire at different times. Therefore, we expect the royalty income to fade slowly in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Total marketing and selling expenses went up by 10%, but would only be 8% excluding commission and royalty expenses. In order to increase the transparency of the various cost items, we have added the line item commission and royalty expenses. The 17% jump in commission and royalty expenses is due to higher sales of Rebif in the U.S. and Erbitux in Japan, that is we had to pay more to our co-promotion partners Pfizer and BMS, respectively.</p>
          <p>As for the previous quarter, our R&amp;D spending exceeded our target figure of 20% of revenues due to the high number of late-stage clinical trials. It will be also the case for the full year and also for next year. &#x20AC;45 million out of the &#x20AC;52 million provision mentioned by Michael earlier related to the potential Venezuelan currency risk now booked by Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>The core operating results declined by 16% to &#x20AC;2,069 million compared to the year ago quarter. Free cash flow before acquisition and divestiture, however, jumped by 56% to &#x20AC;330 million due to improved working capital management and the baseline effect from a change in financing structure in Italy in the last year's quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's talk now about our main products to be found on Slides 12 to 14. Rebif continued its strong growth and reported a 13% sales growth for the third quarter compared to last year. The 27% growth in U.S. sales was similar to last quarter, driven by price increases and volume growth, as well as favorable currency. In Europe, Rebif grew 6% driven by unit growth.</p>
          <p>We launched the first electronic device in multiple sclerosis, RebiSmart, in July. Results of a 12-week RebiSmart user trial showed a broad patient acceptance. These results were presented at ECTRIMS, the Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis in September. So far this Rebif lifecycle management strategy has been a success, as sales of Rebif have accelerated in most of the countries where RebiSmart has been launched.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we presented further results of the complete Phase IIIb IMPROVE study at ECTRIMS. The study showed that the decrease in the number of brain lesions seen early in patients treated with the new formulation of Rebif was sustained over the 40-week period of the trial. The study also confirmed the safety profile of Rebif.</p>
          <p>We submitted the marketing application for Cladribine Tablets to the EMEA in July and to the U.S. FDA in September. As a reminder, Cladribine Tablets were granted fast track designation by the FDA, which is a process that is designed to expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and still have unmet need. Additionally, Cladribine Tablets are potentially eligible for a priority review by the FDA and we continue to believe that given the agency's definition that this is possible for Cladribine.</p>
          <p>Based on these timelines, the launch of Cladribine Tablets could be feasible as early in the second quarter of 2010 in the U.S. and we are preparing accordingly. Recall that the regulatory submissions are backed by the positive results of our CLARITY Phase III trial.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to oncology, starting with Erbitux performance in the third quarter. Erbitux grew 33% versus last year's third quarter, boosted by strong sales in Japan and continued its sequential growth quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now comment on the most recent development regarding Erbitux. We appealed the CHMP negative opinion for the use of Erbitux in treatment of lung cancer. It is a regional negative decision, both completely unexpected by both us and the key opinion leaders, as we pointed out at our last conference call in July.</p>
          <p>The results of our FLEX study clearly demonstrate clinical benefits to patients. Subsequently, we filed with <mark type="inaudible" />. We expect to receive CHMP final opinion by the end of the year or at the beginning of next year at the latest.</p>
          <p>We also presented additional data from our CRYSTAL and OPUS trials at ESMO, the Congress of European Society for Medical Oncology, in September. Recall that these trials investigated the use of chemotherapy and Erbitux as a first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>Impressively, the updated analysis of CRYSTAL showed a significant improvement in survival of 3.5 months. On the other hand, we also had to deal with the contradictory results from COIN study that was conducted by the British Medical Research Center. The data of COIN did not meet the primary endpoint of showing a survival benefit and failed to show a progression-free survival improvement.</p>
          <p>As COIN is not Merck's own, we have only limited access to the data. Nevertheless, we remain confident that Erbitux confers significant benefit on to patients and we continue to investigate the potential reasons for why the trial failed. For example, current opinion among thought leaders is that the COIN study showed significant imbalances in certain aspects and might be typical for the treatment situation in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution. Despite this, we still consider Erbitux to have blockbuster potential and that given the encouraging dataset, further robust growth is left in its approved indications.</p>
          <p>Our fertility product Gonal-f posted almost 2% growth for the third quarter, while the whole business growing 7%. The Japanese health authorities approved a new indication for Gonal-f in July. Gonal-f, which was previously indicated for male infertility, is now also indicated for female infertility in Japan.</p>
          <p>We decided to voluntarily discontinue the Phase II studies in the multiple sclerosis atacicept program after observing an increase in MS disease activity in the atacicept treatment arm compared to the placebo arm. However, the status in SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis are ongoing.</p>
          <p>We still have to analyze the final results of our atacicept RA trial in order to evaluate the next steps of the clinical program. Study data will be announced in appropriate Rheumatology Congress in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving up to Slide 17, we present the best quarter ever for the Consumer Health Care division. Despite a strong negative currency effect, total revenues grew by 11% to a record of &#x20AC;123 million driven by a reduced inventory level in Mexico back to normal levels.</p>
          <p>The organic growth was almost 13% compared to a flat growth in the previous quarter. The provision of &#x20AC;5.8 million due to the potential currency losses on receivables in Venezuela was mostly offset by income related to licensees.</p>
          <p>The plan to focus on strategic brands is now paying off. Compared to revenue growth, margins and operating results grew disproportionately due to improved product margins. The operating results jumped by 55% to a record of &#x20AC;21 million.</p>
          <p>This is all from my end. I would now like to hand over the call to Bernd, who will give you some more details on the Chemicals business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elmar, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The key financial data of Liquid Crystals are to be found on Slide 19.</p>
          <p>The recovery of our Liquid Crystal business continued on a sequential quarterly basis, although results are still below last's quarter. Revenues continued to climb since the loss at the beginning of the year, along with the overall recovery in the global LCD panel industry and the increased share of the new PS-VA technology offered exclusively by Merck.</p>
          <p>Revenues of &#x20AC;211 million were 12% below the very high &#x20AC;239 million of last year, but increased sequentially with improved volumes. This was partially offset by continual ongoing pricing pressure and idle capacities, which affected the operating result of &#x20AC;72 million for the third quarter. This is 36% below last year's quarter, but again, was an improvement quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Return on sales improved accordingly to 34% compared to 27% for the second and 10% for the first quarter of this year. This was also reflected in the free cash flow of &#x20AC;101 million, which is below last year, but an improvement compared to the first two quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>The sequential improvement of this LC business is shown on Slide 20. The LCD industry faced tough market conditions in the beginning of 2009, resulting in huge panel price decreases and price pressure throughout the supply chain. According to one of the leading market research institutes, the global LCD TV market sales are expected to rise for the full year 2009 and for 2010 to be mainly driven by strong sales in China.</p>
          <p>In addition, the industry continues to be driven by innovations, such as the PS-VA technology, but also by further improvement in the standard VA, IPS and TN technologies. For example, reduced power consumption and decreased switching times.</p>
          <p>We expect increasing penetration of our PS-VA technology to partly offset ongoing price pressure. Merck significantly contributed in developing today's LC mixture and technologies and we continue to pioneer new LC materials and technologies and to further invest in research and development, as well as in production processes.</p>
          <p>On Slide 21 you will find the key financials of Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals. Total revenues of &#x20AC;297 million were 2% below last year, but improved sequentially due to the slight recovery of the pigment business.</p>
          <p>The Laboratory and Life Science businesses remained flat. The operating result, however, fell by 44% to &#x20AC;21 million compared to &#x20AC;37 million in the year ago quarter mainly due to the idle capacities and missing pigment sales. Thus the return on sales was 7% compared to 12% of the previous year. Free cash flow before acquisition and divestment more than doubled to &#x20AC;60 million as a result of effective working capital management.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, we acquired Suzhou Taizhu Technology development, one of the leading Chinese effect pigment suppliers in September. With Taizhu, we strengthened our pigment business and we get market access to China, one of the most dynamic markets. Taizhu's product portfolio is complementary to our existing products. We paid &#x20AC;19 million from the total price of &#x20AC;28 million to the company will be consolidated in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass on to Michael who will comment on the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this outlook concludes our introduction and based on the nine month result and our expectations for the rest of the year, we have refined our guidance given in July. We are now guiding round about figures instead of a corridor.</p>
          <p>The new guidance numbers are all in the guidance corridor, which we provided in July, though. We expect Merck Serono's revenue to grow by 6% at a core return on sales of 20%. That is now at the low end of our prior guidance.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono's ROS is affected by higher R&amp;D, as well as higher marketing and selling spend and the provisions booked for potential currency losses in Venezuela and maybe the already mentioned protection against the Greece receivable situation.</p>
          <p>We anticipate a 5% revenue growth at Consumer Health within an ROS of 9%. For Liquid Crystals, our revenues are now minus 20% and the ROS is 30%. Despite the revenue decrease of performance at Life Science Chemicals in nine months of the year, we are confident we can deliver unchanged revenues with an ROS of 7%. For the whole group we expect to achieve a revenue growth of 2% and a core return on sales of 17%.</p>
          <p>Many thanks for your attention. I'll now hand back to Markus who has to make an important announcement.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen and thank you. If I could ask a couple of questions regarding the Pharma division. Firstly, you clearly highlighted the Venezuelan currency issue in Q3, but if I look at that quarterly progression of SG&amp;A, it looks very normal even though there should be an unusual, maybe a 50 million charge in there. Can you let us know whether there was any positive gain in the quarter that allowed you to offset the Venezuelan charge or whether SG&amp;A as a percent of sales underlying at a level closer to 36% is a more realistic level going forward? It certainly seems very low.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you've highlighted the Greek issue around receivables and, of course, that raises the concern that in a number of your markets you're obviously selling drug and then failing to collect the cash going forward. Can you just highlight how much Greece is as a percent of your total Parma revenue and similarly how much Latin America is as a percent of your total Parma revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the provision for Venezuela, as you quite rightly observed, in other income and expenses, and this line is a very volatile line and sometimes it's balanced like this time and sometimes it's not. If we have a stable development for last year, then this means that we have to consider last year and this year and we have a couple of balancing factors of the positive side that we didn't have last year and we had also high charges in last year. So it is not that we will have a target for SG&amp;A. We have targets for sales costs and targets for administration costs, but not for the volatile other operating expenses. As far as Greece is concerned and the question why we are in the business of giving away sales without any return, it's not as easy as that. Firstly, Greek hospitals in the past have always paid their debts.</p>
          <p>This is not conventional of bad and doubtful debt. This is a government that withholds payments from their government institutions. The same goes for Venezuela. Venezuela in the past has always paid their debt. However, it has been forthcoming only with little sums during the trough of the oil prices and we are not sure when the payment will resume and we are protecting ourselves against a currency effect. Currency fluctuations are always a thing of daily business and I think we would be the only company to discontinue business because there's a currency risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have one follow-up just to clarify the Venezuelan charge, is your total receivable in Venezuela, which you have decided you may not be able to repatriate back to Germany or that is a percentage of what you think the devaluation of the bolivar may represent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a percentage of the &#x2013; it is the devaluation of the bolivar that we expect and is a 50 percentage of the whole amount that Venezuela is due to various companies within the Group. We don't assume at the time that we don't get any money out of Venezuela. We expect that we get the full amount out of Venezuela, but we are afraid that devaluation after three years of high inflation and no currency adjustment whatsoever there will be a devaluation, which we find very difficult to protect ourselves against, other than with an internal provision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on clarification of the guidance, I think the guidance for Merck Serono is implying that margins fall to on an operating basis to about 15% in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering whether you could discuss what are the drivers for that particularly low margin will be? And then also a clarification on the LC, Liquid Crystals division guidance, it didn't seem to quite make sense in terms of &#x2013; it seems to be implying a decline in revenues in the fourth quarter, but the operating profits remain stable on Q3. I'm just wondering if you could clarify that? And then finally just a question on Erbitux and your experience in the field, I'm just wondering whether there's as been any negative impact from the COIN data? I'm wondering whether it's making physicians more concerned about combining Erbitux with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with the guidance and it is quite clear that the guidance for the full year in the third quarter also includes the guidance for the fourth quarter, like the guidance for the second half is the same as the full year applying the second half guidance. And we are quite frankly not in the business to double-check your calculation for the guidance that is applied for the first quarter. So you are probably right with your calculation. I'm sorry that you find our guidance unconvincing, but that's what we think it's going to be. I'll give you some justification. The last quarter always has a December included, which usually in Pharmaceutical has a slower sales development. We have said that we continue the Greek and Venezuelan business, that means that we will have additional charges for the Venezuelan currency risk and if it happens in that quarter, and that we will start to protect ourselves against the Greece threat.</p>
          <p>We always have to be mindful that there might be high costs in December. December is always a high-cost month, which we try to anticipate via accruals, but we have to be careful and R&amp;D costs, as well as marketing costs can be exceptionally high in December. If you look at previous years, you will find that especially at Merck Serono the last quarter has always been a pretty low quarter. And Liquid Crystals, we expect indeed a very good profit last quarter. We are unaffected by capacity underutilization and special measures to correct our inventories and therefore we think we will have a peak of ROS for last time probably and the sales are reflecting the post-Christmas ordering of liquid crystals. So I think we have given it a lot of thought and our guidance history may increase your confidence that we are right after all, if not, let's wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the COIN study, so far we cannot detect any hesitation of the physicians based on the unfortunate COIN results. The fact is that if you look at OPUS where we had also the platinum-based therapies included, there were very solid numbers coming out. Even the MIS analysis, which use FOLFIRI and FOLFOX together, very solid results with reduction of one-third of disease progression, the risk offset reduced by 19%, the habit ratio well below 80%. So I think the COIN is not a big issue.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, thank you. Just two quick questions, please and sorry to come back to this issue, I just want to get it right, can you please confirm that you will include about &#x20AC;50 million of provisions for the Greek receivables in the fourth quarter? And secondly, can you come back to the issue of the cost of sales increase in the third quarter? They were about 11% higher. I understand that year-over-year it might be due to a base effect in the third quarter of '08, but maybe if you can explain that a little bit? Thank you.</p>

          <p>According to the Greece precaution in the fourth quarter, I did &#x2013; I'm not quite sure whether you said 50 or 15? I suspect you said 50, so 50 is the total amount of our Greek receivables, and we will be nowhere near, because we will get the receivables in the end. The question is whether we expect that this final settlement will be connected with another discount as it has been in the past or whether we should reflect the long outstanding of these debt in some sort of valuation adjustment.</p>
          <p>So 50 is way out. 50 at the moment is the total amount of hospital receivables in Greece and the adjustment will be considerably below that, will be not one quarter of that. I'm not sure what it will be, but it's totally unrealistic to assume that we will write off the whole receivables.</p>
          <p>As to the cost of goods question, the cost of goods has always been seen in relation to sales. If we sell more quantities, then cost of goods go up. If the prices go down on contrary, the sales go not up accordingly. This is the effect in Liquid Crystals where, as we have stressed throughout the year, we are under enormous price pressure from our customers, which had exacerbated by the behavior of our competition which has made big price concessions. In addition, we have standstill, had a standstill in August. We had a holiday because we wanted to manage our inventory situation, which increases cost of goods as there are always some influences from product mix, some positive, some negative. There have been also some positive, I hasten to add, mainly in the Consumer Health Care area, but on the Life Science &#x2013; Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals there have also been underutilization of capacity and that explains the relatively high cost of sales in relation to our sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, gentlemen. I just wanted to ask with regards to the guidance and not wanting to belabor the point, but Merck Serono, can you just indicate perhaps what kind of R&amp;D spend you're expecting as a percentage of revenues for the full year and more importantly, how do you anticipate that progressing in 2010? Should we anticipate growth on '09 or do you anticipate a flat R&amp;D spend relative to last year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you also just perhaps explain the implied fourth quarter margin for Consumer Health Care given such strong performance in the third quarter, why you're expecting it to deteriorate in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then if I could also ask with regards to Erbitux if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit more on the label that you have resubmitted for in the non-small cell lung cancer indication? And then if you could just also confirm the timelines because I believe the EMEA has quite specific timelines, the time in terms of when you have to appeal, which is after 15 days and then you have to submit information within 60 days and they have to respond by a further 60 days, which would put a response due by the end of November rather than why it might fall into the first quarter as per your comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the R&amp;D costs, of course, everything depends on the opportunities which we have in the portfolio and currently we have some great opportunities as we have 11 Phase III trials. Now I will remind that it will exceed 20% in the fourth quarter and we will for the whole year somewhere be at 22, 23%. And I said already in my introduction to what Merck Serono, I expect also a similar number for 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux, the label, well, we are in negotiations and discussions with EMEA, so of course, one thing is clear, we cannot go back and ask the whole indication because that's done and we have to get better, better numbers and we had many possibilities to cut the data in different indications. I would not like to discuss it now in public because this is also competitive information.</p>
          <p>Regarding the timelines, in theory you're right, what we have also seen in the past that EMEA on appeal does not keep to its timelines, so there is a chance that we might get a response in November. So we certainly filed in time and requested our appeal, but there might also be a possibility that before Christmas they will not treat this and it goes into the next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A few questions. The first on Erbitux and lung again. Those at the Zenasco this year would have been I think amazed by the flex data and how important skin rash was in determining the outcome for patients, more important perhaps than KRAS in colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>Now you've never really looked that whether this is prognostic or predictive. Do you think the current discussion with the EMEA could force the issue? And if it did, do you think that would be good or bad for you?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you just update us on the timeline for adjuvant colorectal cancer? When &#x2013; wherever you may see results there for Erbitux?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the skin rash, you're right. The patients who had a skin rash within two months had actually quite some fabulous results. Unfortunately, there is no test for skin rash up front. And you can see that it may be a predictor of efficacy, but then there are also some patients who didn't have skin rash but had the benefit also.</p>
          <p>So it's not clear cut, and currently in the current environment, I cannot see how a regulatory agency could move on this, apart from maybe giving recommendations that you might not have the skin rash, you might increase the dose, and then after a certain time, you might try something else. So I'm not sure how this works. I'm not sure it's more important than KRAS, because KRAS is a predictive measure, a biomarker, which you can test for and then actually give the treatment accordingly, where in lung you cannot.</p>
          <p>Regarding the adjuvant trial, we expect results roughly in 2012. And hopefully, being positive, it may be the last &#x2013; one of the last ones standing. That would be great news for Erbitux.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Just a question on Erbitux and colorectal cancer. When do you expect to be able to get the overall survival data from Crystal onto the label? And also, will there be any sort of requirement to discuss the COIN data, considering it wasn't a regulatory study on the advanced chemotherapy?</p>
          <p>And following on from COIN and to address part of the question asked before, what is the percent of use of Siloda in wider Europe, up in the U.K.? It does appear that Erbitux having a <mark type="inaudible" /> in particular in the chemotherapy.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, from the presentation of the data at ESMO, we saw that there's a possibility of a &#x2013; maybe another group within the main group of CRYSTAL, possibly the BRAF wild-type patients, that may be getting an extra benefit along with KRAS wild-type. But will we be getting any analysis on BRAF, and when may that be?</p>
          <p>And just a last question on Cladribine, I think it's been asked before, just I apologize if it's been answered. But any updates on the patent situation in the U.S. on Cladribine? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start from the back. Cladribine, our confidence increases regarding the patents, but no further information until the patents are in direct book.</p>
          <p>Regarding ESMO and BRAF, I do not see an announcement. I would classify BRAF as scientifically interesting, clinically irrelevant.</p>
          <p>Regarding Siloda, I personally think that Siloda has interaction with Erbitux, so the Erbitux with Siloda, which might be a reason for the COIN result. Because in COIN there was lot of</p>
          <p>Siloda, and Roche is remarkably quiet about our current negative results. The interpretation I'll leave to you. I'm not aware about how much Siloda is used in Europe, but it's certainly increasing its turnover.</p>
          <p>And the last thing was the label about what reference?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In Europe as soon as you have published results, the sales force can use this information and detail the doctor, which is not as you have it in U.S., where you have to get it in on the label. So we have some more time to get it on the label. We will certainly -- in the next update &#x2013; regular update -- we will file for this, but for promotional purpose, it's not needed to have it on the label.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Three questions, please. Firstly, on Page 12 of your presentation, you refer to strong penetration for Erbitux in the front line setting. I assume that means you've managed to capture market share and duration of treatments by indication. If you could share with us, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Number two, on the initiation of your breast cancer trial with Stimuvax, which was announced last quarter, where you have a 900-patient trial, which I imagine is not an expensive trial to run. Could you share with us any Phase I or Phase II data in breast cancer, which is giving you confidence in making this investment?</p>
          <p>And then number three, previously you had highlighted the willingness to build out your chemical business through M&amp;A. Given the recent trough in valuations pre-recovery, I was surprised that we hadn't seen anything. Could you just share with us whether it's valuation or whether it's opportunity that has limited your actions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A strong penetration, which we mentioned on Page 12 shortly, in head and neck, where we are by ourselves with our results for Erbitux, because there was nothing for several decades.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It said in colorectal in the bullet points underneath?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It said in colorectal, some penetration in metastatic colorectal <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In colorectal, of course, new results, which were published, help us. We have also the REFLEX stability story, which no other drug can claim, which drives sales into first line. And then do not forget, to replace a patient lost in third line, we need 16 weeks to get an additional benefit, because we have roughly 16 weeks treatment in average in third line, where you have 24, 26 in first line.</p>
          <p>So that took some time. But as you can see, we increased quarter-on-quarter, which means we penetrated into this market. And I believe that the data, which has been shown at ESMO, where we have a 3.5 months survival benefit, there is no other drug who can claim this frankly, because Avastin did not have these results, which would further actually help us to penetrate into the first line sector.</p>
          <p>Though I have to maybe take the opportunity to make one statement about treatment duration. In our plans and in the guidelines, the treatment duration first line is actually given 28 to 32 weeks. What we do see in the market is that &#x2013; is treatment duration is declining. And you see today advancing to the tune of 22 to 24 weeks, which obviously also decelerates the penetration in volume terms into this market.</p>
          <p>Regarding the STRIDE trial, which is the new breast cancer trial, number one, we had obviously brilliant results in non-small lung cancer. Number two, we had in earlier development another compound, which went also lung one. And in there, we had already collected some experience in Phase I with breast. And because the treatment is so benign from a scientific profile, using the immunotherapy of our body, we convinced easily, as witnessed by the Phase III results, the Sulu authorities that we can go into the treatment. It just reflects our confidence in Stimuvax. And the breast market is a market which is in dire need of better treatments.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You did ask for the M&amp;A activities in chemicals. Yes, we still consider M&amp;A activity as one would for further growth in our chemical business.</p>
          <p>You have seen one result already in the last quarter, which was the acquisition of the effect treatment business in China, one of the leading suppliers there, the title company. There was also a very small indicator of another exhibition, which you see in Bangalore Genei business in India, which is a genomic bioscience tool company.

And then secondly, just thinking about the improvement in profitability at Liquid Crystals, could you give us some idea of the sequential benefit of currency on both sales and the gross margin for the third quarter compared to Q2? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, tax rate, I referred to an earlier estimation that we made way back in 2006 and '07 where we said that it would be nice if the blended tax rate between Merck and Serono would be around 24%. And I think this expectation still holds for the fourth quarter &#x2013; for the whole year of 2009 and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And Liquid Crystals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the profitability of Liquid Crystals, we have a little bit more relaxed currency situation than last year. There was some small element of currency exchange based growth in the figures as well as in the results and the profitability. But the main recovery which you'll see in the Liquid Crystal business is based on the increasing demand on the reduced idle capacity situation as well as on the penetration of our new innovative products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So sequentially the contribution of currency wasn't significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it wasn't insignificant. It wasn't as huge as it used to be. I think we have a minus 5% currency effect in the turnover, but we have hedged most of the turnover and there is balancing factor as Bernd Reckmann said in the results statement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. If I may come back to your guidance on Liquid Crystals, and I apologize if I just did not understand when you were saying early too about the question. You're now guiding for sales down or, yeah revenues down 20% for 2009. That to me given your &#x2013; the results you've had in the first lineup of this year implies that you're expecting revenues to decrease again in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Can you please explain your reasoning behind that, if that has anything to do with the pricing pressure you're seeing or if you're also worried about volumes?</p>
          <p>And question number two is, if I look on Page 14 of your presentation, you list the Erbitux sales there from Q3 2008 until Q3 2009. That quite clearly looks as if growth is slowing down for Erbitux. Now outside, non-small cell lung cancer, where do you see further growth coming from for Erbitux going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the good news is that we could really let's say limit our former corridor from minus 30 to minus 20 to the roundabout figure of minus 20 for Liquid Crystals, which shows the upstream into the market. If you look back into last year, if you look back in the years &#x2013; in the previous years, you always will see that quarter four, and in most of the cases, also the quarter one of the following year, is a little bit softer because of the sizing effect, most of the orders have been fulfilled in the quarter three, which serves the Christmas business. And then there is definitely, greatest from the first weeks of October, there is a slight decrease in the activity in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux, it looks like it slows down, but let me give you a few reasons why this looks like. Number one, we had price decreases in several countries, for example, <mark type="inaudible" /> which means in volume, it looks totally different. We have also some currency impact in there, which also does deteriorate.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are waiting for new news. So I think with the ESMO news, that we'll again hopefully accelerate our penetration into the colorectal cancer first line, because obviously defining tumor mass data somehow came about as most of the families believed incredibly good, because I think it's incredibly mediocre, and it's certainly less good than Erbitux data.</p>
          <p>I guess we have all confidence that we can grow quarter-on-quarter, which we do, and if you would like to see a chart, which is really not total with the new Bristol-Meyers advertising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would like to jump in here because of my prior statement about the currency effect. It's just my memory that we have changed the functional currency in Korea and therefore we now have, through the dollar, we had a negative effect from the Korean won. Now we have changed the functional currency into the dollar, and we have a positive effect, which was very small in the second quarter, but then jumped to 7% in the third quarter. There was a positive effect of 7% and it will cause a turnover in the third quarter. Sorry about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. A couple of questions, please. The first one is a follow-up on Liquid Crystals. Based on the guidance you gave us today, in Q4, normally, you should have 44% operating margin in the division. And in the past, you have never been able to reach that kind of level with sales below 200 million. And still based on your guidance, normally in Q4, your sales should be approximately 170 million. Therefore, how can you justify this? Maybe some cost cutting to come further?</p>
          <p>The next question is on <mark type="inaudible" />. Can you please give us a detail of the timing with regards to the lupus?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on Erbitux in Japan. Can you please give us what is the level of sales you can target in second and third line, which is the current indication? And can you also give us a timing for the approval in first line in Japan, colorectal cancer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the guidance on quarter four, Michael has already explained.</p>
          <p>We see and have seen already some volatility between the quarters. We will expect for quarter four a one-time quarterly peak in profitability. And that is mainly because of the fact that we don't see any clouds with respect to idle capacity, under utilization, inventory adjustment in this quarter. And this is although the last quarter where we &#x2013; in 2009, where we ship according to older contracts to our customers.</p>
          <p>I think the key message is that you don't do the mistake to extrapolate from quarter four into the next year on long and mid-term. We will continue to see price pressure in the market. There is already some, let's say, caution in the market by our customers who see first signs of oversupply and maybe a period in beginning of next year. We don't know exactly how the Chinese subsidies, whether they will continue or not, will influence the market and therefore the volume growth. And as we are still continue to try to keep the price level as stable as possible, we cannot predict what competition will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding antastaflex for lupus obviously, our confidence got strengthened after the results of GSK, which showed a clear way forward and actually confirmed the mode of vaccine. We should get results out of the current Phase III trial in 2011. We are currently signing another Phase III to have two registrable trials based on the knowledge which we gained from the GSK study.</p>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux in Japan, obviously we are not giving country-specific peak sales per indications. But you are right, we are penetrating very nicely, as you have seen by the royalty and commission line, which is part coming out of Japan, the payments which we have there with Erbitux into the market, together with Bristol-Myers. And we do expect the first line indications somewhere in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Could you maybe say a word about volume growth? Or if you don't &#x2013; or maybe you can break down even Erbitux revenues by region? Or if not, if you can give us some indication about volume growth in Europe and &#x2013; at the moment? First question.</p>
          <p>Second question, order was supposed to be on the guidance on &#x2013; what has changed in between now and for instance the second quarter in Liquid Crystals when you had much higher sales volume than do you expect now for Q4 and a much lower margin.  So have you taken out capacity and don't you need that if there's a pick-up again? Maybe you can explain a bit further there. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not giving Erbitux number by region, but entire growth which we have in Europe, is actually volume-driven. It's actually higher volume because I alluded before to the price decreases, which we had. So it's also growing in Europe.</p>

          <p>With regard to Liquid Crystals, I'm not sure we understood the question. The previous question was, how come you're guiding such a high ROS in the fourth quarter? Your questions seem to be, how come you're guiding such a low ROS in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, my question is why you're guiding such a low volume and such a high margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't guide any volume whatsoever.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's volume times price.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I mean if you have your full-year guidance at nine months, you're implicitly giving more or less a precise Q4 revenue guidance, plus or minus 10 million, whatever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Everything else is your mathematics, which we guess is correct. We are confident that we will fulfill our total year guidance. Compared to quarter two for example, as already said several times, we don't expect the level of shutting down of production and of inventory adjustments which we had to take in the beginning.</p>
          <p>And obviously, as always and as you know, also from the previous years and quarters, there was a lot of effort in improving further our manufacturing and production processes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also have a proposal for those who doubt our guidance on Liquid Crystals. Since this is now a roundabout guidance of one percentage, why don't you assume that we are 10% out on the low side on the sales guidance and 10% out on the high side on the ROS guidance, and then you come to a ROS of 34%, and everybody's fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah. Maybe a follow-up on the PLS business. There you're saying your Q4 guidance implies roughly 50 million higher run rate. How much of that is compared to what we've seen over the last four or five quarters? How much is acquisitions contributing to that improvement in Q4 on the top line in PLS? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a zero acquisition contribution. A small one, but not &#x2013; it's mainly the recoveries but we still see the stability of the classical bread and butter businesses in LB that we see the positive trend in Liquid &#x2013; in LSS that we see the recovery in the pigment business, in cosmetics as well as to a lower extent in the automotive industry.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My questions are all related to Liquid Crystals. And I'm not going to ask about the guidance, I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of the business a little bit better.</p>
          <p>So I think you understand why you have big margins in the fourth quarter, because it's essentially going back to full capacity utilization. And next year, you have a new contract, which may change pricing. But that's &#x2013; does that therefore mean that the pressures which you had this year were mostly volume and therefore market share related? And so therefore can you give us any indication, how much your market share has actually dropped this year?</p>
          <p>And can you also give us the penetration of your new PS-VA technology?</p>
          <p>And finally, also a question on the Liquid Crystals, can you just compare the Liquid Crystal volume of an LED and an LCD of the same size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was quite a task to follow all the questions. I'll start with the &#x2013; I don't comment again on the guidance, but the question behind was, what's the catch with market share?</p>
          <p>We are still market leader in absolute terms and we will defend this position. We try to be flexible if necessary on the pricing war, which took place in the industry in the last couple of months. There was some small decrease in market share over this time, which happened mainly in the first month of this year. We are satisfied with our existing market share, which is still the absolute market leader.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is market leader, should I interpret this as bigger than 50%? Or is it just the largest of all players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, which one? Bigger than 50?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, bigger than 50. PS-VA is making nice progress. It again shows that Merck is the only one player in the industry which is able to deliver new technologies to the increasing demands of our customers. We don't see any activities in PS-VA region yet from our competitors. PS-VA is penetrating. There are several customers now are using PS-VA in large production, and we expect that this penetration will continue in the next quarter. But please understand that we cannot provide names of our customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it just like &#x2013; is it still in its infancy? Are we talking like 5% penetration? Or is it some more like in the 30 or so penetration?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the PS-VA, is that mostly used in television or is that also used in monitors and laptops?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>PS-VA is used in small displays. There are some, let's say, game displays, some mobile phones with PS-VA, but of course the volumes do come from the TV application.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the difference in liquid crystal volumes going into an LED and an LCD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no LED. So what one of our customers is promoting is a marketing activity LED TV that only &#x2013; the backside is now in LED, which has a lot of advantages because you can better manage contrast ratio, you have lower energy conduction, but the display is always the same, which is the LCD display. And therefore there is also no different content of LC between the classical LCD TVs and this marketed as LED TV.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no &#x2013; because I thought there is going less liquid crystals into an LED TV? That's not the case?</p>

          <p>Hi. Sachin Jain from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just two quick ones.</p>
          <p>First, on Erbitux for lung cancer. I appreciate not willing to discuss exactly what subsets you are discussing in EMEA, but wondered if you'd give some color on what percent of your initial indication a best-case scenario would represent? Is it half, third, two thirds? Just any color you'd be able to give there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on your comments on the fourth quarter, on Merck Serono margins, if I understood correctly, you talked about an increase in SG&amp;A costs. I wonder if you can just give us some color on whether there are significant Cladribine pre-launch costs in there? And just any color on Cladribine launch costs into the next year around potential approval? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux lung, I cannot give you how much it is because then you could figure out what we do. Because the sub-groups are pretty clear described. So I hope you understand.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Cladribine, we have already now obviously some launch costs in the current quarter and we'll have in the fourth quarter. But of course, the big ramp-up will come after we see hopefully approval next year. We will have some substantial investments to ramp up Cladribine itself as we came in line with its market potential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and thanks for taking my questions. Just one question on the pharma royalties line. We've seen another fairly weak quarter here, even though the products on which these royalties are based seemed to have been growing pretty solidly year-on-year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate further on what's driving these lower royalties?</p>
          <p>We know that last quarter there was an adjustment so we had expected to see more of an uptick this quarter. Have you maybe underestimated the product sales this time around? And hence should we expect Q4 royalties to be markedly higher? Or have you, for instance, lost any royalty revenues for certain products in certain territories? For instance, I think Puregon royalties start to go at some point in 2009? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding royalties, on the last conference call, we said that maybe you should take the first quarter and the second quarter on an average, and then you have the third quarter, which was a highly predictive statement. And now if you pencil in roughly the same level as in the third quarter, I think you will be fine. We will have the royalties maybe for one, two, three on this, plus, minus, on the same level. These are the fluctuation which you have seen and then we will start a gentle decline over the next few years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just two quick ones. One on the regulatory &#x2013; anticipated regulatory timelines for the S market. Is there any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy being talked about, anything which has been discussed with the FDA you might anticipate, which might slow down probably the overall approval process, given that it's in expedite one? Secondly, probably pushing my luck a little bit here on the Erbitux question again, would the subgroup analysis relate to something where you also could show progression-free survival in the end? Because I gather that was some property of the discussion, which also turned up of approving Erbitux for lung cancer? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the U.S., we did file with the filing end of September a REMS, which is the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan, which we think is needed, not because of the product, but the regulators would like to have this. That's already done. And from this point of view I do not hope that we will have a detrimental effect on the timeline. And we should get at the end of November actually the pronunciation of FDA do we have priority of renew or not. We have already said before I believe there is a fair chance to get this renew. Regarding Erbitux, the question was?</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. There's a number of financially distressed European governments for the next few years and possibly a number of financially distressed European health systems. I wonder whether Greece is a sort of one-off unique or whether you think this may be the tip of an iceberg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>According to our experience, I think the tip of the iceberg is not the right example or the right comparison. We are used to very slow payments from government organizations in the Mediterranean, Italy, Spain, Greece.  But what we have now seen cumulative from Greece the three years' arrears and no payments whatsoever. That is unsurpassed. And I think it reflects the Greek budgetary situations and the way they statisticed themselves into the E.U. They are sort of caught between a rock and a hard place. And we have a new government which promised programs to give the economy a boost and I can't imagine that at the same time they will start to pay their hospital debts, or put it on the budget to make a first step at least. So I think Greece is an isolated case and it has nothing to do with, what do you say, troubled &#x2013; troubled something. So it's...</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just got a follow-up question related to the CRYSTAL study. I know you presented the updated survival analysis at ESMO earlier this year, and you've now got tumor sample KRAS status data for, I think, the majority of patients. I'm just wondering whether we can expect to see an updated data set on the resection data, as stratified by KRAS status? And then my second follow-up was just basically related to the performance of your CardioMetabolic range of products. I think you've said previously that you expect growth in emerging markets to more than offset generic competition in the near term. I'm just wondering whether that statement still stands, if indeed you &#x2013; is correct?</p>

          <p>Let's start with Erbitux. Regarding the resection, obviously we're getting more and more data or else not at least from <mark type="inaudible" /> activities. And currently I cannot say, or just I don't know it, what the state of analysis is. But I'm sure we try to get more data into the market. But currently the performance in the resection activity is actually one of the key features where we also penetrate into the market, and we know this. And if we take this data into Japan, when we get first line that will be great, because in Japan colorectal cancer is treated by surgeons, and surgeons do nothing prefer better than have somebody operate. So I think that will have a good effect in Japan.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CardioMetabolic Care business, I did say this, it's absolutely correct, we have maybe a small interruption of this, because currently we use some key patenting trends, which is quite heavy double-digit number, which just drops away. I believe maybe we have this year maybe some softening next year, but then I believe that we can grow again in the CardioMetabolic Care business, since we have still some patents of products, which are Exar like glucovance and so forth, which are penetrating nicely in emerging markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a follow-up if I may. With respect to Cladribine, can you maybe discuss your stance in terms of whether you'd look to partner that product in terms of marketing it in the U.S.? Or if you do anticipate going it alone, so to speak, what kind of sales force would you envisage needing to hire to support the promotion of that product? And secondly, could you then also just a little bit more color on the commission and royalties line? You've taken the trouble to break that out so evidently that's an important line you want us to focus on going forward, or the implied remaining SG&amp;A to focus on. But can you just give us an idea of what that line is linked to? I obviously understand it's royalties and payments on things like Erbitux, but can you perhaps give us a proportion of how much is linked to Erbitux, how much is linked to other products, just to give us a bit more visibility on how to forecast that line?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the royalty and commission, I think you have to lean far out of the window to help you to get more life into this, because we're bound by confidentiality in some of the agreements. And as already pointed out, this is Pfizer, which means rabies co-promote in the U.S. and that's the Erbitux co-promote in Japan. I can't unfortunately give you more information or I break my covenants which I have in the contract. Regarding Cladribine, there we have to see under certain circumstances our current co-promoting partner has a handle on the product and we have to wait if Pfizer expresses itself and would like to be part of the launch activities of Cladribine. Depending on this, we might have more or less cost, but of course the costs issue only being a short-term one because obviously if they would come in, it would also gain commissions on it and the line before would move up.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have just two quick ones remained. First on net working capital reduction and therefore on the free cash flow. Do you expect still a strong cash flow and  a strong net working capital reduction in Q4 and maybe also Q1? And the second question is in currency effects, just for clarification, your calculation method is average. That means that negative currency effective in Q4 would not &#x2013; will trigger and Q4 numbers, but there will be a kind of elevated effect in Q4 and Q1 next year. Is this right?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. And because that was so complicated, I forgot the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No worries. So the networking capital reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net working capital reduction I think is slowly coming to an end. As we recover more and more receivables will go up. I mean would they go up anyway by our problems in some countries and the exacerbated problem in Greece. But high turnovers, and we had a very good September, contribute to higher receivables. And I think if I reflect the discussions with my colleagues from the operating side, they believe that their inventories are more or less where they should be. There is a bit more room for improvement, but not so much any more. I think the main impact on the fourth quarter will be from tax payments. We had no tax payments in the third quarter and we expect tax payments in the fourth quarter. And I don't think that you can prolong the expectation of a free cash flow based on the third quarter, which was an all-time high by a huge margin. So I think we will give a guidance for the full year next year in good time, but for the fourth quarter for the time being, I advise to be cautious on the free cash flow.</p>
