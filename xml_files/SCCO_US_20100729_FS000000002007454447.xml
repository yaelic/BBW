      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mona, and good morning everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Before getting into any material, I'd like to apologize for any inconveniences that you may have had due to the delay on the conference call start time. It was not our fault, but again, you are obviously are not responsible for that and we would take any responsibility on this one as well.</p>
          <p>Today we have Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO, and Armando Ortega, our legal counsel with us. And we will discuss our views on the metal markets as well as Southern Copper production sales, operating cost, financial results, and capital spending programs. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, we reported our satisfaction with the recovery of metal markets compared to the 2009 level. At that time, we commented on the markets recognition and anticipation of upcoming recovery and more demand for basic metal, particularly copper, molybdenum, silver, and zinc which are the principal commodities produced by Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>However, during the last quarter, the market would have deteriorated due to concerns about the recovery of the U.S. demand, China's growth, and Europe's best price. As a result, during the second quarter of this year, we have seen high volatility and weakness in basic metals prices.</p>
          <p>Even though we believe there is no chance of a slowdown in growth &#x2013; I'm sorry, even though we believe there is a chance of a slowdown in the growth rate of the world economy, we also think that we're not close to a recession or the so-called double-dip, particularly in basic metals.</p>
          <p>Focusing on copper, on the demand side, what we see is that the red metals physical consumption is consistently increasing worldwide. According with CRU, during the second quarter of 2010, copper demand grew by 4.8% worldwide when compared to a third quarter of this year, building a small deficit for the quarter. The main demand driver of growth came from the emerging economies, led by China and the recovery of physical consumption in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>While the Chinese government continues to employ monetary tightening measures to control inflation, growth remains robust and should continue to consume growing amount of raw material. Chinese DVP grew 10.3% in the second quarter of this year versus 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010. Chinese fixed asset investment in urban areas in the first six months of the year increased by 25% versus a year ago, and fixed asset investment in rural areas for the first six months of the year increased by 22%. These are very strong indicators of growth and activity at China as well as some other Asian countries. During the second quarter of this year as well, the U.S. and European copper demand for refined copper increased by 22 and 4% respectively when compared to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>These are very positive developments that support our conviction of higher physical demand from now on. On the supply side, current production growth is not catching up with demand performance. A clear sign of this is the consistent reduction in the combined copper inventories of the London Metal Exchange, ComEx, and Shanghai warehouses. At their latest peak in February of this year, the sum of their combined inventories was 815,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Currently, as of last Friday, there were approximately 625,000 tons, a reduction of 23% in four months. For the rest of the year, we believe that physical demand should increase even further after the end of the northern hemisphere summer.</p>
          <p>Looking into molybdenum, as you know <mark type="inaudible" /> in the second quarter of 2010 this metal represented 13% of the company sales. We're currently seeing consumption coming back to where it was before the economic crisis. For the rest of 2010, we're expecting a relatively balanced market for molybdenum.</p>
          <p>Silver represented 6% of our sales in the second quarter. We think that silver prices will have the strong support for the remaining of 2010 and on, due to higher industrial demand as well as inflation concerns.</p>
          <p>Zinc that represented 4% of our sales in the second quarter has very good long-term fundamentals due to significant investor consumption. However, inventories are currently at the relatively high level, affecting zinc prices.</p>
          <p>Looking into Southern copper production, we're reporting a 4.8 reduction in copper from our mines when comparing to second quarter of 2010 with the same period of 2009. The major reason for this is an all-grade reduction of Cuajone and the La Caridad of 8 and 9%, respectively, which resulted in lower copper production of 5,300 tons.</p>
          <p>The remaining production decrease was caused by slightly lower ore grades on recovery at our Toquepala and IMMSA mines. It should be pointed that our second quarter production has increased by 4% when compared to the first quarter's due to a slight recovery in the Cuajone ore grade. In the second half of 2010 we are expecting higher production from the Peruvian unit due to ore grade recoveries and some <mark type="inaudible" /> production from Cananea starting in September.</p>
          <p>Silver, regarding our metallurgical facility, we are glad to report a 21% increase in rod production due to higher sales in Mexico and the U.S., allowing the company to capture important copper premiums over the stock price. This is a good indication of the recovery of durable goods demand in the U.S. and Mexican economy. At this point, we are maintaining our copper production guidance for 2010 at 500,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Regarding molybdenum, we had record production in the second quarter of this year reaching 5,500 tons, a 26% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. The better moly production was the result of improved recoveries, a higher ore grades at the Toquepala, which increased production by 55%, the Cuajone mine that increased production by 37%, and La Caridad by 10%. This higher production at all of our operations was the result of a slightly better ore grades and recovery.</p>
          <p>We're increasing our 2010 molybdenum sales guidance from 19,000 tons to 20,000 tons. Zinc mine and refined production decreased by 8 and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2009, due to lower ore grade at our Charcas mine as well as lower production in Santa Eulalia due to <mark type="inaudible" /> problems which has been since then solved.</p>
          <p>The company estimates zinc sales of 110,000 tons for 2010. Regarding silver, mine production decreased by 7% in the second quarter when compared to same period of 2009. The fine silver production decreased 3% for the quarter. We are expecting a recovery in silver production in the second half of this year. We are estimating 16 million ounces of silver sold in 2010.</p>
          <p>Focusing on our financial performance, net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were 1.2 billion, 42% higher than the 825 million in the second quarter of 2009. The main driver for higher sales were the recovery in metal prices and a 26% increase in the molybdenum sales volume due to higher production. When compared to the second quarter of last year, copper sales volume decreased by 5.6% in the second quarter. Silver volume saw a decrease by 10.7% and zinc volume saw a decrease by 2.8%.</p>
          <p>Looking into our operating cost, our total operating cost and expenses have increased by 111 million when compared to the second quarter of 2009. The main variances include the following: fuel and power cost increased by 14 million; labor cost increased by 3 million; other operating materials by 15 million; workers' profit sharing, as you know, related to the higher sales and better results of the company by 38 million; royalties also related to higher sales by 3 million; third parties copper concentrate purchase increased by 20 million; selling, general, and administrative by 4 million; exploration expenses by five; and other operational cost in variances explain the remaining difference to complete the 111 million cost variance.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mention of sales and operating cost variances in the second quarter of 2010 our EBITDA was $612 million or 52% of sales. This figure compares with 380 million in the second quarter of 2009 that was 46% of sales.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash cost, Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproducts credits was $26.05 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.13 lower than the $39.06 per pound cash cost for the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in cash cost was the result of continuing operational efficiencies and higher byproduct credits, principally molybdenum.</p>
          <p>As indicated before, molybdenum sales volume increased by 26% and its price by 77%. The second quarter cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product credits was $1.57 per pound, higher than the $1.35 per pound of the second quarter of 2009. This $0.22 variance is explained as follows. The temporary reduction in production that the company had in the second quarter of 2010 accounts for $0.08 of the $0.22 increase. $0.06 are due to higher cost of energy, fuel, and power. Higher selling, general, and administrative costs account for $0.02 of the increase. Labor cost and royalty increases each increased cash cost by $0.01. Other variances in operating cost account for the remaining difference.</p>
          <p>On April 16 of this year the company issued 1.5 billion in fixed rate senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued in two trenches: 400 million due in 2020 at an annual interest rate of 5.375% and 1.1 billion due in 2040 at an annual interest rate of 6.75%. As a result of the better market prices, higher molybdenum volume sold, and efficiency gains, net earnings in the second quarter of this year were 313 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.37. This figure compares with net earnings for the second quarter of 2009 of 175 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.21, a 79% increase.</p>
          <p>Looking into the Cananea citation, after the termination of the labor relations by enforcement of the law, the company has aggressively started the repair of the facilities and currently have more than 3000 workers and contract personnel who are working at the mine to restore the facilities. The estimated cost to restore this mine unit is approximately 114 million.</p>
          <p>The company's goal is to reach full capacity by February of 2011. The company will continue with the social, educational, and cultural programs that it usually conducts in all its mining operations in conjunction with the local communities. These programs were put on hold due to union labor disputes.</p>
          <p>Expansion in capital projects. As you have seen in our press release, on July 22, 2010 the Board of Directors approved a 5-year, 3.8 billion capital investment program in the State of Sonora, Mexico to expand production and improve cost-competitiveness. The program considered the following projects: a 2.1 billion investment to expand Cananea's annual production from 180,000 tons to 450,000 tons of copper, an increase of 270,000 tons or 150% from the current production capacity.</p>
          <p>The major components of the Cananea CapEx are a new concentrator with an estimated annual production of 188,000 tons of copper and three new SXEW plants and a Quebalix circuit with a combined copper capacity of 82,000 tons per year. The plan also includes a molybdenum plant with an estimated annual capacity of 2,000 tons.</p>
          <p>The first step of the Cananea investments is the restart of the Quebalix III construction. The Quebalix is a crushing and conveying system for the leaching material that reduced by the SXEW plants. These Quebalix have a capital investment of $56 million. It should be mentioned that 80% of this investment was made prior to the labor disputes. Currently, the company is at the final stage of analyzing contractor proposals to start building the third leaching plant at Cananea which will have a capacity of 32,000 tons and an estimated capital investment of 180 million; this plant is expected to begin production in 2012.</p>
          <p>During the next year, we will conduct studies and engineering for the Cananea concentrator and molybdenum plant, as well as for its fourth and fifth leaching plants, and we will also work in the detailed engineering of the copper smelter and refinery at Empalme also in the Sonora state.</p>
          <p>The Pilares mine site development will send its mineral production for processing to the La Caridad concentrator. The estimated production of this project is 40,000 tons of copper per year at a cost of 195 million and it should be starting production by 2012. The Pilares mine site development represents a change in scope for the La Caridad expansion, previously budget at 300 million.</p>
          <p>Until now we have had ax part of our own projects the following ones; the Tia Maria Project, 120,000 tons of copper at a cost of 934 million; the Toquepala Brownsville expansion 100,000 tons of copper and 3.1,000 (sic) [3,100] tons of molybdenum at a cost of $600 million; the Cuajone Brownsville expansion at capacity of 72,000 tons expansion for copper and 500,000 tons of molybdenum per year at a cost $300 million. To these projects we are adding the Cananea indicated expansion as well as the smelter and refinery new projects and the Pilares.</p>
          <p>As indicated, we're placing for now La Caridad expansion at a cost of 300 million by the Pilares mine site development at a cost of $195 million. During this past quarter, the company invested $92.9 million in capital expenditures. For the Tia Maria project, the technical group confirmed by the Peruvian government, the company, and local communities was partially formed and it is scheduled to initiate the review of the Environmental Impact Assessment shortly.</p>
          <p>The group will resolve which of the three alternatives for water supplies is more feasible. The company has offered to build a dam with an increased capacity of approximately 40 million cubic meters of water that currently drains to the Pacific Ocean. The company will only use 7 million cubic meters per year of this water. The remaining additional 33 million cubic meters will be available for the significant benefit of the Tambo valley agriculture communities and the Islay population.</p>
          <p>The second alternative for water supply is the extraction of underground water through wells, and the third alternative is desalinization of seawater. With the latter two alternatives, the local communities will be deprived of the benefit of the additional 33 million cubic meters of water if the dam is not built. We expect to receive the approval to begin construction of the project during the fourth quarter of this year. We anticipate beginning production during 2012.</p>
          <p>The Tia Maria unit will produce through its SXEW process 120,000 tons of copper at a cost of $934 million. Through June 30, 2010, the company has spent a total of $100 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion. Detailed engineering is now in progress. The use of high pressure grinding rolls at the tertiary crushing stage was approved. Wet screening instead of dry screening is currently under evaluation. For the EIA offer of this project, we're at the final stage of it and will be presented to the government at the end of August. An explanation of the project was recently presented to the local community.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Cuajone facilities, during the past quarter a 73-cubic yard shovel was put in operation. Also 149 drilling machine was received from the supplier and it is being assembled. This equipment will support the work to optimize the kind of grade at the mine in order to increase the copper production in the next 15 years. We're continuing work on the Environmental Impact Assessment for the expansion project of Cuajone. As of June 30, 2009 the expenditures incurred were 23 million.</p>
          <p>The Tantahuatay gold project, in which the company has a 44.25% participation with Buenaventura, will start operations in the second half of 2011 and is expected to produce between 80,000 and 100,000 ounces of growth per year and 426,000 ounces of silver per year for five years. This project will require a total investment of 110 million, of which 38 has been already invested. Construction began in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>On July 22, 2010, Southern Copper Corporation received an unbinding proposal from its parent company, Americas Mining Corporation, offering to effect an all stock business combination of Southern Copper Corporation and AMC. Retiring company of a cycle in which all public stockholders of Southern Copper Corporation will receive common shares of AMC in exchange for the shares of Southern Copper Corporation. Under the proposal presented by AMC the stock of AMC will be registered and list on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Lima Stock Exchange.</p>
          <p>The board of directors of Southern Copper Corporation is in the process of appointing a special committee of independent directors to evaluate the merit of this proposal and intend to announce the formation and make-up of this committee in the near-term. We're informed this special committee will be granted the authority to retain advisors including legal and financial advisors. If the proposed transaction is consummated, Southern Copper Corporation public stockholders will have an indirect ownership interest in both Southern Copper Corporation and the SARCO through their ownership of AMC shares.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know it is the company policy to review at each board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources, and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine their corporate quarterly dividend.</p>
          <p>Accordingly at the close of the market on July 22, the board of directors authorized a dividend of $0.37 per share. This dividend will be paid on August 25 of this year to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12.</p>
          <p>Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you again for joining us today and we'd like to open up the phone for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my call. Just wanted to get your thoughts on &#x2013; in terms of your views in terms of the cash cost per pound that you foresee for the company in the next few quarters and 2011, do you expect a decline in this metric or do you expect them to seem relatively flattish during that period of time? That will be my first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your question, Carlos. I think that you can see our current production base, I would say that our cash cost should be flat or varying just in terms of any changes that we make have in two prices mainly. However, please keep in mind that we are including our Cananea production as part of the company base again, and Cananea was a low cost operation that will certainly influence positively the cash cost of the company from now on. I think that for 2011, at full capacity with Cananea, we should probably see that cash cost lower by between $0.15 and $0.20 from its current level before by-product trade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, before by-product. And my other question is, in terms of the production, how do you see the production going forward this year and in the next few years? Now that you will obviously try to ramp up Cananea and -- yeah, basically because of Cananea the growth doesn't start to kick in until 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the -- well, in terms of our current production base we mentioned that there is a 500,000 vacancies for the year 2010. That number should hold for 2011 and to that you have to add what we are going to do on Cananea. We are expecting to have Cananea at full capacity by the end of February of 2011. It's about 15,000 tons of copper per month. So that will give you an idea of what we are expecting, basically 150,000 tons of copper from Cananea in 2011 that should be added to the 500,000 that I mentioned, so that's about 650,000 tons for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of the CapEx, when -- do you have an estimate of the CapEx on an annual basis for DG next year and 2012, just to get a sense of when the biggest part of the divestitures -- not divestitures -- sorry, <mark type="inaudible" /> for the future growth will take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, for this year, we have a total budget of $836 million. From those you may reduce a little a bit due to the Tia Maria expenditures that are mainly on hold at this point. From -- for next year, our budget will be going about -- to about 1.1 billion and for 2012 about a $1 billion. These numbers will be reviewed as we move on in time obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. My final question is regarding the proposed expansion with AMC, what -- do you have already a timetable for the next moves by the board and by the independent committee that will be appointed to represent the minorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at this point, Carlos. Armando, would you like to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The only thing I would like to comment is that the board is in the process of forming the special independent committee. And as appropriate we will market this established and we would proceed to inform the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then it will up to that party to decide the timetable and the support that it will require for its duties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to, could you remind us the process to make the final decision regarding this transaction will be, the independent board will form a &#x2013; will provide a proposal to the entire board. And then the entire board will vote upon this proposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all it is up to the special independent committee to assess the merits of the transaction. And if they consider the transaction to be fair, to be an affiliated stockholder in that circumstance they would propose the whole board to approve the transaction. And then the company would need to call for a stockholders meeting to have the transaction approved as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Felipe Hirai from BOA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Can I have just two follow-up questions here? So on the CapEx side, Raul, you gave us the numbers for 2011 and 2012. Would these numbers already include the new CapEx for the next penetration and how you're looking at the CapEx for the other years? And also if you could give us any idea on how are you expected to see the prefecture and part in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't get the last part of your question. Could you repeat it, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, what I want to know is if the CapEx as you said is at $1.1 billion for 2011 and $1 billion for 2012. If they already reflect these higher numbers for Mexico and how do you see the CapEx after 2012. And related to the new projects in Mexico how do you see the production start-up for this additional capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay let me first mention on the CapEx. For &#x2013; I mentioned already that for 2011 we have 1.1 billion, 1 billion for 2012, then 900 million for 2013, 700 million for 2014, 700 million for 2015 and '16. In terms of this, obviously do include the program approved by our board in July, the Mexican operations of the Cananea expansion as well the Pilares expansion.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we already mentioned that the effect of the third SXEW at Cananea will start operations by mid-2012. On the case of the concentrator or the traditional mining investment that has mine equipment in new concentrator and molybdenum circuit where we are working on defining the basic engineering and looking to schedule this project by, to start production by mid-2016. In the case of the smelter and refinery, those two issues to start operations by 2017.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question is related to the cycle. Do you already have any clarification of synergies that you could potentially have by combining the operations?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul, good morning. I want to focus on the cash cost during the second quarter. I see a huge increase versus the first quarter where you had a credit. And now we are backing to an effective cost. Even though we have, or you guys register a significant increase, and molybdenum prices went up. So you can elaborate basically what happened between the first and the second quarter and the cost and provide a little bit more detail. And just to confirm on Felipe's question, the production in second half of the year should ramp up significantly in order for sales volumes to reach to 500,000 from some guidance.</p>
          <p>I just want to confirm is this correct because you are way behind that guidance if we annualize what we have seen in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me go to your last question, Victoria. We're including, we're expecting to produce about 470,000 tons from our current operations. And we will get some new production from Cananea in the fourth quarter not at full capacity but that will fill the gap for what you're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So actually there's a decline in your guidance because the 500,000 was without Cananea before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you can say so. You can hear only the operations that are currently using.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now looking to your first question with what comprising between the second quarter of this year with the first quarter. We had in terms of total cost, we have earnings of $31 million. Fuel and power increased by 3 million, labor cost by 3 million, all the materials increased by 11 million, mine royalties by 2 million. And the rest is small expenses increases. On the cash cost, we had a cash cost of $1.50 per pound before by-product credits in the first quarter of this year. That number compares with $1.57 for the second quarter. A portion of that is explained by the reduction in production, but mainly due to by-product credits on the other metals. I mean not molybdenum, but silver, zinc, we had our reduction on that. And as I say, cost increased by 31 million mainly for fuel and power and labor and operating material, general operating materials increased their cost a little bit in the second quarter of this year when compared to the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Should we be concerned about lower ore grades going forward both at Caridad and Cuajones, or could this be a real problem in terms of your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think that the Cuajone operation is increasing -- it's increasing its ore grade as we move on further into the year. We are not getting to the level that we had last year, but we're closing the gap that you have seen in the first quarter, mainly. As I mentioned this quarter's production increased when you compared that to the first quarter one and that trend should be -- should be consolidating and that's why we increase our -- if you just double what we did in the first half of the year you will not get to the number dimension. We're having a better production coming from Cuajone and from Caridad as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on your funding needs. The bond you issued earlier this year was partially to be used for CapEx spending and at that point, the spending plan was a bit smaller. So, just wondering if you can update us on your plans there, and how you plan to fund some of those CapEx? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Well, we are -- we have our bond issue ready and we are -- we're expecting to start using that money for our growth. A portion of that growth will be financed by our own, by our own funds generation as well. Next year we will have the benefit of having Cananea back, and that is going to improve our cash generation. Later on in time, when we have Toquepala and Tia Maria moving into production expansion in the Toquepala and Tia Maria project, we will consider -- we will review our current debt position and make a decision on that matter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the bottom line is for the foreseeable future you have enough capital to proceed as you wish and you'll kind of wait to see how the cash flows develop and revaluate at that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it sounds like you're limited in what you can discuss regarding the AMC transaction, but any view on how that could change your funding plans or how capital will be distributed within the new entity?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. My question was also related to ASARCO. I mean, it looks like ASARCO throws off a significant amount of free cash flow and whether it would &#x2013; in fact, one of the benefits of the potential merger could be that that cash flow could be a source of funding for Southern Copper projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, at this point, I think that we can't comment on this kind of questions. If you don't mind, the Grupo Mexico will have its conference call later on today. I think that you may address that question to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, yeah, I appreciate that. And then, on just &#x2013; here's another one I'm wondering if you can address......</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can always ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. I'll try. So Southern Copper being the surviving entity, I would assume ASARCO would not be a guarantor of those bonds; but if they are not a guarantor, would Southern Copper continue to disclose the guarantee entity to bondholders going forward? Can you elaborate at all on that or whether ASARCO would become a guarantor group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>ASARCO and Southern will be separated as entities. So the bonds that Southern issue will be back by Southern Copper and in the future if this transaction ever consummates. At this point, there is not much information that we can elaborate on this but that's one of the things that we can share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it sounds like, though, if they're separate subsidiaries that you would be able to produce subsidiary information like you do already or like Grupo Mexico does already. Is that your expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's our expectation. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Raul, we probably would like to direct our colleagues to read again the exhibit that Southern Copper filed together with its 8-K last Friday, which contains the letter filed by AMC describing, I would say in a very clear manner, the structural transaction and  the end result of the transaction for corporate purposes regarding both ASARCO and Southern Copper.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We do have another question. And it comes from Alex Hacking from Citigroup. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. The first question -- I just want to confirm that the proposed transaction with ASARCO will require a vote from the minority shareholders in Southern Copper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will check again with our outlet council but upon our past experience, the normal procedure to approve the transaction is first to have the formation of a special independent committee that would analyze and assess with experts the merits of the transaction. And if they consider that the transaction is fair, then they would present this transaction -- they would recommend this transaction for the approval of the board. And then the transaction would be presented to all the stockholders in an ad hoc or special stockholders' meeting. We would like simply to double-check it, but that is the normal procedure to have these sorts of transactions ought to be approved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to confirm what you are saying, is that it does not -- it would not require a vote of the minority shareholders, just of the entire shareholder base, which would obviously include Grupo Mexico's 80% <mark type="inaudible" /> presumably?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as our experience tells us, and the law that we are aware of, the interest of the minority stockholders are precisely safeguarded by the creation of the special independent committee. Their very duty is to insure that the transaction is fair for the unaffiliated stockholders, and that is precisely what they are called to do. That is part of their fiduciary duty and the complete mandate that they get to asses, to examine, to determine whether the transaction as proposed is fair or not for their stockholders, and I am talking about the minority stockholders. And then, procedurally, if they reach the conclusion that it is, then they need to recommend the transaction for the approval of the board and later on for the approval of all the stockholders in the context of a general stockholders meeting, where minority stockholders would vote.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. That's very clear. The second question I have is just going back to the CapEx, would you mind to just clarify the timing of some of the projects forming, i.e., when they would be completed. Specifically I am talking about the new mine at Caridad, the Pilares and then also just the expansion with Toquepala and Cuajone, what's the target date for completion there? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to find out: you recently regained control of Cananea and you are planning to spend quite a lot of money. What is your visibility on any potential labor issues given the history at the mine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, as you know, we kept, we gained control of the mine and we are in a very active, very aggressive process of reconstructing and rehabilitating the mine. Upon the timetable that has been provided to you, we plan to start slowly and increasing level producing again. Once we terminate the rehabilitation and reconstruction process, we plan to formally hire with a new labor union, new workers for the mine and also to design a new collective bargaining agreement, a modern, a competitive one in order to help us to support our production basis in a new era of labor relationship with a new union. That is, I would say in general terms, the profile of what we want to do and we expect to do.</p>
          <p>We are working with contractors. Right now we are working with contractors with several contractors who are helping us in this labor, but as you know, this is just for a while. I mean, during the time in which we terminate our rehabilitation and reconstruction process. But once again, in order to repeat myself, once this process, once this stage is terminated, we would start right away a formal labor relationship upon the umbrella of a new collective bargaining agreement with a new union, with a new labor union.</p>

          <p>Yeah, well the straight answer to your question is no. But in Peru there is no discussion about raising the royalties.

          <p>In Mexico, we have experienced in the last year, both based, one or several of congressman launching or making statements regarding the likelihood of a potential new royalty to tax mine activities. And it has become almost a sport but at this juncture, we don't see nor rather at least not now, any new initiative. It would not be a surprise if there is a new congressman announcing that, an intent to start a new initiative in that regard. But I don't think it's something that would be passed by the whole congress. It would need -- as a tax, it would need to go before the two chambers of congress.
