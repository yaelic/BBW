          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tom, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's 2008 Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jon Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us for the Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Results and Outlook Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chase Carey our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel.</p>
          <p>In a moment I'll hand the call over to Chase and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first, I'm obligated to read to you the following. On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of the DIRECTV Group's and DIRECTV U.S. annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures. These are attached to our earnings release and are posted on our website at directv.com.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm pleased to introduce Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. I would say overall the third quarter was a solid one for DIRECTV. Highlights in the quarter were our solid top line revenue growth and our bottom line cash flow growth. These results were really led by our ability to continue to attract quality customers, to drive HD and DVR penetration, continued progress in managing key costs, and disciplined control of capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>We are in a tough economy and a competitive environment, and that is putting a bit more pressure in a few areas like churn, ARPU and retention spending. But overall, I would still describe the impact as marginal. The strength of our business is really continuing to enable us to reach our key targets.</p>
          <p>Pat will take you through our results in detail, but I want to briefly comment on a couple of the U.S. metrics. Most, like ARPU and SAC, were pretty much in line with our expectations. A couple of metrics that were a bit off our expectations were net sub growth and churn. The net sub shortfall was really due to the BellSouth region. Quite simply, it's taken us longer than we expected to mitigate the end of our AT&amp;T bundling relationship in that area. Excluding the BellSouth region, our net sub growth was actually up a touch year-on-year. We're making progress in the BellSouth region, but it's just taking us longer than we planned. Churn was also impacted by the BellSouth transition although the challenging environment added a bit of pressure too. Beyond these areas, we were impacted by a few issues like the hurricanes, a legal settlement that impacted G&amp;A, but overall we feel pretty good about the results.</p>
          <p>Our Latin American business continued to also show strong results. Revenue, profits, and cash all beat our targets. Churn has continued to track above a year ago due to both to our prepaid program and the overall expansion of the business. The one metric I want to comment on in this area is Brazil subscribers, where we recorded a one-time 57,000 subscriber reduction. With the Brazil merger being completed in the last year, we've had a lot going on in that area. As we stabilize that business this year, we discovered in Q3 a block of subscribers that should have been churned out in prior quarters but were not removed from the sub count. There's no financial impact from this adjustment. We're obviously not happy we had to make this adjustment after making an adjustment in Q2 in Brazil. We're confident that we've taken the necessary steps to ensure all our metrics are accurate going forward. We've also reviewed our other Latin businesses to ensure there are not lingering issues elsewhere.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn it over to Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chase. All in all, I thought we had a solid quarter as we continued to achieve solid subscriber and ARPU growth, improved operating efficiency, and margin expansion as well as reduced CapEx and significant cash flow.</p>
          <p>Starting at the top line, revenues were up 11% at DIRECTV U.S. to 4.3 billion. Net additions of 156,000 were lower than last year but consistent with the targets we provided at the beginning of the year and on our last earnings call.</p>
          <p>Last quarter we said that second half net subscriber additions would be similar to the first half, assuming that gross adds would be flat to down versus the prior year, combined with a flat to slightly higher churn rate. And that's basically what we're seeing. Gross additions of about 1 million subscribers were down about 3% from last year. Although we fell a bit short of our target in the former BellSouth territories, we more than made up for that shortfall with strong results in the rest of the country.</p>
          <p>All of our key channels had year-over-year growth except those through our telco partnerships. In particular, our direct sales, independent dealers and commercial business had solid year-over-year growth. More importantly, the quality of our gross additions continues to improve as the percentage of high quality or lower risk subscribers increased over both the prior year and last quarter.</p>
          <p>As you've heard us say before, we prioritize quality over quantity. And this focus on quality continues to drive down involuntary churn. However, we saw an increase in voluntary churn in the quarter primarily due to increased competition and the slowing economy. As a result, we're being much more selective in our upgrade and retention efforts to ensure that our best offers are given to our best customers. For example, we're continuing to see aggressive promotions in some of the FIOS areas as well as in the former BellSouth territories, where AT&amp;T is offering bundles with Dish Network.</p>
          <p>In a slowing economy, some of our more price sensitive customers might be more interested in saving money by taking a less expensive offer from a competitor. In these cases, we'll typically have less aggressive save offers, particularly if the customer is identified as a lower valued subscriber.</p>
          <p>So churn may be a touch higher, but as you can see so far this year, we're on a pace to reduce our full year cash upgrade and retention costs by about $200 million compared to 2007, a tradeoff we feel makes sense in this type of macro environment.</p>
          <p>ARPU growth of 6.1% to 83.59 was driven by price increases and strong growth in HD and DVR service revenues. Despite some of the market issues I mentioned earlier, we continue to see extremely strong demand for advanced services. As a point of reference, we added twice as many HD and DVR customers in the third quarter as Comcast reported last week. As a result, over 8 million of our customers, or a third more than a year ago, have advanced services and pay us on average about $100 a month.</p>
          <p>As we talked about on our last earnings call, we were expecting ARPU growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, due to such trends as lower upfront HD and DVR equipment fees, slower ad revenue growth, as well as more offers for new and existing customers. We expect these trends to continue into Q4 and into next year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to profitability, I thought we had another solid quarter in terms of managing costs and improving operating margins. As you saw in the earnings release, our operating profit before D&amp;A margin increased almost a full percentage point to 25.4% despite some one-time unfavorable items. This margin expansion is consistent with what we've seen all year and what we expect for the full year. Most of the margin improvement is coming from better cost containment in areas such as subscriber services and upgrade and retention marketing, while we continue to hold the line on our programming margins. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher subscriber acquisition costs, mostly due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the acquisition of higher quality and advanced product subscribers.</p>
          <p>Our G&amp;A costs were also a bit higher than the prior year primarily due to a legal settlement, higher bad debt expense, and costs associated with the acquisition of installer networks. The legal settlement related to a patent infringement case originally filed over eight years ago. Bad debt expense is a bit higher in the quarter. However, we are still targeting our full year bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues to be at or below last year's level.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we've discussed in our last earnings call, we've either acquired or gained control over several DIRECTV installers, which we call home service providers. We now own and operate HSP servicing approximately one-third of the country. As a result, we're reporting G&amp;A costs for these businesses that were previously incurred by third parties. Over time, we expect these transactions to result in net cost savings. However, I remind you we are taking control of these installers primarily to improve the overall customer experience. Excluding these three items, our G&amp;A costs are up year-to-date about 5%, which is consistent with our target and full year outlook.</p>
          <p>In addition to improving margin, we're continuing to drive down our capital expenditures. DIRECTV U.S. CapEx was down over 30% in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've reduced our CapEx by over $500 million mostly due to rapidly reclining set top box costs combined with increased usage of refurbished boxes, a leveling off in demand of advanced services from our existing customers, and we're nearing the completion of our HD and satellite expansion plan that began about three years ago.</p>
          <p>The reduced CapEx combined with our higher OPBDA drove a more than 50% increase in cash flow before interest and taxes for DIRECTV U.S. to about 500 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow before interest and taxes is up $845 million or 87% over last year.</p>
          <p>At the consolidated level for the first nine months of this year, our total free cash flow, which includes Latin America, taxes and interest, is about 1.25 billion or more than double last year's free cash flow. Also in the quarter but not included in our free cash flow number was over $1 billion of stock repurchases. Cumulatively we have now purchased about 340 million shares for nearly $7 billion over the last two-plus years while reducing our outstanding share count by roughly 25%.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call back to Chase, I'd like to briefly comment on exchange rates in Latin America and our liquidity. As you may know, the Brazilian real has weakened by about 30% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The impact on revenues in Brazil due to this exchange rate change is about 70 to $80 million. However, we're still expecting strong Q4 revenue and OPBDA growth in the region when compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Looking at our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter, we had a net debt position of about 2.9 billion comprised of 5.9 billion of debt and 3 billion of cash and equivalents. We do not have any significant debt maturing until 2013, and we currently hold an undrawn credit facility of 50 million &#x2013; 500 million. In addition, about 90% of our cash is held in the U.S. in extremely conservative investment vehicles. So all in all, it's safe to say that we feel good about our liquidity at this time.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Chase for some closing comments.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. The rest of 2008 will be one of continued progress as we move forward with our HD leadership adding both more local markets as well as national channels. So we'll look to reinforce our content leadership with unique programming like "Friday Night Lights," which we launched in early October, move forward with our whole-home solution, absorb our field services operations that Pat touched on as well as a myriad of other initiatives.</p>
          <p>While the economy and competitive pressures have increased, we feel good about the momentum of our business. Demand for DIRECTV in the fourth quarter is extremely strong, and we're looking at fourth quarter net sub adds in the low to mid 200,000s. Seasonal initiatives like NFL Sunday Ticket sales are also strong. In the fourth quarter, we'll continue to see a bit of pressure in some metrics like ARPU and churn, SAC and retention spending, but these pressures are really at the margin, not that different than the third quarter. We continue to find ways to mitigate these pressures while making ongoing improvements in other key areas that enable us to continue to improve margins.</p>
          <p>Overall, the demand and strength and the growth of our business will enable us to continue to drive double digit revenue growth while adding over $1 billion in cash flow this year. We'll also continue to move forward with our buyback plans given our undervalued stock, strong balance sheet, and expected continued increases in operating cash flow going into 2009 and beyond. We have no intent to change our plans although we will continue to monitor the broader economy and make adjustments if appropriate.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Jon.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I guess, good morning to you guys. First question would be, I don't know if it's possible, Chase, to spend a little more time on the BellSouth region and whether or not that was a gross adds or a churn issue in the quarter. It sounds like &#x2013; and maybe I'm reading too much into the fourth quarter, like you sort of addressed that successfully in 4Q. Along those lines, I'm a little surprised that AT&amp;T is being aggressive with the Dish bundle given that they're migrating over to DIRECTV next year. And then as a corollary to that, any early thoughts on what that means for you guys in 2009 on a gross adds basis, bringing that channel on board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess taking them in order; on the BellSouth side, it is both gross and churn were affected. I'd say more on the gross side than the churn side. It is &#x2013; and I think we are &#x2013; it is improving in the fourth quarter, though as I said, it's taking us longer. We know we can compete. Obviously, in 2009 this will all change. But I think we know we can compete effectively. We've competed for years in the AT&amp;T region itself where they were bundled with Dish. I think what we just found here is the initiatives and the time it's taking us to put in place the right sales initiatives to replace it is just taking longer.</p>
          <p>So the second and third quarter we clearly did not get to where we planned to. I think we're making headway in the fourth quarter, but even in the fourth quarter we won't be where we were, and to some degree obviously we're now looking forward to the transition in the first quarter where BellSouth comes back in. So we have to plan the fourth quarter a little bit with taking that into account. It doesn't make a lot of sense to really gear up a whole bunch of initiatives to mitigate for BellSouth and then find two months later you've got BellSouth back in as a partner.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of BellSouth being aggressive with Dish, I'd expect them to be. They were aggressive with us right up &#x2013; to our benefit right up until March 30th or March 31st when they went to Dish. I think in this marketplace, it's a competitive enough marketplace; it's tough to not be in the market. You've got to be in the market to fight with what you've got. That's sort of what they've got to fight now. I'd expect them to use that to fight until they switch to us.</p>
          <p>I think in 2009 it will clearly be a positive in 2009. At this point I wouldn't get too far into it, I guess I would just to temper it a bit. It will be a building process in 2009. It's a big region. Probably in the BellSouth we obviously are benefited from having some history with them working there; in the rest of the region, we don't. So there clearly will be a ramp-up as we go through it. Our goal will be to hit the ground running as strong as we can, but the reality will be &#x2013; there clearly will be a ramp-up to the BellSouth relationship as we go through 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Chase, you talked earlier about the competitive landscape. It seems like over the last six months or so both cable and Dish have beefed up the HD offering. So I was just wondering if you could just speak to that and talk about if you're seeing that impact your business at this point or is the competitive pressure more from the telco side and more price related and promotional driven. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say &#x2013; I think, again, the cable guys and Dish have beefed up their HD although I think sometimes the press, what they market and say they're doing is way ahead of what they're really doing. But in terms of impact on us, we feel great about our position in HD. I think one of the great things about establishing a position of leadership that really associates your brand with that leadership position is I think those are strengths you can drive for a while, particularly if you keep finding ways to energize it. And I've said before and I continue to believe, I think our position in HD leadership is one that can benefit us not for months or quarters but for years.</p>
          <p>Obviously, incumbent for us to continue to freshen it, and we do. We're adding dimensions in terms of sports packages, and we'll finish the year with 120 local markets. We'll be up to 88% of the country and continue to look for new and interesting ways to add &#x2013; NFL Sunday Ticket Matrix Channel is now in HD. And I think as you continue to do things to strengthen and reinforce our leadership position and reinforce our brand, and I think that brand differentiates us from our competitors in general, particularly cable in general. And certainly in HD I think we've built a real position of leadership that will continue to benefit us for a long &#x2013; for a real time to come, and certainly, that's what we'd be seeing.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of competitive pressure, it's more on the offer side. I think we feel very good about our position, ability to drive our strengths forward. But I think you are seeing more, whether it's the cable bounties for switching or just the pricing on offers. It's a more aggressive, competitive marketplace on the offer side. And I'd say that's really where the &#x2013; ended up &#x2013; when I talk about increased competitive pressures, it would be there. I'm really talking about that, not the &#x2013; not as much in terms of HD leadership and the like.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I guess two quick things. One, have you seen any pickup in the Verizon channel in terms of gross adds. And then just secondly, a question on advertising. I think a couple of years ago, advertising was about a buck-and-a-half per sub; just wanted to find out where that figure is now, and also do you think there's enough growth in advertising from share take over the next year to offset the cyclical headwinds. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Verizon, it is probably not yet a meaningful pickup. We have actually in the summer had very good discussions with Verizon about trying to reenergize. I mean, I do think Verizon sort of has had FIOS, and understandably, at the forefront of what they're trying to do and probably made the non-FIOS aspects of their business a little bit more of an afterthought than we would have liked. I think they understand that. I think they referred to it even, I think, on a call last quarter. And I think there is a renewed energy on that side of our relationship, and I think we look at actually that as an opportunity that we can put some fresh energy into it than actual results today. It wouldn't be up &#x2013; we've done a bit better, but I wouldn't say the results would be materially impacted, but I think we believe we have some nice momentum to that that we can build on it and have Verizon more focused and committed to that side of the business versus FIOS than they might have been six months ago.</p>
          <p>In terms of advertising, advertising, it's obviously a small &#x2013; it's a tiny part of our business &#x2013; it's under 2 or 3% of our revenue. Probably it would be, if you wanted to say where has the economy hit us, that would probably be the area. That area we clearly have been hit by the economy. There's no question. We're probably a bit in the third and clearly in the fourth in advertising will be &#x2013; it's an area that's been growing really well for us. It looks like the fourth quarter will be down year-on-year in advertising, not up. So certainly &#x2013; that probably, in a unique way, is a place the economy does hit us. But, again, it's a pretty small part of our business.</p>
          <p>It is an area that we still really believe there's upside to us. In many ways, we've just scratched the surface. We don't compete on any of the levels that really &#x2013; we just &#x2013; we get spots. We sell them nationally. What we really are looking to do is move into and take advantage of the technologies we got over the next few years, to start [oh] to move forward with the ability to target, to localize. We're some adding interactivity to it. To add a lot of the things that really our advanced set top boxes will give us capabilities to do. Whether that mitigates in '09, probably would not get in that specific in comparison. But we think this is an area &#x2013; certainly if you look out over a couple of years, we are a small fraction per sub of what certainly the cable competitors are. And we think, as you get particularly DVRs with the capability, DVRs with connectivity in the home and some of those capabilities in terms of interactivity and targeting and insertion and the like, that this is an area that is one of real opportunity for us as you look out over a couple years.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask a longer term question here.  If I go back, I don't know, maybe eight or nine years, there's a time when people thought your growth would slow, and you've got this fairly significant boost in terms of your gross adds as you expanded locals, local channel availability.  And then everyone got very nervous about video-on-demand, and you guys got another leg of growth from DVR.  And more recently your growth has been spurred on by your differentiation on HD.  My question is, as we look out over the next, say, two to four years, is there another sort of rabbit that you guys can pull out of your hat to sort of differentiate yourself and keep your growth aloft, or do you think it's more about more the blocking and tackling just to maintain high customer loyalty and drive revenue and cash flow off the business as the Street is thinking about it today?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there &#x2013; yeah, I mean, as you look out, I guess in some ways you always wish you had the crystal ball.  I wasn't here eight years ago, but I doubt they had the crystal ball that said, let me see, three years from now we do the DVRs and six years from now we do the HD.  In hindsight, these things probably always have a much greater of visibility than they do as foresight.  So a lot of our focus is in blocking and tackling, but I honestly believe in the industry we're in that moves and changes as much as it does, there will be transforming opportunities.</p>
          <p>I think mobility is one example of a place that will become a more meaningful part of this; I'm not sure what shape or form. I'm not saying people are going to go watch episodes of "Lost" on a cell phone.  But I think there will continue to be, I think just by definition there will be &#x2013; will continue to be events that energize and expand the arena we are part of.  But we're not obviously all of it, but we're part of. And I think what's really incumbent on the players who succeed, they are ones that can be opportunistic and smart about seeing where the opportunities are, when it's right to jump on them and trying to figure out how to exploit them.  And obviously, we made the bet on HD at a point in time where we thought it was there.  And I think there will be places and opportunities to take bets that open up new arenas and new opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>I think we have great strengths in our business versus &#x2013; we obviously have differences between us, if you want to get &#x2013; I don't want to get too philosophical here, but between wired players and ourselves.  I think we have true speed to market, a national footprint and a national brand.  That's a tremendous strength.  I think the wireless nature of our business is a tremendous strength.  I think we have natural partners out there that we bring unique strengths to that are dependent on us, whether it's emerging broadband or telcos as they develop their businesses, and I think there will be other technological forces that come into play.</p>
          <p>Again, I think the challenge &#x2013; I think for us, the key is to be as strong as you can on the one hand, so you have unique strengths like our subscriber base, quality subscriber base, our distribution strengths, our speed to market, our brand, and develop &#x2013; and content leadership.  Develop those strengths and then figure out how to use those strengths to move forward and take advantage of opportunities that emerge in the market as you can get a sense of them.  Again, I'm probably sitting here right now, I'm not sure I'd say it if I believed &#x2013; I'm not sure I'd publicly say where I thought that opportunity is even if I knew, but I think it is ultimately something you have to continue to push at and prod at and try to make the best when you think it's right. That's the best I can give to you.</p>

          <p>Let me sharpen it a little bit.  Do you believe that your potential push into MDUs is a material driver of growth sort of two to four years out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, sure. I mean, look there's like &#x2013; that's probably a more mechanical word.  That's not only &#x2013; I mean, we're doing that.  We clearly two years ago or a year ago, we did not have a technological solution that really worked and we didn't have a sales infrastructure to develop it.  We have both of those foundations today.  If you look at our penetration in that area, it is woeful.  I mean, it's close to embarrassing.  You know, to some degree it's probably understandable.  It was rightfully &#x2013; we didn't have the right &#x2013; the solution for those marketplace.  There was lower hanging fruit elsewhere, and it made more sense for us to go chase it.</p>
          <p>Today that is a &#x2013; with the solutions in place and the capabilities in place that we do, there's enormous for us even to just take the market share, let alone getting to the type of market share we have overall.  We're a tiny fraction of what we are in the mainstream market.</p>
          <p>So, as you go out there, you find that we are far enough out into the MDU market, you clearly have an incredible pent-up demand from the MDU players that are really looking for choice and looking for alternatives.  They feel they just really haven't had that opportunity that a residential consumer has.  It's not going to drive the '09 results.  It will be a solid contributor, but it really is a multi-year plan to really capture some of the MDU share we should have.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Let's shift from operational opportunities to balance sheet opportunties. You're obviously in an enviable position with the 3 plus billion in cash, more coming in each quarter. And assets have gotten cheaper, whether it's your own stock through DIRECTV shares or L Media shares or potential acquisition targets.  I know you don't want to disclose specific plans. The question is, how aggressive are you willing to be with your cash position in this marketplace to the extent you see something that's just too cheap to resist?  Thanks.</p>

But do you decide your stock is too cheap, and you do a tender offer?  Do you buy L Media because the spread blew out? There's a lot you can do with your cash, and it's enviable to have it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you get &#x2013; we are &#x2013; we are pursuing &#x2013; we have continued to be diligent and aggressive about pursuing the buyback.  I probably wouldn't say at this point if we had probably a different view, but we certainly continue to be in the market, continue to be active with the buyback.  I think at Liberty, it is probably less &#x2013; there are a lot of dynamics around that, so I think just look at it on a cash perspective.  I think is probably a bit the tail wagging the dog.  I think you've probably got &#x2013; if there's something there to do, time will tell. We talked at the Liberty investor day in September.  Both Jon and I talked about it a bit.  Right now there doesn't seem to be anything.  It's a track stock. There's not a lot &#x2013; I think we will continue to look at it and see if there's something that makes sense.  As we said then, I don't see anything imminent there, and that's probably less a factor of cash, than the values and other issues.</p>
          <p>I think in acquisitions, probably don't have a lot more to say than what we've said before. I think we certainly do -- we are strategically whole.  We don't need to do anything.  I think we always want to be opportunistic.  Though my guess would be anything that's interesting, there's probably &#x2013; if the public value is beat up, the private value is probably going to be a whole different animal and certainly would not think anything's imminent there, though again we want to be smart about it.  If there's something smart to do, we'd certainly want to go have a look at it.</p>

          <p>Chase, have you considered buying back L Media shares as a cheaper way to buy your own stock and increase your leverage in negotiations with John [Malone, Liberty Media Chairman]?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>I think that's really complicated to say you're going to be buying them.  You're buying a minority position in a tracking stock from a shareholder that on the flip side owns 48% of you.  It's a little like a game of chicken with your largest shareholder.  I think that's a pretty complicated dynamic to get in.  I'm not sure that's really how I want to &#x2013; again, we're going to look at everything.  We'll look at it from a DIRECTV perspective, but I think &#x2013; I do think we believe having a constructive relationship with Liberty is in our interest, and that has certainly been the mindset we've brought to it. Trying to play the type of games private equity guys might try to play is probably a little different than how I think we'd look at what's right and smart for us to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I have a couple of more questions on Latin America.  You talked about the real declining 30%.  I think the functional currencies for pan-americana apart from Venezuela &#x2013; Venezuela, we have a fixed tag &#x2013; are also off in the low 20s to mid-20s.  That business, I think, is about 70% or so the size of Brazil, but if you could give us more guideance on that.  And also, I suspect, some of the CapEx down there is effectively U.S. dollar denominated. But is there anything on the actual operating cost side that implies less than just a proportionate move to the currency movements.  Do you have any programming that would have a U.S. dollar element?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I mean, let me answer the latter, and I'll probably let Pat touch on the currency.  I don't think we use another currency, we think it's mostly Brazil.  We worked very hard the last few years to get the business largely aligned in local currency.  Whether it's programming contracts, operating contracts, even debt, to the degree we have it, it's all local currency denominated.  I think the only material cost we have that is a U.S. dollar denominated one are the satellite lease &#x2013; the satellite transponder leases.  I think the rest of it is really aligned with the local currency there, which wasn't true three or four years ago but really, we have successfully moved it all to be in that case. And probably Pat is closer to the currency, but we do think Brazil is the primary issue.  But Pat I'll let &#x2013; maybe you or Bruce can &#x2013; one of the two of you can touch on the currency issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I think, if you look at it, we picked Brazil because of the magnitude of the dollars there.  When you look across the region, again, we still feel like, if you look at kind of where we were in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, we're still going to see some very good kind of year-over-year growth for the whole region, but it won't be the kind of growth that we saw in the first three quarters.  So it will still be up 20%, something like that, overall for the region.  Even with the rates the way they are.  And like Chase said, most of our revenues are all kind of local, and a vast majority of our expense are all on local currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You probably need a better Crystal ball for currencies even than you do for business in the U.S. But are you still looking for decent U.S. dollar growth in Latin America next year, or would you expect it to be more or less a flat year if the currency relationships hold where they are right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, again, I think right now we're not looking out to 2009, but certainly we've got some good organic growth that's there as well.  I mean, obviously, we'll have to kind of see how the economies down there fare over the next few months.  And as we begin to look into 2009 &#x2013; but we're in a good position as far as our subscriber base down there and the growth and the type of services they're taking, which is helping on our ARPU growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think we're really currency speculating.  Our primary way of dealing with the currency was to get our costs and revenues aligned.  I think we sort of felt to sort of to sit here &#x2013; I guess we probably mostly follow what the third party consensus is.  I don't think we have unique insights.  So I think we try and deal with currency again by getting the costs and revenues aligned, and I think then our focus is making sure we are operationally on top of it so that if you do have probably less currency being an economic issue in a particular country or region, we can make appropriate &#x2013; we can take appropriate steps to deal with it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Let me just drill down a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the high end and the low end of your business.  We heard from Time Warner Cable yesterday that things have slowed down dramatically, and it sounds like you're describing real strength in the fourth quarter.  Is that -- are you seeing real differences between your higher end customers, customers, for example, that take the NFL Sunday Ticket and are still feeling relatively secure versus the lower end customer base that you've got or some of the ethnic segments that may be feeling more macroeconomic pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really wouldn't say so.  We look at all those things, and I think it is an accurate summation.  I think we feel very good about the demand and strength of the business.  And as I said, certainly HD, DVR, Sunday Ticket, those sort of products continue to be pretty much in line with sort of what we -- what it seems. Again, there is that &#x2013; as we said, churn a bit more on the credit side.  There is a segment of our customers out there who probably feel a bit more squeezed and are more open to going after a deal. But it's not a big segment.  It's probably more than it was.  But it's a part of the business and a dynamic we are dealing with here.  But I wouldn't sort of say you could pigeon hole it or sort of really put it in one particular area.  Actually, the ethnic side of our business continues to be pretty good as well.</p>
          <p>So, I wouldn't sort of say you really &#x2013; it's being driven by one segment versus the other or one's weak versus the other.  I think overall it's probably largely what we've seen is continuing to be what we're seeing in the &#x2013; we've been seeing in recent quarters is what we're seeing going forward with probably some actually at the end of the day, probably some added strength in the fourth quarter.  But, again acknowledging within that probably across the board are a few more customers in every place that are searching for a deal to try and switch and take advantage of a switch deal or a new customer offer to shave a few bucks off a bill when they feel it would help them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chase, if I could ask a follow-up question about your telco relationships.  Can you describe sort of what happens when AT&amp;T for example rolls out U-verse in a given market?  Do you see a complete fall-off in your bundled relationships with them, or do some customers still opt for the satellite bundle, and AT&amp;T, for example is still willing to market that.  And how does the dynamic work with existing subscribers?  Are you seeing churn out from your bundled subscribers as they have the option of moving to the telco-delivered video.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have -- it's tougher for me to comment on AT&amp;T because I'd be commenting from a step removed since we don't bundle with them. Certainly the conversation &#x2013; my expectation is AT&amp;T is probably approaching it different than Verizon.  I think AT&amp;T will with us have bundled offers that are pretty universal across their footprints and really offered to everybody.  I think they are clearly not making &#x2013; they're not investing anything close to what Verizon is investing on the FIOS and the like.</p>
          <p>So I think on the FIOS side, that differentiation is clearer.  Where FIOS is launched, that is clearly much more their lead product, and we're their lead product where FIOS isn't, so we're sort of competing with it.  There's still customers that take DSL we have and there's still customers that want us, and we'll take DSL with it for whether it's sports leadership or other reasons or just content leadership. But I think in the AT&amp;T, my expectation is AT&amp;T will be pretty widely distributed.  So U-verse would be more of an option for a customer, that they're not trying to differentiate or sort of provide an edge to extra weight to one side or the other, and it's more a consumer proposition.  There are two consumer propositions; the consumer chooses.  I think with FIOS, Verizon puts more weight, unique offers into the FIOS area, free TVs in New York and things like that that wouldn't exist in a DSL bundle.</p>

          <p>Not different -- not meaningful different than historical.  We do have historical geographic differences.

In other places, people put new &#x2013; cable guys come out with a unique offer in a city or the like.  We deal with it.  But I wouldn't say anything different than the ebb and flow that has again been the course of our business other than from an overall perspective, the goal is for all of them to be more competitive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Quick question on housekeeping; what percentage of subscribers are taking advance services today?  And then also, Dish came out with their box, with the Slingbox capability.  Is that something &#x2013; a type of technology that you guys would consider or find interesting at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on the first &#x2013; I think what we've said and probably not that different -- I think this &#x2013; I think we sort of said at the end of this year we'll be close to 50%, and that's probably &#x2013; I don't think we've given a lot more visibility than that.  I'd probably say sort of close to half our customers by the end of the year will have an advanced product.</p>
          <p>I think the Slingbox as it &#x2013; mobility I think will be a bigger part of our business.  I think it will be over the next set of years, not quarters.  I think the Sling product is a pretty niche product for a handful of customers that want it today.  I think the real issue is how scalable the Sling technology is in anything but a niche basis, as you figure the bandwidth issues and the like about it. So I think it's a nice product for a niche of customers that want that, but I think the whole mobility thing will probably emerge in a more mainstream way that is probably a few years from now as it becomes more front and center.</p>
          <p>I think for us the big -- we actually think things we've done have a much broader application and appeal like the ability to remotely with your cell phone to interact with your set top box.  It's been a real popular product for us we've launched this year and I think we'll probably look for ways to continue to deal with more the mainstream, to adding features and dynamics to the mainstream cellular and PC business that sort of are for a large majority of our customers, not a small niche.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, a couple quick ones.  First of all, in the AT&amp;T relationship, is there any sort of spending that you guys need to do up front to get ready for AT&amp;T as a distribution partner in terms of like, priming the channel?  And then secondly, as it relates to the fourth quarter guidance, a nice healthy uptick from the third quarter, Verizon recently announced the new &#x2013; fairly aggressive bundles that included DIRECTV; $80 triple play type numbers.  Does that factor into that strength that you're seeing or that you expect?  Or could that possibly lead to some upside? And then although you probably don't want to answer it, is that the kind of pricing you expect from AT&amp;T when things get going next year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of AT&amp;T, there will be some.  It will be more operational like &#x2013; we have dealing with call centers, getting call center prepared systems in place to be able to sort of handle a customer between the two of us.  You know, so it's not &#x2013; it's not enormous, but there is clearly expense that, overhead, we will &#x2013; setting floors up, up and coordinating really operational aspects of the business.  Call centers, field service, systems, bills, and the like.</p>

          <p>Is this something we're going to see in the margins in the fourth quarter, or is it too small?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we feel we can handle it.  We are continuing to add features and dynamics to our business.  Again, I think we view it as our job to try to find ways to be able to continue to provide these enhancements for whatever reason, whether it's enhance the consumer or enhancements in this case for the sales channels and to manage it in the context of our overall goals.  So I think there will be some.  And clearly there will be some marketing as you get to more of the launch product of the market, I think we would look for some ways to add some marketing to it.  Which is probably a work-in-progress, so probably too early to say what that becomes.</p>
          <p>In Q4 we certainly, what I would not be at this point, banking on or projecting a significant jump from Verizon.  I think we &#x2013; again, I do think we feel &#x2013; we put some positive momentum to that relationship, but it wouldn't be certainly in the fourth quarter.  I would not say it's a material part of what I'd be projecting in the fourth quarter.  And I think AT&amp;T, every conversation I've had with AT&amp;T as well as the rest of the people here, I think there's great enthusiasm on both sides and I think great excitement about what we can do with the product.  Again, it will be a building process as any relationship of this size and scale is through '09.  But we think there will be great energy.  And great excitement about, on both sides to try to really make this relationship something that is &#x2013; is a building part of both our businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. My question is on the digital transition.  I know you guys haven't talked about it that much because it's probably a nonevent for you.  But as you think about that transition, are there any initiatives that you're currently putting in place to try to capitalize on some of the confusion may be out there for analog, cable customers that may be kind of caught up or even over the air who may be wanting to switch to some kind of a low cost pay TV service?  What exactly are you doing right now, and how do you see that opportunity in your area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess there are two &#x2013; we clearly are addressing it.  There are two aspects to it.  First, there are customers we have today that could be impacted.  Could be they have a TV in the kitchen with rabbit ears or something like that.  So we have initiatives and plans in place that we obviously have to relevant customers that may not have local and they've gotten it that way.  So we're working with those customers &#x2013; customers we have today to help them through this.</p>
          <p>I think in the new customer place we will have initiatives out there.  Again, I don't view this as sort of a major event for us.  I think it's a positive opportunity.  There's no down side to it.  I think we would look to in the Wilmington test, we got some customers out of it.  But we don't think it's a defining event.  I guess generally you're talking about customers who historically have not cared enough about TV to get pay TV.  So I think it probably ends up saying they're not going to be uniquely profitable.  I mean there is some, you may grow over time, but by definition probably not going to be customers that you've built your business around. Yeah, we will have offers and compete, and I think it's going to be an opportunity.  I think it will be a positive for us, I just don't think it would be sort of a major positive we'd be looking at in '09.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more question on the whole-home solution.  I think that's been something that has been on your radar for a couple years now.  I'm not quite sure if, what &#x2013; can you be a little bit more specific, Chase, in terms of the traction you might be seeing there.  I know it's still probably early.  The specific initiatives or marketing offers that you have gear around those kinds of things and how you intend to monetize that as you look out to next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point, the focus is really more from an engineering and customer experience perspective as opposed to &#x2013; first and foremost, and that's really where the focus is today.  We are going to move forward with phases that sort of move from being able to tie &#x2013; which would imply the phase we're in now, with really having &#x2013; tying PC screens in the home to TV screens in the home so you can watch DIRECTV on your PC as well as your TVs or access your DVR and your PC as well as your TV.  I think it will move from that to tying boxes in the home.  So, if you've got an HD box in one room and an HD-DVR in the other room, the HD box can access the HD-DVR.  And then probably more towards the end of '09 and '10, move to a next generation box that is one box feeding multiple sets.  It's a process of moving through tying -- our goal is really to tie the devices in a home and for that matter out of a home, which as we said looking on PCs and cell phones.</p>
          <p>But to tie devices in a home from PCs to the boxes you have to a box from the ground up that will be able to really provide fully what I guess would be the ultimate -- really when we talk about a whole sum, the final product of a whole-home experience.</p>
          <p>We're also &#x2013; if you're asking what we're starting in fourth quarter, sort of installation technology, single wire technology that makes homes much more upgradable, adds flexibility, adds interconnectivity.  So, all those things are things that we're deploying now.  We actually have customers &#x2013; we're not marketing, but we actually have customers that are using the &#x2013; are tying their PCs in and experiencing it.  We always call it beta sort of customers that we tell how to do it.  We're not marketing to them, but I think it's actually 10,000-plus customers that are experiencing it today.  We are starting to really move.  I think our goal really is to refine the experience and get it out, get the bugs worked out, and really sort of move forward with it. So I don't think it's a revenue event in '09. It's really sort of getting that experience to a place where it can become a driving, a centerpiece of our &#x2013; in that regard, beyond '09.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question today.  It does come from Kit Spring with Stifel Nicolas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about any major content renegotiations you have over the next year or two, and how do you see your leverage against the major content companies, maybe both on the broadcasting and on the cable network programming side?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably won't get too far into specific negotiations.  I think most of the big players, we actually have dealt with over the last couple of years, there's always something coming up.  And we have pretty good luck &#x2013; there's always attention to a buyer-seller relationship that we have.  That being said, I think we have tried to approach things in a fair way.  I think part of that ends up being we expect to be respected for the size we have in the business, and to have values that pricing is commensurate with &#x2013; is consistent with our competitors for the size we have in the marketplace.  I think that's been the goal, and that's what we've driven the business to.</p>
          <p>That's the thing there again, there won't be always be frictions in it.  We obviously moved quite successfully forward in adding HD from really everybody to it.  I think we have been able to move forward, and we've made progress certainly on program costs.  There are always areas &#x2013; the one I talked about probably that are continuing to be there probably &#x2013; you would sort of say what are the bright light issues today?  Probably be retrans first and then some of the local sports issues.  Not as much national but local.  Most of the big guys in retrans we have for quite a while.  So we don't have sorts of the real high profile big guys.  But there are a lot of stations out there.  That's a part of the business that we deal with day in and day out and continue to fight. But I think we feel we've made real headway on the program cost side, and I think our size is clearly an asset in doing so.  And we are going to make it a sort of foundation how we move forward that we expect to be treated fairly for the size we have in the marketplace.</p>
