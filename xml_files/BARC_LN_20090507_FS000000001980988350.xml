          <p>[Abrupt start]...and interim management statement. I will now hand you over to Mr. Chris Lucas, Group Finance Director.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us at the rearrange time this morning. Seeing from the statement we issued this morning that we've given you additional detail on the P&amp;L with IMS.</p>
          <p>As we think the current environment caused a greater discloser. I wouldn't have the balance sheet in the same details or I will comment on its overall shape. Just to say, we going to expect, dramatically maintain the same level of discloser in the all the management. In general my comments this morning compare with the first quarter this year with a same period last year.</p>
          <p>We started 2009 with a good first quarter looking at the Group as a whole profit before tax were up 15% to &#xA3;1.4 billion after absorbing gross credit market write-down of 2.6 billion. This was driven by very strong income growth of 42% at &#xA3;8.2 billion including income level in most parts of the group and a particularly good performance in Barclays Capital.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges increased &#xA3;2.3 billion, which includes &#xA3;754 million of credit market write-downs. Now half of the growth is due to higher volume and the impact of each exchange rate. We told you in February that our planning assumptions for the loan losses this year range between a 130 and 150 basis points, excluding available for sales assets.</p>
          <p>We are currently at the lower end of that range on an annualize basis at a 131 basis points. Cost growth is 37% to &#xA3;4.5 billion reflect business and head count growth from the Lehman acquisition, as well as business growth resulting from our investment in the distribution network in global retail and commercial banking.</p>
          <p>The number of customers we serving the RCV has increased very significantly from 34 million in 2006 to about 49 million now. Reflecting our strategy to the diversify the earnings base across the Group.</p>
          <p>Moving onto global retail and commercial banking where we delivered first quarter profit almost &#xA3;600 million income grew 16% in the difficult condition. Interest on liability margins -- interest rates have declined and growing impairment on weak global economy. Impairment in the UK businesses in line with our expectations. There is impairment growth in the international business is faster than in the UK.</p>
          <p>Turning to the individual business, we start with the UK retail banking, very good income growth in mortgages in consumer lending was more than offset by liability margin compression even after the impact of hedges. Impairment growth which is in line with expectation was mainly in the UK consumer loan book and overdraft. And 90 days delinquency rate have increased slightly on the year end.</p>
          <p>Cost increase is a result of higher PATMI charges as well as normal fee to gain some property sales, as a result profit was quite a bit lower than the in the same period last year. Against the background of market contraction, we've increase the size of our mortgage book from &#xA3;82.3 billion to &#xA3;83.5 billion over the quarter as new business exceeded redemptions.</p>
          <p>The average long-term value on new business written this year was 45% around the book overall was 43% from a current market valuation base. We have over 820,000 residential and pipeline <mark type="ph" /> mortgages in our books. Only 1% are more than the 90 delinquent and 235 were in repossessions at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Commercial Bank there was solid income growth particularly strong fee income, sales of treasury products including foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. The significant decline in profits was driven by higher impairment. So we continue to benefits from the diversification of the our loan book and the five largest charges amounted to &#xA3;65 million in total</p>
          <p>You'll recall that we positioned our commercial banking portfolio defensively and limited our participation to sectors such as commercial property, sponsored leverage lending. We expect the rate of impairments will increase, but the loan loss rate remains low by industry standards.</p>
          <p>As in the UK Retail Banking discretionally costs were tightly controlled, but the rate of cost growth in the commercial bank was higher than that in -- of income growth. Of course half of this was the result of higher interim charges.</p>
          <p>Profits of Barclaycard grew slightly reflecting very strong income growth across most businesses. This more than offset higher impairment charges which were in line with expectations. Cost growth at Barclaycard was lower than income growth and our net cost of funding in Barclaycard reduced.</p>
          <p>In UK Cards, delinquencies have increased in the first quarter, reflecting adverse economic conditions and rising unemployment. We've continued to reduce credit limits and tighten approval rates which were less than 50% in March. In Barclaycard US loan loss and delinquency rates also increased, but they continue to be better than the industry averages. Barclaycard US now accounts for almost 30% of the overall card book.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe there has been higher income across all major markets and the rate of cost growth was lower than that of income growth. Profit declined as a result of higher impairment charges, largely in Spain where the rates of impairment growth was broadly similar in both retail and wholesale.</p>
          <p>The loan loss rates in Western Europe have increased, but remained below our average for the Group and 90 days delinquencies are growing at the slower rate than loan loss rates. Most of our retail property exposure is Spain in major urban centers were the market is less impacted by the economic environment than in coastal areas. The average loans to value on new mortgages was 55% in the first quarter compared to 63% for 2008.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets there was very strong income growth in the UAE, India, Egypt and Sub-Saharan Africa which is more than offset by increased impairments. The rate of cost growth was higher than the rate of income growth and taken together this resulted in a loss in emerging markets in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The substantial part of the impairment growth which did constitute consumer lending and cards particularly in India, supported in context the assets book remain quite small. Consumer loans and card balances in India total &#xA3;1.1 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Cost growth reflected the effects in 2009 of higher investment in the distribution network. You'll recall that Western Europe and emerging market added almost 650 new distribution points in total in 2008. Expansion would be significantly lower this year, as our focus for 2009 has maximized returns from this investment. We continue to believe there are attractive opportunities in these markets and we are well-position to take advantage of them over the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>GRCB which exclude as the capital amounts of callers, profits declined as a result of increased impairment, affecting the economic downturn in South Africa. Profits for the first quarter last year also benefited from &#xA3;46 million gain from Visa IPO.</p>
          <p>The majority of increased impairment was in mortgages and vehicle financing with a loan loss rate approaching 2% and the rate of cost gross year-on-year was in line with asset income growth.</p>
          <p>Absa's new Chief Executive, Maria Ramos started in March after a handover period with Steve Booysen was announcing to leave last November.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Investment Banking and Investment Management where profits for the first quarter grew as &#xA3;1.1 billion with an income growth of 79% reflecting a very strong start at the year in Barclays' capital and a successful integration of Lehman's.</p>
          <p>Barclays' capitals profit of 907 million was significantly ahead of last year. Gross income more than double to over &#xA3;5 billion with excellent growth of interest rates, credits commodities, priced services, and equity products. The contribution from the US has been transformed by the Lehman's acquisition.</p>
          <p>To give your ideal scale, gross income in the US business has almost triple from &#xA3;670 million in the first quarter last year to about to &#xA3;2 billion in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Barclays' capital ran ked second globally as underwriter for combined equity and bond issuance in the first quarter. And is the leading underwriter of all international bonds, global bonds, US dollar domestic bonds year-to-date.</p>
          <p>There were gross losses from credit market write-downs of &#xA3;2.6 billion, &#xA3;1.9 billion is reported in the income line and &#xA3;754 million was in impairment. This was partly offset by gains from owned credit of almost &#xA3;280 million and hedges of a &#xA3;182 million. On a net basis, the charge was &#xA3;2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Just over &#xA3;1 billion and additional credit reserves related to monolines, reflecting leasing downgrade in February. Even though there has been no default on any of the underlying assets. Commercial real estate pretty much accounts for &#xA3;460 million of write-downs.</p>
          <p>Credit market exposure was reduced by &#xA3;5.2 billion, which equates 12% of the year end balance in 2008. All of these reductions were liquidated broadly in line with their marks and this includes the wholesale repayments with half, which we told you about in February. Cost increased the Barclays' capital is resulted volume growth in the expanded business and the accrual of performance related pay.</p>
          <p>Profits of Barclays' global investors increased as a result of a significant reduction in support to select the liquidity funds. This amounted to &#xA3;37 million in the first quarter this year compared to &#xA3;173 million for quarter one last year.</p>
          <p>There was a modest decline in income with management fees down as a result of declining asset value. We've had strong net new asset influence, especially in index equity of fixed income. Overall, asset under management declined as a result of negative market movement.</p>
          <p>Profits of Barclays rose so significantly as a result of two main factors. First, the sell of the Closed Life Fund which contributed &#xA3;43 million in the first quarter last year. And second the impact of acquiring Lehman Brothers US Private Investment Management which has assets under management of about $26 billion at the year-end.</p>
          <p>Income declined as lower interest rate impacted margins cost were well controlled and current assets decline slightly since the year-end, driven mainly by negative market movements and exchange rates.</p>
          <p>As far as the balance sheet is concerned, there has been very little movement from the numbers we have reported for the year-end either in the size of the overall balance sheet, adjusted gross leverage for the amount of risk weighted assets. We continue to expect our overall balance sheet size and leverage to decrease over time.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital ratios, taking into account the net gain on the sell of the iShares business amounted in April '09 and the conversion of mandatory convertible notes issued last November. We would have reported the Tier 1 ratio of 7.3% and an equity Tier 1 ratio of 7.2% on pro forma basis at the 2008 year-end.</p>
          <p>Inline with FSA announcement last week what we reporting out core Tier 1 ratio from June onwards under the standardize definition this would have been 20 basis points lower than equity Tier 1 year-end. In other words 7% rather than 7.2%.</p>
          <p>Profit attributable to equity holders in the first quarter of &#xA3;826 million. As we announced in the AGM we intend to resume cash divided payment in the second half of the year and for then onward we will pay cash dividend on a quarterly basis, in general we expect to make three eco payments a year with a variable payment in the final quarter.</p>
          <p>We recognized the market desire for us to maintain strong capital ratios to expect the distributor portion of profit after tax to significantly lower than the 50% maintained in recent years. As far as this year is concerned, our price will be conservative and will take market conditions in to account. The third quarter payment will be made in the fourth quarter and the final cash dividend for the year will be declared in May in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the outlook for 2009. Trading in April has been consistent with that of February and March after an exceptional performance in January. The range of possible outcomes for the year however is broader than usual given market conditions.</p>
          <p>Based on indicators such as delinquency rates and early warning list we expect impairment to increase in each quarter of the year and to be at the higher end of our planning range on average for the full year.</p>
          <p>To give you an idea of the trend the loan loss rates in the fourth quarter last year was 109 basis points compare to an annualize rate for 2008 of 95 basis points. We would of course update you at the interims have been reviewed second quarter impairment trends.</p>
          <p>I want to you know that as of April of 1st Russia has become part of GRCB Western Europe for both management and reporting purposes. I don't expect this to significantly impact the result or either business.</p>
          <p>John said in February that we'd update you our goals. And you should expect to hear more from us at the interim. We'll also be holding an investor seminar on Barclays' capital next month in both London and in New York.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had a good first quarter with profit growth of 15% to &#xA3;1.4 billion, driven by excellent income growth of 42% to &#xA3;8.2 billion, which has enabled us to absorb credit market write-down and impairments</p>
          <p>The rate of cost growth was significantly lower net of income growth and we benefited from the successful integration of Lehman's acquisition. I'm joined by Robert Le Blanc, who's Risk Director, Rich Ricci, Chief Operating Office for IBIM and Stephen Jones our Head of Investor Relations. We are happy to take your questions now.</p>
          <p>You'll understand that we have nothing to add to our announcement on the sale of the iShares business. So my focus today is on trading year-to-date.</p>

          <p>Hi, just on the impairments, run rate and guidance, the 131 basis points, is that just -- I just want to make sure I've apple-and-apples compared, is that based on the Q3 '09 or Q3 '09 less the 750 out of impairments related to structured credit.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John-Paul Crutchley from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I am JP from UBS. Couple of question if I can. Firstly, I mean clearly BarCap had a very, very strong January and you obviously pointed a good performance in February, March and consistent then into April. I just wondered if you can give a picture of exactly how diverse that trading was just in terms of traffic and run rates year ahead. Second, I want to ask on capital and risk assets ratios in capital generation, looking at these have implied profitable satisfactory holders taking out the benefit from owned debt, we suggest you probably grew the core equity ratio by around 15 basis points in the quarter. I just wonder if that -- this number you sort of recognize in terms of the net capital growth if you like in terms of capital build. And the final I have question for global on the monolines, just a question how you see things progressing here because you do seem to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>JP, can I answer the first two and then later you come back to ask Robert the third, if that's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry. Yes, it's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one I think was around Barclays' capital income and the best number that I look at is that &#xA3;5 billion of income that's before credit market write-down that got to that line. That gives you a flavor of the real franchise ability to generate income. If I look at the trend over January, February and March, clearly January was an extremely strong month. And we look it in term of being broadly a month and half worth of sort of expected revenue that I think is the best way of looking at it. I should just say that when you try and calendarize and annualize the income flows, we always expect that second half will be slightly quiter than the first because of the impact of August and December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of contributors by active cards, let me ask Rich to make the couple of comments. Maybe Rich is in San Francisco at the moment. But let me just add, out of that 5 billion by far the largest contributor was fixed income which was over &#xA3;2 billion of that and rest was spread amongst the asset classes that we described. In terms of your second question JP on capital, in term of attributable capital, I think you quoted 15 basis points. That's broadly -- we are couple of basis point away from your math, but that's broadly the right number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean just coming back on the monolines. I mean you previously <mark type="indiscernible" /> clearly you're taking marks, but the underlying asset deterioration on the underlying assets evaluation is broadly offsetting that, so net exposure may pretty much end up unchanged. I just guess -- are you thinking more broadly about how you manage these exposures out. Longer term there has been some debates in the market about commutating the exposure trying to get the underlying assets or was there something you just now see as -- you have to just work out over time as the underlying portfolios migrate towards maturity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>JP, its Robert, I will pick that up, but Chris or Rich might want to add to this. I mean just as to restate very quickly the underlying assets value, which you all have seen in the discloser haven't changed significantly, so I think that's a positive sign for the first quarter anyway. We have reflected a downgrade in the first quarter on a number of our exposures and you will see that detail as well and that's resulted in an increase in our credit reserve of &#xA3;1 billion. There has been discussion around restructuring at some of the monoline and also there is always a possibility of commutation or strategies you can follow. I think that what we are doing is obviously it following closely, fully reflecting the value of the underlying assets and also taking more write-downs. We've increased our weighted average probability of defaults across all the monolines to a very substantial number. But in terms of how we might tactically handle any of these exposures, I don't think we can make any specific comments. But it's something we are watching and trying to look at actively rather than just sort of living it alone you can see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, its Michael Helsby. Just a on -- I have got a couple of questions, firstly on your impairment guidance. It seems I remember that the full results you gave us the 130 to 150, but you've also -- when questions said that that would apply to 2010 as well. And also note the comments that you are making about how it's going steadily move up so I think on average that clearly implies that fourth quarter is going to be outside of that 130 to 150 range. I want just three small points, firstly, whether based on your assessments and your modeling whether would be expect to deterioration or just be like a steady linear progression over the more expediential. And also given the key force going to be outside of the range whether you could update your thoughts on 2010. I appreciate everything very uncertain. And also account of life and we find the AFS impairment that's included if you could give us what that number was in the first quarter and then I have just got a follow-up question on margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer a bit on AFS and ask Robert to pickup the piece more broadly in terms of guidance. The AFS number was about 530 million in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the impairment guidance of the 130 to 150 for the year and you know we have committed about 130 in the first quarter on an annualized basis, I would say we expected to increase gradually over the year more in a linear fashion rather than in expediential fashion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we are seeing it increasing across all of the businesses domestically and internationally, a little bit faster growth rate internationally if you considered the economies of the US, Spain and South Africa where a lot of our international business is. I think you will understand that trend. So more linear than expediential. And in terms of where we think it would be I don't think, you know, we would see the first quarter being therefore the highest and our range of 130 to 150 we met to be for the overall average annual rate rather than in any particular quarter. So I think we will be at the -- end of that and therefore by mathematic you would expect the fourth quarter to be above it. In terms of what it means for 2010 we were trying to be very specific we thought we were pretty brave, saving something about 130 to 150.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going year ahead, I don't think we meant it to quite specifically to 2010 and the reference I just trying to give when we made that comparison was we expect 2010 to feel like into the difficult -- in the same way that '09 is without trying to be specific what is range there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So based on it, so a study progression throughout this year then it would be tough to assume a study progression throughout next year as well based on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wouldn't necessarily to be clear that you should assume that for next year though.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- our objective is February was to try to dumping down any expectation that 2010 will be a better year than 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, now I think that's reasonable. And just on -- just a follow-up on margins. So I think you mentioned throughout the statements about the impact of liability spreads. I was wanting if you could just sort of rapid altogether with assets spreads and give us an overall view on the retail and commercial banking margin moved in the first quarter and then if you can to give us a more feel for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I do without sort of giving you of course margin base, but to help obviously assets spreads will be increasing through the quarter and half and that's what we had indeed seen. And the liability margin compression is in totaling, a net number after hedges we forecast for the year is about 600 to &#xA3;650 million that sort of range. And that is also taking the benefit of both product hedges and more structural hedges. So that is the impact of margins impression across the net UK retail Barclays Commercial and Barclaycard.  It should be same that the compression reduced its profit in the retail bank and commercial bank will increase in Barclaycard.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Sorry, I know you've already touch on monocline, but just to be clear, I think,  the -- it seem quite substantial migration from investment grades to non-investment grades looks like about 6.8 billion, and appreciate that you've increase the CVA by about 1 billion. I just wondering how, I mean, it's seems given the scale of the migrations still quite at low CVA relative to -- to maybe to your expectation, only if you could just drill down a little bit on where you've got to that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the level of CVA reflects the performance of the monolines and as we said earlier, we start by looking at the performance of the underlying assets and what the write-downs out there. When I look at the monoline CVA roll, it comes from that 17 to 24%. And we expected to perform -- back to -- its gone to over 16%, reflecting those downgrades particularly around that timeframe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask a question on the very strong income growth seen at Barclays Capital, I was wondering if you could help us trying to understand why it increase by so much in terms of ahead some factors, but I think a relevant, but maybe you can help try and wait each of the factors in line with how much its impacted your overall income. I mean obviously wider spread just had a big impact, volatility in underlying assets just had an impact. And you may have gained market share and then obviously there is the Lehman acquisition. I was just wondering if you could help us attribute where the increasing income is actually coming from, along those factors and possibly other factors as well. And given that just looking at Bloomberg date, it looks as a volatility has dropped sharply recently, I was just wondering if you could help us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the three parts or four parts to conclude increase volatility. There is clearly increased volumes in the marketplace and that was taken is fully in January and also going through, and has going through in February and March. We see a reduction in market participants so therefore an increase in market share and that we feel has been strong, but it probably the one that may slight back is some of the participants we think invest the market more permanently others, more temporarily. The third one is margin which have been up. The best way I think I would look at it in terms of beyond that is the &#xA3;5 billion of income, which shows that the income that has by franchise before credit market write-downs has over 2 billion of that coming from the US, which probably the Lehman's business. Bob mentioned in February and has remained true that the Lehman's contribution of 5 billion I think is about a third. So that is by far the most significant driver of that doubling of revenue we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow-up, could you identify how much of the 5 billion relates to an accurate position taking given huge moves we've seen in fixed income markets due to constant releasing very large macro events we've had in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business is driven through its client franchise. Of course, there is some proprietary activities, but by far the most important part of that is Cards business. And if I look at it slightly different way in terms of the bar <mark type="ph" /> or capital consumption is as a measure of risk taking. Both of those have been either flat to down over the first quarter. So it feels to me that the big driver is very much customer related volumes rather than more risk taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And could I have just one quick follow-up as well. And could you just identify what the risk-weighted assets growth was during the quarter? And how much of that, if any, is attributable to pro-cyclicality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We made a statement that said there was no significant change and by that I actually mean there was no significant change. As is turn down, the difference between March 2009 versus March 2008 was less than &#xA3;1 billion. It was almost identical. And therefore there is some pro-cyclicality coming through more so on the credit side now than the counterparty risk. So that's been offset by good management of business close in terms of capital utilizing -- utilization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. I had two questions. Actually, I want to follow-up on Cormmicks <mark type="ph" /> question on trading income. One of the things I guess I'm -- for several of the banks in Q1 -- that several of the banks you pointed to has some payment made by GSP. And I think in the AIGSP appendix, they outlined about 8, $9 billion of payments to Barclays, what that recognized in Q1 or was that recognized in Q4 of last year? And do you expect those to continue?</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Christopher Lucas Sandy, with all your respect, we are going to talk about specific circumstances. They were though just normal payments on stock lending and collateralization. So the recognition on annual basis of income would arise differently from the residual payment of collateral.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Yeah and I do appreciate that you can't comment on a specific company relationship. Apologies to that. The other question that I had was just regarding the leverage loan sales of &#xA3;3 billion, which was repaid at par. Now is there a linkage potentially with collateralized loan obligations, Fitch about three weeks ago noted the practice of transferring loans, particularly leverage loans into CLOs at par. And said that that was potentially exposing CLO holders to a high degree risk and I know now that the new Finland CLO, which I understand contains a lot of Barclays loans whereas they were two tranches adding up to about $33 billion in Q4 -- fourth quarter and Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, the fixed deposit <mark type="ph" /> question, the &#xA3;3 billion Alltel repayment was just a standard repayment of a loan of a former <mark type="indiscernible" /> acquisition by Verizon and there we financed their banking arrangements and went on. So that was just a straight forward payment at par of the loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of your broader question the CLO you referred to is securitization structure that we put together predominantly to give us eligible collateral for the deposit at Central Banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We retain the risk, we account for it on the loan basis that we -- if we retain the assets and therefore there is no -- there is nothing on the accounting that will be different to having those loans on our balance sheet. Really purpose for this is to help us as we manage the overall funding base of the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. So my understanding would be that the -- it would just shift it from loan item on the balance sheet up to debt securities as CLO? Much to Repo for example the ECP.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I know that there is incredible growth in WRA this quarter, but I think I might be saying that change in the regulatory approach to WAR <mark type="ph" /> means ultimately much greater WRA requirements for trading businesses. And I wonder if you might be able to give us an update on your thinking on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some alpha <mark type="ph" /> comments used, let's say there could will be a increased capital levels for trading activities. I think the there needs to be a distinction between sort of more proprietary trading activity and activity for clients where we think there will be a distinction between them. It's difficult to predict where the regulatory end in terms of capital requirements. We see and acknowledge the general directions for more capital in investment banking activities and our reaction to that is very clear. We will manage towards a relatively low capital utilizing activities and the higher returning activities and you see that in terms of the businesses we're conducting in asset classes such as equities, government bonds, high grade issuance, for example. The best -- the best sort of position I give is, we have actually had a slightly lower capital requirement in the Barclays Capital as income increases 76 or 79% on the first quarter. So I think that just show that you can manage this very effectively.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Robert. Good morning. No significant gains in the figure, just in for our credits?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just in general, in the past you've had write ups on assets acquired and things like that, then in particular we want to mention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are very pure in terms of other source of adjustment. There is nothing really substantial either positive or negative in terms of <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've obviously shown very strong numbers in Barclays Capital particular in the revenue side. Could you comment on some of the features that have been suggested in the market has been behind capital markets revenues? I am thinking here of repayments from AIG, other big gains or restructurings and the reversal of previous marks on legacy client position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I in previous questions try to address the source of the revenue increase. But when I look at it the figures, single thing is the growth in volumes. There was clearly some movements in marks around the year end, I think spreads widened at the yearend and narrowed in January. I would regard that is normal practice and reflecting the market conditions that were in existent. I mentioned AIG in general terms rather than specifics. We've talked about the growth of the business, because the growth of the franchise which I think it's by far the most important aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you wouldn't see this as reflecting a de-leveraging of counterparties previous positions which is something that we might view as less sustainable than overall growth in the market or in BarCap's market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when I look at the activity, a lot of it is good plan driven issuance activities. And do I see more of that continuing? Yes, I do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to the margin, you've kindly given some indication of what's happening in terms of the liability side. Could you comment on how much your hedges of limited that and also what do you think the equivalent gain is going to be on the asset side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of getting, just to touch on the hedges in the asset side, you'll can see progression we had at end of the year and then I think we will continue in terms of the hedges we've got two overall hedges. We have some product hedges that operated on an individual product-by-product basis. We then have a strategic hedge, which is there to manage the interest rate risk on the equity base. Put those together and the impact is about &#xA3;2 billion for 2009. And I should caution as that on most of that is replacing what would otherwise be lost income for those, that's the <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. As a round to that, I mean, could you comment on where you think the overall margin trend for the group is going to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will clearly increase, most notably in the Barclaycard business which is more wholesale funded. It will be increasing gradually over the course of the year as we end our re-pricing, the assets books, but that will take time and will be a gradual increase, I think over the next nine months, 12 months that's a good time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but we're saying, trying to get a feel for the overall net margin the Group level, assume your comments there were referred into the asset spread?</p>

      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning it's Ian Gordon. Just a couple of quick ones on GRCB businesses and one on fair valuing on debt please? And n Bob -- because you reflects that's profits were slightly up. I know you just touched on this in your answer to Robert's question and the released talk so margin improvement is that the main driver or is the fact that we obviously working of a higher asset base with the Goldfish acquisition and spread in the US of similar significance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's clearly got the full year effect of the volume growth, but if you look at the asset margin in Barclay accounted its gone up from 6.51 at the end of '07 to 6.92 in '08 and you would expect to continue to see that as funding cost come down. So it's a combination of the both. The overall balance level in December versus March is broadly flats, so you will see the full year benefit of the Goldfish business coming through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thank you. And then on in the Barclays Commercial Bank in 2008 you enjoyed was a period exceptionally low impairments in basis points terms even in the sort of interesting areas such as UK commercial property, obviously I appreciates the reason that you relative advantage versus UK peers. Are you able to give out any color on the drivers of deterioration i.e. is it specific to the obvious sectors of low level, also is it small for widely base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's widely based, but focused then on the commercial property and leverage finance. I think the best side there is when I look at the performance of that business. We had in the fourth quarter last year, loan loss rate of about 90.96 or 96 basis points. The first quarter this year was about 114, if it's below that 130 to 150, that I -- that we've given you as the overall group level. This still sharing for us good performance related to the market as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then finally just on fair value <mark type="indiscernible" /> guidance obviously since you gives out for us further 279 this quarter and what is your thinking, if its changed at all or do you think of cumulative fair value gains or something which we reverses out overtime or do you see any scope would be to come within your gift to crystallized any meaningful portion of the cumulative gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for us you remember that our entire gain is on fair value liabilities that a part of our investment banking business what we have not done is the fair value, the structural debts in part of our Tier 2. You will also know that we have got a exchange offer that we've announced for some other Tier 2 take to sterling piece and that of course would have the impact of crystallizing the gain, But I should comment that this is the gain we would not recognize today.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Fine. So that there is no change in terms of your thinking of the fair value gains which you do recognize and indeed in both the markets quarter-by-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think my view is that reflects and offsets what's on the asset side and its very much the same drivers just doing that, because it's in a fair value book where we fair value the assets, I think its entirely appropriate.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Chris. I know you've made a comment on the level of assets at the group level, but I was wondering if you could give us some color on both the movement of total assets and total assets excluding derivatives in Barclays Capital since the year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can certainly -- at Group level and much of the driver of change comes out of Barclays Capital. We said broadly consistent, so that you could reach slightly down but to a level that its losses down, is not significant in terms of the overall balance sheet. When I look at the individual businesses within the context of a very small movement, there is a slightly larger reduction in Barclays Capital offset by a small increase in the retail and commercial banking business which is exactly what we would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there will be both total assets and total assets, tax derivatives <mark type="ph" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Total assets -- total assets, tax derivatives is clearly a Barclays Capital driven things that they have the derivatives closed up within their books. But we said to you that the adjusted gross leverage number has remained very stable with whatever was it at the end of the year. That would be driven by predominantly the total cost of the equity base the total assets and the derivatives grows that number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First thing on the 530 million, I think of impairments on the available sale book. Can you confirm this is mainly on the subprime and both align <mark type="ph" /> and how much is the less that the impaired?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's approximately I said 530 of that 590, that's the number. It is predominantly although not entirely credit market assets related because there are a couple of structures where we held assets in the conduit, where we now believe those assets are permanently impaired and therefore I have taken that charge through. As to the broader available to sale numbers, we think we have taken approximately 70% of the available to sale assets that we are holding in terms of write-down.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Just want to just iron out the couple of things on BarCap, if we can just looking for a little bit more detail. I mean you've us a lot more numbers than what you ever would have done but you've told us the gross revenues 5 billion, you've told us the marks net about 2.15 billion. Should then if I just assume a -- this is of average underline bad debt charge for last year. Should I assume the net revenues around by 2.7 billion and then by influence because you've got the pre-tax number, you've not mentioned doing about 34% pre-tax margin. Is that; A, are those numbers correct, and then B, is that type of margin that we should be thinking about for the rest of the year when we are doing our BarCap numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That -- sort of cost income ratio 65% down a reasonable numbers we are taking over the long term period, fluctuated -- as the income line fluctuates, but we do have good variability in the cost line as well. If I look at the 5 billion that -- if you split out the credit market as they go through -- credit market write-downs go through that actually that 5 billion will come down to about 3.6</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just have quick question on funding actually and you point -- I understand you have raised &#x20AC;1.5 billion <mark type="ph" /> long-term and standalone debt in April I think. Could just tell us what duration of that was and actually more importantly do you think that you're going to -- are now feeling in more confident in your ability raise on -- unsupported or un-government guarantee debt going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very pleased to be now to raise that. We do with the first UK issue to raise unsecured. It was 18 months. So it was -- it was a little bit short then the government guarantee but I think the fact that we now got UK bank issuers issuing un-guarantee is really important development. And we are very pleased to have done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the authorities in the US obviously saying that they would start to allow banks there to reduce their capital dependence anyway. At the point where they can reliably raise five year plus funding without government support. How far away do you feel that we -- or from that in the UK, just clearly that's an important point -- capital strength as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have something. I think it is important. We have some feel like that because Tier 2 exchange offer that is currently out in the market, the interim <mark type="ph" /> we are exchanging to would be twelve year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Un-guarantee paper now as slightly different new issuance, but it would be an important indicator of what the demand is for long-debted un-guarantee debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on a bigger picture point here your -- the liquidity position of the bank -- there are various noises around that all banks are going to have to hold or maintain much stronger liquidity position. Can you talk about what you are doing in that respect and also what the cost of that I guess at the margin level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to do the second because there is no real clarity as to what, what the requirements would be but ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But directionally do we expect that will be more liquidity requirements on executions. The answer is strongly, yes, we do and in terms of our own prudent manageably liquidity respective of what the regulator is require. We have spent a lot of time and energy looking at where our sources of collect are, stress testing our liquidity assumptions, understand to how long we could operate in severe example of, for example, the unsecured market close, closing for a significant period of time, and a word to be able to manage the business through anything that they get thrown to us it will fit. I think the -- one of the benefits is come out the last month is that we being much better manages of our liquidity requirement. And I think that sort of positive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I am just -- just sorry to go on, but I mean just thinking about how that may change? Do you feel that you have already made very significant step in the right direction i.e. you nearly done and any margin drag as a result of that is now in your P&amp;L? What you think this is something is going to take many years or quarters to...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much depends hard to know where the regulators come out and my expectations though is that they would look to implement over period of time rather than individually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John. So, if you can -- it was just maybe slightly broader question <mark type="indiscernible" /> maybe up with. Just on how you are managing the Group at the moment in terms of returns versus growth, because I mean clearly some of the areas which there have been limited growth aggressively like the emerging markets business obviously are going backwards because of the combination of the cost investment and the short-term cyclical investment impairment, judging by the way of defections of our sales force you also to be heavily building out the BarCap business in Europe too. So I just wondered if you can maybe just make a few comments about how much you are willing to actually now push to cost leaver to invest in the business, I mean it's difficult timing versus not very much trying to maximize returns from where you stand at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we are trying to manage the short-term and the long-term, but in the overall strategic directions that we've set out are diversifying businesses both in terms of types and geographies. In the short-term there as we set out short-term we sort of certainly go through 2009 and into 2010. We are clearly managing our return rather than growth as not to say we were look at growth opportunities than you've mentioned some of them for example the build-out of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> in Barclays Capital outside of US is one example. The continuing build of emerging markets is another, but we will be looking for existing investments to be making their returns and focusing very much on that as part of the group activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as you do that greater in clearly, John you mentioned it has been very much invest growth. Are you looking essentially to build that in terms of the spending, the revenues that you are making, which clearly have been maybe talking in place of the slight BarCap? Or do you have a certain view of strategic spend you would into sort of where on the GDP this year now to get to where you what to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have a sort of number in buying, but we are very much focused on the return that we can make on equity and risk-weighted assets. And that's because we were very conscious on the cost of capital we have and therefore looking for good, strong margins above that is very important for us. We tend to do that on a business-by-business basis rather than having a market number that we're working through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much indeed for joining us. Let me just close with a couple of final remarks. I'd like to reiterate we had a good first quarter with profit growth of 15% to &#xA3;1.4 billion driven by excellent income growth of 42% to &#xA3;8.2 billion. This has enabled us to absorb credit market write-downs in impairment. The rate of cost growth significantly lower than that of income growth with better business from the successful integration of the Lehman's acquisition.</p>
          <p>That's all for today. Thank you very much for joining us and we'll speak soon.</p>
