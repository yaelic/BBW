        <plist>
          <p>Great. Well, good evening, and sorry for being a bit late. We are delighted to host this meeting for our yearly result presentation, and with my colleague Bertrand Badr&#xE9;, our CFO, and <mark type="ph" /> also on the back (0:26). What we will do is go through quickly the presentation and of course answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Just as an introduction, needless to highlight that 2011 was a year of major change in the Mediterranean Basin. And of course we can remember also the drama in Japan. But clearly, perhaps even more importantly, the crisis in the euro zone. And what I just would like to say is that it's really, in my view, a major change. It's not a question of coming back to the same world in six months' time. There is a fundamental change which is not just for the euro zone, for all developed economies in my mind, to be able to find a new way of growth, a new model for economic growth with less spending, and less public spending and less deficits. So it is a challenge. It will take many years to deal with that, and even if we have, I would say, an improvement of the situation at the beginning of the year, I think we should remain of course aware of that challenge.</p>
          <p>In this year, we achieved results overall of &#x20AC;2.4 billion. As you know, we have a lot of, I would say, non-economic items, and Bertrand will comment on them. Overall, with a negative a global impact of &#x20AC;860 million, which reflect that the businesses themselves, I think, fared pretty well in such a turbulent environment.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, a plus-&#x20AC;100 million net contribution with something like &#x20AC;460 million of exceptional items, negative impact. Again, Bertrand will comment.</p>
          <p>An important element is that we are financing the economy. We are growing the loan book in France by 4.4%, 4.7% in International Retail. We are doing our job. And in France in particular, the loan book growth is particularly dynamic. There is just Finland which does better in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me just say, very importantly, we are also helping companies to issue bonds. We were number three in the euro corporate bond issues in 2011. The beginning of the year is spectacular for our business. We led more than 50 transactions in six weeks. That's for me very important. As you know, the model we want to develop is loans, of course, generation of loans, but distribution and a capacity to be a key player on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>It was a year also a transformation of the balance sheet. Well, we are going to go through this briefly, but we reduced our exposure to sovereign debt. In particular, the Greek one with 75% markdown at the end of the year. You will see that we have reduced our CIB exposures and we have started the deleverage of the Group also with CIB, with a total of &#x20AC;19 billion of disposal of assets in CIB, and at a limited cost. And we were able to reduce the cash &#x2013; the funded balance sheet by &#x20AC;48 billion.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the earnings and to thank that we are confirming we will not pay a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:19) this year, and again, this de-risking, they key element I think to highlight is that we are in line with the 9% core Tier I EBA Basel 2.5 figure six months ahead. That shows we can deliver in terms of deleveraging, and again, with contribution of our businesses.</p>
          <p>But one word briefly on the deleveraging of the Group which started of course before the period 2011. Now, we have started to deleverage but we accelerated that through the crisis. You can see on the slide that in Q4 it accelerated with not only the sale of legacy assets and the amortization of legacy assets for &#x20AC;5.7 additional billion, but also the sale of loans of credits, &#x20AC;5.2 billion, so all in all with third quarter, &#x20AC;6 billion. You have on the slide the cost of that deleveraging, which has remained limited.</p>
          <p>Very importantly also of course, the exposure to &#x2013; of the U.S. dollar liquidity. It was $100 billion for SG CIB at the end of June. It is $45 billion at the end of the year. It means that we have reached in June excess our target. We wanted to reduce that by 50 billion. We do not rely anymore on monetary market fund in the U.S., and that's I think very good.</p>
          <p>If we look now at capital in the next slide. Really, I think here we highlight first of all the evolution of the risk-weighted asset. You see a moderate growth of our Retail activities and Specialized Financing business. That reflect the fact that we <mark type="ph" /> land (6:13) plus 2%. And you see the decrease, the significant decrease, of the risk-weighted assets in CIB. That's the result of what I've just commented in the previous slide. Also a more limited market risk overall. And that translates, as you can see on the bottom of the slide, in plus-48 basis points of additional core Tier 1, SG CIB risk-weighted asset reduction, plus-48 basis points.</p>
          <p>So if we start with the 8.5% Basel II core Tier 1 figure at the end of 2010, we add the net income with no cash dividend, 49 basis points. We add the employee capital increase and the scrip dividend. You know there was a share option for the dividend for 2010. That's produced altogether plus-33 basis points of core Tier 1. In the fourth quarter, we have the small benefit of a buyback of hybrid debt, plus-11 basis points. Again, the reduction of the exposure in SG CIB. And you see a moderate impact of the growth of the other businesses, the minus-10 basis point. That leads to an increase of core Tier 1 in Basel II of 130 basis points. Then you have the impact of the Basel 2.5 at the end of this year with a slightly lower impact than anticipated, &#x20AC;25 billion additional risk-weighted assets, with lower exposure on the capital markets. And I must say also probably a conservative assumption that we made a few months before the implementation and a result which was lower with really the modeling at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the funded balance sheet, you see the decrease of &#x20AC;48 billion and we stand at &#x20AC;636 billion with a significant enhancement of the financial structure of the Group. You can see that short-term funding just represents now 19% of the total funded balance sheet versus 25% at the end of June 2011. The long-term resources exceed the long-term assets. In front of the short-term funding, we have &#x20AC;84 billion of liquid asset buffers, &#x20AC;58 billion of assets eligible to the Central Bank, plus the &#x20AC;26 billion of deposits at the Central Bank.</p>
          <p>Regarding the long-term funding program, we plan to issue between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;15 billion. We have already presented &#x20AC;2.6 billion in 2011 and we have issued for &#x20AC;2.8 billion in the first six weeks of this year.</p>
          <p>A final word on the sovereign debt. As you know, we are &#x2013; and that's for me in particular if we factor a difficult scenario in Europe. We have a low exposure. <mark type="ph" /> Hans (9:31), can you move please the slide? Regarding the sovereign debt, &#x20AC;2.7 billion at the end of the January 2012, for the five countries, I've already commented on Greece, &#x20AC;307 million remaining. No exposure in Portugal. And as you can see, very moderate exposure regarding the other countries.</p>
          <p>The total trading book varies, the figure varies, &#x20AC;1.1 million at the end of January 2012. Generally speaking, we have moderate exposure on the private sector in these five countries when we look at more specifically our Greek subsidiary. You can see we've decreased the loan book by &#x20AC;900 million in 2011, &#x20AC;3.5 billion to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. We have of course further provision with now a doubtful loan coverage ratio of 75%. And we've a limited reliance on the Group funding, just &#x20AC;168 million at the year end, with a policy of maintaining a good level of deposits. So certainly here also we have reduced our exposure to this subsidiary.</p>
          <p>And as I said on the other countries, I think really we are &#x2013; we have moderate exposure, which I think is good if you have a very distressed scenario at least from an economic point of view in these countries going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, we leave the floor to Bertrand, if you can comment on the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, briefly. I don't want to spend too much time on this page which just shows the resilience of the top line over the last three years. The minuses on the CIB front being compensated, more than compensated to a certain extent, by the plusses on the Retail front. But I think we should move straight to the next page, <mark type="ph" /> Hans (11:25), which are the results.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, the underlying figures are well represented by the top-line decrease, a slight decrease of 2.5% in the like-for-like basis, 3% in real terms.</p>
          <p>On the cost front, the figure is on the face of it relatively high; plus 3% or plus 4.2% on a like-for-like basis. If you take into account the fact that we have already provisioned the restructuring of the CIB at the end of last year for &#x20AC;230 million, if you also take into account the fact that the systemic levies are now working, if I may say full speed. If you correct this, the plus 3% becomes plus 1%. And more importantly, last quarter on the like-for-like basis, compensated with this figure, it is minus 5%. So the way Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has reacted very proactively on the deleveraging front, it's done the same on the cost front, and Forex controls would be a priority going forward, of course.</p>
          <p>We have also been impacted by a cost of risk. This cost of risk is made of two parts <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:37). On the one hand, the Greek one, which is heavy. It's an addition of the depreciation of the Greek government bonds on the one hand, and also the cost of risk being carried out at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:51).</p>
          <p>If you exclude the Greek impact, the cost of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:55) is down 20%. This being said, if you add up this resilient but down top line, operating expenses with our &#x2013; and this cost of risk, of course operating income is down significantly, 25%. But it has been impacted a lot by one-offs and exceptional items, which again have created, I understand, some confusion this morning. So I would just comment them one by one to make sure that everybody is on board. It's well detailed in the appendix. I suppose you're very familiar with what is being presented here.</p>
          <p>At the yearly, if we consider the yearly figures, the exceptional items represent roughly &#x20AC;0.8 billion. If I take them for the last quarter, which is of more interest today, the first item is of course the positive mark-to-market of our structured products for a net income effect of less than &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Second, depreciation of our Greek sovereign bonds portfolio, which has an impact of &#x20AC;114 million.</p>
          <p>The third element is our restructuring, &#x20AC;230 million pre-tax, so a little bit better than &#x20AC;200 million after tax. Various small goodwill impairment and losses on various stakes, which together represent &#x20AC;170 million this quarter. And the cost of the deleveraging, both on the legacy assets portfolio and on the ongoing activities, which together also represent slightly less than &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Last and certainly not least, I know it's been the most debated point this morning, is what we've done with the legacy assets. I will come in more details with you again. The total impact pre-tax is slightly above &#x20AC;400 million. After tax, slightly above &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>So in total, exceptional items represent &#x20AC;459 million of the figure that is on the slide. So if you add this figure back to the &#x20AC;100 million, we have between $500 million and $600 million in dollar incomes. I know that we've &#x2013; most banks have been through that exercise over the last quarter, but this being said, it's important to look through these figures and have in mind all these items, which are, if I may say, real one-offs.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk, very rapidly. The main element is that it has been down throughout the year, with some inflection, especially in the French Retail. In terms of perspective, we see &#x2013; we don't see any change. Today, we don't see a rapid increase, as some people had forecasted three or four months ago. We are still in moderate growth, which is roughly in line with what we you have seen the second half of last year, so nothing special to stress at that level.</p>
          <p>French Networks, very rapidly. Commercial momentum is still on. Deposit growth, faster than credit growth, although credit, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric stressed, it is a very French-specific factor. We're one of the very few countries where we have this type of growth.</p>
          <p>The loan-to-deposit ratio is better by five points. The service I think is an important factor. And the main item is integration, successful integration, of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit, SMC, which allows the top line to grow to 3.7%. Underlying figure of the like-for-like basis is plus-1.7%, in parallel with the cost line at 1.8%, here again impacted by the integration cost with SMC and also by the important IT program, making the conversions of the IT platforms of both networks of Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Bottom line for the net income is up by 15%. It's a very good year.</p>
          <p>If we go to the International Retail, <mark type="ph" /> Hans (16:52). International Retail is of course, given the diversity of the business and the diversity of the geographies we are in, it is difficult to comment. There are very few geographies which have not been impacted by events one way or another, whether you are in Ivory Coast, where we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:09) for a little while, whether it's Egypt or Morocco, whether it's Greece or Romania, and so on and so forth. But there are quiet places like Czech Republic, for instance.</p>
          <p>But all in all, the good news is that, with the exception of Greece and Romania, there are no countries where we had declining revenues, which means underlying growing business. Here again with a very important ratio that we are monitoring, which is the loan-to-deposit ratio, which is almost 100%. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:40) 100% everywhere. There are countries where we are very liquid, and there are countries where it's more stretched. But in total, the funding growth by the Group to the International Retail is significantly down this year again.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial performance, it's been strongly impacted by Greece of course, which is basically eating more than 50% of the net income of the International Retail network. So it's weighing very heavily on the performance of the business. To a certain extent, it's unfair with the rest of the business, but we have to make this difference.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next page, <mark type="ph" /> Hans (18:18), CIB. CIB this year has been technically made of two years, if I may say. First half was really buoyant and very promising. Second half of course, needless to come back on the various events which have impacted the business environment, the financial loans and so forth. And the reaction of SG CIB has been very rapid, very determinate. And the deleveraging has been fast and has proven very efficient.</p>
          <p>As <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:53) this is one of the main explanations behind the smaller impact of Basel 2.5. It's also one of the biggest reasons why we've been able to reduce our funded balance sheet and so on and so forth. It's been made very rapidly, very efficiently and not very &#x2013; in a very costly way as for the SMEs' introduction. So that's the first big picture.</p>
          <p>Business-by-business on the equity front, the first half being what it had been, allows the equity business to be down only by 4 percentage share, and this is one of the area of strength of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, with the equity derivative business. And this is really why this business has not really suffered from last year. Again, you should take a global picture of the year; even the end of last year has been somewhat difficult.</p>
          <p>On the fixed income, it's been more difficult for us as for most players. Some of them I think already released their results. So we are down 31%. The third quarter particularly has been pretty bad, or pretty poor, whereas we have some rebound at the end of last year, but certainly have to make the year a complete success. The reality from a commercial perspective, there was no market, and it's been very difficult to be active there.</p>
          <p>Last but certainly not least, of course as a financing business where we are also down to a certain extent by 16%, here again the impact of the deleveraging has been relatively strong. That's where we have sold &#x20AC;6 billion of loans. This has an impact. And again, we will, maybe if you have questions, comment on the impact of the deleveraging process going forward. But that's where the impact has been felt strongly.</p>
          <p>So that's all for the core business of the CIB. If we spend a little bit of time on the legacy assets, we have put together two pages, which is a difference with prior presentations. On the first page we highlight to say that the legacy assets have been at the core of the deleveraging process. They did decrease from &#x20AC;33 billion to &#x20AC;17 billion, mostly by disposal, part of it through normal, regular amortization process. Most of this has been done during the second half of this year. On top of that, we have pursued &#x2013; it's a painful process, it's a relatively costly process, but it's relatively rewarding &#x2013; the dismantling of CDO. That's where you have a huge prudential leverage. But it takes a lot of time. So we've been working on this pretty actively.</p>
          <p>The main element that probably will require some clarification, and I will be more than happy to talk now, and if you have questions, to come back later on this point, is the valuation adjustment in Q4 on this portfolio. You were used to a kind of guidance of &#x2013; a run rate of &#x20AC;100 million per quarter. It's true that this quarter, we are north of that figure for two reasons. On the one hand, we have adjusted the valuation of our CDOs down, given the environment, given the market practices with our competitors in the U.S. especially, and given also the way Blackrock was approaching this portfolio. So we have been quite prudent and conservative.</p>
          <p>This is also to a certain extent relation with the next page where we have also made a big distinction between what is in this legacy assets portfolio. I would say the very good assets on the one hand, and the really difficult assets on the other hand. So we spend more time on this. And you see the explanation for the strategy we will put behind these assets.</p>
          <p>So second element, if you can come back one page before. The second element which had an impact is the part of our portfolio which is protected, if I may say, by NBI(a). And the fact that we have also added this protection by NBI(a) with some CDS.</p>
          <p>If you look back for the last quarter, some several years actually, the mark-to-market of this hedging, which is not a perfect hedging, I mean, there is no hedging in terms of duration volume which is difficult to put together for NBI(a) exposure, but this hedging was profitable because we are prudent, we never took this profit into account, and because we are also prudent now the market has a positive in NBI(a) post the computation with Morgan Stanley to merge the work and the computation with BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>So the fact that the insurance authorities in the U.S. are looking quite carefully at the situation, as a result, the CDS of NBI(a) has been significantly down and now we have a material impact, and being prudent, we have to take into account the <mark type="ph" /> structural (23:45) impact. So the <mark type="ph" /> junk (23:46) effect of this more conservative valuation, you saw the change of methodology again, to make things clear, but the impact of the conservative approach on the dilution of the CDO, and the fact that risk taken, the mark-to-market impact on our CDS, together obviously &#x20AC;310 million, a bigger part being represented by the conservative approach appraisal of the CDO. I don't have the exact figure on that slide because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:15) figures between CDO and within the hedged and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>But in both terms, you could say that between <mark type="ph" /> 17 (24:23) and 40% is represented by the NBI(a) figure, and the rest being represented by the more conservative view on the CDOs. But again, it's more complex with the circular effect between both elements.</p>
          <p>So next page, and this is the last one which I will spend a little bit of time. The legacy assets have reached a level of &#x20AC;17 billion. The reality that not everything either is the same quality. The vast majority of this portfolio, &#x20AC;12.6 billion, is made of assets which are kind of normal assets. Very limited cost of capital. On top of that, bottom is synthetic so it is not funded. And the last thing is that it should be minimal. So all this together makes us follow this part of the portfolios the way we follow the deleverage process of the rest of the bank. So there is not much to say. We will make the arbitrage between capital impact, liquidity impact, P&amp;L impact. So it's as simple as that.</p>
          <p>And so we do not intend in the future to have a dedicated follow-up of this portfolio. More difficult to manage, of course, is the rest affected below &#x20AC;5 billion, the half of this &#x20AC;5 billion being represented by the CDOs and the U.S. RMBS. The cost in terms of capital is heavy; &#x20AC;2.9 billion. It's more difficult to manage. There is less liquidity. Cracking is of course an option, but it's a long-term process. So we will expend our energy, our focus on this aspect.</p>
          <p>Moving back to the other businesses. Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, not much to say besides the fact that they are back to normal trajectory, and the fact that there is not much to say in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:09) very important information. We have to develop constraints on these businesses, and going forward, the constraints will remain in terms of capital allocation and refinancing constraints. Despite that, we've been able to deliver significant results. Insurance has done a good performance in the year where, especially in France, life insurance was not really the product of the year. But we've been able to add a net inflow in our Insurance book. I think it's important to underline.</p>
          <p>And last, on the GIMS activities, here again, relatively good performance from a commercial perspective in most businesses, with net inflows in Private Banking, net inflows with TCW, a significant contract signed by SGSS, and market share which is somewhat protected from Newedge. <mark type="ph" /> Where it is has (27:03) also been impacted by a number of small one-offs at the end of the year, which makes the results, the bottom-line results, not as attractive as you might expect, the biggest item being the impairment cash that was done on the goodwill.</p>
          <p>On the Corporate Center, there is not much to say besides the fact that that's where we have registered the impact of the structured debt, the impact of the depreciation of the Greek debt, the impact of the systemic levies, tax levies, in the UK, France and, to a much lower extent, in Germany.</p>
          <p>And Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, I think you want to add some more words in conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bertrand.</p>
          <p>Just as a conclusion, in 2011 I think we've shown our capacity to adapt quickly to this big change in the summer. When I look now at 2012, I would say we've turned six months and had the page of the EDA. Now, it's to further adapt in 2012 where I think the environment could remain volatile. What does that mean for our business? So the French Retail should further develop by focusing on the quality of the service to the clients, and so we put lots of efforts on that.</p>
          <p>The achievement, the completion of the integration of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit, who will migrate the system on the Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord in the first half of 2012. And of course the mutualization of our systems between the <mark type="ph" /> r&#xE9;seau (28:37) Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord, which is moving forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding the International Retail, we will develop &#x2013; adapting our development in each on country, depending on the situation. If I had to highlight one big project, of course it's in Russia. We have merged in 2011 from a legal perspective. We've merged the systems. 2012 is a year during which we will on one hand develop the corporate business and of course take advantage of the synergies. We have, as you know, the ambition to reduce the head count by 2,000 people, taking advantage again of this merger.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CIB business, clearly the model is changing. As we said, to have less loans and more distribution. We were discussing just before the beginning, clearly the capital market environment is better than expected at the beginning of the year. On top of that, we have a really, really good start for example on the bond business with a lot of operations. I remain prudent because it can change. The environment can change. We remain in an uncertain environment. But I would say so far, so good.</p>
          <p>Regarding also the other businesses, as we've said, I expect them to be able to improve their contribution both on the Specialized Financing business and Global Investment Management and Services, and despite constrains on their resource.</p>
          <p>Regarding the deleveraging, it will carry on in light of Basel III. It needs further disposal of assets with a cost. It will cost some money clearly. And of course the disposal of businesses in the next two years, as we have, as you remember, the plan to free the equivalent of 100 basis points of core Tier 1 with the disposals. And regarding of course the costs, it will be a significant element. Already in the fourth quarter, we see the benefit of that in CIB. If we exclude the restructuring costs in CIB, we will have the implementation of our restructuring in 2012 and also of course in the International Retail.</p>
          <p>So I think we are in line to meet our objective at the end of 2013 in terms of core Tier 1 at Basel III. And I would say I'm reasonably positive regarding the contribution of our businesses. Again, I remain prudent on the environment and I know there will be one-off elements again this year, just to restructure the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>That's what we wanted to say. The floor is yours, both in the room as well as on the line.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Guillaume Tiberghien at Exane. I've got four questions. The first one is on the deferred comp. Can you give us the stock of deferred comp that you have?</p>
          <p>The second one is on the RWA. Just to make sure, can you remind me the RWA of the money good toxic legacy assets and the money bad legacy assets?</p>
          <p>The third one is on Basel III. If I take the current solvency and I add the impact that you had given about 15 months ago, and then I add the returned earnings and the impact, I should basically get roughly 9% solvency without having any disposals of businesses. So if then I add 100 basis points of disposals, I should get 210. So does it mean that the impact of Basel III that you had given and that you don't really want to refine today has been maybe underestimated a little bit?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is a very small one, but can you tell us about the sensitivity of the revenues to NBI(a) CDS to be clear so that we can forecast a bit better for the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bertrand, you can take most of these questions. That's &#x2013; on the deferred comps, I am not sure we can give you &#x2013; we can come back to you on the figure. We have &#x2013; what is clear is that we are cutting the bonuses this year by 44% on CIB. As you know, there is still effectively in their accounting this year the stock, something &#x2013; I think it's like something &#x20AC;260 million coming back from the other years. And we will have of course the benefit of this lower compensation figure this year in 2012, whatever the result of 2012 will be. On the legacy assets, we have put capital figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it is now &#x20AC;4 billion in total, &#x20AC;2.9 billion for money bad, and &#x20AC;1.1 billion in rough figures for the money good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we need to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:52) in risk-weighted assets. On Basel III, I don't think we have changed the figures, and if you wish, there are still some issues at stake on Basel III. For example on the insurance conglomerate, we stick with the calculation of the consensus and we will see how it goes in practice. With the deleverage, we need the deleverage, we need the disposal. We stick to this 9%-plus core Tier 1 in Basel III. So we might review that with you again, but there is no big change on the Basel III impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:30) uncertainties and I think that the insurance one &#x2013; the magnitude is several dozens of bits so it can move. In our projection so far, we will be on the conservative side; if we have good news, fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could improve that by 30, 40 basis points, depending on whether you take the most conservative assumption on the insurance, or on the contrary, the proposal of the Danish. So you see there are still some uncertainty. And then sensitivity of revenues on CDS or NBI(a)...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, I think the fact &#x2013; I'm not sure I can take &#x2013; I can speak of the sensitivity of revenues, but there will be some volatility of revenues. The price of CDS being already somewhat down, like 25 or 30 today, there is not much more way down. But it can go up. If the market in fixed <mark type="ph" /> home (35:25) consider that despite the computation for some reason in the New York insurance department or whatever, and NBI(a)'s future is more certain. The CDS could go up and then we would have volatility, because now, having made the decision to take the mark-to-market impact, we have to stick to that, whereas before we had reserved the profits, now we have to stick to that. So there will be some volatility. I wouldn't say it should be huge, but there will be some volatility, probably more, if I may say, on the upside or the downside, but I'm very prudent given the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The direction if NBI(a) is deteriorating, it's a plus in revenues; if NBI(a) situation is improving, it could be a minus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then it's <mark type="ph" /> capped at zero (36:12) basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other questions? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:18) we will do that through the lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I just had three questions, please. The first one would be on the deposit in France, I see a sequential decline, if I'm not mistaken. The Central Bank data seems to suggest that they were going up in the fourth quarter, as far as I can see. And I was just wondering also BNP also saw some decline there sequentially. And I was wondering essentially what explains the difference between what you can see industry-wide and maybe what banks are reporting on the bottom of basis, and maybe explain a little bit of &#x2013; this may be some seasonality or something?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on CIB. I couldn't help picking on your spectacular adjective that you used to describe the beginning of the year, and I was just &#x2013; I can't help asking if you are tracking similarly to 2011 or not. I mean, that's just because Barclays, for example, said that.</p>
          <p>And related to this, and that's my last question, do you think that the plan to delever has impacted a little bit your ability to pick up volumes in the capital market businesses or not in? In other words, do you think you can mete out a little bit when there is more activity or not? It doesn't look to be the case according to your comment, but I think that this is not in consensus, so that's why I'm asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps on the deposits in France. Clearly, here you have the average page 41, and what we did is &#x2013; I mean, there is a trend to compete for deposits in the French Retail on the corporate side. We launched in December a campaign which led to additional &#x20AC;3 billion of corporate deposits, which of course are not factored in the average. So I think overall, as we've said, there is an improvement of the loan-to-deposit ratio. It's really a balance and we have to monitor that going forward in terms of price. And there is clearly more competition today on the deposit side. In particular, I would say, with corporate clients. But the figure again is better at the year end.</p>
          <p>Regarding the trend, I mean, I'm reluctant to give figure again because I think it can be volatile. If Greece goes back in the wrong direction in two weeks' time, we might have again perhaps &#x2013; we might have a spread. So I think it's really difficult to extrapolate. But as I've said, it's clearly a good start.</p>
          <p>And to come to your third point, when I look at the success rate we had on the bond issues in euro, both with corporates and French &#x2013; foreign corporates, financial institutions, as well governments, I think there is no material impact. And the deleverage, keep in mind the deleverage that we did was of course a lot with U.S.-denominated assets. Legacy on one hand, and of course also with probably non-European clients, where we might not have had necessarily the ability to compete, for example in the U.S. with U.S. firms on the bond market. So I don't think in itself it will be an impediment for us to develop our capital market activity. Of course it will have a cost, the one-off cost if we <mark type="ph" /> serve a sale (40:14), and of course it means less revenues on an ongoing basis. That's clear the figure <mark type="ph" /> you can get (40:17) figure from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we expect, that's what we say this morning, if we achieve our goal in terms of disposing of loans basically, loans are equivalent this year, additional costs should be between &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;700 million probably this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take a rough figure of 5%, if you wish. It's difficult to estimate. It was less this year in 2011. In 2012, it will be considered maybe a bit higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I summarize by saying that the deleverage revenue run rate loss would be contained to what you dispose with no contingent to the rest, it's fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. At least I think a relatively small contingent to the rest, yes.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you. Virginia Martin from Autonomous. So the first question would be related to the costs in CIB, because when you started your deleveraging plan, you said you calculated costs down 5%. But since you are reducing your costs in 2011, I wonder how much farther down should we expect costs to go in 2012? That will be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is related to the deleveraging on the decreasing risk-weighted assets. So if I look at the risk-weighted assets in markets activities and I strip out the effect of this CRD3, then I get about 7 billion of market risk-weighted assets, which is quite low. That's under Basel II. I think the previous quarter, it was about 10. So if you could add some color on how you have achieved that, because I don't think you've ever such a low figure. And also the risk-weighted assets, the operational risk-weighted assets in the CIB, also go down. And I think usually they tend to be pretty stable. So again, if you could give some color on how you have achieved that.</p>
          <p>And finally my last question would be on the liquidity buffer on the Central Bank reportable assets that go down from &#x20AC;77 billion on the past quarter to &#x20AC;58 billion in this quarter, that's stripping out the cash. Bearing in mind what's &#x2013; it's true that the LTRO has eliminated lots of uncertainties regarding liquidity and we are all more at ease with <mark type="ph" /> liquidity (42:45), but is that &#x20AC;58 billion level you feel comfortable with? Is this a transition situation? Which would be the adequate level for SocGen for our collateral, for our Central Bank reportable buffer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will leave Bertrand this question and maybe the question on CIB. Keep in mind the CIB, the people basically have hardly left actually the fair amount we decided for this plan at the end of the year. It's quicker of course abroad than in France, and it's roughly 880 people in France and 700, I think something like this, outside France. But clearly the benefit of that will be in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the risk-weighted assets, again, two things. In CIB, clearly the legacy asset disposal, and you saw in the fourth quarter there is a big figure plus the sale of loans explained on the credit, the decrease of risk-weighted assets. And then, as I said, in the first quarter as well as in the fourth quarter, we have managed all our risk at a low level which is also a result of the reduction of our funding in dollar. So it's something which will remain. We might increase a little bit the risk, but structurally, the risk will remain at a lower level in terms of market risk than before the end of June 2011. So after that, on the capital market risk, it's complex because it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:42) and it can vary depending on the compensation effect, et cetera. But fundamentally, we kept in the second half a low level of market risk because we felt that the market could be very risky and volatile and we did not want to have any problem on the capital market. Perhaps...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the buffer, as I think the last question, of course this is an impact of the various Central Bank interventional <mark type="ph" /> structure (45:09) and the fact that we've been there. It's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:10) knowledge. I think being around &#x20AC;60 billion is where we are comfortable, I would say. It's not an absolute figure. It's not a kind of scientific approach, but I think we are fine with that table. It doesn't mean that we...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Knowing that we have also insurance assets which are not eligible, but perfectly liquid, and such as equity basically, for example, you can sell that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:45). We tend to add that in front of the short-term funding because its book size of the balance sheet can move at the same time, at the same speed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To go back to my earlier question of the cost, the 1,500 redundancies, which would be the impact in costs in 2012? Is it possible to quantify it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a figure on top my mind, but it represents something like exactly 12% or 13% in terms of structure. We will need to come back to you. I think the structure of the redundancy is probably in line with the structure of the overall staff. So I think it will be relatively significant. Now, it will not from day one; also it's not for the full year. Consider that it will take time in France. There is an implementation phase which might take the first six months of 2012, to give you an idea.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The operational went little bit down. We have had &#x2013; I mean, fundamentally, with the progress we made, we have made a lot of progress on the operational risks. Now, for two years we have had a very low cost of risk on the operational side. And effectively, there was a slight improvement on the risk-weighted assets of the operational risk, but it's relatively small.</p>

          <p>And we still have, I must say &#x2013; I must say, we still have actually an amount of capital on the operational risk with CIB which is pretty high compared with last year. So that's &#x2013; the way people calculate vary, but it's still pretty high.</p>

          <p>Sorry. It's Anke Reingen from RBC. I have three questions. Firstly on the restructuring, just to confirm, so the restructuring charge will broadly equal the cost savings, around &#x20AC;250 million? And then in terms of the earnings hit from your deleveraging, can you give us some guidance there as well in terms of lost revenues?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on shares, in terms of &#x2013; I saw on your balance sheet you still have &#x20AC;1.2 billion deduction for treasury shares. Would you consider reissuing them? And also, will there be an increase from the &#x2013; like we had last year, from the compensation shares?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly on custody business, because I am basically asked a lot, so just wondering in general, any update on your disposal plans, and then in particular any factors you have taken into account on the custody business? What would be your factors? And I'm just wondering if you can help us with the book value of the custody business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will leave Betrand <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:51). On the shares, we don't intend to reissue these shares, on the treasury share. Yes, there should be also a capital increase result to the staff. It's a policy we've had so far every year.</p>
          <p>On the disposal plan, I will be consistent in the way I answer these questions, because I've always said, and I stick to that, that the best way to destroy value and do a bad sale is to say that you are selling an asset and design these assets. So I'm not masochist.</p>
          <p>Let me just say that the regarding the custody, fundamentally it does not require liquidity &#x2013; to a certain extent, on the contrary &#x2013; and does not use a lot of capital. So clearly, it's not a priority to dispose of such an asset compared with other assets.</p>
          <p>And I think we are doing good business and are improving a winning business on the commercial side, and we want of course to further improve the cost-to-income ratio. This business is of course impacted by the evolution of the markets, as you know.</p>
          <p>Perhaps on the...</p>

          <p>Yes, the two questions. I'm not sure we said that the restructuring costs would be equal to the restructuring benefit. I think we just say that we would come back to you to assess what would be the run rate of the restructuring benefit.</p>
          <p>Regarding the earnings hit, I think what has been said during the last quarter remain more or less true, which is roughly a &#x20AC;500-million net negative impact at the gross operating income level.</p>

          <p>Patrick Leclerc, Merrill Lynch. One follow-up question, I guess on the CIB risk-weighted assets. On a pro forma basis, the decline by &#x20AC;22 billion in this last quarter.</p>
          <p>And in light of this, first, could you update us on the final deleverage target of &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;40 billion CIB <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:57) reduction? And second, of this &#x20AC;22 billion, how much do you believe is coming from just a lower risk appetite and how much is coming from a real deleverage exercise?</p>
          <p>And I guess a correlated question is of the &#x20AC;750 million of recurring revenue losses that you have in your plan are your &#x2013; well, you suggested, how much do you believe already materialized in this fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you take, if you wish, the &#x20AC;60 billion to &#x20AC;80 billion reduction on the risk-weighted assets, you had half of that which was in SG CIB and half which was outside SG CIB.</p>
          <p>And I would say roughly we did &#x2013; we have done half of SG CIB, if you wish, in this second half of 2011, roughly. And it means probably in the figure, two-thirds is real deleveraging with legacy assets and sales, and the other third, less risk appetite.</p>
          <p>As I said, we might increase a little bit the risk appetite, depending on the environment. But not to come back to the same before the crisis, because of the limitation of the U.S. dollar funding. So that might increase a little bit, but moderately.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:37) I mean, really a limited amount because we sold &#x2013; you will see on the state of the loans, I mean, it's predominantly in the fourth quarter. Out of the 6, you had 5.2 in the fourth quarter. So it's really relatively small, I would say.</p>
          <p>The one-off cost is higher. We've said over 170, or 63 exactly, for the sale of the loans. The bulk of the decrease will be seen in 2012, and it's moderated in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Just a few questions from me.</p>
          <p>First of all, just to come back on the capital deductions, just to understand, double-check on securitizations at the end of '11. How much of that is &#x2013; is &#x20AC;2 billion roughly the number out of the &#x20AC;2.7 billion of capital deductions?</p>
          <p>And also secondly, I mean, how much can be achieved really beyond the &#x20AC;1.3 billion of benefit that you basically guided from cracking CDOs?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just on market risk-weighted assets, because you've done part of that in Q4, I mean, how much more can you actually reduce on the market risk-weighted assets to mitigate the impact from, let's say, Basel III? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That one we'll come back. We'll describe it on the legacy assets.</p>
          <p>Again, on the capital markets risk, as I said, now we had overall a low figure in the second half. I would guess that, everything being equal, we might increase that a little bit, as I said, in 2012. And after that, we will have to factor the Basel III effect.</p>
          <p>Perhaps on the legacy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the legacy asset, I think it's Slide 11. &#x20AC;2 billion related to CDOs and our U.S. RMBS basically today. How much more can we achieve, is that your question, Delphine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is difficult. I mean, this is a painful and long process. And again, it will be really an arbitrage going forward. How much do we need and how much we are ready to lose, basically.</p>
          <p>So you are on page &#x2013; maybe, <mark type="ph" /> Hans (56:22), if you can go to the 17, that's our kind of run rate, run rate impact. We can go further down the road, probably <mark type="ph" /> at the cost. (56:34) So it will really depend on where we are.</p>
          <p>So it's not totally within our hands, but to a certain extent, within our hands, given the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I just would like to say &#x2013; so we have in mind to further gain &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the next two years in terms Basel III.</p>
          <p>What I think I would like to highlight is two things. First of all, I distinguish this deduction from a structural deduction. I mean, if you run insurance for example, you might have a cost in your Basel III calculation, which will stay as long as you have insurance, and forever. Here, we took about a figure, which will further reduce going forward.</p>
          <p>And we have, to a certain extent, an arbitrage between P&amp;L and capital. But what is important is that there is a lot of capital which is already deducted. And to a certain extent, what we are looking at is, even if it hurts the P&amp;L, to have something which might create capital.</p>
          <p>So now it's a question of looking really at each CDO. It's not that easy to plan. But again, we have in mind to make progress. And if we were to carry on with the curb, 2014, 2015, this figure would go of course further down.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; if I may say, the investment-grade legacy assets &#x2013; you see also Page 18, the profile, the amortization profile, which is very significant, because you have here on the slide the funded profile. And on the unfunded assets, 85% mature before 2014. So here it uses something like &#x20AC;1.1 billion of capital, &#x20AC;1.2 billion in Basel III. As you can see, the bulk will amortize naturally.</p>
          <p>And again, we &#x2013; it's a question of arbitrating effectively, trying to anticipate. But then we lose some carry. Like with any loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>We have question from Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions.</p>
          <p>So the first one was just to think about the financing business again. And if we look at the kind of year-on-year decline that you had in your financing revenues, obviously stripping out the cost that was associated with the disposal, it looks like about a &#x20AC;200-million decline. And if I annualize that, that suggests an &#x20AC;800-million lower run rate.</p>
          <p>And I know in the past, you've guided to the &#x20AC;750 million kind of recurring impact of your delevering. But just trying to understand, why is the impact so high already, if we're still at the earlier stages, should I say, of the deleveraging process?</p>
          <p>Second question was &#x2013; and I may have missed the answer to this, but are you providing any broad guidance on how we should think about legacy asset losses for the quarter, for 2012?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, just wanted to double-check again, the mitigation guidance that you've provided in the past, which I think cumulatively was around &#x20AC;40 billion to &#x20AC;45 billion, does this mitigation guidance still hold against Basel 2.5 and Basel III? And what part of that has already been achieved? So to help me kind of model a bit better the Basel III impact? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not provided guidance for the legacy assets. And Bertrand will comment. Again, as I said, that might be also depending on what we are cracking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question is on P&amp;L impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In P&amp;L, if you wish, in terms of cost of risk and dismantling of CDO, we will see what we will do exactly.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financing, you can't extrapolate a fourth quarter which was still a quarter where there was overall low activity from the clients. Traditionally, you have more activity to a certain extent on the fourth quarter. But here, you had a full half year during which the activity on the corporate side was pretty low, on the financing side was pretty low with the crisis.</p>
          <p>So we stick to something like again &#x20AC;750 million of recurrent impact. Again, we will see what we deleverage. The reason of deleveraging, it varies a little bit. We try to sell when we have a price which is reasonable. So the reason of deleveraging could also vary a little bit in 2012, depending on the appetite we see on the markets.</p>
          <p>And then the mitigation of the &#x20AC;45 billion, I'm not sure it's on the Basel III calculation because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What are you referring to here, Kinner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Accumulations of guidance that I thought had been provided over the last kind of year and a half, basically in terms of how much overall mitigation there will be against Basel 2.5 and Basel III.</p>
          <p>And I think initially we may have started with a &#x20AC;20 billion, &#x20AC;25 billion number. And then I think we &#x2013; once we were told there was another 50 basis points of mitigation. Overall I have in mind &#x20AC;40 billion to &#x20AC;45 billion, but I could be wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no problem. I think if it refers to a one year and a half, I think it's difficult to reconcile with what happened with the deleveraging which took place, which was accelerated. We have &#x2013; and then we said a low impact of Basel 2.5 compared with our previous estimate, and by something like &#x20AC;7 billion, &#x20AC;8 billion.</p>
          <p>It's difficult to reconcile with a calculation which comes back so far. So I mean, I think it's not an easy exercise, that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So from here, if we are on Basel 2.5, what should we, just as a reminder, assume for the Basel III inflation and any litigation against the Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The litigation against Basel III, it will be &#x2013; again, there are the uncertainties we discussed about &#x2013; for example, on the insurance side, and further deleverage. Basically, it's further deleverage, both on the legacy assets. As we said, &#x20AC;1.5 billion overall in Basel III terms, and of course the benefits of the further deleveraging that we are going to take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the inflation to start off with from Basel III?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impact of Basel III. But at 2013, it will depend on the structure of the deleveraging that has taken place over that period.</p>
          <p>We will in due course give you the figure, if you wish, the <mark type="ph" /> cumulative (1:04:45) figure. But at this stage, we have not changed the estimate on Basel III itself.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. Jeremy Sigee from Barclays Capital. Two questions on funding, if I could.</p>
          <p>Actually on Slide 6, you show your medium- and long-term funding, the &#x20AC;130 million, which I think has come from &#x20AC;119 million in the previous quarter. So it's quite a chunky increase. It looks like in your bullets the long-term funding program is adding &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;3 billion a quarter only. So I wanted to understand what are the other material components of that increase? I think I'm right in understanding the LTRO is in that category. Perhaps you could confirm that. But I wondered what other material elements are adding so much to that jump in MLT finance?</p>
          <p>And then second related question is we've seen a number of other banks, including euro zone banks, re-access public-term debts since the start of the year. And I just wondered how close you feel you are to that point, and what you feel you need to do to be able to access that? Because it would be very positive signaling value, if you could.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; because we were in close period. And we can't two weeks before issue. That's clearly something we will consider in a short period of time.</p>
          <p>Again, let's wait and see how the market moves. It was clearly open. Let's see how Greece develops. I think it could change effectively the direction of the market potentially.</p>
          <p>Regarding the change, yes, I think it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:43) in LTRO, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thibault Nardin from Morgan Stanley. Two quick questions from my side. The first one is actually on Greece, if you could please elaborate a little bit on how you reduced the balance I think provided <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:09) between I guess ELA and GLCIO, and how much more room you would get in terms of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:17) in case you lose additional deposits?</p>
          <p>And my last question would be, if you could please quickly elaborate on why the shadow P&amp;L gapped out this quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Greece, basically we are not choosing the ELA. It's basically more eligible assets to the Central Bank, plus a policy to maintain deposits at a good level. And as you know, the LTRO is not used by Greece.</p>
          <p>And then on the shadow P&amp;L, which slide is it? You mean it's on the assets which were transferred on the banking books? It's Page 27. It's the CDO, I think, we'd say on the CDO probably. The adjustment evaluation of the CDO also. We can come back to you on that, but I would think it's the same translation of the adjustment of the CDO which are in the banking books, because we talked about it on the trading book, but I would say it's probably the same methodology on the banking book and explain the bulk of the valuation of the shadow P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>&lt; A &#x2013; [074Y4C-E Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a]&gt;: It's fair to say that the valuation of the Blackrock is about &#x20AC;2 billion higher, just under &#x20AC;2 billion higher, than our fair value as recorded here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have the comparison with Blackrock I would think like we give every time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on Page 53.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Page 53, yes. Page 53, you can see both on the OCI and on the loan of held-to-maturity and loan and receivables portfolio the difference with Blackrock, half their value, and the accounting in the balance sheet. And still a positive gap for &#x20AC;1.4 billion. So there was an adjustment by Blackrock. We followed the adjustment and basically fundamentally maintained more or less the same differences during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Other questions? Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, going back to the impact of the deleveraging program, those &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;700 million, let's say, losses on sale of assets and so on and so forth, because you've said that, as of now, you can quantify the impact of the &#x2013; the P&amp;L impact of the cracking of CDOs. So just to clarify, where would this &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;700 million come from? Would it be sale of credits, sale of money good assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you wish, what we say is the money good assets, to a certain extent, would be managed like any loans, because they are investment-grade assets and there is no reason when we arbitrate the portfolio to have a particular focus on these assets and not on globally the portfolio. Overall, if we were to sell at 5% cost between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;15 billion, it means a one-off cost between &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;750 million, so that's roughly the kind of assumption we have. It might be more in terms of size of the loans or less. It might be a bit better cost than 5% or perhaps <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:11). It's an assumption. What is clear, in 2011, we did better in terms of cost than we had anticipated, but what about the market? It's clear that there is appetite. I mean, we are in a world where there is a lot of dollars available, a lot appetite for U.S.-dollar assets, and it's predominantly what we are selling, but let's see.</p>
          <p>And then the cracking of the CDO is another matter because in size, it's not big. We talk about, in total outstanding in terms of RMBS and CDO, of &#x20AC;3 billion. So it's not big, but it uses a lot of capital. And here it's more about &#x2013; I would say more about capital than liquidity, and that &#x2013; with a cost which would be also on the P&amp;L relatively high, but with a capital benefit. And we arbitrate, and it's again difficult to give a guidance. There are opportunities which can be there on the market at some point. You have to take hold of the structure and then dismantle the CDO. It really depends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Sorry, just one last question. How much of the &#x20AC;1.3 billion CDO cracking do you intend to do? How much has been already done as of today?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

We were at the end of 2010 at &#x20AC;5.9 billion. We are at &#x20AC;4 billion at the end of 2011. So in one year, we have freed close to &#x20AC;2 billion, out of which &#x20AC;1.3 billion followed the CDO of &#x2013; the dismantling of CDO.</p>

          <p>A small question on the deposits. You published in Q2 and Q4 the breakdown between deposits and repo within the deposits, and actually if we look at the repo, they went up quite a lot between Q2 and Q4. And then the core deposit went down quite a lot. So how did you manage to basically &#x2013; it's not in the &#x2013; it's going to be in the financial statements. Do you view those repos much more unstable and how do you think you can address this element?</p>

          <p>Well, if you wish, we use repos particularly as an alternative source of funding in dollars. There could be &#x2013; again, typically, the kind of arbitrage we can have this is either sell the asset because they are typically money good assets, or refinance the assets with new repos or with new liquidity. I mean, so it's difficult again to say it would be automatic or not. That's really the bulk I have in mind in terms of increase in the second half.</p>
