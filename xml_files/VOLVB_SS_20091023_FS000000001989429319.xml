          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's conference call on the report on first nine months 2009. It will start with a presentation and thereafter there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson, CEO of Volvo. Mr. Johansson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good afternoon and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us on the conference call for the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>I have in the room together with me our CFO and our business area leaders as we normally do, and I also have our IR people here to answer any questions that you may have after our presentation.</p>
          <p>We have also made available to you over our site, Volvo site, the slides that we will be speaking to, and I'm looking now at slide two that says Group Highlights for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>What we experienced in the third quarter was that sales stabilized, you might say on a low level. You definitely can say on a low level, lower than Q2, but still that's a seasonal effect also in &#x2013; still are feeling it, but things have stabilized.</p>
          <p>We had an operating loss of 3.3 billion, which is obviously a big loss, but still considerably smaller than the six we had in the quarter two. Most of that effect comes from cost reductions being quite effective, and of course from a cash flow point of view we had a successful continuing reduction of inventories, which worked well in the quarter. You remember that the third quarter here with extended vacation periods, et cetera, is a messy quarter when it comes to things like production rates and number of days taken out, et cetera. But all in all then, cost reduction is quite effective in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the business environment, we are saying that we have seen the bottom; we've seen the stabilization. We see Europe bottoming out and we see some signs of improvement there. The difficulty, we think, is perhaps not that, but more a call on how quickly or how slowly will the recovery actually be, and I will be more into the details on that on the Truck side, but in general that's true for all of our business areas that we have. We think we have seen the bottom, and you should remember then that in most of our business areas we have come down by 50, 60%. So it's a very low bottom there. But still.</p>
          <p>Asia, after having taken a little of the pain in the beginning of the Eurasia, now we actually think we see a recovery, in the main driven by India and China. And then also to some extent Japan beginning to come back up, but with the same comment that on Europe; coming off of very, very low levels; levels far below trend lines.</p>
          <p>And then North America, you can say even though we actually see some effect on the order intake there, I think we can say we are seeing no clear signs of recovery. We also, I should say, are not expecting any further downturn there.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide three in the handout, we can make a couple of good observations there. One is that if you look at rolling sales, we have taken off between rolling last year's relevant third quarter we had sales of 311. Now we are coming at 237. So, obviously a steep decline in sales. And that was &#x2013; quarter-on-quarter comparison was 31 or 39 respectively for the currency adjusted. So continuing real decline there. You see us clocking 48 billion there compared to 70 last year.</p>
          <p>Operating income then obviously worse than Q3 last year and better than Q2 this year as cost reductions bit. If you look at the pie chart up to the right-hand side of that slide you see interesting things there. First of all that Asia is now significantly bigger than North America, and of course the Group's investments in Asia, Eastern Europe and other markets is actually paying off handsomely here, as we see North America and Western Europe having come down to very low numbers, and in Asia, in China and India, but also the rest of Asia actually coming back up. And as you can see here, we also have 44% of our sales in what you can call perhaps volatile but structurally in growth markets, while we expect perhaps North America and Western Europe to come back to original trend line.</p>
          <p>What we thought we'd do now would give you first a look there by our CFO, Mikael, and then we would listen to the different business areas. So, Mikael, do you want to talk to slide four?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Leif, and yes, right. Page four, which is the annual cost level development that we have talked to you before about and activities there to bring down the cost with 21 billion stocking off by the end of Q8, '08, until end of 2009. And I'm glad here to report that we are on track according to the cost reduction plans we have presented.</p>
          <p>We still have some way to go, as you can see here, but until the end of Q3 we are on track here. And it also is starting to be seen in the P&amp;L statement, and we stated earlier here that you will see a gradual improvement starting really in the second half of the year. And I think it's fair to say that the Q3 improvements here on our P&amp;L is proving that. And we are making good progression in all areas where we are reviewing the costs, and especially as you can see here in the OpEx area also where we have certainly good traction when it comes to the admin costs. But we are not done here and work continues to reduce cost as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Let me then move on to page five. We have added in a slide here to better show you the underlying performance. As you can see in the middle of the page there, we have a number of one-offs, which we went through in the Q2, amounting to 2.4 billion. We also have some of them in the third quarter amounting to 600 here, which then if we then adjust the operating income with those items, we see an improvement of almost 1.5 billion from Q2 to Q3. So certainly here we see improvements in the cost structure, and this despite the sales drop between the quarter of 11%.</p>
          <p>Then on top of that, of course, we have the under absorption of 2.5 billion in the third quarter, but also that is an improvement from Q2 to Q3 and we will know that in Q3 we have then the vacation effect with the extended vacation period here amounting almost to two months. So, also improvements down there.</p>
          <p>Moving on then to cash flow on page six. We also here see significant improvement yet again between the quarters, now coming down to a negative cash flow of 1.4 from the 2.9 we had in Q2. So, you could say that the trend break we stated in the second quarter is getting us now the confirmation here with the improvement, relative improvement here in Q3.</p>
          <p>And also here, of course, we are affected from the extended vacation period, and we have mentioned before that the third quarter will be a tough one from a cash flow perspective due to the extended vacation period. And we saw that inside the quarter also where the cash flow gradually improved as we progressed into the quarter. But certainly cash flow will continue to be a top priority in the Group together with cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Moving down to page seven and working capital, which is the big contribution in the improvement of cash flow. As you can see, we have then a positive 1.8 billion coming from working capital with a big portion contributed to inventory reductions, which we see here is 3.4 billion. And we have had a good pace of inventory reduction through the last two quarters I would say. And we have, especially on the new equipment side, achieved a lot, but more to come when it comes to the use side, which in the beginning of the year was actually increasing, but we now see that we also are decreasing the used equipment inventory. So, good progression across the group, both for new and used equipment as we have gone through the third quarter here.</p>
          <p>And, of course, when it comes to inventory, we are focusing both on the right-sizing portion of the inventory, but also to make sure that we have process improvements to bring down the total &#x2013; kept it tied up in the total pipeline here. So, work is going on, on two fronts here really.</p>
          <p>Payables. Negative 0.7 billion, and that's what we talked about earlier on here, is the vacation effect you could say. And, as we move forward here, with improved production we should see more positive effects coming from payables.</p>
          <p>Worth mentioning also at this time is the item, "Other" here, and the 2.5 billion, which is a higher number than usual. And this is related to, we'll call it salary-related costs. You have here vacation, payouts, social costs and tax costs in relation to that, and it's higher due to the extended vacation period. But you always have this seasonal effect in the third quarter. But I can also here report good traction across the business areas here in the overall working capital improvements.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to page eight, where you can see the current status when it comes to the net financial position and the net debt-to-equity ratio, which now is 85.8%. But as you can see, we have stabilized the net debt-to-equity ratio between the quarters here. We have been helped by the currency with 1.9 billion in the quarter, but we should also remember here that, compared to the start of this journey in the beginning of 2008 here, we still have negative effect coming from the currency and overall ratio here.</p>
          <p>But the stabling situation and the work towards the 40, which we are still committed to over time here, is going on with the working capital and the cost reduction activities as the main contributor, of course.</p>
          <p>Finally then, before I end my part of the presentation, page nine and the funding and liquidity situation. We continue here to have a conservative approach, I would say, and have improved our liquidity position, 64.5 billion, split it up into two tranches here; 33.5 in liquid assets and 31 billion in undrawn Committed Facilities. And the Committed Facilities here consist of three tranches, none of them have any rating triggers or covenants in them.</p>
          <p>In the quarter here, we have also entered into the U.S. bond market where we have issued a bond, 5 1/2 year, 750 million, with a good reception I would say, and we're very pleased to see that we now have a new market to be present in. And the U.S. bond market is also the market, which is very deep and broad over time. So it's a good opportunity that has opened up for us here.</p>
          <p>The maturity structure is also, of course, in focus and as you can see it's very limited refinancing need for and during 2010. It's really when you get into 2012 where we start to see any bigger amounts that needs to be refinanced. So, a good profile on our liquidity and funding positioning, I would say.</p>
          <p>Let me also mention here in connection with the final part of the presentation here, the new hedging policy I mentioned on the press conference earlier. Starting Q4, we have introduced a new hedging policy in the Volvo Group where we will hedge only firm flows. Before we hedged up to 12 months, but it was based on forecast. Now it's firm flows which remain at hedging contracts and hedging activities will be much shorter. I would say we're probably talking about three to four month's time horizon in that. And when we change the hedging policy here, it will also include an accounting change where we will not apply hedge accounting to these contracts going forward. However, the contract that is already made before the switchover here, meaning any contract taken before September 30, there we will continue to apply hedge accounting until they mature. And you can read more about this accounting change and this hedging policy change in the report under Accounting Principles there.</p>
          <p>So I think I will stop my presentation there, Leif. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me do a short presentation on the Truck side, and start with slide 10 there. You see net sales dropping from 46 to 30 and shaving off basically 50 billion Swedish kroner on 12 months rolling there. And, of course that comes from a continued depressed demand for new vehicles that, with the exception of Latin America, India and China, we are all actually way down below historic trend lines and we are, by any measurement you can say, at very low demand. That was reflected then in our sales, which was down by 42% adjusted for currency. We did come in with a less operating loss, but still a considerable loss. Most of that, of course, driven by the downturn in sales, and with that absorption and other costs, but offset also by good development on cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Inventories of new trucks, they were reduced by another 19%, which means that we are beginning to come in line when it comes to new trucks in most of our markets. There are exceptions to that, for example, in Spain or even France, but most of the parts we are now beginning to see a reasonable good turnover rate of inventory, even at these low levels of sales. That does not really reflect on the used truck situation. Even though that's improved since quarter two, we still feel that there's too much used truck inventory out there.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we are focusing on here is clearly rightsizing operations. And we are very intensely looking at making sure that, when production rates now go up a little here, that we actually can again rate that up, a slight upward trend with cost efficiency and productivity. And then, of course, we are happy to note that we are &#x2013; we feel quite ready for the U.S. 10 new emission regulations that are coming in 1/1, January 2010. We will be delivering the cleanest truck that we have seen any place before. We think we can do that within the cost and price that we have said before, and we think we can also do that with good fuel efficiency. So, clean and fuel-efficient will be the tone for the 2010 introduction of new trucks then.</p>
          <p>The trouble with that, of course, is that it does impact a couple of messy quarters here on how will inventories of old engines be built into new trucks in first quarter, et cetera. So, it provides for a little messy first half of 2009 in the U.S.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 11, there you see heavy-duty truck market in Europe and there are two things to note on that slide. One is, of course, the very dramatic drop that we have. We have now sales, which we confirm for 2009, to be about more than 50% down. It actually goes back all the way to the '90s to see markets as low as that. And we have, we think, data to support &#x2013; to say that we think this is the bottom, that we will not see a further downturn in '10. And there's quite a lot of speculation and discussion about that, what that really means in media. What it does mean is that we think we have order intake and sufficient data to say that the market won't go down in '10, but we are certainly not calling a quick upturn or anything like that. We are trying to have a balanced view here and make sure that we can deliver good value, even at these low levels of new truck deliveries.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 12, you see the heavy-duty truck market in North America, and you see actually here the prolonged downturn that we've had there. Again, our expectations are that 2010 will be a higher number than 2009. We are seeing some acceleration towards the end of the year in 2009 of 2007 products, or U.S. '07 products. It might mean that we have a little different start of the year in 2010 here. On the other hand, if there is a pre-buy and perhaps there is a slight pre-buy here, then the numbers are not such that they would go down anything much out of '10. So I think we will see there &#x2013; as the economy recovers we will see an also upturn in 2010 markets.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 13, there are a couple of interesting points to note on that. First of all, of course, is that you see the down &#x2013; on the graph you see the downturn that bottomed out in Q4 '08. And of course that came as we had lots of cancellations, especially in our European order books, and came down very much. Then you see a quarter-on-quarter progression of about 20% between Q2 and Q3 and actually you can now see that we &#x2013; from Q4 '08, which seemed to be the bottom, we have gradually increased them from 13,000 up to 32,000.</p>
          <p>There is actually a couple of more points to be made on this slide. One is that Europe is down. We think most of that is the seasonal effect, but it certainly points to the fact that we don't see a quick recovery there. You see North America actually up quite well. While we think there is an underlying positive trend there, we also think that we have a little of a pre-buy effect there, so that's too early to write home about as a quick recovery. South America is, to some extent, driven by incentives but we actually see in South America now solidly a good development and we think that will remain there, as we do Asia. We see India and China but also the countries around, and even Japan coming off of historically low levels into more, better territory. And other markets, as you can see there, reasonably the same.</p>
          <p>Just, if you take a look on the fourth point on that slide, you see Asia is actually bigger than Europe. Order intake in Asia is bigger than Europe, and of course that is a further continuation on the theme that our investments in Asia that we have done over the past many years now is paying off nicely and being balanced -- able to balance the geographic demand across groups and different business areas there. Those are, of course, trucks numbers but they reflect similarly around in the group's different business areas.</p>
          <p>With that we are coming to slide 14 and construction equipment, and we have the President of Construction Equipment, Olof Persson, to speak to that slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Leif. The total world market condition remains very tough with a drop of 42% in the quarters. Europe was down as much as 54% and North America decreased by 50%. Other markets decreased by 61. The only positive development in the quarter was China where the total amount was increased by 45%, and that's mainly due to stimulus activities. We also saw some good performance in South Korea and for the same reasons going back to the stimulus.</p>
          <p>Our sales of course suffering from the severe downturn in the market and our sales adjusted for currency and liquid and divested units declined by 48% due to lower volumes. But when it comes to the inventories we were able to further reduce the number of units with another 10% in the quarter and that means, since October 2008, total pipeline inventories, including dealers, have been reduced by 50% and this has had, of course, has had a significant positive impact on the cash flow this year.</p>
          <p>Capacity utilization in the quarter was around 30% and due to significant under absorption we reported a loss of 787 million SEK in the quarter. At the same time, you can see that our cost cutting initiatives that we have talked about in the previous quarter, now really start to pay off. Compared to Q2 we reduced our losses with 37% despite lower sales.</p>
          <p>It's quite obvious that our main focus right now is to get back to profitability as soon as possible. And after some further reduction of inventory in Q4, I believe by the end of the year that we will have reached a good balance between the inventory and the present customer demand. We will, of course, also continue to capitalize on our momentum in China, and as you can see in the report, Asia now accounts for more than 35% of sales and is almost as big as Europe.</p>
          <p>We also roll out our new strategy where we will have emphasis on profitability, increased machine uptime, reduced product costs and also focus on prioritized industry segments. And this would be introduced to all of our <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Finally, recently we have seen some improvements in our spare part sales, which is a sign that our customers are increasing the utilization of their equipment. That is normally an early indication that the market is starting to recover. And what we see right now is that the total markets for 2010 will, as we can see it today, be better than 2009. How much, where and in what speed it's very difficult to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, President of Buses on slide 15 there. H&#xE5;kan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Leif. The global bus market continued to decline during the third quarter. In North America, the coach business is significant down. Some measurement US-Canada minus 40%, Mexico minus 70% compared to last year. The city segment is still stable in North America.</p>
          <p>Also in South America we have had a significant drop in the magnitude of 50%. So, there we can see, I will say, a recovery in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>So in North America we are rightsizing our North American operations and that will be ready in the fourth quarter, and then we will have a significant lower breakeven level in that region.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the coach market is down 30%, and also here we can see that the city market is weakening, and we think that we will have a very weak 2010 in the Europe market. Here we adopt our cost structure to lower demands in all areas.</p>
          <p>In the International market we can also there see a decline, but there are clear shifts towards buying in modern buses, and with our investments in the Asia region we have a record high order intake. It's up 80% compared to last year, and that is how we see that we capitalize our strong position in Asia.</p>
          <p>Looking for the sales numbers we are, I will say it's sales are fairly good in this market situation, but we can then see a big product mix change from coaches to city buses, and also a big market mix change from western part to the eastern part.</p>
          <p>One specific issue in the third quarter is that we have some major delivery problems in North America in Nova Bus. We have a good order book there, but we have the combination of capacity increase and some suppliers in bankruptcy. That's how we get some delivery problems in the third quarter. We will recuperate that during the fourth quarter and in the end of the year we will get back on track.</p>
          <p>The supplies, negative 91, very low capacity utilization in North and South America. We have the vacation period in Europe, but also related to the market and exchange. Cash flow is traveling in the positive way. Heading focus, rightsizing them in North and South America, focus on the cost reduction and productivity, because we think that also in the bus industry we will see a slow recovery during 2010. And naturally we have to get the delivery performance in Nova in the end of this year, and we can also say that on the new vehicle introduction we have the serious start of hybrid production and we can say that we have very good figures now from our field testing the hybrids, so that will be very, very interesting to see the take up of hybrids during next year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good. We have Goran Gummeson, Volvo Penta, slide 16 there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Leif. The global demand for marine letter engines is very low currently, both in Europe and North America, the boat sales are severely hit by the global economic downturn. We see some signs of recovery in the U.S., but this is from extremely low levels. The total market drop in Europe seems to be leveling out, but the situation varies from country to country.</p>
          <p>For industrial engines the situation is more stable, and we see clear signs that the order intake is picking up, especially in Europe, and some of our international markets. For the isolated quarter, Volvo Penta, we made a small operating profit, despite the sharp drop in sales. We lost more than 30% in sales value compared to previous years, but we announced to you also that our efforts to reduce costs really contributes to our earning capacity. We have also worked successfully with our operating capital and inventories. And pipeline of finished products have been reduced over this time.</p>
          <p>Going forward now, we are now focusing on managing risks, of course, within our system toward suppliers and customers. And the effects of the financial crisis are not &#x2013; still not over and risk management will continue as one of our priorities. This autumn, Volvo Penta, we will be launching a number of exciting new products in the marine side. And we must make sure that we capitalize on these products when the market turns upwards again. The hybrid system is of course one key component in these efforts.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; or in the industrial segment we have new emission legislation coming up in the fourth &#x2013; into 2011 and 2015. The information steps are windows of opportunities for us now when we have ambitions to expand our industrial and the end business and utilize on the group's engine platforms that are moving forward.</p>
          <p>That's in short from Volvo Penta, Leif.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For our end customers, the financial situation for global airlines continues to be very tough. They're projected to lose about 11 billion U.S. for '09, and even for '10 a very severe forecast of a loss of four billion for the airlines. However, the recover of air traffic has flattened out. Last month was only a decrease of 1% versus the beginning of the year accumulated a 6% decrease. So, we are expecting coming into the fourth quarter, comparing to a bad quarter in '08, that might even be positive trends when it comes to air traffic.</p>
          <p>However, Boeing and Airbus are cutting down when it comes to receiving new orders. It's 75% down from previous years when it comes to order intake. So, upturn in the airline industry is far away. For us, we have been affected by this downturn. Our capacity in our workshops are down 20% in the utilization of our capacity, and even if you see our turnover, our net sales has gone up. They have, in fact, decreased by 10% if you adjust it for currency, but the dollar has increased versus the '08 year.</p>
          <p>If you look on the operating income side, it's better than '08 but '08 was a one-time effect, and also here the dollar has impacted and given us a good income increase versus '08. We're in the midst here of reducing our workforce, adjusting for '10, which will be less capacity utilization for '10 and working with the costs of that.</p>
          <p>So, in focus for next year is a lot about capacity adjustment and doing cost management we have to build ourselves into a future where we still for '010 will have a depressed view on volumes. And also continued cash flow focus during nine eight has worked well and we're going to keep up that work when it comes to cash flow.</p>
          <p>In the same time period, we are in the midst of developing a range of new engines in the business, and we are very focused on execution of those contracts during the second period for the engines, as it's a very intense work, which we are focusing and executing in these new contracts.</p>
          <p>And that ends the Volvo Aero presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. With Financial Services we had a new retail financing in the third quarter of 2009 at 6.3 billion SEK. This is 46% down from the same quarter in 2008, and most of that is because, and it reflects the lower Volvo Group sales for the business areas that we deal with.</p>
          <p>Looking at operating income, it's a minus three million SEK. Basically compared to last year, third quarter 2008, the decrease is seen mostly with the increase we had in the provision for losses.</p>
          <p>Looking at the highlights, we see early signs of portfolio stabilization. Just to do a quick turn around the world, in the USA we see a stable with a slight negative trend. Canada, a very good market for us, has been stable and it's looking quite positive. In South America, led by Brazil, again it's a positive effect. The portfolio is in very good shape. In Europe, we see a stable but improving trend. Eastern Europe, stabilizing, slightly positive trend, and Asia remains stable.</p>
          <p>We had some good news in September in that the inventory of the repossessed units that we had actually reduced. The largest reduction was seen in Western Europe, where for the first time in quite a few months, we had less repos and more unit sales. So, that was actually a trend break, which was very good. We're continuing to see difficult economic conditions going forward, even though in some markets we see a positive trend break. So, it looks like things are starting to stabilize or getting a little bit better.</p>
          <p>In focus, we continue to work with our customers in assisting them with their cash flow needs, working with them in this downturn to continue their activities. For those customers that we feel have a good chance of surviving, we are modifying contracts, restructuring and working with them to stay in the product. We take a look at the frequency of our delinquency, delinquent accounts and our repos, and we have a lot of activities working with our customers to maintain that.</p>
          <p>Inventory management and marketing, obviously a big focus for us right now as inventories have increased, as I said before. We're seeing some positive trends there in keeping inventory in line.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, we're obviously rationalizing our cost structure in light of a bit of a shrinking portfolio of our managed assets. And that's for all for Financial Services.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me take you through the Group Summary. There on slide 19, earnings per share at a loss of $1.44 per share, and obviously a considerable loss that we need to continue to work with, and we are doing that by moving ahead with the cost-reduction programs that we have announced.</p>
          <p>We see a good work on cash flow and a successful reduction of inventories there and we see net debt development stabilized. Moving forward then, we see markets that are historically at extremely low levels but which we feel have stabilized and are coming up in the next year. And of course, we continue to work diligently with our cash flow.</p>
          <p>With that, let me open up to any questions that you all might have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Patrick of Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, this is Patrick Crevlo from Cheuvreux. Two questions if I may. First of all if I look at your slide number five and just add back these numbers, basically what you are saying is that you would have been at break even on operating levels in this quarter if it wouldn't have been for the production of some extraordinary costs. Going into the fourth quarter, it's typically a seasonally higher level of sales, so can you just sort of without guiding of course give some kind of light on what type of under absorption can we expect? Or why shouldn't make a decent profit in the fourth quarter provided that the normal season of Q4 being a little bit higher than the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have Mikael point out the different guiding posts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know we don't give any forecasts for coming quarter and other period and that applies also this time. This was more to give you a guidance on where we are right now and I think that's as far as we can comment on what you see on the slide here. But obviously it's so that if you have more volumes, the under absorption goes away, you become more profitable. So, it all depends on what the top line will be going forward and I think that's what we have to wait and see. And what is indicated is that it goes in the right direction but slowly and in the meantime we're working with the costs and when that comes into sync, we have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then maybe a question more to Sal Mauro on the FS. Again, also same kind of asking for guidance here, but I'm just looking at the development of your credit provision expenses, and in the last 12 months you've put aside basically 2.1 billion, according to the P&amp;L, for the FS with a peak in the first quarter this year, and then it's been sharply falling.</p>
          <p>Now is there anything that you see given your statements on the U.S. stabilizing and after improving etcetera, etcetera that would sort of &#x2013; why should this trend, why should we deviate from this trend? I mean are we going to go back quite soon to, call it normal credit provisioning expenses, say between 50 and 100 million per quarter? Because what you're saying with say the development of distant market looks quite promising and just looking at the numbers the trend is clearly pointing down in terms of provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, as Mikael said, we really don't give a forecast going forward, but I can reflect a little bit looking back in some of the experience that we had through the first three quarters of 2009. When we saw the developments starting in fourth quarter of 2008, we had some signs, but fully we saw what was happening in the first quarter. We tried to get ahead of the curve a bit by booking much more in provision than the actual write-offs because we had a concern of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>I think we continue to look at that into the second and to the third quarter and what we're seeing are some stabilization and some positive trends in some markets, and I think the issues of write-offs are somewhat behind us, but no one has a crystal ball looking into the future.</p>
          <p>Looking at the different markets in the U.S., for example, it's the longevity of the downturn that concerns me. A lot of our customers have been holding on for quite some time and doing a very good job of it, and we're hoping with the improving economic conditions in the U.S. that they will remain stable and not get any worse. We haven't had many very large fleets or dealer issues in the U.S. and we're hoping that that is the case going forward.</p>
          <p>So, I would say if we look back we took a heck of a lot of write offs. We have a pretty stringent policy at 180 days to do the best we can in writing off the assets. And looking forward, we're seeing some stabilization and some positive signs, and I'd say we have some cautious optimism going forward.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Patric Lindqvist of HQ Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. I have three questions. Firstly, one on the nasty first half of 2010 this year, as you described it. I understand, obviously the different suppliers having different engine alternatives to supply. Should we read that as you see a risk that you might initially reduce the market share due to this, in the U.S., over this -- in the beginning of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think, frankly I think &#x2013; the risk is certainly there. I think it's interesting to note that we think we are ahead of most everyone when it comes to being ready for 2010, and at the same time EPA is not ruling very clearly on what the rules might be for being able to put in '07 engines into trucks built in '10. That means that it's difficult for us. We don't know what our competitors have in the form of inventories, or normal inventories of engines, and we don't know what their build expectations might be.</p>
          <p>So I, frankly I &#x2013; the risk there is certainly, but I think more of a messiness all in all together in trying to call what is actually happening, especially in the first quarter, but possibly also spreading into the second quarter slightly there. But it's more a sign to say that this &#x2013; that quarter will not be a normal quarter from a truck industry in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the issue recovery or not in the truck markets, I just wanted to &#x2013; simple metric thing, okay, Q3 order intake was 36,200 units roughly which is annualized 128, which is basically the kind of delivery numbers if we analyze the first nine months of this year, and probably it's going to be a bit of an uptick in Q4 in terms of deliveries. So, basically we have order activity right now in line with 2009 deliveries, roughly. So, to see a recovery, one needs to bet that we should see an order uptick in any given region and area, and I just want to get a feel for, since you're talking a bit on the recovery note at least, although slowly, where would you see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Patric, I think &#x2013; and this has been one of the difficulties during the whole day &#x2013; I think what we have done is to say that we don't see a further downturn. I think we made the point on the two slides that showed truck market for North America and Europe, that we don't see a further downturn, and much of the reasoning was the same that you just went through.</p>
          <p>We are expecting, we have now note or date that from possibly coming out that the U.S. is beginning to come into green territory and on GDP. We are expecting an auto order recovery in the European market from a GDP point of view, even though at very low levels, you could say. So, I think perhaps the real data we have tried to share them with you in as much detail as we can, and then an overall feeling that there is a recovery coming in terms of general economic development. And certainly we could be wrong on that, and then most of the world would be wrong also, but that's about as detailed as a forecast as we can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And a final quickie on the write-downs you took on used trucks, does it mean that you're still seeing falling used truck prices? And is it Europe and U.S. or both? And then just whether, or was it a bit of the catching up to do in terms of used truck pricing? And <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>There is, there's certainly price as one element. I would probably say this quarter slightly more on the fact that I think we have too many.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. This is Yann Benhamou from Exane. My first question is a follow up from the first one. Can you give us a bit more clarity about your ongoing, your current forecast in terms of prediction in Q4 compared to Q3, please? My second question relates to your cost cutting plan. I wanted to know how much do you think you will realize in terms of savings this year compared to the 21 billion you have announced on an annual basis? And how much of it is fixed? How much is variable? And finally if I can, last one on inventory reduction, your averaging 15 billion. Do you think that you could do better than this 15 billion on the annual basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me start answering on the 15. It think that's a good number, and we expect that to be there. On the cost savings plan, perhaps, Mikael, do you talk to that? You saw a slide there in the package, if you remember. Mikael you can talk a little more to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Page four, as you saw, we reported that we are on track until Q3. And what we wanted to show with this picture is that this is activities that will give the cost saving on an annualized basis when they are fully implemented, and it takes them, of course, years to get up to these numbers. And what we also said is that you will see them starting to kick in with higher speed towards the end of this year. So, we have not indicated when and exactly in time when we will see them in the P&amp;L segment, but what I alluded to before was that I think Q3 improvement here demonstrates that actually these cost savings are coming in also into the P&amp;L here as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when do you think the 21 billion will be fully included in the P&amp;L? It will be next year but do you think H1 or the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think I mean the full effect will start to kick in. I think you should see this with some delay here. So the full impact I would say is towards the second half of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how much <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the production half and let's note here that we have increased production rate somewhat in the third quarter but we have taken many days off of production as we have extended vacation periods, et cetera. I don't think particularly much is going to happen to the production rate but we will not take as many days off, especially not in October and November. Then I think we can say we have order stocks now of between two and two and a half to three months out.</p>
          <p>I think we have a reasonable ability to see what's happening in October, November. December could still be a vacation period if you wish with days off there, so a little more uncertainty on when you come into that. Then I think you should remember when you look at production rates in Q4, while we do expect output <mark type="audio gap" />, still talking about having an inventory reduction in Q4. So not all of the sales will actually come from production but will also have to come from inventory for us to reach the 50 billion target here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But if I'm right you had eight weeks of production cuts in Q3. How much do you expect in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're not right when you say that across all of our business areas. You're generalizing a little there, but you're probably right in general to say we have between seven, eight, nine even across the different business areas. And your question is how much do we see in quarter four? And that is frankly dependent on what our order intake is going to be here in the next month or so when we see what's going to happen in December. And then, you remember our comments that we had with the last question on what might happen in Q1 in the U.S. here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Can you just answer the question for the part which is fixed and variable for the cost-cutting plans, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say that again? We hear you, we have difficulty hearing you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Out of those 21 billion, how much do you consider as being fixed cost prediction and what is the remaining part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have said here is that about half of the 21 billion is related to staff reductions and the other half roughly is activity based. And, then of course you can say that some of the layoffs here, if volumes come up, we need to bring some people back there. What I would say if you look at the total reduction in layoffs, that's more volume dependant than activity-based, so to speak. And I think it's difficult to give you a clear-cut division than on what this is coming back over time or not, but that's how it spreads out on the activities.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Knowing that you don't give forecasts, perhaps you could talk a little bit in general terms about how you see your working capital going on the upturn. I mean, you obviously had this payables problem on the downturn. I'm just sort of wondering how quickly that starts to unwind itself, and while on the subject I would also be pleased if you could tell us a little bit about your suppliers, because we can see you are having some difficulties there. Have you stopped those difficulties getting worse? Now you're talking about upping your production.</p>
          <p>And one slightly unrelated thing, I think I heard you say on the aerospace that capacity utilization was down 20%. I was wondering if you just say where's that's coming from because my understanding is that Boeing and Airbus are working pretty much for halves still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mikael, do you want to talk on the balance sheets on the leverage on payables and receivables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's correct as you say here. I mean on the down, all the way down here the big negative effect is the payables, and I will say the payables effect is quite digital here. I mean as soon as production starts to ramp up, you need to order more material to get you into production. As production are improving the payables. Positive effect from payables will be seen pretty rapidly here. So, we've correlated quite well, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps we should say Mikael, with the expression since we have a Frenchman asking the question. With the exception of the law that was instituted in France, as you know, with limitations on how much payables we can have there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not a Frenchman.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I'll let Staffan answer on the Aero side here. On the supply side, we have about 50 suppliers in the system, that for different reasons we have on the radar screen. Most of them as these levels of production are there for financial reasons, that they've had clear financial trouble in being able to refinance or invest in future products and projects. And we've had, I should say not so small disturbances here and there, but since we have been running at low production rate we have not seen much of that. We had, in Plattsburgh, in the U.S., one of our bus suppliers that created problems for us and we commented on that during the press conference.</p>
          <p>Financial problem and financial resolution perhaps has been the key words in quarter two and quarter three. As we come into, and if we are coming into a growth scenario, that might change into the ability to get production from them. The present reading we have of that is that the banking system has become somewhat more optimistic on a recovery and with that are not sending out suppliers big signals that they will not be able to finance themselves on an upturn, but that's still an open issue and it comes back into the captive area of trying to read where the whole of the financial system and the recovery is going there. I don't think, technically or capacity wise, that we would have really an issue at these very low levels of manufacturing, so that is -- we still have a ways to go before I think we would come into any technical capacity issues, provided the supply base was reasonably financially sound here. Staffan, do you want to talk to the Aero side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's correct about Boeing and Airbus is delivering at the same pace as '08 and even on top of that in '09. What I was commenting was with shop load in our factories that has gone down and that's due to the shift in generations on the wide body side, where we were ramping up for a new 787 in '08 and you know that program has been deferred a couple of times. It also let's fairsus come down between '09 and '08 and also a decline in the military programs in our shop, so our shop load was down 20% in mobile.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I just go back to suppliers? I mean is there any risk that you need to change your payment terms?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is certainly that risk. You actually have a little &#x2013; or you have had all the way through quarter one and quarter two and quarter three, you've had impact of supplier problems in our P&amp;L and even in our balance sheet as you say there.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is <mark type="inaudible" />. I have a question on capacity utilization during third quarter, and I guess given that this is of course talking about trucks, and I guess given that you didn't produce anything in July and August, I guess that capacity utilization would have been lower in third quarter versus the second quarter. And I guess if you could maybe relate that to the under absorption of fixed cost offs, and maybe comment something about September to get some props on what we should have for fourth quarter and onwards? That's my first question. And my second question is if you could give us some guidance on tax assumptions for fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's first talk a little bit about production then in Q2 and Q3. If you look at the, you have different moving parts there. First of all sales were lower in Q3 than they were in Q2. And secondly we had slightly bigger inventory reduction in Q2 than we had in Q3. And of course in between there you get the production rate, or the production there. So when you say that we should have had &#x2013; what's your assumption that we would be higher capacity utilization in Q2 than Q3? Or was it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I go on, if I look on all the three months together, given that you almost closed production for two months. I guess what I was trying to find out was how this under absorption looks in September when you started production again as a proxy for going forward into fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm surprised you're not asking me to give you a complete <mark type="inaudible" /> for each month there. Obviously, September looks better than July and August, but I think I would refrain from giving you numbers there, and partly because I don't have them directly available, but obviously in a month when you produce, compared to when you don't produce, then the numbers become better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that most of the under-absorption of fixed cost was from July and August?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good afternoon. I've got two questions for you then. One about Penta and one about the mix that's in the construction equipment. One of the things that struck me in your numbers is how well Penta had done given the very sharp fall in sales, and the comparison mostly the trucks business. And I just want to understand the -- why Penta was able to manage a small profit with sales growth of minus 32%? Trucks has a large loss with sales growth of minus 42%. And I'm trying to understand whether &#x2013; is Penta got an inherently more flexible model with less operational gearing, or is Penta ahead of the curve in terms of the cost reduction program? So I'd like to know a bit more, please, about what's been driving the different performance there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the mix in construction equipment. You highlighted that Asia is becoming a bigger part of the business because it's proving more resilient. Does that have any implications for mix given the typically lower sticker price? So, construction equipment in Asia?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, all right, we have our President of Volvo Penta here, and I'm sure he will be willing to talk to you about how good they've done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is, of course as you say, it's a combination of mix and cost cutting activities. We have had a pretty good after-market sales of <mark type="inaudible" /> in this quarter and that <mark type="inaudible" /> and on top of that we don't want the product launches that we have done over the years with the idea of <mark type="inaudible" />. We are moving &#x2013; we are moving north, so to say, when it comes to profitability on the product. And on top of that with all the activities that we actually instituted already in early, early autumn last year, we are coming through pretty early in the &#x2013; during the year, so to say, so that's helping us out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mix in Asia, we see and the shift towards Asia, I think that generally to say that &#x2013; I don't see that being a big issue, shifting towards Asia in terms of the mixing products and so on and so forth. I mean we're working with our brands throughout the world with the Volvo brand and as a premium brand we're pricing accordingly, so I don't see that as being a big issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't thinking so much of pricing as more as just I'm assuming that a lot of the vehicles in Asia are just lower specification and therefore are less profitable, even if it's the same quality standard and the same positioning relative to the local market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know the &#x2013; our Volvo products go in and we're working very much in global product. So the Volvo product that goes in, if you take Asia as a total, is basically, if you look at the standards, the same products we're utilizing throughout the world, as well.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions please. The first one, if you could please broadly talk about the South American truck market. It looks like there is going to be a recovery going on, and your order intake numbers are reflecting that situation as well I think. And the second question for Mikael, if you could please give some guidance on the &#x2013; on this <mark type="inaudible" /> working capital, you already provided some details already but I was get &#x2013; I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more and maybe just give some explanation, how should we think about this category in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start then on South America, which you can say to a very high degree or a large degree is the same as Brazil. We obviously are well placed in Brazil as you know. It is fair to say, I think, that they did have an impact. In the beginning of the year sales &#x2013; order intake and sales were down, and then they introduced an incentive program that we think has driven the market towards the second half here.</p>
          <p>There is some speculation that, that might go away, and I don't know if anyone knows that, there was some discussion here whether that has happened, and no one knows that, so that probably hasn't happened yet. There is some speculation that might &#x2013; that the incentive program might go away in the beginning of '10. So we &#x2013; well there could be a little of an incentive effect here, but our overall impression, and we can see that on other products also, our overall impression is that at Brazil and Latin America is not on a downturn, but rather on the recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then the question here on the other in the working capital change here of minus 2.5 billion. As I mentioned one &#x2013; it's salary related, as we call it, and the effect from that is about 1.7 billion out of the 2.5. And, this is a normal seasonal effect, where people go for vacation, they have then vacation paid that has been accumulated throughout the year. The effect this time is that we, in many cases, not only have one month, or a couple of weeks, we have extended vacation period this time. On top of that we're also running certain programs in, on the Whitesaler for example, where we have short-term weeks where they're taking out the time banks and things like that. That also is affecting these items. So it's vacation and time bank reduction, and I would say it's primarily concentrated here now to the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Nico Dil. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. First of all I very much like the chart you show on European and U.S. trucks over the past cycle. I just had a quick question here. If truck freight gets back to peak levels, where do you think that truck volumes could go to both in the U.S. and in Europe? The second question is in inventories, I'm not entirely sure, I'm not entirely clear sort of on what the communication here is. At the beginning of the year you highlighted 15 billion in total reduction in inventories. I think we're at about 13 billion. So, from my calculations we have about two billion to go.</p>
          <p>Now the clear understanding I want to get here is you have about 2.5 billion in under absorption costs. Some people are under the impression that that 2.5 billion could fully disappear once you start to produce in line with your sales level. I'm not entirely sure whether that is the case, so I just want to get a bit more clarification on that 2.5 billion under absorption? And the third one is a very quick one on the raw materials. There was a one-off here of about 200 million positive. What can we expect here going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think a little of this truck freight to peak levels, let me take you through I think a little guidance there on how we see that. If you look at the truck fleet in North America, then it is today very old. I think our calculations showing about eight years old, and if truck freight comes up to what you can call historic peak levels, which is then go back to '06 and '07 or beginning of '08, then we certainly feel that that would push up the market, because there is much of the old capacity that would be uneconomic to run at that. Now, then you fall into the category of trying to define how lightly a scenario is that over the next year or two? Well that all depends on economic developments.</p>
          <p>I'd be a little more cautious on the European side. If truck rate went back to peak levels there, because there we have a reasonably new fleet, which is operating well. We also have quite</p>
          <p>a lot of used trucks, which are reasonably new, that could go into the system there. So, even if we had an upturn on truck freight, it would probably have less of a gradient in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the inventory side, I think we confirmed to say the 15 billion is the target. 2.5 of the absorption, I don't think that you could say at these levels of production that we are looking at in Q4, all of that would go away, but I don't have a number to support that with. I think that's still optimistic.</p>
          <p>On the raw materials side, when the calculation we made there was 200 million, and that's not really a one off. That's a gradual change on the raw material build that we have. And we are noting on the differences. And, of course, those numbers were more significant when we had big swings there, which we had in the early 2008. Now they are less. But 200 million there is not a one off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps one clarification question on the peak in truck freight. Let's say in three to four years we're still at that level, I'm just trying to look at whether trucks in the U.S. could go back to let's say around 340 to 350,000? Or whether here in Europe we could go back to the 329 that you list over a longer time period, thinking, not taking into account necessarily the age of the fleet now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure. No. I think we have a situation where truck freight is very correlated to economic growth, and truck sales, over time, is very correlated to truck freight. And if you're painting a very optimistic scenario of both the U.S. and Europe coming back to good growth numbers, that will bring with it truck freight, and it will bring with it truck markets again also. And that correlation, you can say we have no reason to believe that that correlation would look differently over the next five years than it has done over the past five years.</p>

We have our IR people to your, to any questions you may have in the future. And if nothing else, we will see you in the next quarter. Thank you.</p>
