          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Suncor's Fourth Quarter and Year-end Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Helen Kelly, Manager, Investor Relations. Ms. Kelly, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for listening in to our fourth quarter conference call. In the room with me this morning, I have Rick George, our President and CEO; Steve Williams, our Chief Operating Officer; Bart Demosky, our CFO; and from the Controller's Department, we have John McKenzie and Greg Freidin. As well, we have Jenna van Steenbergen, who now works with me in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Rick, Steve, and Bart this morning will take turns to give us their perspectives on the quarter, and then we'll open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll pass it over to Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Helen, thank you very much, and good morning and welcome, everybody. Just before we head into fourth quarter, I do kind of want to remind you where we are on the merger and see 2010 as I do. And it was a great year for us overall in terms of driving synergies, in terms of getting the divestments that we'd talked about at the start of the year done, repairing the balance sheet, and also forming one culture. So feel very good about the year and where we are in our progress of the merger with Petro-Canada.</p>
          <p>So on to the fourth quarter, obviously a very good, solid operating and financial performance, the downstream earnings, obviously, one of the highlights and surpassed our own expectations, helped by obviously strong operations, good margins, and good sales volumes. It was also a record quarter for us in the oil sands business in terms of productivity and reliability, which is a great indicator for us.</p>
          <p>Overall, the strong fourth quarter enabled us to exceed our full-year production outlook in oil sands. And although it's still very, very early in 2011, we're off to a solid start, and Steve will give you an update in just a moment on those operations.</p>
          <p>And what I'd like to spend my time with for a while here is around our longer-term strategy and to share my thoughts with you as we head into 2011. Obviously, on a strategic update basis, in December, we announced a real milestone for us, our 10-year strategic plan to grow our oil-based production to over 1 million barrels a day by 2020 and laid out a roadmap for sequencing the projects that will enable us to deliver high return growth. That growth will be underpinned by oil sands. Our oil sands will grow to represent more than 75% of our cash flows by the end of the decade.</p>
          <p>A key component of that whole plan is our partnership with Total and the joint venture development of Fort Hills, the Voyageur Upgrader, and the Joslyn mine. This joint venture is a key strategic fit for us. Not only is Total a financially and operationally strong partner; the deal de-risks the development of the Upgrader, with Total paying some of our Sun costs up front as they pick up a share in the future development costs. As we bring on the Voyageur and Fort Hills out of the safe mode and deliver the next phase of growth, we're targeting much higher returns to our shareholders and, obviously, return on capital, a key number for us.</p>
          <p>On the current construction side, Firebag 3 and 4 are both in flight. Construction of Stage 3 Firebag is now 92% complete, and we expect first oil at Stage 3 to come on late June of this year. Firebag Stage 4 is targeting first oil in early 2013. Engineering is about 93% complete, and we'll start ramping up construction in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Looking further out, of course, on the in situ side, we do have plans in place to develop MacKay River 2, Firebag 5, and Firebag 6. By the end of this decade, we'll have a portfolio of bitumen production that's split roughly 60% mining and 40% in situ, paired with upgrading and refining capacity to maximize the value of every barrel we produce.</p>
          <p>In our long-term plans, we're also targeting modest growth in our international and offshore portfolio through the investment in Golden Eagle, Hebron and other step-out opportunities, as well as ongoing exploration in Norway, Syria, and Libya. Overall, this phased development should enable us to deliver increased returns to our shareholders. And, somewhere in the $80 range, we would expect to fund this growth largely out of internally generated cash flow.</p>
          <p>So, as I hone in a little bit more on 2011 in the near term, this year, we have a capital budget of about $6.7 billion, which is more than 40% growth-weighted.</p>
          <p>We're targeting some 550,000 to 600,000 barrels a day of production in 2011, something in the range of 280,000 to 310,000 barrels a day which will come from oil sands, something in the 35,000 to 37,000 barrels a day from Syncrude, and the remainder of some 230,000 to 250,000 barrels a day from our new E&amp;P business.</p>
          <p>There are kind of five key things to 2011 as I look out on the year, and I'll kind of give you an outline of those and Steve will elaborate on them more in just a moment. The five key things for us in 2011 is operational excellence, with continuous improvement on our upgrader reliability. The second one is improved Firebag performance in volumes. The third is to reduce our cash costs at oil sands and in situ. The fourth is to drive effective project execution, particularly this year on Firebag Stages 3 and 4, and to implement and start the planning around the Total joint venture and that ten-year growth plan.</p>
          <p>These are the five goals I've set out for my executive team in 2011 and believe is what will ultimately drive the types of returns that our shareholders expect.</p>
          <p>Now, with the merger behind us, the focus, obviously, is on moving ahead. And we announced in January the amalgamation of our natural gas and our I&amp;O divisions into a single exploration and production division. That group will be led by Fran&#xE7;ois Langlois, who has been with the company for some 29 years and has had leadership positions in both natural gas and I&amp;O. Not only will this enable us to take advantage of the synergies between the two organizations, it also helps make our strategy increasingly clear by forming one single conventional upstream division that will spin off cash and grow and support the oil sands, while sustaining and delivering on that small growth I talked about.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take this opportunity to offer my thanks to Neil Camarta for his contribution to Suncor over the past 18 months and during his tenure at Petro-Canada.</p>
          <p>So, obviously, very excited about the path we're on, very excited about how this quarter went and, in general, the year. We've got the merger behind us, as I mentioned. Our operational and financial results are improving, and we're really showing the kind of company that Suncor is and can become post the merger. I believe we're in a much better position than ever.</p>
          <p>Now, over to you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rick. What I'd like to do this morning is to split my comments into two sections. First, I want to recap and we'll talk about the company-wide operations excellence management system or, as I'll refer to it today, OEMS. And second, I will talk about the fourth quarter and overall 2010 actual performance. In summary, the overall message I want to get across is we are making significant, visible, and measurable progress across the company's operations.</p>
          <p>So, first, let me recap on what OEMS is. It is the combination of the best systems and processes in the world, with the right culture and strong consistent leadership. These systems we've designed have been benchmarked to the best -n-class, including both Exxon and DuPont.</p>
          <p>We're implementing OEMS company-wide, with no exceptions. And whilst it's early days, we are seeing strong company-wide progress, and improvements we're seeing will continue as the system is rolled out and matures, and successful implementation of an ambitious program like this does take time.</p>
          <p>The OEMS system will lead to company-wide improved performance. The early implementation, as I've mentioned before, is focused on oil sands-based and in situ businesses, with the aims to eliminate all major incidents through improved process safety management. And safe and reliable operations are the biggest levers to increasing volumes and reducing costs that Rick was talking about.</p>
          <p>So while our improvements in 2011 will be masked by the Upgrader 2 turnaround, which is the largest in oil sands history, and the start-up of Firebag 3 project, we are cautiously optimistic about both.</p>
          <p>The last six turnarounds in oil sands have been completed on cost and on schedule, and the start-up and commissioning teams for Firebag 3 have been fully trained and are in place. In fact, the team successfully started up the ninth steam generator earlier in January of this year.</p>
          <p>On the major projects front, we are also fully implementing the operations excellence management system, and what that will do is help to drive effective, disciplined project execution, particularly on the growth program that Rick covered earlier. The major projects focus will be on costs and quality, with schedule coming third.</p>
          <p>One of the principles on which will design and execute the growth program is that we will minimize distraction for the day-to-day organization. That was one of the important lessons we've learned, and that's why we were particularly pleased to announce the appointment of Kirk Bailey as the EVP for joint ventures. That will allow the operating businesses to focus hard on costs and reliability. Mark Little, who has had extensive oil sands experience at Imperial before joining Suncor a couple of years ago, has been appointed to EVP, Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>So that's a long introduction, but it is a very important context for the performance we are now achieving. So let me talk briefly about the fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>Overall, production was strong across the company, averaging 626,000 barrels a day during the quarter. Oil sands, natural gas, and international and offshore all exceeded their full-year guidance on production. Oil sands production in the fourth quarter was 326,000 barrels a day, a record quarter, and during that quarter, we saw improved upgrader reliability and higher bitumen production.</p>
          <p>Oil sands costs for quarter-on-quarter were higher than anticipated, higher than the market may have expected. Several reasons for that. That was due to some seasonal effects; some additional maintenance, particularly on upgraders and in situ; and the preparation work that we started for the Firebag 3 start-up. The good news is that that maintenance work is one-off, and we're already starting to see the improved reliability as a result of it.</p>
          <p>We've just completed the January numbers, and we've had another good month. Production is 329,000 barrels a day, so that's the seventh month that we've been able to produce at these levels since completing the turnaround in the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>So the OEMS program is improving the upgrader reliability and reducing the probability of fires in the future. That focus will continue and is relentless, and we will see further improvements that are planned through this year and into the future.</p>
          <p>Today, just to recap, we have two upgraders and, of course, in the future, we will have three. We also have the assets available on the ground now to export MacKay River and Firebag bitumen when required. Now that flexibility is an important part of the Suncor strategy and is unique in the oil sands industry. And, of course, it helps us to mitigate the impact of planned and unplanned shutdowns. And integration, which is also part of the strategy with the refineries, also offers earnings protection when light/heavy differentials widen, as we've seen during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In natural gas, production during the quarter was 438 million cubic feet a day, which was higher than planned. And, subject to market conditions and interest, as we've highlighted before, we do plan to divest a further 220 million cubic feet a day of gas business in 2011.</p>
          <p>Refinery reliability was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, and overall utilization averaged 94%. Denver, Edmonton, and Montr&#xE9;al all ran at utilizations above plan, although Sarnia did continue to be negatively impacted by Enbridge pipeline issues, which restricted deliveries of sour crude from western Canada.</p>
          <p>So let me just briefly summarize. While we continue to pursue operational excellence across the organization, fourth quarter results and January 2011 results so far are encouraging indications that we're on the right path. This is a journey that takes time, but we're confident our work on OEMS and process safety management will lead to higher volumes, lower costs, and ultimately higher value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So let me just pass back to Rick to discuss our performance in international and offshore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Steve. On the international and offshore front, first of all, on the East Coast during some regular well testing in the fourth quarter, we encountered H2S in part of the Terra Nova field. So what we've done is shut down the affected wells and the facilities in which we were testing H2S while we developed a mitigation plan. And that current outage is about 9,000 barrels a day net to Suncor, although I quickly have to say that that deferred production is within our East Coast production guidance.</p>
          <p>We also in this year, in 2011, have a plan for a 15-week dockside maintenance of Terra Nova, of the vessel itself. However, we are currently working with our partners to consider the possibility of delaying this into 2012. As many of you know, we've got an issue there specific around the swivel that connects the production to the vessel, and if that swivel continues to operate safely, we'll continue to take a look at delaying that maintenance.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our operations in Libya and Syria, I'm delighted to tell you that, in both countries, operations are normal and that we see no disruptions of the type that we're currently seeing on TV in Egypt. During the quarter, we actually had the start of oil production in Syria &#x2013; only about 1,000 barrels a day, although we'll be adding more wells to that as we go through 2011 as we bring this oil rim that's around the gas field into production. So that will continue to improve as we go forward.</p>
          <p>And our exploration program in Libya continues. We actually are delighted to announce this morning that we've been moved up to full quota production, starting here in February. So again, you'll see a little bit better production for us in Libya, as well, as we go forward.</p>
          <p>One exciting thing that happened in the fourth quarter was in Norway. We tested an exploration well, which is a Beta Statfjord well. We did test it at 10,000 barrels a day on fairly tight chokes. The reservoir obviously looks very good and very productive, but we have to do a lot more work before we can really determine the size of that particular discovery.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of highlights on the international and offshore side. Bart, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. From a financial perspective, the strong operational results that Rick and Steve have spoken about certainly translated into strong financial performance, as well. During the quarter, we delivered operating earnings of $946 million, which is roughly a threefold increase year-over-year on the quarter, and operating cash flow of over $2.1 billion, which is almost double from the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>I guess what I'd say is I'd characterize our results this quarter as a clear sign of the financial capability of this company, and that's based on reliable operations and our integrated strategy, which Steve highlighted, combined, of course, with strong pricing environment in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operations for a moment, in the downstream, that business delivered a record quarter of $372 million in earnings due to improved and higher utilization rates, wider light/heavy differentials, improved cracking and refined product margins, and very strong product demand across that business.</p>
          <p>And our R&amp;M division continues to be a significant source of free cash flow for the organization &#x2013; certainly was in 2010, and in 2011, we expect the downstream to generate well north of $1 billion of cash from operations.</p>
          <p>For the upstream, oil sands reported $487 million in earnings during the quarter as a result of record production and higher price realizations year-over-year, as well as a one-time royalty recovery of $105 million related to a bitumen quality adjustment. Sales mix, however, was impacted by maintenance at one of our hydrogen units, which carried over from the third quarter. As a result, we produced a higher proportion of sour products compared to plan.</p>
          <p>Oil sands volume was also impacted by inventory build of just about 15,000 barrels per day during the quarter as a result of pipeline restrictions on the Enbridge system, which have continued. Oil sands cash operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter was $36.70. And, as Steve mentioned, costs were impacted by higher maintenance expenses at upgrading and in situ, which will enable us to drive higher reliability going forward from here in 2011. And we believe this amounted to roughly about $2 per barrel of the costs.</p>
          <p>We do expect costs to be higher over the next two quarters as we ramp up Firebag 3 facilities and as we undertake a large six to seven-week turnaround at Upgrader 2 during the second quarter. Overall, we expect oil sands cash costs in the range &#x2013; and this is consistent with our previous guidance &#x2013; of $39 to $43 per barrel in 2011.</p>
          <p>International and offshore recorded net earnings of $452 million from continuing operations, and there again, higher realized prices were benefiting the business. Those were offset somewhat by lower volumes from Terra Nova and White Rose, as detailed by Rick.</p>
          <p>Also included in I&amp;O's net earnings was a $192 million after-tax settlement related to our Terra Nova ownership redetermination, and that increased our working interests going forward by roughly 3.7%.</p>
          <p>One of the strengths and benefits of having an integrated strategy like Suncor's is that, as we move through different parts of the commodity cycle, the upstream and downstream parts of the business will share in the profits. Sometimes move value will be captured in upstream, and other times, such as this past quarter where we saw those pipeline disruptions and it impacted upstream price realizations, the downstream will share in the profits. So sometimes more value will be captured in the upstream, and other times, such as this past quarter, the downstream will see more of the value.</p>
          <p>Over the long term, our integration strategy enables us to maximize the total value we're able to extract from our upstream bitumen production, to refined product sales to the end customer, and ultimately to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet and CapEx for a moment, our long-term view and focus is also reflected on how we manage our balance sheet and capital plans. And I'm happy to report that we've met or exceeded all of our financial targets in 2010.</p>
          <p>First, we completed the sale of $3.5 billion of non-core assets ahead of schedule, with all of the cash in the door now except for a portion of the package in the UK North Sea. Through that process, we've high-graded our portfolio with the sale of our lower returning assets, and we've paid down our debt significantly. Over time, this will enable us to generate higher earnings and improve our return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>Net debt is down from $13.4 billion at the end of last year to $11.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, and that translates into a 1.7-times debt to cash flow ratio. The proceeds that will be coming from the Total transaction will further improve our position upon closing, which we expect to be sometime in late Q1 or early Q2. So, looking forward, we expect to maintain our debt levels well below our 2-times debt to cash flow target and within our 20% to 25% debt to capitalization target.</p>
          <p>Now, with the merger behind us, a strong balance sheet in place, and as we bring on new production and increased cash flows, certainly one of the questions that we get a lot is what our policy on dividends is going to be going forward. And while we don't have and haven't had a formal dividend policy in place, our philosophy has been consistent, and it's been to increase dividends with production growth.</p>
          <p>With Firebag 3 coming on stream in 2011, this will be the year we start thinking about dividend growth again. Obviously, this is going to be a board decision, but our preference is for modest consistent but sustainable dividend increases which are in line with our industry-leading growth and position in the market. So when we think about maximizing shareholder returns, we see that as a combination of growth and execution, and we're in a great position in 2011 and beyond to deliver on both. And, with that, there will be more money to return back to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much, everyone, and with that, I'll turn it back over to Helen.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Since Rick has briefly gone over the 2011 outlook, I won't go through again it  in detail. The outlook is unchanged from what we had disclosed in December. You will find the detailed guidance documents on suncor.com under the Investor Centre.</p>
          <p>A quick reminder that, commencing in 2011, our monthly oil sands production numbers will now be posted directly on our website instead of via press release. Please visit suncor.com/production for these numbers. And, quickly here for our U.S. analysts, the LIFO adjustment for the quarter would result in a negative Canadian dollar 96 million impact to after-tax earnings.</p>
          <p>So with that, Melanie, if you wouldn't mind opening up the lines, we'd be pleased to take your questions. But just a quick reminder that the controllers and I will be available after the call for detailed modeling questions. We'd be happy to entertain your questions now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Rick, hoping you could elaborate a bit, first on what you're seeing broadly in terms of cost inflation in the region; and, second, more specifically, your expectations for capital costs for Fort Hills and Joslyn. You're obviously still early on in the process there, but any sort of original take on where you are in the process of re-engineering those, what your initial thoughts are, and maybe when you'd expect to have additional details there would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, and thanks for that comment. I don't really have a lot to add, other than kind of the general knowledge that basically is out there. My views, and I discussed this on the last quarter, this next run will be different than the last high inflationary period we had, for us, partly because we had a lot of the engineering on some of these projects &#x2013; like, for example, the engineering on our Upgrader is virtually done &#x2013; or 80% done, and also a lot of the materials for these projects &#x2013; some of the materials on Fort Hills &#x2013; but a lot of the materials on our Upgrader have already been purchased. So a lot of that is kind of behind us.</p>
          <p>And we're not seeing the kind of inflationary rates on purchased equipment, steel pipe and all of those kinds of issues on these projects. I think if there is a concern generally, it's around labor, and labor both in terms of availability and also productivity. And what we're trying to do is take the lessons that we learned during this last cycle and try to make sure that we don't repeat that.</p>
          <p>And those are things like not overbuilding a workforce too large on any one individual site, making sure that we do the planning and the engineering well and that we've got the tools and equipment to the work site so that people aren't waiting on that, trying to organize the work in a much better fashion so that we've got clean work sites and clean work fronts to work on, trying to maximize outdoor work in the summer and indoor work in the winter.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of planning. It's really about that upfront planning that's going to make a difference. So I'm not really clairvoyant, except that I don't actually expect this next one to be exactly like the last cycle. Still a concern, but I do expect it to be different.</p>

          <p>That's very helpful. And one more quick one from me, on the Upgrader turnaround &#x2013; the U2 turnaround &#x2013; can you just confirm the dates of that and also just that this will take you through the turnarounds for the rest of the year?</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been some time since we've been able to talk about strong downstream results. And I just wanted to, in light of that, get your thoughts on the downstream, generally, and also wanted to see if you had any thoughts around some of the refining assets that are coming out in the U.S. Obviously, you've got the Voyageur upgrader set, but is there an opportunity with BP selling some assets to get some cheap cokers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, thanks. That's a great question. I see our position really very different than other oil sands companies or other Canadian companies in the sense that we do see our refineries, particularly three of the four of them, very tied to our oil sands business.</p>
          <p>And so in a quarter here where you see pretty large spreads between WTI and Gulf light crudes in Brent, then our inland refineries &#x2013; i.e., Sarnia, particularly Edmonton, and also Denver &#x2013; are going to make good money. And so it's kind of if you're integrated and have enough of this flows between the two systems, when you get wide differentials, we're going to make it in the downstream; when you get smaller differentials, we're going to make it in Fort McMurray. So I think a little bit of that is it just shows the value of integration, and it will swing. I do think it'll swing over time.</p>
          <p>You know, on the second part of that question, Andrew, as around would we be looking at buying refined assets in the U.S., first of all, you do not see any growth in terms of U.S. demand. World demand for crude continues to rise, but it's on the back of Asia and developing economies' GDP growth. And you're not seeing growth in oil consumption or demand in the U.S., despite a lot of sales of SUVs and large vehicles continuing.</p>
          <p>So, you know what? I don't see it as a growth market. I definitely do not see us buying a refinery that's on tidal water and getting into that game, so really no interest right now in expanding our refining business by buying other refining assets. I would never say never, but it would have to fit back into our strategy. And I don't see, for example, buying a large BP refinery fits that strategy for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. I guess, along those lines, any additional thoughts on the Montreal coker project? Would that be just pushed well far down the road to when you might need additional capacity for heavy oil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no current plans. And I would say that project would be somewhat dependent on us reversing Line 9 &#x2013; us meaning the industry. So right now, we cannot really move western-based crudes into Montreal. And, you'll remember, Line 9 is the key line that actually moves crudes from east to west into Ontario. At one time, it ran crudes into Montreal. Well, the industry is taking a good look at reversing that line, so I would say that project's on hold until we can see if we can get that line reversed over time &#x2013; and that's not a short-term project &#x2013; and then feed it from our own operations. That's where the logic of that project would be. Steve, you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The only thing I would add, Rick, is the refining world is historically cyclical and tough. The only place to be in that world is the best. Our downstream assets are first quartile on reliability and costs. And, of course, that's exactly the place we intend to take oil sands.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. You guys have done a great job in terms of outlining the longer term, so just some of the questions I had were on some of the things you'd mentioned going into this and shorter-term issues. But, Rick, what's the run rate now in Libya? If you go back up to full quota, are you back up to 60,000 barrels a day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in that 40,000 to 50,000 barrel-a-day kind of range, net to us. So that's our 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And, just with respect to the inventories, so what I was going to ask you is whether the inventories, you'd expect to basically draw those down in the first quarter, but are you seeing a continuation, then, in terms of &#x2013; I think you mentioned that, that there are still disruptions on the pipes right now. I'm wondering if you can enlighten us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, our plan is to draw them down, Greg. There are some big puts and takes, of course, on the system at the moment. One is Enbridge reliability and the clarity around it. The second one is, as you know, there are some industry production issues, and so pipelines are being rejigged, as we speak, in light of that. So, overall, the strategy is to draw that inventory down, but it will be subject to some of those market impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. The bitumen valuation methodology, I know it's probably complex, I think, in terms of explaining it, but what was the major change? Was it the agreed-upon differential between bitumen and Bow, or what have you, that led to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg, it's Bart here. The piece that was changed was the part of the differential related to quality of the bitumen. And we've been quite candid about this, but we're still in negotiations with the province. This is a first step towards finalizing what that differential will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And maybe just the last one for me, with Syria equivalent volumes over 100 million a day, how &#x2013; I think that exceeds your off-take agreement, but curious as to how sustainable those rates are and also curious just on the gas pricing that you're getting there right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, Greg, listen, we're at 80 million cubic a day flat. I think there may have been a quarter-end kind of differential there. You'll see us move production up in Syria, but it's more around us producing the oil rim on a go-forward basis. We're just getting ready to put our second well on. We'll put a third one on, and I think, by the end of the year, we should have about four wells on there on the oil side. But gas has been steady. That's our quota. That's where we'll be for the full year in terms of that, and that's been a very steady operation for us and a good cash flow generator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just the last one is just on the cash costs, so were the repair costs for the hydrogen outage, those were embedded then, right, in the fourth quarter numbers, and was that the bulk of the $2 that we would have...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>On Firebag 3 and 4, Rick, how about, in terms of the actual costs versus budget? I presume they are pretty in line. Any data that you can provide in here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's in the guidance. We did move Firebag 3 up by about $200 million to $300 million, and part of that was some surprises that we got out of restarting that project up, and the numbers that I think we provided you with here earlier on 4's still very solid numbers. So we did see a small increase in Firebag 3. I do not expect to see any further increases. As I mentioned earlier, we're actually starting to steam that. We're bringing facilities on in kind of every week and every month here, but starting to steam in March and should have production starting to ramp up in June. But Firebag 4 seems to be very well under control with the numbers we've given you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, based on your experience now in Firebag 3, how long it take after the steaming do you think it will reach a steady state of the production?</p>

          <p>Yeah, we've always said it's about an 18-month kind of time period, 18 to 24 or something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's the &#x2013; into the start of 2013. That's a good number, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think previously that you guys had the target that to bring the steam/oil ratio to about 2.5, and Firebag 1 and 2 I think is maybe over 3]. Is that &#x2013; those are still the good number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Steve Williams here. Yeah, those are reasonable numbers to assume. We have an active program to manage SORs this year. Given the nature of it, the actual timing and how it works is very difficult to predict to the month, but we are putting in the infill wells on Stages 1 and 2. Of course, on Stages 3 and 4, the spacing of the well pairs is different, so we will get to different SORs. And we have seen some progress on the early stages. So we were getting it down into the low 3s at the end of last year and, of course, on MacKay River, we've had much lower industry-leading levels down in the lower 2s.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And Rick, you talk about &#x2013; I think that, earlier, you guys talked about the dividend policy or that your expectation. How about in terms of the share buyback as a tool to return cash to shareholder? How you guys view that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, it's Bart here. I think, just looking at our plans forward from here and all of the extensive slate of growth projects that we have planned to develop, that's first call on our cash. That's how we're going to be able to best return and drive improved returns to our shareholders. Next would be dividends, and we think that's the right place to focus, starting to return more cash to shareholders over time, consistently, consistent growth, and we think that's what shareholders value. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Brian Dutton of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Rick. You mentioned in your comments at the beginning that reducing cash costs were a priority for you this year. And I know we always talk about cash costs on a per-barrel basis, but was looking at the cash costs here for the fourth quarter, and they came in at $1.1 billion, which I think is a record amount. And I was wondering if you could give us, one, color around why are the costs so high in absolute dollar terms, and the steps you plan to take to reduce the costs in absolute dollar terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, to move from the per-barrel costs into the absolute one, Brian, you have to look at overall production levels, as well, so the record absolute costs come with the record production in fourth quarter. We have the most comprehensive of programs attacking these costs aggressively. The biggest parts, as I described earlier, are the execution of this operations excellence management system, and the biggest levers on costs are safe, reliable operation.</p>
          <p>You did see, during the better quarters on costs last year, we got into the very low 30s, and that's where we aim to get back to. And we think the main things in achieving that will be to get the assets reliable, particularly around upgrading. And we're very encouraged by the progress we're seeing. So we did have to do two pieces of work in the fourth quarter. One was on the finishing off of the repairs on the hydrogen furnace, which is now back in full service and operating very well.</p>
          <p>The second piece was part of a rolling program of repairs to the U1 coke drums, and these repairs are extensive. Instead of just simply repairing individual problems, as we've done in the past, when we take these facilities out, because we have fair upgrading capacity at the moment, we take the opportunity to fully weld overlay and repair the complete circumferential rings around the cokers. The consequence of that is the costs have been a bit higher, but we will get improved reliability as we go through 2011 and '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I guess what I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, you know &#x2013; Brian, let me just add &#x2013; listen, I know that there is a concern. Just to know, we're &#x2013; as I mentioned, the five targets for 2011, that is on it. It's certainly on Mark Little's list, and we will get to this. You may not quite see as much of it as you'd like in the first and second quarter as we go through this turnaround and prep for the turnaround, but it's our aims and goals that we'll kind of try to roll this operating cash cost over, and you'll see it more in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rick, I guess what I'm really struggling with, though, is the costs in dollar terms are up $150 million from the third to the fourth quarter, and I realize that the increase in the record number of volumes are coming out of the mine, but aren't about 80% of the costs fixed coming out of the mine? And so that's really what's surprising me, is the absolute dollar amount, given the fixed nature of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. And, again, we don't see that as necessarily the trend for the long term. I think our longer-term trend is as we describe it here. But it is &#x2013; as Steve describes it, the key is reliability. And we are paying a price and we are going at this in a very systematic and sequential piece here. There are no shortcuts. And, you know what? Going through this in the way we are gives us a lot more confidence that we're on the right track in terms of long-term reliability. So I know it's uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable for us doing that and seeing that, but it's not the long-term trend.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And one other one, the Beta Brent discovery in Norway, with the appraisal well test, do you have a &#x2013; able to provide any sense of the size of that discovery, and are you starting to think standalone, or is that looking like a tieback development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes, why are you there, in the sense that we have not really decided. We were looking at both. But you know what? We'll get a second well down off the discovery, an appraisal well, either sometime late this year or early next year, and then I think we'll start to be able to hone in on what is the true size and scale and producibility of that. So, listen, it's certainly better than drilling a dry hole, but we just don't know enough yet to really get very definitive about how that ties in.</p>

          <p>Morning, guys. Just wanted to double-check on the turnaround schedules for the upgraders and things like that. You did mention U2. Can you give me the start date for that turnaround and how long it's going to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Gene, we've updated our Suncor presentation for the fourth quarter, and you'll find that on our website. There's a page on turnarounds. We have just narrowed it down to &#x2013; as Steve said earlier, May is the start date of the turnaround. It's roughly somewhere between six to seven weeks. So that's the final call on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I also had a question about the turnaround. In the previous presentation, investors' presentation, I think you guys had a seven-week, and then this one you have six weeks. Is there a reason for that change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You should think of it as it's approximately a seven-week turnaround. These are major events, and what we're calling at the moment is it's between six and seven weeks, so it's just a rounding error. As we get into it, we'll plan it down to the half-hour, but we don't normally share all of those numbers at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And I think you guys mentioned inventories of &#x2013; did you say a build of 15,000 a day, if I'm right, or was it another number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's the right number, just under 15,000 barrels a day.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good morning. I had two questions. First, could you &#x2013; maybe Bart &#x2013; remind us of your hedging philosophy and give some indication as to open positions for 2011? Secondly, Rick, you've got a number of satellite platforms and projects coming on in '11, the White Rose satellite, South Hibernia, the Buzzard enhancement. Can you give us an idea of the implications of these projects regarding how long they will sustain the production plateau in each location?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Bart will take the hedging question and, sure, I'll be glad to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So hedging and &#x2013; the philosophy go-forward for the company, given the strength of our cash flows, the diversity of them, and our plans to really fund growth out of our internally generated cash flow, is that we don't feel that we need to hedge production go-forward from here. In 2011, we have no crude hedges on the books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And none planned, I have to add. Right, Bart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mark, on the second question, so, yeah, we do have these satellites. It's all built into that estimate we give you on I&amp;O production rates. Longer term, the way I like to think about our I&amp;O, and now rolled into an exploration production vehicle, is this is a division which will show growth over the next decade. It will not be steady, and we do have some really big chunks coming on, as well, like Golden Eagle and Hebron, and with the results of discoveries in Libya, and potentially the Norway discovery, as well.</p>
          <p>But what I would see is, today, if you take a look at this newly traded E&amp;P division, we would be just around 200,000 barrels a day, and I would see that actually growing slightly over the next decade. These current kind of satellite high on the east coast are not overly material to Suncor, but certainly built into those projections that we show on the outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Earlier, you said that Libyan production is going to go back up to full quota. On Monday, I guess WikiLeaks released some diplomatic cables that said that the quotas were imposed because of a diplomatic dispute with the Canadian government, and I'm just wondering if you would care to comment on that; and second, whether or not you plan to sell the Libyan assets now that they're up to full production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on the first one, that WikiLeaks was actually a report of something the U.S. ambassador in Libya reported, so I would not want to get into it with comments. You should call his office and ask him what he said, okay? It has nothing to do with us per se. On the second question, we have absolutely no plans to sell in Libya.</p>
