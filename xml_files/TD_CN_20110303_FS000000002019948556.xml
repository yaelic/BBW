          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the TD Bank Group 2011 First Quarter Investor Presentation. My name is Mushtak Najarali and I'm Vice President of Investor Relations at the Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mushtak, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. Colleen's going to be up shortly to discuss our first quarter results, but let me start by giving a few thoughts on the quarter and then what we're expecting for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, this quarter was an excellent start to the year for TD Bank. Total adjusted earnings hit a record of almost $1.6 billion in the quarter, and earnings in both our Canadian and our U.S. Personal and Commercial businesses also hit new highs.</p>
          <p>Our Wealth Management business continued its positive earnings momentum, and our wholesale team delivered another strong quarter. Total adjusted retail earnings hit a record $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Now, that's amazing, given that this time last year, we were earning just over $1 billion in adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>We also announced a $0.05 dividend increase for our common shareholders, highlighting the confidence the board has in our future success. Fundamentally, this was a great quarter with earnings a bit ahead of our run rate. We are very well positioned for the year.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong, with our Tier 1 capital ratio at 12.7%. We generated close to $1 billion in organic capital growth in this quarter alone. I'm going to give you some more commentary on capital in a few minutes. Let me just make a few comments on each segment.</p>
          <p>It was another record quarter for TD Canada Trust, with earnings up 26% year over year, crossing the $900 million mark for the first time. We do expect year-over-year percentage increases to slow in future quarters as the lift from reduced loan losses dissipates and real estate lending starts to slows.</p>
          <p>However, adjusted for the number of days in the quarter, we would still anticipate earnings in this range for the rest of the year. These wonderful results are underpinned by our commitment to remain the leader in service and convenience. You have noticed that more than 300 of our branches across Canada are now open on Sundays.</p>
          <p>TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank, turned in a record quarter, with adjusted earnings up 54% year over year. We remain pleased with how our performance in the United States is tracking, despite the regulatory headwinds. Our new run rate of earnings is in the $300 million per quarter range. Credit conditions are developing as anticipated, with our loan quality gradually improving.</p>
          <p>Our mortgage security portfolio is showing modest signs of strain, but we are very well provisioned.</p>
          <p>Our organic growth strategy continues to deliver market share gains, while our acquisitions are performing well, with integration efforts going as planned. We expect the same with Chrysler Financial. That deal is on track to close in the second quarter and we're very excited to add the Chrysler Financial auto lending platform to the TD family.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management earnings rose 32% year over year, excluding the contribution from TD Ameritrade. Growing confidence in the equity markets helped deliver higher client assets and strong trading volume, while margins expanded. TD Ameritrade continues to do a great job at asset gathering and recently crossed the $400 billion mark in client assets, an impressive milestone.</p>
          <p>This was also another strong quarter with solid returns for the wholesale bank, and consistent with our expected earnings run rate of $175 million to $225 million per quarter. This business performed well despite moderated markets compared to last year and continues to execute well on its client-driven franchise strategy.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, we're expecting a very good year in 2011, thanks to the power of our retail focused growth engine. The dividend increase we announced today speaks to that. At the same time, I don't think it would be fair to say that all negativity has lifted from the macroeconomic picture and that the world is back to normal. There are key global issues that have yet to be resolved.</p>
          <p>The European debt crisis remains a real concern. Inflation in emerging economies is becoming a more important issue and clearly the United States economy continues to recover slowly. While there have been some positive economic signs in the U.S. recently, the reality is that the fiscal situation remains unclear, municipal and state budgets are under strain, and the U.S. housing market has not noticeably improved.</p>
          <p>The recent unrest across North Africa and the Middle East has also added another level of uncertainty into the global markets. At the same time, on the ground, we're continuing to see positive signs from our personal and business customers. They're continuing to get more comfortable spending and borrowing and they tell us that conditions are improving. So it's a mix of high-level caution and ground-level optimism.</p>
          <p>And if that sounds familiar to you, it's what we told you last quarter, it's because our view hasn't really fundamentally changed. We think the economy is recovering against a backdrop of fragile confidence. And while that's a challenging environment, our model has clearly shown an ability to deliver in that challenging environment. We're in a good position to continue to invest across our franchise to bolster our position for the future.</p>
          <p>So let me talk about capital and dividends. On the capital front, we are providing some additional disclosure that Colleen will speak to, but our key messages have not changed. We're confident that we'll meet the new cap requirements on an accelerated basis without issuing common equity.</p>
          <p>We can do this because we have a great set of businesses with very strong capability to generate organic capital. But what this does mean, however, is that we don't expect to have a lot of excess capital. Consequently, if we were to do an acquisition of significant size, we would likely have to issue shares to fund the transaction.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to emphasize several things about the new capital rules. These new rules represent a significant increase in the amount of operating capital. In fact, we'll need to hold approximately 70% more operating capital under Basel III to conduct the same businesses, which we were previously doing.</p>
          <p>While capital levels are significantly increasing, the effect on return on equity at the overall bank level will be less dramatic than one might assume. There are several reasons for this.</p>
          <p>First, our ROE at the total bank level reflects both operating capital and goodwill and intangibles on our books. Second, we're already holding much of the additional operating capital that we need to hold, we hold that today.</p>
          <p>And third, and our earnings growth, and the low risk weighted nature of this growth, helps us manage rising capital needs without impacting on the ROE.</p>
          <p>So what does all this mean for dividends? Well, our approach hasn't changed. Our confidence in delivering sustainable earnings growth will drive our approach to dividends. And as we get into the latter half of the year, the board will review the timing and size of future increases.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me wrap up. We're off to an excellent start in 2011 with record quarters for our U.S. and our Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking operations and strong performances from Wholesale and Wealth. We think we've got the right ingredients for another very good year, even though regulatory and economic uncertainty has not dissipated.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, I mentioned that for 2011, we'll able to at least meet our medium-term target for adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10%, based on our current outlook I remain very confident we can do so.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the meeting over to Colleen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Ed, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me take you through the results. Slide four, our total bank adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.588 billion, a record high, up 26% from last quarter, and 11% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.74, also a new record, up 26% over last quarter, and 9% over last year. The key highlight this quarter was the record-breaking retail performances from both sides of the border, delivering a combined $1.4 billion in adjusted earnings, up 30% from last year, and representing 86% of total bank earnings. All retail businesses posted double-digit earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Credit continues to improve from cyclically high loan loss levels driven by a more stable economic environment and improving unemployment. Our Wholesale Bank delivered another strong quarter. Adjusted net income of $237 million, up 10% from last quarter, but down 36% from last year. The Corporate segment loss of $68 million in the quarter, declined by $95 million compared to last quarter, but increased by $35 million compared to last year.</p>
          <p>As you can see, our capital position strengthened in the quarter. Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.7% was up 50 basis points from last quarter and 120 basis points from last year. Our ability to add 50 basis points to our capital ratio in a single quarter underlines TD's organic capital generation capability.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide five. TD's reported net income was $1.541 billion or $1.69 per share. Adjusted net income was $1.588 billion or $1.74 per share. The difference between reported and adjusted results was due to four items of note, all of which you've seen before.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to segment results, I would like to mention that we also had two types of transfers between business segments this quarter that related to charges from the Corporate segment to the businesses, and the movement of U.S. credit cards from Canadian Personal and Commercial Bank to the U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking segment. So when I reference segment transfers in the presentation, I am referring to the combined impact of these two changes. Slide 16 in the appendix contains more details.</p>
          <p>Moving on to TD Canada Trust, as Ed mentioned, Canadian P&amp;C had a record quarter, record net income, record efficiency, and record customer satisfaction. Net income was $905 million, up 26% from last year, and up 17% from last quarter. Revenue was up 5% versus last year with good operating leverage, excluding the impact of segment transfers revenue was up 7% over last year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to strong volume growth in personal and business deposits, real estate secured lending, indirect lending, and insurance.</p>
          <p>Real estate secured lending volume moderated as expected due to borrower deleveraging and competitive pressures, but still remained impressive at a 9% growth year-over-year. The continued strength in business banking was also a key driver of growth in the quarter, with business banking volumes up 8% year-over-year as the economy recovered, compared with 4% growth last year. Growth in personal and business deposits remained strong on a year-over-year basis at 5% and 11%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Compared to last year, the margin was down 11 basis points, but eight basis points of that decline was due to segment transfers. Insurance also had a record quarter, making a strong contribution to earnings. Results were driven largely by higher volume and premium growth and better claims experience in our general insurance business. We continue to expect positive momentum in this business going forward.</p>
          <p>Provision for credit losses excluding segment transfers was down 27% from last year, reflecting better credit conditions, driven by an improving economic and employment environment. PCL was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, declining by 4%. Also, business banking loan losses remained at very low levels.</p>
          <p>Expenses excluding segment transfers were down 8% sequentially, as expected, since expenses last quarter were higher than usual due to higher business investment and project related costs. Expenses excluding segment transfers were up 2% from the prior year due to higher employee compensation and project-related costs.</p>
          <p>We expect the rate of earnings growth will moderate on a year-over-year basis starting in Q2, with reduced benefit from improvement in PCL, slowing volume growth, and continued margin pressure in personal banking. However, the outlook for the rest of the year remains very positive and we expect strong performance in insurance and business banking.</p>
          <p>I also wanted to remind you that the second quarter has a fewer number of days. You know this. But we expect that it will have an earnings impact of roughly $0.10 per share sequentially at a total bank level. The majority of this impact is in TD Canada Trust. Overall, it was just a great quarter for TDCT.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide seven, Wealth Management, which excludes Ameritrade, had net income of $133 million, up 32% from last year and up 13% sequentially. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of higher earnings and the best quarter since Q2 of 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenue increased 16% from the prior year due largely to fee-based revenue from record client assets, higher net interest margin, and higher transaction revenue. Expenses increased 12% from last year, primarily due to higher variable compensation and trailers related to business growth and a non-recurring project expense. TD Ameritrade contributed $48 million to TD this quarter, up 12% from last year, and up 45% from last quarter. On the whole, this was another strong performance from Global Wealth.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide eight. Our U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking business had record adjusted net income of US$332 million for the quarter, up 54% from last year, and up 21% sequentially. It was a somewhat noisy quarter, and I'll take you through the details; but the fundamentals were very strong in the quarter, so let's start there.</p>
          <p>On a core basis, excluding acquisitions, segment transfers, and a favorable impact from our non-agency CMO portfolio, which I'll speak to in a moment, core revenue showed good growth at 7%, despite the impact of Reg E, driven by strong organic volume growth in loans and deposits. On a year-over-year basis, the segment delivered positive operating leverage in spite of the impact of Reg E on overdraft fee revenue.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong organic growth. Loan growth was up 9% year-over-year, primarily in residential mortgages and commercial loans. Deposits, excluding the TD Ameritrade insured deposit accounts, grew 7% year-over-year, driven by maturing stores. Volume growth continues to compare very favorably to our peers in the U.S.</p>
          <p>For our core lending portfolio PCL, excluding acquisitions, segment transfers, and the impact of the CMO portfolio, was down $66 million or 36% compared to last year and down 10% sequentially as the U.S. economy continued to recover. Earnings this quarter also included the impact of a favorable item equaling $24 million.</p>
          <p>A couple of numbers this quarter related to debt securities classified as loans do bear mentioning, the higher PCL and the higher gross impaired loans. For our debt securities classified as loans, PCL was US$66 million, up from previous low levels and gross impaired loans in this portfolio also increased by $649 million.</p>
          <p>Accounting for acquired portfolios can create swings between net interest income and PCL, with good news flowing to NII and bad news flowing to PCL. We saw this happen this quarter, as higher foreclosure levels drove more NII and more PCL. The resulting net positive impact to earnings was $11 million after-tax. We've outlined this on slide 21 in the appendix including the impact this quarter. We will be transparent about the impact of the accounting and will provide similar disclosures going forward as appropriate and where the numbers are meaningful.</p>
          <p>Mark will address the credit quality of this portfolio in a moment, but the trigger for reporting impairment on these securities does tend to overstate the true risk in the underlying portfolio. We've explained the methodology on slide 21 in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Core expense growth was well controlled and largely related to acquisitions, new stores, and infrastructure investments. Expenses excluding the impact of acquisitions and segment transfers were up 6% compared to last year. On the acquisition front, Q1 included a full quarter of The South Financial Group and our Florida FDIC acquisitions. Volume and earnings and return performance were all better than expected.</p>
          <p>Overall, a terrific quarter for the U.S. Personal and Commercial Bank. Looking forward, we remain optimistic that good volume growth will continue for the remainder of the year. We expect a more sustainable run rate will be in the US$300 million range per quarter on average.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Wholesale Bank, slide nine. Wholesale delivered net income of $237 million, which was a strong performance for the period. Results were down 36% from last year. Last year's results reflected the unusually strong market conditions that followed the financial crisis. Compared to last quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $21 million or 10%.</p>
          <p>This quarter's results reflected a moderated trading environment and stronger capital market revenues. PCL was relatively flat compared to the prior year. The $6 million in PCL this quarter was mainly our cost of credit protection. The credit quality of this loan portfolio remains very strong. Expenses were up 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher variable compensation. Compared to last year, expenses were up 4%.</p>
          <p>Overall, this has been a strong quarter for Wholesale, which delivered solid results across all business lines. Going forward, we expect near-term earnings performance in the $175 million to $225 million range per quarter.</p>
          <p>The Corporate segment, slide 10. The adjusted Corporate segment loss this quarter was $68 million. As I mentioned in my overview, we revisited our Corporate allocation methodology this quarter. This reduced the Corporate loss by $41 million after-tax, with a corresponding impact in our business segments. We expect similar amounts per quarter going forward. Please refer to slide 16 in the appendix for more details.</p>
          <p>Excluding segment transfers, the higher loss versus last year was primarily due to an increase in net corporate expenses and certain favorable items in Q1 last year that did not recur. Excluding segment transfers, the lower loss sequentially was primarily due to a decrease in net corporate expenses, higher earnings on excess capital, the Symcor write-down reported last quarter, partially offset by lower gains from securitization activities.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are forecasting our Corporate segment loss for 2011 at approximately $80 million to $120 million per quarter. We would caution, however, that by its nature Corporate can contain some volatility.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11. We know that capital remains a key issue on your mind. There's been a desire for us to provide more quantitative details to help you understand the impact on our strategy. Having said that, our key messages on this issue have not changed. We still expect to meet the Basel III requirements in Q1 of 2013 without issuing any common equity. We will continue to grow the bank and will have some excess capital upon implementation of the new rules. However, we would need to issue common equity to fund any acquisitions of significant scale.</p>
          <p>Any future dividend increases will be based on the board's outlook for sustainable earnings growth. The increase we announced today is an illustration of our ability to deliver that. There are a lot of moving parts and the numbers related to the impact of Basel III will get refined over time. As Ed mentioned, this new capital regime will require us to hold a significantly higher level of capital.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a sense of how we expect to manage through the capital changes. There are essentially two main impacts, which drive the significant increase in capital. The impacts include higher net common equity deductions and the impact from higher risk-weighted assets. The total expected impact of these is estimated to be an increase of $9 billion to $10 billion in capital required. For us, we expect to be able to meet these higher capital standards, thanks to the strength and performance of our lower risk business model.</p>
          <p>In addition, in anticipation of the updated Basel requirements, we've been building up capital over the past couple of years. With our current excess capital of approximately $6 billion and significant organic capital growth potential over the next two years, we expect to be above the 7% common equity requirement in 2013 with full phase-in of deductions.</p>
          <p>We've consistently shown a strong internal capital generation capability, having added $2.3 billion to retained earnings just in 2010 alone, and Q1 was another good example of this capability, where we saw almost $1 billion in retained earnings growth that translated to 50 basis points in Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>Based on the strength of our business model, we're confident that we can meet the new Basel III requirements and continue to run our growth strategy in the new capital environment. Going forward, you can assume that this is our base-case scenario. We'll update you on the capital impacts of Basel III should anything change materially.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand it over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Colleen, and good afternoon. Please turn to slide 12. Similar to last quarter, I'll limit my comments to highlights of our credit performance in the Canadian and U.S. portfolios, followed by a brief update on the debt securities classified as loans portfolio. Detailed credit slides are provided in the appendix.</p>
          <p>As in the past, we've excluded debt securities classified as loans in the $1.8 billion FDIC covered loan portfolios from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of U.S. credit performance.</p>
          <p>Overall, performance has continued to improve across the credit portfolios. The Canadian credit portfolios remain strong, with the personal portfolio continuing to return to pre-recession levels in terms of annual loss rates. We're seeing encouraging signs in the U.S. credit portfolios. Default and loss rates across the personal portfolio remained stable during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Mortgage refinancings have continued to drive high-quality growth in the residential mortgage portfolio. We're seeing positive trends in the U.S. commercial portfolio, as evidenced by a noticeable reduction in both gross impaired formations and PCL in the quarter. And lastly, the recently acquired credit portfolios continue to perform well within expectations. In summary, we expect these positive trends to continue in the U.S. over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to comment on the performance of our debt securities portfolio. As Colleen mentioned earlier, gross impaired loans on debt securities classified as loans increased by $649 million to $1.8 billion in the quarter. Under the required accounting treatment, a security becomes impaired when the current expected loss exceeds the expected loss calculated when the security was acquired. This treatment classifies the entire security as impaired. However, the incremental risk at the time of impairment is the increase in the expected loss amount and not the entire security.</p>
          <p>That being said, at the end of the quarter, the fair value of the portfolio remained &#x2013; continued to exceed the net book value. It remains our view that losses on the debt securities portfolio will not exceed the discount taken at time of acquisition, and we're comfortable that the portfolio is adequately provisioned.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the presentation back to Mushtak.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Michael Goldberg, Desjardins Securities. So I do have a question about the debt securities classified as loans. And I just want to clarify so I understand, you've increased the amount that are classified as impaired because the expected loss is now greater than the expected loss at the time of the acquisition of these securities, is that correct?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I wouldn't &#x2013; I couldn't recall at the time of the acquisition. I know the numbers today, that when you take the increased expected loss or the current expected loss that's well within the discount. And then that's further validated by the fact that the fair value of those securities is about 300 higher than we're carrying it, which I think would probably be kind of similar to what the amount we feel that we &#x2013; is left in that discount that's not covered by an expected loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to clarify, when we closed the Commerce deal, we took a write-down on the securities portfolio of about $1.5 billion, and portion of that, as you know, was credit related, and with the lion's share of it being more liquidity driven. Hence, now the higher yield on those securities.</p>

          <p>John Reucassel from BMO Capital Markets. Tim Hockey, just if I'm allowed to ask one, I'll ask you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The margin &#x2013; in your comments you mentioned margin pressure in Personal Banking &#x2013; and I don't have that written down that you've said that before. So is the pressure on margins more intense today than it has been in the past? And then a couple of your competitors has talked about pricing competition in commercial as well, if you could talk a little bit &#x2013; and how that impacts your NIMs going forward? How you look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from a competitive pressure point of view, our outlook would say that, notably on the lending side, in real estate secured lending in particular, and as you mentioned in commercial lending, there is pretty high competitive levels. So if I had to give an outlook on margins, the margin on average earning asset outlook is fairly flat, if you will, maybe slightly down. But the competitive pressures underlying that are &#x2013; if we get an increase in the Bank of Canada rate, we should get some floating up in deposits over the remainder of the year. But we do believe that the competitive pressure will put margin pressure on our &#x2013; both personal and commercial lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you changed your outlook on your loan growth in the real estate secured? I think you talked about mid single-digit. Is that still what you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually feeling a little stronger than we would have thought last quarter. We obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of growth. Market share gains in almost all categories, in fact, all categories. So I would say, if I had to forecast full year, I would say we're going to be more in the 6 to 8 type level.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter Routledge, National Bank Financial. Ed, I was struck by your reference to significant acquisitions in the presentation. Has there been a change in view, A? B, would you look outside your Eastern Seaboard footprint? And C, given you've got a pretty hefty integration effort to go with Chrysler Financial, do you have the integration capacity over the next six months to do a sizable deal like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to clarify, our reference was that to do a significant acquisition we'd have to use shares. It was only that then to define sort of what is excess capital that we see we have here for acquisitions. And we're saying we might be able to do very small acquisitions, but if there is anything of any size, we're going to have to use shares.</p>
          <p>No implication that we're now in the game, the hunt, to do significant acquisitions, I don't know. And so I think we're still in the same position that we've been for some time, because we have this sort of difference between on the ground optimism and then prevailing uncertainty in a macro sense. I think we're still in the space that we like smaller deals rather than bigger deals at this stage. And we would rather &#x2013; there is no shift in our focus in terms of banks would be down the East Coast, and we'll continue to look at asset plays like Chrysler Financial where we can add to the balance sheet, but those would be asset acquisitions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. For Tim. Tim, excellent growth in mortgages in the quarter. It looks like by my count almost 5% sequentially. But what I thought was curious was the HELOCs were unchanged for the first time I think since going way back to 2007. That's a product class where you've obviously derived a lot of growth. So what was the reason for the slowdown there? Does this have anything to do with the new mortgage rules, although they were admittedly put in late in the quarter? Is there any de-emphasis of the HELOC product going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Strong competitive pressures on HELOC in particular. It has been our stellar growth product for many, many, many years, and we now have a dominant market share. We tend to look at the total combination of both mortgages and the HELOC books, because in many cases we see those products as fungible. So as we said, 9% overall, mostly on the mortgage side and flat on HELOC side. And that's pretty much the product mix that we would see going forward. No impact whatsoever from the announced changes from the Minister's office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Good afternoon. Again on Canada, as you expect earnings to slow, Colleen's comment was kind of interesting there. Where do you expect the earnings growth mostly, because the asset growth was pretty strong this quarter? Are we talking mostly on operating leverage and maybe see some further declines in the expense base? And then on the M&amp;A front, Ed, your comments about the small deals &#x2013; am I correct to understand that you define small as anything less than $50 billion of assets?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our earnings outlook for TD Canada Trust domestically, the point we were trying to make is that there was always a, call it second-quarter effect, days effect to a large degree. And so we would expect to see a decrease. We've been &#x2013; we feel the analyst community maybe has been surprised by that in the past and we wanted to make sure that that was out there. But at the same time, if you sort of looked forward, we feel very confident about the current earnings levels. But the absolute level of year-over-year growth will slow from these mid 20s rates. We just don't believe we can continue that. And in fact, mathematically given what happened with the PCL step-down this quarter, it's not going to recur next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the acquisition front, again, we haven't changed that. A number of people have picked up one point, I used to say $10 billion or less, and then I said, well, $10 billion to $20 billion and so people wondered whether that was a major shift. What caused me to just use it was when we were looking at Chrysler Financial, at one point, it looked like the size of the asset portfolio could well have been over $10 billion, so I started to nudge up the number. But I wouldn't read too much into that. I think that's the sort of territory that we would look at doing acquisitions for the moment, at that point. Until we tell you otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just on the dividend payout ratio, you got to around 38%. Is it safe to assume that you're going want to stay to the lower end of that range in order to go by <mark type="inaudible" /> guidance of earnings retention, conservative earnings retention strategies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two comments on that. I think I was explicit in my remarks. I think $1.74 is probably not our running rate, and so that I think when you look at what the dividend payout ratio, I think I would throttle back a little from that number in sense of how we look at it on a sustainable basis at this stage.</p>
          <p>No, I don't &#x2013; I know I'm sort of alone in this, but I do try to separate out capital and dividends. Obviously, at the extreme, if you're capital short and you have a real problem getting to the test, then you might start to lean on dividends. But, frankly, it makes such little difference to capital accumulation in this kind of time period. That &#x2013; I think we have a dividend policy, 35% to 45%, and we're trying to stay in that dividend policy.</p>
          <p>And I think when you look at &#x2013; the point that I was trying to make is I think what makes us &#x2013; when you work your way through what sort of are the drivers, and I'm sure all of you've done this, we were unusual in that we have this huge rate of return on risk-weighted assets, which essentially means a huge rate of return on regulatory capital. So that as we grow we don't have to keep &#x2013; we don't grow our regulatory capital needs at the same rate as other different business mix might cause you to do that. So we naturally generate a lot of capital. And so we're reasonably confident as you can be that we're not going to have any trouble meeting the January 1, 2013 date.</p>
          <p>The only caveat I'd put on that is that there's still &#x2013; I know people keep on putting a lot of certainty around these rules, we find that every few weeks we get another missive about further details and they're moving these numbers around all the time. But subject to that, I think we're not worried about meeting the capital rules. And therefore, we're confident to say, which we've been signaling that we want to get back to, once our sustainable earnings were in a place that told us to pay increased dividends, we're going to increase dividends.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is probably for Bharat. You talk about $300 million in expected earnings for the rest of the year. That seems conservative from my end. And you've got good momentum on revenue growth, and we talked about loan losses coming down through the year. So I'm a little curious, except for the shorter number of days in Q2, why it is that you think your earnings will be down or in line with Q1? Excuse me. And then related to that, is it because of Durbin and interchange fees and you expect an early adoption perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought you'd enjoy the number that was out there. I see you picked up on the days' impact for the next quarter. And Colleen said it very I think appropriately, on average that's what you should expect. Have we considered some headwinds for Durbin? Absolutely. It's tough to quantify Durbin, because the final rule has not been issued. There's lots of discussions, a lot of moving parts on what that rule might be or the timing of it. In our numbers, we've obviously expected some headwinds on it. So considering that, considering the days count in the second quarter I think it's appropriate at least at this stage to say on average that's what we are expecting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now some think Durbin won't be implemented until after your year-end. And if that's accurate, would it be fair to expect earnings in excess of $300 million.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Probably for Colleen. You still don't have advanced internal ratings based methodology for credit in your U.S. book. When do you expect to get there? And directionally, do you expect a positive benefit to your capital ratios or negative?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little uncertainty. I mean, our original plan would have been for the end of 2013. But the size of the U.S. entity has triggered our requirement to meet the U.S. rules for Basel II, which are slightly different and separate from the Canadian rules. And they have quite strict rules regarding how you approach it. It's more rules based than principles based. And one of them is specifically the amount of data you have. So because of that, that probably will be several years delayed behind that. So it's difficult to predict at this point, which one will determine the impact on the regulatory capital. I think it's safe to say it's somewhere in between; but I wouldn't &#x2013; I think it's unlikely in '13, more to the latter end of that range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It would be positive, yes. It would be a positive effect, because the reality is we're carrying the operational risk capital already, but we're carrying standardized on credit.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Brad Smith from Stonecap Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Yes, my question just again relates to these debt securities that are classified as loans. I really feel like the number is still material, $4.5 billion, and yet, we just make it go away and pretend it doesn't exist. So a question for you, Colleen, perhaps, with respect to this portfolio. This thing started at about $12 billion. I think it ended the last quarter at $4.5 billion. The impaired amount at $1.8 billion is about 40% now, and that started at 4%.</p>
          <p>And the other question that I have is with respect to the provisioning. I mean, you show a specific provision each quarter for this, and then there seems to be some drawdown of a general provision. Could you just put that all in perspective? I do understand that the current fair value, as you put it, is above the carrying value. But one of the reasons that these securities were required to be classified as loans, as I understand it, is because their values are not quoted in a regular market. So is there any information in terms of the wind-down, sale, or otherwise of this portfolio that would add confidence to the valuation judgment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brad, why don't I start with the last part of your question? You're absolutely right. When we first moved the portfolio, the valuation was part of the issue. But the numbers we're citing now under &#x2013; for fair market value are representative of actual market observed prices in a relatively liquid market. So we think that's actually a pretty good number. You are comparing now on an apples-to-apples our book value versus the fair value, and we're $300 million higher on fair value. Again, it's just a data point. The reality is the book value number is the one that's obviously on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Your second question was around the impaireds. And I think you're quite right, and that's really what Mark has outlined, is that there is this exaggerated effect of how we're triggering impairment on that particular portfolio. So you have a security that obviously has a number of underlying loans. And what happens is that obviously what we've done when we closed the transaction is we have an expected loss on all of those various underlying loans. To the extent that the expected loss is higher than we expected, that means that we're suggesting the underlying loan is impaired, which then is impairing the entire security.</p>
          <p>So to exaggerate the point, you could have a security that's got 30 underlying loans and essentially we could be showing it as impaired if one of those positions where we had a higher expected loss than what was in our model.</p>
          <p>So I think it can be alarming to look at that big impaired number in relationship to the $4 billion or so that we have in the portfolio itself. But it really is not indicative of the underlying credit issues. And again, we obviously have the general set up, and as we realize those amounts, as we see actual amounts coming through, we reclassify from the general into specifics. And you've seen that phenomenon. I don't know, Mark, whether you wanted to add anything on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing &#x2013; I guess I look at it from a credit perspective, accounting aside. And really we do the analysis independently. And we say what do we feel these things may ultimately lose? And we're still in a range where we feel that we're really not going to lose anything on aggregate on this portfolio. So the proper decision is to continue to hold.</p>
          <p>Now, I know it's unusual, like if you look at our gross impaired loans of about $4.1 billion, $1.8 billion of it is in this category. But unlike in normal gross impaired loans, we don't expect to lose money on this $1.8 billion. And I think we haven't seen anything that would tell us that that thought is wrong. And it has reduced from about $11 billion to about the $4.5 billion you mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just with respect to the reduction from $11 billion to $4.5 billion, what is causing that? I mean, are you selling these? Or are they just simply paying out? How is it coming down as much as it is? And why is it &#x2013; why is the impaired amount growing? It really looks from an outsider's perspective like the good loans are either getting repaid or going away and the bad loans are staying in the bucket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we've had paydowns on the portfolio and also then we have sold some of the securities. This is a portfolio that we monitor very carefully because there are certain parts of it that can be quite capital intensive. And you do see that in the deduction from Tier 1 capital, where anything that's rated below BB minus, there's a 50% deduction from Tier 1. So that's quite punitive. And sort of looking ahead as well, the capital side of it can be quite punishing.</p>
          <p>So we do tend to look at these on a security-by-security basis and assess whether it makes sense to continue to hold them or not and we have sold various positions, and you would actually see that showing up then in our invested capital in the United States. So in some cases that has actually helped to bring down our invested capital.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add, Colleen, is that part of the paydown has been driven by the foreclosure activity in the U.S. So we're in the senior tranches of the security, so when you sell the house or you sell the item, the cash generally comes to the senior &#x2013; does go to the senior tranches. So that's why we have had paydowns higher than one would have expected in a different environment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; it's Ed here. I guess the other thing I would add is just mathematically over time you are going to tend to create impaired, because if just think about it. We buy this whole portfolio of $10 billion plus, and we have to guess where to put the provisions against every one of these items. And every time you get it right, you get no credit for that. But every time you get it wrong you have to take the whole security and make it impaired. So you could end up of not having made any &#x2013; net no changes at all. But if half the time you guess right and half the time you get it wrong, eventually half the portfolio is going to be impaired. And that's just how this accounting works. So we don't net them. It's only gross. So over time, you would expect to have impaireds just grow, because we're not geniuses to figure out how to assign this in the first place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if these were in the loan book, we wouldn't impair them. We impair them because of the accounting rules.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Firstly, hopefully two quick net interest margin related questions for Colleen. In the presentation, you tell us that excluding the segment transfers the margin decline for Canadian Banking was 3 basis points. Do you have an analogous number that can help us get the core NIM change for U.S. P&amp;C, which was up it looks like 26 on a reported basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, most of the NIM increase in the U.S. was driven by the CMO accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I could say here that &#x2013; I'm guessing it would be helped by the credit cards being transferred in as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's up, but less than five basis points is fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then secondly, if we try and get to the bottom line on an all-bank level, that's on page 11 of your supplement, the 10 basis point increase in total bank NIM &#x2013; obviously, the segments don't have an issue here. So it's going to be all of the CMO accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say there are probably three main categories in terms of why the NIM is up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The CMO accounting has probably added about 3 basis points at the all-bank level. Then the next couple of items, I'd say, are more mix related. One is related to the fact that we had lower derivative assets in the quarter. And you see that on the balance sheet, and that's a low-margin business. Also we've been adding higher margin business in the U.S., in particular, South Financial, for example, which has a good margin. And then finally we have higher earnings on excess capital which I cited in the Corporate segment. And that would also be contributing to the increased NIM in the quarter at the all-bank level.</p>
          <p>So excluding the CMO accounting, we're probably in a sort of 235 to 240 range if you normalize for any of the swings that you get on the Wholesale side, any trading-related NII.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. I get the TSFG; you had the first full quarter of contribution. That's obviously going to boost NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very quickly &#x2013; Corporate, the pickup on excess capital, is that as simple as the fact that long-term rates have been moving higher over the last couple months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's certainly part of it and also the fact that excess capital is growing, so those two factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can sneak one quickly in here for Tim Hockey. It seems like you haven't been talking as much about the business lending side as some of your peers. And yet when I look at your numbers, we're now looking at 9% year-over-year loan growth in your small business and Commercial Banking segment. This is one of the few areas where you're not top two in the country. So just wanted to take your temperature here on whether you think there's still some more utilization for your commercial borrowers to offset some of the maybe slowdown in consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe we didn't pull it out only because there's tons of great news to choose from. I think business banking is one of our best stories, frankly. It's growing hugely. A few years ago we were number five in business lending in Canada; and then a couple years ago we were number four; and just last year we came in the number &#x2013; third position. So we've been growing share.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed tends to just draw a line. And so we're very proud of the growth that we've had in this particular segment and we are seeing quite a bit of strength. Great market share gains and, in fact, stronger both lending and deposit growth, even stronger on the business deposit side. So great opportunities going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A question for Tim Hockey on the expenses in the Canadian P&amp;C business. So obviously some seasonality in fourth quarter and some good improvement in the quarter, but when I'm looking at the efficiency ratio it's about the lowest I've seen it. So I'm just wondering, first of all, if you could give us an update on any initiatives, spending initiatives, you have for the rest of the year? And then secondly, how you think about the long-term efficiency ratio in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't tend to disclose individual initiatives, because frankly our strategy is very clear. If our revenue grows, our expenses will grow a little bit less, and so when our initiatives come off, then we move to the next-to-fund initiative, if you will. And so we treat it more that way. As you mentioned, last quarter in Q4 obviously the expense growth was high. And even ex the segment transfers our expense growth this year, year-over-year &#x2013; this quarter, rather, was quite low. We expect it to bump around a little bit over the next couple of quarters. Our general trend and our belief is that with that simple mathematical formula that we'll continue to drive our efficiency ratio lower. We don't have a target, but we would have said a few years ago that our goal was in the low 40s in terms of &#x2013; can we get there and is that best in class? And I'd say that's still our target. We just don't know how low is low at this point. We still have opportunities for additional efficiency gains.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sticking with Tim &#x2013; or actually maybe for Mark. A good down-leg in credit losses in Canadian Banking. Not that we're going to get there in the next couple of quarters, but are we ultimately heading back to the low 30 basis point range in terms of credit losses? Is there anything structural that might prevent that at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's important to &#x2013; from a Canadian perspective, you have to look at the fact that the Canadian Commercial and the Wholesale or TD Securities credit portfolio is &#x2013; their performance is simply excellent with effectively no credit losses. And I don't expect that to continue. And then in terms of the other, the Consumer categories, I think we're in many of the segments back to the pre-recession levels, but we've still got a little ways to go in the Visa and the unsecured category. But I don't think it's so significant, given that you're off a higher base, that you'll see a big change in the number itself. So I don't know. Overall, 30? I'd have to look a little bit on the history before I'd commit to a number like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, maybe I'll follow up. And just a second one if I could. A question from the slide 11, Colleen when you went through that. In the third point, you mentioned that TD has about $6 billion of excess capital. What sort of definition are you using there? What's the basis for that $6 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I'm really just &#x2013; I'm really taking the way we calculate our common equity ratio today, so &#x2013; is roughly about 10% versus the 7; so you'd be taking about 3% of $200 million in risk-weighted assets and that's how you're getting to the $6 billion. And then you're layering on obviously the deductions after that and adding to the risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But functionally, that's not probably true excess? Or maybe it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the way we look at it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Perhaps for Mark and Colleen. I understand, Mark, that you look at these securities classified as loans from an economic perspective. But if we could just think about the accounting for a moment, it's possible that this accounting approach could affect subsequent quarters, not just on these securities but any of the acquired portfolios. And what I want to understand is the extent to which you'd expect the NII to be higher, as it was this quarter, in an amount sufficient to offset the higher PCLs? Did I describe my &#x2013; was that sufficient to think through that issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think we wanted to highlight two issues on all of this, this quarter. So first of all is the fact that there's this macro issue whereby you can see this P&amp;L moving around. Where I think you probably will see this happen in future quarters, where you may have higher NII because that's reflecting the good news on some of the items and then some higher PCL on some where the loss is actually higher than we'd expected when we marked the book when we closed these deals.</p>
          <p>So I think you will see those move around. And I know both of those lines are very important and obviously the margin is important and the PCLs are very closely watched. So we will disclose that. Again to the extent that it's a relevant number, we will continue to disclose that going forward. But you're absolutely right. It isn't specific to just the securities. It will happen on the lending side as well if you look at the acquired deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, is it your feeling that the two should generally offset then, the increase in the NII and the higher PCLs? Is that a logical presumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily. Not in a given quarter. Over time, yes, because we would certainly say &#x2013; and I'll hand it back to Mark on this. But net-net, we actually think the credit in these portfolios is as good as we did originally if not better. So net-net this will be positive over time, I would say, but it could shift around from a timing standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Mark. I would agree with Colleen. I think over the life of the portfolio, I would think it maybe &#x2013; I think it would offset effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So should we expect any kind of items of note then emerging from the acquired portfolios in cases where the PCLs were higher than the NII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see us including this as an item of note per se in the way that we think of items of note, Mario. But, again, I think we'd like to make sure that you have the right disclosure to assess that impact.</p>
