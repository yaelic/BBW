          <p>Good morning. We will be starting off with Piyush's presentation on &#x2013; he will give us some insight as to how the bank achieved our record first half earnings for the year, some of the key drivers behind it. After that, Sok Hui will take us into the numbers in a little bit more detail.</p>
          <p>So, on that note, without further ado, Piyush, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karen. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being here. I was just telling people outside, I'm actually very pleased with our first half performance. As you know, we've declared SGD1.54 billion in profits for the first half, which is certainly a DBS high. And I can't find out. I asked people whether it is a high for a Singapore bank and I'm told it is, but I can't swear to that.</p>
          <p>Obviously we had a very strong first quarter. As you know, we did SGD807million. But I'm also very pleased with the second quarter at SGD735 million, is the second best quarter we've ever had in our history. In the first quarter, I had already told you we were benefited by large one-off capital market trades. So, we knew that won't come back really.</p>
          <p>The SGD1.54 billion has obviously benefited a lot from the credit environment. And you have a credit which we flagged again earlier. The credit cycle is helping. Our overall credit situation is good. But NPLs are down to 1.5% from previous 1.8%. But I really want to make the point that we've not just taken all of the improvements in credit down to the bottom line. We've continued to improve our coverage. And our coverage now is up to 113% of non-performing assets, which is reasonably decent. If you exclude &#x2013; if you look at only unsecured loans, we are up to 148% of coverage. So, we have continued to increase our provisions as we go along and the SGD1.54 billion is notwithstanding that number.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the thing I'm most pleased about is that the results are driven by very strong top line growth. Our overall top line, as you can see, is &#x2013; actually if you look at it, just total top line is up about 6% to 7%. But the underlying drivers of it, our interest income, is up 12% year-on-year. I feel good about that, because in the &#x2013; in twisted environment we've had over the last 12 months, with Sibor or SOR coming down to historic lows. For us to be able to drive 12% increase in interest income speaks to a lot of things, but principally to very robust loan demand. We've been able to drive our loan book quite nicely. As you know, particularly in the last quarter, loans grew extremely well, 7% up for the quarter, up about SGD11 billion in constant dollar &#x2013; in Singapore dollars and about SGD13 billion in constant dollar terms, if you will.</p>
          <p>So loan demand has been good. As I was mentioning to some people, I'd say this last quarter was particularly held by trade finance loans out of Greater China that was particularly very strong. But also I've been pleased in the last year that our fee income continues to grow well. So our fee income has been up about 8% and changed year-on-year. And I'm quite pleased, because that again continues to demonstrate solid growth of all underlying business activities.</p>
          <p>So the last thing which I'm also very pleased about is our returns are obviously improving from 8%, unchanged in '09. Last year we did 10% with 9.8% for the first half. We're now up at 11.4% for the first half of this year. So directionally, we now had several halves of improving ROE and that's obviously always a good thing.</p>
          <p>Right. This is just, as you know, I wanted to &#x2013; even though some of you &#x2013; who is it? Sam was telling me how I see regularly taking the slide and flashing it up. Well, the good thing is I keep taking this slide and flashing it up. So you should know we're not running away from what we're trying to do. But I thought I'd give you some sense for some of these areas in terms of what we've been doing and where we are. So if you get to the first one, which is Singapore slide &#x2013; this.</p>
          <p>All right. In Singapore, if you look at, I think our first half income is up 11% from a year ago. Now this is a stuff, which we don't report, because we don't pull out Singapore country performance from the rest of our Singapore-centric performance. You know, we run our trading room out of Singapore. We run our capital markets activities. This is what we've done for internal management. We actually &#x2013; ever since we created a Singapore country organization, we carve out and look at Singapore performance separately. This really reflects that management view of the Singapore performance.</p>
          <p>But we're up 11% year-on-year and is powered principally by very strong growth momentum in our institutional bank, which has actually grown 17% year-on-year. That growth is broad-based. It's in the top tier corporates. It's in the SMEs. It's a loan-driven, but also very strong cross-seller. GTS business is up about 24%, 25% in Singapore. Treasury cross-sell is up about 55% in Singapore. We've done a range of capital markets deals. And even in the last quarter, we did Mapletree. We did the Perennial Trust. So our overall cross-sell business in Singapore has been very strong.</p>
          <p>The consumer has obviously been challenged with the interest rate environment but that notwithstanding, our overall consumer business is up also about 11%, right, which is actually very strong. Some of it has benefited from the way we did transfer pricing. But even if you normalize for that the consumer business is up still in the mid to single-digits, which is actually quite good. And the consumer &#x2013; this is a point I made last time. I just wanted to reemphasize. Our new branch operating model continues to work well. And so I think I showed these charts <mark type="ph" /> when we've added it (05:47).</p>
          <p>But if you look at our average monthly sales volume of investment of wealth products, it's quite clear that the new branch model outperformed our traditional branches quite substantially and so we've taken this new model and rolling it out now across the country. We hope to really make a lot of headway in the second half of the year to drive this as a standard operating model.</p>
          <p>The other thing about Singapore, which is interesting, is that our first-mover position in the RMB space is really beginning to pay off dividends. We now have about RMB20 billion of deposits in Singapore. Frankly, we have more RMB in Singapore than we have in Hong Kong today. And this just continues to grow spectacularly. We're quite pleased. We've been conscious and cautious with our client base. So, our customers understand &#x2013; actually a lot of customers are not taking naked revenue position, very few are frankly, because we keep explaining to customers. You want to go from Sing dollar to RMB that's obviously not a very smart trade to do.</p>
          <p>But there are customers who make asset allocation decision. People are generally convinced that the RMB will be a major currency in times to come. So instead of keeping all the portfolio in dollars, they're really switching from dollars to RMB, which is a good thing. But net-net it's giving us significant value, the whole offshore RMB position and offshore RMB strategy.</p>
          <p>Slide, please. So, Singapore is our first priority. We said we've got to improve. And effectively, we are continuing to hold &#x2013; stay the course there. I'm very pleased with the traction we're getting in Hong Kong. A lot of times people have raised questions about Hong Kong investments and whether they are ever going to pay off. The good news is if you look at the last year, our Hong Kong first half income is up 17% from a year ago. In fact, if you look at our earnings, they are up 51% in constant dollar, local currency terms.</p>
          <p>Now again, the earnings are benefited by bottom &#x2013; by credit and credit cycle. But top line of 17% is very good and again driven principally by the institutional business, which is up 24%, powered under that by essentially the China play. We are really continuing to do very well with the China red chips and the large China companies coming into Hong Kong. That business is up 50%-60%. Our GTS business is up. Cash is up north of 30%. Trade is up almost 30%. T&amp;M cross-sell is up 55%. So if you look at across Hong Kong, we're really beginning to make that investment sweat and we're beginning to make the institutional part of the business come alive.</p>
          <p>I'll say the strategy of using Hong Kong as an anchor for our Greater China business is increasingly beginning to be validated. We've booked another 1,500 corporate customers &#x2013; the RMB-based corporate customers in the first half of this year, which is a nice growth. As I mentioned briefly before, we're driving a lot of the trade finance activity for China out of Hong Kong. So that's proving to be extremely helpful. And finally, we're beginning to make good headway with SOEs and POEs as well. So in the dim sum bond space, we've now done four. We're on the league table, which is interesting, because we're not a big capital markets player in Hong Kong traditionally. So I'm quite pleased with the progress we're making all around with the Hong Kong space.</p>
          <p>The consumer business in Hong Kong continues to be challenged, because of the deposit environment. People, including us, have to continue paying up for deposits. That's the bad news. The good news is that finally, over the last few months, the loan market has started repricing. And as loans, and particularly mortgage prices, have started moving up in the system, our NIMs has started being better protected. We're making good progress, particularly in unsecured loans where we're now the fourth largest player in the market. We used to be number five, so we've gained a slot in that position.</p>
          <p>So, on the whole, if you look at our Hong Kong franchise, we've really started delivering on what we're hoping to do, which is manage Hong Kong more tightly, leverage it for China, and just make that investment start sweating a lot more. We hope to be able to generate on our attributed equity about 15% ROE for the Hong Kong business this year, which means that on a total invested capital we start seeing a pick up from where we used to be.</p>
          <p>Slide, please. If you look at our other stuff, a third-party which we have on my thing, it's rebalanced the mix of our earnings. And, as I said, that &#x2013; we really think we have the opportunity to grow out organically. And this really demonstrates how much progress we've made even in a year. Our earnings outside Singapore, Hong Kong are gone from 17% to 20% of our total base. And this is, as I said, not because Singapore, Hong Kong are declining. Both markets are growing nicely. It is just that the markets outside the growth markets are really beginning to kick in. And if you look at the slide below, now this is again a management view because we don't show earnings in this thing, but they get hidden under the total earnings.</p>
          <p>But each of our countries is doing really well. The India number of 13% looks soft, because we had some trading hiccups in India. If you exclude the trading, the customer franchise in India grew at 31%. And so from a customer business standpoint, all of our four growth markets are delivering north of 30% growth rates. And again, the good thing is that we're doing it by building out a local currency franchise. We're doing it by cross-selling GTS. We're doing it by cross-selling T&amp;M.</p>
          <p>China, the case in point, if you look at the 51% growth for the first half, the GTS business in China grew 110% and the treasury cross-sell &#x2013; the customer related flows in treasury grew by 150%. So clearly we're being able to do what we want, broaden our franchise, move away and win local currency, do a lot of cross-sell and then continue to build that up, so clearly making up headway there.</p>
          <p>On wealth, our wealth focus is beginning to show results. As I had indicated before, I was quite pleased we've put our entire wealth business under a single platform under Su Shan that includes both the private bank and the rest of the premium and treasures business. We've &#x2013; as you can see form the numbers, the total wealth segment is up 18%. But the non-interest income &#x2013; the fee-related business is up 30%. And that's both in the private bank, which obviously is doing better. The lower end gets impacted by deposit. So the deposit margin shows up in that 13% number. But net-net, you can see that there is traction and growth in our wealth business.</p>
          <p>Our earnings asset base, which is our AUMs plus our loan book, is up at an annualized 30% in the first half of the year, which is very good. So we're seeing strong momentum. Our Treasures Private Client that we soft launched two-three months ago is looking very, very good. We've got about 1,000 clients in the first couple of months. RMs are very bullish, because they're finding that this positioning has traction. Our clients seem to be very happy with what they're offering. And so some time over the second half of the year, we will try and make a little more noise around this and then push it even harder. So there has been good progress.</p>
          <p>Continuing down our list of priorities, we said we wanted to grow the cross-sell and GTS and T&amp;M. I've alluded to this a couple of times, but I wanted to put up this chart because this is quite revealing. If you look at quarter-on-quarter, GTS business is just continuing to power along. As you know, we've invested in it. We've build teams. We've hired people. We invested in technology. But the good news is that it is paying off. And the other good news is it's consistent, because if you look at the last quarter both the trade and the cash business, both grew at 30%, right, and so this is not a unidimensional anymore.</p>
          <p>Our cash business is now about one-third of GTS, which is great because we never &#x2013; in the past we've not been a major cash bank, which is one reason why this award in the bottom. I've put it up because I'm very pleased with it. We were rated in a poll of clients as the fifth best cash bank in the medium corporates and eighth best in the large corporates all over Asia. Now given that most of the cash players typically tend to be the western banks. And given that we're a late starter, I think we're making very good headway. Clearly, in Singapore, we're number one and we're ranked number one. But to me the fact that we're being recognized now in Taiwan, in China, in Hong Kong and India, that's very encouraging.</p>
          <p>And the same is true for the last item I want to talk about on the cross-sell basically which is our treasury and markets business. I don't have it on the chart. If you remember in'09, only 27% of our treasury and markets business was customer-related. In '010, it moved up to 36%. In the first half of this year, it's up to 45%. The 45% is a little flattered, because the trading number is down for this quarter, as you all saw. But even if we adjust for the trading number and normalize it, it's about 42%. So directionally, I'm very pleased. We continue to build far more actuarial and less volatile T&amp;M business.</p>
          <p>Again, I was pleased with the award. Asia Risk, on a customer pool, we got ranked the fourth best house in Asia. I think we're fourth and fifth between rates and currencies. But again, in the face of all of the bulge bracket banks, this is not a bad place to be. So we're really quite pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Slide, please. One of the things that you can see quite we would be &#x2013; if you think about the stuff we're doing with GTS and with T&amp;M and all of the capital markets stuff, you can start seeing it in the nature of our institutional banking franchise. And this is again a management view. It's one of Jeanette's charts, which I stole from her. But I want to make the point that if we look at the left side of the chart, despite very strong loan growth, we've had 11% loan growth. We grew our loan book $16 billion, $17 billion from December to now, so it's not a question of we're not doing loans. We're a very active lender.</p>
          <p>But that notwithstanding, the contribution of lending to our businesses dropped from 55% to 47%, whereas the contribution of GTS and T&amp;M, what Jeanette's call the transactional piece of the business, has gone up from 36% to 43%. And this really goes back to one of the things we talked about. We do not want to be just a monoline lending bank. We really want to be a diversified full-fledged commercial bank. And this chart demonstrates how successful we're being quarter-by-quarter in being able to make that happen.</p>
          <p>Finally, last side, quick side on outlook. People ask that there is obviously some slowdown at the macroeconomic level, right. I mean Singapore GDP fourth quarter is really off. But most countries around the region are beginning to see some slowdown. However, the interesting thing is we're really not seeing a major impact on our loan pipeline with the exception of mortgages. And frankly, on our business pipelines, in general, the business activity and business demand so far has continued to stay fairly robust around the region. And as we look out certainly for the next several months where we have transparency, we're continuing to see very healthy demand and very healthy pipeline.</p>
          <p>It's possible that the China trade finance growth we saw in the second quarter might not repeat, as mentioning outside the room. I think this was partly a function of the monetary policy tightening in China. So a lot of Chinese companies, which are in the import-export trade levered and used the trade finance route more than the domestic lending route to <mark type="ph" /> this day (17:04) and it might or might not continue. So that's tough to call. But otherwise, pipelines are good and stay strong.</p>
          <p>Second, our asset book continued to stay healthy. We've stressed our book for U.S. downgrades, U.S. default, European crisis, China hard landing, you name it, but we really don't see any clouds in the horizon in terms of credit quality and in terms of our asset book. So we're quite &#x2013; relatively sanguine about that I have to say. Opportunities in GTS, treasury markets and wealth management continue. I showed you, we have momentum in each of the businesses. And we think we'll be able to continue to deliver strong growth rates in those businesses.</p>
          <p>Interest rates, I don't see them increasing. I was hoping they are increased in the second half of this year, which is what I had indicated to folks. But clearly given the shape of the global economy, what's happening, this has been pushed out at least another year. And I don't see rates actually moving up till well into '012, maybe even the &#x2013; in the back-end of '012. At the same time, as you've seen, we've been able to hold our NIMs and our margins. Our balance sheet management activities have come in nicely. Loan pricing has increased in some countries. Interest rate movements up in China and India have helped our overall book.</p>
          <p>So, the fact that interest rates are not going to go up really doesn't mean our NIMs are going to suffer. I think our NIMs are fairly steady. It just means that the potential upside from margin increases will probably come in some time later then we thought. But I guess the point I've been making is that notwithstanding that, our loans book, our non-interest income, has continued to grow quite nicely. So, we're not overly concerned about that.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, we think growth in Asia with continue to stay strong. Clearly, you need to stay vigilant. And I said with relatively sanguine. That having being been said, I do wake up every day and read very carefully what's happening in the U.S. and what's happening in Europe, not because I think there's going to be fundamental, secular impact of that, but I do think crisis or confidence could play a part.</p>
          <p>If the markets gets spooked and there is a lot of liquidity related moves, then you just got to be on top of that and make sure you're positioned appropriately for that. So, we do need to stay vigilant. But, by and large, fundamentally we're going to stay focused on executing to our strategy. It's looking quite good.</p>
          <p>I'm going to hand over then to Sok Hui. She's going to take you through some more details of our numbers and some of the other questions which you might have.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We achieved record earnings of SGD1.54 billion in the first half, up 23% from a year ago and 10% from the previous half year. Total income reached a record SGD3.75 billion as we captured customer opportunities across the region. Net interest income reached a new high of SGD2.32 billion. Loans expanded 11% or SGD16.7 billion from end 2010 and interest margins of 1.80% were stable from the recent quarters.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income of SGD1.43 billion was also a record. Fee income was boosted by stronger contributions from wealth management, trade and remittances and investment banking. Customer flows in treasury products also grew. Expenses were higher at SGD1.57 billion as head count was increased and investments made to support higher business volumes and build capacity for future growth.</p>
          <p>Profits before allowances rose 3% from a year ago and 7% from the previous half year to reach SGD2.18 billion. With asset quality continuing to improve, allowances fell to SGD262 million as specific allowances declined to eight basis points of loan. Of the total allowances of SGD262 million, SGD116 million was in general provisions, in line with the stronger loan growth. ROE for the first half reached 11.4% above the 9.8% a year ago.</p>
          <p>Second quarter earnings of SGD735 million were 2% above a year ago and 9% below the previous quarter. Customer income trends was sustained, while market-related non-interest income fell. Net interest income increased 7% from the previous quarter to SGD1.20 billion. Loans grew 7% or SGD11.3 billion this quarter from regional corporate borrowings.</p>
          <p>Interest margins were stable at 1.80% as balance sheet management efforts offset the impact of a soft interest rate environment. Fee income of SGD387 million was 7% below the previous quarter. While contributions from trade and remittances and wealth management were better, we were offset by decline in investment banking fees, which had benefited from strong IPO activity in the first quarter. Stockbroking commissions were also lower, in line with a decline in market volumes.</p>
          <p>Trading income fell to SDG146 million this quarter. This was mainly due to the mark-to-market impact of hedges we took for some of our AFS, available-for-sale, fixed income investments and overall balance sheet management. Under current accounting rules, the mark-to-market losses on hedging activities are taken above the line, while the mark-to-market gains are taken below the line. It is shown under other comprehensive income. This asymmetry in hedge accounting treatment is likely to be addressed under the new proposed accounting standards.</p>
          <p>Customer income for treasury products was higher than a year ago and comparable to the previous quarter. Expenses rose 3% from the previous quarter to SGD798 million. Profit before allowances fell 8% to SGD1.04 billion. Allowances increased 10% to SGD137 million. This was due to a 62% increase in general allowances to SGD99 million. Specific allowances continued to remain low at seven basis points of loans for this quarter.</p>
          <p>Net interest income continued to trend up in the second quarter, rising 7% from the previous quarter and 12% from a year ago to SGD1.20 billion. The uptrend in net interest income over the past few quarters has been helped by stabilization in net interest margins of around 1.80%. Our balance sheet management assets have offset residual margin pressures from a soft interest rate environment as well as from tight liquidity conditions in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 7% from the previous quarter or SGD11.3 billion to SGD169 billion. Compared to a year ago, loans have grown 15% or SGD23 billion. The loan to deposit ratio has risen slightly over the past year to 80%. The growth in the second quarter was led by regional corporate loans. Borrowing for long-term purposes such as investments and capital expenditure continued to be strong. In addition, there was also an increase in shorter term trade-related loans to China-incorporated companies, as we took advantage of market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Deposits rose 6% from the previous quarter or SGD11 billion to SGD211 billion. This brings deposit growth from a year ago to 14% or SGD27 billion. The growth in the second quarter was led by Sing dollar current and savings deposits, U.S. dollar current accounts and Chinese yen fixed deposits. In constant currency terms, loans grew 21% from a year ago, while deposits grew 18% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Fee income increased 8% from a year ago to SGD387 million. Investments in the wealth management and transaction services businesses have started to deliver better returns. Wealth management fees were up 53% from a year ago, while trade remittances fees rose 16%. Other non-interest income fell to SGD252 million, as trading income declined. As mentioned earlier, this was mainly due to the impact of hedges that we took on some of our available-for-sale fixed income portfolio as well as for balance sheet management. And again, just to emphasize, under current accounting treatment, the mark-to-market losses are taken above the line but the mark-to-market gains are taken below the line under other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>Customer income for treasury product grew in the first half, rising 42% from a year ago and 14% from the previous half year to SGD433 million. This amount is included in trading income and the amount for the first and second quarters of 2011 were comparable. Customer income accounted for 45% of total interest and non-interest treasury income in the first half of this year compared to 30% a year ago. This is the result of better cross-selling to customers.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 11% from a year ago and 3% from the previous quarter to SGD798 million. The cost/income ratio of 43% was in line with guidance. We expect the full year cost/income ratio to be higher than last year as the rollout of our strategic initiatives continue. We will ensure that the investments we are making contribute effectively to the development of our regional franchise.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong. Hong Kong reported first half earnings of SGD333 million. In constant currency terms, they rose 51% from a year ago and 5% from the previous half year. This is also a record half year high for Hong Kong, surpassing the previous high in the first half 2007 by 12% in constant currency terms. The performance is the result of better all-round performance in one of our core markets. Net interest income of SGD389 million was higher in constant currency terms than both earlier periods. Loans expanded 20% from a year ago and 16% from end 2010 in constant currency terms, driven by domestic and cross-border corporate loan.</p>
          <p>Interest margins fell 23 basis points from a year ago to 1.50%. As a result, the housing loan and customer deposit price competition were stable from the previous half year. Non-interest income rose to SGD377 million, achieving double-digit percentage growth in constant currency terms from both earlier periods. So it's broad-based fee income growth, stronger treasury cross-selling, as well as better trading gains.</p>
          <p>Expenses of SGD309 million were stable in constant currency terms from the previous half year. The higher expense in first half 2010 reflected the compensation to constellation customers. Profit before allowances improved to SGD457 million. The increase in allowances to SGD63 million was due mainly to general allowances, in line with loan growth. Specific allowances remained low as the NPL rate fell to 0.8% compared with 1.2% a year ago.</p>
          <p>Regional operations. First half earnings from our operations outside of Singapore and Hong Kong rose 41% to SGD308 million. They accounted for 20% of group earnings compared to 17% a year ago. Net interest income for these countries collectively rose 16% from a year ago to SGD504 million. The increase was across all countries driven by strong balance sheet growth. Loans booked in rest of Greater China grew 25% from a year ago to SGD14.4 billion while those in South and Southeast Asia grew 11% to SGD9.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income collectively grew 3% to SGD189 million. There were higher contributions from loan-related fees and treasury cross-sell to our corporate customers, but they offset by lower trading income. Expenses rose 14% to SGD321 million from higher head count as well as investments to expand the businesses in these countries. Total allowances fell 73% to SGD25 million, with most of the declines accounted for by lower specific allowances.</p>
          <p>Asset quality continued to improve. Non-performing assets fell 7% to SGD2.9 billion due to customer repayments and loan upgrades. More than half of the assets classified as non-performing were current in interest and principal. The NPL rate improved from 1.8% in the previous quarter to 1.5%. Allowance coverage rose to 113%. This collateral if included would amount to 148%.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remained strong with core Tier 1 at 11.5%, Tier 1 at 13.5% and total CAR at 16.5%. We've been able to generate internal capital in line with risk adjusted asset growth. This has enabled us to pay dividends and support business growth while maintaining a healthy core capital position.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we redeemed SGD1.1 billion of non-core Tier 1 preference shares. This followed a redemption of SGD1 billion in the first quarter. We issued SGD2.5 billion of new preference shares in fourth quarter of 2010 in anticipation of these redemptions.</p>
          <p>We are paying an interim dividend of SGD0.28 per share, unchanged from the previous half year. This gives shareholders an annualized dividend yield of 3.7%. The scrip dividend scheme applies for this dividend. For shareholders electing to receive their dividend in scrip, new shares will be issued at a 5% discount to the average of the closing share price on 8, 10 and 11 August, 2011.</p>
          <p>In summary, our first half results have been driven by a sustained customer income and supported by broad-based growth in business volume. The implementation of our strategy has resulted in better all-around performance of our businesses and enabled us to better capture opportunities in Asia, which offers the best structural growth prospect for the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on execution to strength and expand our regional franchise. At the same time, our strong balance sheet and prudent management of risks will enable us to weather short-term uncertainties ahead. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sok Hui, and thank you, Piyush, also. We can now begin the Q&amp;A session portion of our results briefing. And on that note, could I have the first question, please? <mark type="ph" /> Kevin (34:07)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Piyush, I think given all the uncertainty about whether the U.S. can lift it steps ceiling on time and the risk of a downgrade to the U.S. ratings, I mean what kind of measures is DBS taking as to reduce the risks, should something like that happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've done a lot of work trying to understand what the implications of a downgrade might be. And the truth is we really don't see any material shift or change in our actual position. So we have some impact on our trading positions, but frankly, we think we'll make money. We won't lose money given the way our positions are, if there is a downgrade. We have potentially some impact on underlying long-term asset holdings because it is in credit spreads, but that's also made up by incremental changes elsewhere in our position. So we don't see too much of an impact of that.</p>
          <p>There is something which is more difficult to &#x2013; and yeah, which is what might happen to the global economy. If there is a drop-off in overall confidence, global economy starts suffering, will that lead to credit problem? That's a lot more difficult dimension. But as best as we can, we think even the consequences of that are actually quite limited. So, nothing that we can see over the next several months.</p>
          <p>The biggest challenge is likely to be a liquidity issue. So, already you can start seeing dollar liquidity in the region around Asia has begun to tighten over the last few weeks and that's obviously as the market starts positioning and preparing itself for a potential downgrade or even default in the U.S. And so liquidity tightness is probably the most obvious impact that we're likely to see and so for that we've obviously been making sure that we're adequately positioned. We've made sure that we have appropriate liquidity where we need. We make sure that we've gone and retested all our liquidity arrangements. We had, in any case, over the last several quarters, managed our European positions to be at the very short end of the liquidity curve. And so our own position &#x2013; let's say, even if there is a liquidity situation, it should not have any material impact on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Piyush. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you just explain a little bit more when &#x2013; earlier you said on that question you see that you'll make some money if there was a downgrade. Could you explain that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Lisa (36:44), what happens is that our trading books are always positioned in various ways, right. You can be long dollars. You can be short dollars. You can be long and <mark type="ph" /> take (36:52). So the net take, when you look at all of our positions and net them off, really if there is what we think, let's assume the U.S. downgrade, there's increase in credit spreads, there's a weakness in U.S. dollar. If you take the impact of all of those, we might actually wind up being positive instead of negative, because of the positions that we have. And frankly, we positioned appropriately. So, if there's a downgrade we think we'll make some money more than <mark type="ph" /> anyone (37:17) but it's not material. The bottom line is that's it not a material impact.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sam from Dow Jones. Could you give us a sense of the China trade finance that you're talking about? What's some of the quantum of this? So how much we saw in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we did about SGD5 billion of China trade finance over the last quarter. I think somewhere between SGD4 billion and SGD5 billion of China trade finance in this thing, which is obviously a substantial number. In the normal course, we always do some of that. So the increment wasn't that entire SGD5 billion, but that's what we did. And obviously it picked up relative to the past. And it picked up partly &#x2013; obviously, we have been focused on finding the right clients to do this with, so it's not accidental. But monetary policy tightening in China effectively meant that a lot of companies who might have had alternative avenues for financing themselves in the past find those difficult. And so they now turn to the trade finance markets to fund themselves. Now that plays positively for somebody like us who's big in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So under ordinary business as it might have been done before this quarter, what would your lending looks like in the quarter? Would it sort of increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course. We grew SGD11 billion, so there wasn't all China trade finance, right. So, I think we're probably benefited by about a couple of billion dollars relative to our normal quarter, because of the China trade finance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. It's really a function of monetary policy in China and how PBOC &#x2013; yeah. For the time being, those pipelines are very strong, and so they continue to be replicated. The question is they are obviously inflated from a BA usage, business usage scenario. So my own think at some stage that trade finance lift will level off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So SGD5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, your outlook for NIMs, what sort of swing would you expect in terms of &#x2013; in basis points over the next few quarters given that you seem to be suggesting that things are stabilizing? How long do you anticipate this plateau will go for? Will it go until you expect U.S. interest rates start rising as you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got it wrong twice now, so that I can get it another. Because at the end of &#x2013; beginning of '010, I suggested that we might see a rate increase end of '010 and then I suggested end of '010 that we might see the increase in second half of '011. And so right now, best as I know, people &#x2013; the market &#x2013; the futures are pricing a rate increase only back-end of '012 at this stage. And, as you know, Sibor is tightly linked to the U.S. rate increases. So it's very tough to call when that rate increase cycle might start happening. What is obvious is that right now &#x2013; I made this point before, on a through cycle basis, our entire deposits earns us somewhere like 1%. To speak in '07, it earned us 2%. Right now, it earns us less than 10 basis points, right. So there's always a lot of upside as and when the rate cycle starts moving. When that happens is anybody's guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Gula (40:43)? You should use a microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. The first one is interest rates in Hong Kong have started to rise independently here because there's been a lack of liquidity, so the loan-to-deposit ratios have actually gone up above 80%. And the same thing seems to be happening since there is more loan growth and deposit growth. So do you see something like that happening and could you say interest rates &#x2013; I mean, do you see this as a bottom of the cycle? I know you got it wrong three times, but do you think that interest rates in Singapore could go up independently off America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's unlikely because LDRs in Singapore are still, what &#x2013; they are I mean 70%, high 70s, 80% or something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure. It's 80%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>80%, yeah. So that's very different, the Hong Kong situation is different. Hong Kong &#x2013; frankly, the Hong Kong rate scenario is driven by China. So, if you just thought of Hong Kong as an economic entity, you wouldn't have seen any of this stuff. The issue is really the Central Bank is typing in China, all the Chinese companies are finding a way to borrow in Hong Kong. And they do it both through the trade finance route I talked about, but they also do it just by accessing the Hong Kong markets through their subsidiaries, through their banks, through a whole bunch of stuff. So that's what's driving this huge situation in Hong Kong which is propelling the whole. The second thing that's happening in Hong Kong is on the deposit side, there's a conversion from Hong Kong dollar to RMB. So you just don't have enough Hong Kong U.S. dollar and the system is converting to RMB and thus creating this unusual kind of situation in Hong Kong where the rates are beginning to move up independent of the U.S. dollar. It's unlikely to happen in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the Chinese market, there's some concern of these <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013;  of the FDs (42:29) specifically huge amounts of debt and there's also a concern that the Chinese banks could have a hard landing even if the economy doesn't. How is DBS positioned and what will happen with Chinese banks, uneven type problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that I was waiting for you to finish your question, wondering what your analogy was. I don't think the Chinese banks can have a Lehman type problem. To think about &#x2013; you're thinking about the big numbers, right. So the Chinese banks put out $2 trillion in loans and was in the potential non-performing, the local government financing vehicle. Anybody's guess but let's call it, C100 billion, right, so that's 15%, 20% maybe, $300 billion, $400 billion. Now you've got to figure, first of all, that that's much smaller than the scale of the non-performing problem the Chinese banks had in the beginning of the decade. And the problem in the beginning of the decade the banking system and the government was able to absorb, so &#x2013; and that was a much bigger problem. So logically they should be able to absorb a much smaller problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:37)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the same, 2 trillion. It's the same, because the local governments are not allowed to borrow directly, so they all create these separate &#x2013; this thing and the banks put them out into the trust companies. But that's potentially the nature, the first one we are triangulating, right. So maybe it's SGD300 billion, SGD400 billion. It was a much bigger problem 10 years ago, the banking system and the government was able to absorb. But the second we are triangulating that is we think about the U.S. government. They wrote a check for TARP for $700 billion, remember. Now, it didn't get used but there wrote a $700 billion check.</p>
          <p>The Chinese have to write a check which is half the amount. The nature of the &#x2013; I mean, the contents are the same. The U.S. government &#x2013; they did it through a troubled assets restructuring program. The Chinese do it through the banking system and then the banks put it out and then the government goes and decapitalizes the banks, so they do it through the back door. But finally, it still goes back to the same budget offers, right.</p>
          <p>So I think that the likelihood of a Chinese bank going through a Lehman kind of situation is very, very remote because the Chinese &#x2013; resources of the Chinese government that features in reserves and the capacity of the system to be able to bailout the bank is real. And I think they have demonstrated in the past that they know how to do it and will do it. Now that having been said, we are obviously sanguine and we're not sanguine. We're careful and so we think about the counterparty risk we take. We're very focused on who we take it in and we're relatively comfortable that the state-owned banks, the big four, five the government will support. As you get down the spectrum to the provincial and city-owned banks, you'll always be very careful about.</p>

          <p>Well, I've said before. For us doing a private equity kind of investment doesn't make too much sense. So, for &#x2013; we're very consistent. We were looking &#x2013; we'd be happy to do a deal if it brings us strategic value. And if we can figure a way that we can bring value to the trade, to go in and take a pure financial position is not necessarily interesting for us.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right <mark type="ph" /> Gula (45:59), I think you had your share of questions. Anyone else here? <mark type="ph" /> Lucent, (46:03) yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all in China, can you give an update on RMB business? And a separate question is because you mentioned that the mortgages as &#x2013; you think have slowed down. Can you give more on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the RMB business &#x2013; offshore RMB business is just continuing to grow very, very strong &#x2013; very strongly. I mean it's we've been &#x2013; if you look at this thing, I mentioned before, from a deposit and structured product this thing, it's actually now our business is distributed between Singapore and Hong Kong. But if we just look at the different categories of facets of the business, heavily Hong Kong centric but doing very well. So, our interbank RMB-dollar business contributes strongly. We still think we're somewhere between 15%, 20% market share now. That's always a guesstimate number, but our traders reckon we're still up there.</p>
          <p>Our customer flows, RMB &#x2013; and obviously the NDA but mostly the CNH this thing still very strong. You can see it underlies a lot of our T&amp;M activity. Our deposit business I talked to you about. Our RMB trade finance business is strong. Interestingly we begun to build a strong RMB loan pipeline. And so I mean one of the issues we talked about briefly is we built the deposit base. We have about 40 odd billion in RMB in deposits. So if you can't build a corresponding asset base then how do you use the money? Trade finance is one channel but what's happening now is we're beginning to see a lot of demand for RMB loans. We've already done about SGD4 billion or SGD5 billion worth of &#x2013; RMB4 billion or RMB5 billion worth of loans but we have a pipeline right now for another 30 billion of RMB loans, so that's very good. That's a new development.</p>
          <p>The RMB bonds, we've been doing the dim sum bonds. We've done four in the first half of the year. We have a couple of other large ones that we've been mandated. And so we may be able to bring those into the market. So if you think about the nature of our RMB franchise it is beginning to be increasingly broad-based and beginning to contribute very materially and meaningfully to the range &#x2013; nature of our businesses both on the mainland, in Hong Kong and in Singapore. So we were actually quite bullish about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of mortgages, clearly there is a slowdown in mortgages in Hong Kong. All of the administrative actions are very clearly biting. You can see the loan volumes coming off quite sharply. There's definitely a slowdown in China with all of the actions in Beijing, Shanghai and frankly, we've been going slow in China anyway for several quarters now. We reigned in our business as early as the first quarter of last year because we weren't very comfortable with where the markets were. And Singapore, as I told you in the last quarter, business slowed down. I mean, at the end of January set of actions from MAS, February, March, even April, volumes came out very sharply. Volumes have picked back up somewhat in the last couple of months, but again, relative to BAU and historic past volumes are down quite favorably. So the mortgage actions around the region are very clearly beginning to get some bite.</p>

          <p>It's tough for me to call what's happening. Again, the mortgages thing it keeps having a life of its own. I did mention before that in our segments of the market where we are strong which is HDB, HDB upgrader, low end of the market, yes. The rates are definitely I think single-digits. The high end of the market, the luxury end of the market, continues to be a lot more resilient. We're actually beginning to increase our market share in the luxury end of the market and have moved our market share in the last quarter or so. But net-net it's tough to call how much the top end of the market might grow.</p>

          <p>I just want to get a &#x2013; I understand DBS is one of the first bank to tap this China, Singapore currency swap. Can you just give an update, has it been approved, the application and do you see a lot of demand for this as well? And just let me ask you a second question as well. I saw that your staff cost in your head count have risen 4% in the last quarter. Do you see this trend continuing for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the swap facility thing, actually the swap facility uses a good thing to do because we wanted to make a case. We're the first people to go use it. But in reality, you think of a way the swap facility works, the Chinese provided RMB. The truth is that there's enough revenue floating around, so you really don't need the Chinese swap window to get hold of the RMB. So from ongoing economic thing it's unlikely that there will be a lot use of the swap facility in the current situation. It's only if there's a shortage of RMB that the swap facility starts or generally a shortage of liquidity. What could happen is if there's a complete shortage of liquidity, Europe collapses then obviously the swap facility will be very helpful. But in the absence of that, I don't see a lot of use of the swap facility being made.</p>

          <p>On the head count expenses, yes, I've been indicating that we're an investment board and we're continuing to invest with a view to the long-term. And so we're likely to continue to see growth, but also a fact that our cost/income ratios will level off, and they should level off shy of 45% is what we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So they're hiring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're continuing to hire and so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At what rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not slowing off. So if we look at the bulk of our hiring that has happened over the last three or four quarters, we've hired for the wealth business. We've hired for the SME business. We've hired for the GTS business. We've hired to build out a branch franchise in some of the expansion markets. A lot of that is in place. So we'll continue to hire, but the peak of the hiring is probably being to be as we start lending off.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, last question, so I hear a question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the hiring, did you say that you reached the peak of the hiring or are you leveling off of the peak of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:40)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, yeah, we haven't reached the peak. Let's look at the question at. We've probably reached the peak of the hiring in terms of how many people we bring on. It's not the peak of our head count, because we will continue to hire, so the head count will probably peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the dollar liquidity, is there any sort of number or any sort of volume available of how much dollar &#x2013; U.S. dollar liquidity has been affected because of the crisis in this part of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Is somebody around who would &#x2013; I don't. No, none of my Ph.D boys are here. They might have had a sense for this thing. Maybe we can try and get some little chat with you around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think funding costs have started creeping up, is the point, more than absolute dollar liquidity. That's what my <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:25) is showing me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering about the impact of Indonesia's propose for an ownership cap on DBS strategy there. You guys have been linked and I'm on &#x2013; and you guys were --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We guys are what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys have been constantly linked in the news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, linked to the news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought you knew something I didn't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we think they own &#x2013; you guys own 99% state which is if a cap implemented will be affected. So how &#x2013; what will your strategy be for Indonesia in the coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a tough question. We really don't know what that regulation might be, if there is a regulation. So this was the Governor of central bank said something at a door stop interview and we've not been given any guidance or a guideline. Frankly my investigation also said a complete lack of clarity about what is even being proposed. So far nobody has talked about a foreign ownership cap. If you really look at all the stuff, there's no reference of foreign ownership cap. My understanding is that to get a reduction of foreign ownership caps requires a change in the law. So, it would have to go to parliament. And so that's not been talked about.</p>
          <p>All the news and the sound bites have really been around single ownership, which is very different from a foreign ownership cap, right. Single ownership in most countries, in most contexts, really focuses more on ownership of banks by industrial houses and by individual entrepreneurs and which is a very completely different kettle of fish and that would have completely different ramifications from just what is the stance of a foreign investor in the country. So bottom line it's still very uncertain and very unfair.</p>
          <p>Obviously, if you get to a situation where Indonesia decides that all foreign investors need to dilute down to sub 50%, obviously that will be a blow. I don't think it's good for Indonesia. I think it will have impact on Indonesia's FDI aspirations in the future. So I think they'll be very thoughtful before they go down that path. But again, bottom line, we really don't know what is on the angle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Just one last question. Of course, we have a &#x2013; at the moment you've got 40 billion of RMB &#x2013; 40 billion RMB deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Group-wise, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about half and half. Half in Hong Kong, half in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then what about &#x2013; and then there was SGD5 billion trade finance &#x2013; China trade finance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they are different currency. The 40 billion is RMB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The trade finance are Sing dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then you talked about you've done 4 billion to 5 billion of RMB loans and the pipeline there are 30 &#x2013; you're looking at 30 billion RMB loans in the pipeline. Then you went on to say that &#x2013; there was a question on the short line, I mean, yes and the China central bank and there's really no need to access that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it has to be a very particular situation. So in the one we did, the client situation was very specific, all right, where we could figure out the way to use the swap line. But my point was a general rule the swap line makes RMB available from China into Singapore, right. And to the extent there's already now so much CNH floating around, you really don't need to access the swap line to get hold of RMB. RMB is really available.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, thank you very much. We have a media briefing scheduled with the whole team in Hong Kong right now. So we'll have to call this to a close, but once again thank you for coming.</p>
