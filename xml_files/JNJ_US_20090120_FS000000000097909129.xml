      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome.  I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2008 and full year 2008.  Joining me on the podium today are our hosts for today's meeting: Bill Weldon, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>A few logistics before we get into the details, the audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments.  Following my remarks, Bill Weldon will comment on the 2008 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company.  At the completion of Bill's remarks, Dominic Caruso will provide some additional commentary on the 2008 financial results and guidance for 2009.  We will then open the floor to your questions.  We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30.  And following Q&amp;A with some final remarks by Bill, we'll conclude the meeting around 10 AM.</p>
          <p>Distributed with the copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises.  For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website as is a copy of the press release.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation may be considered forward-looking statements.  The 10-K for the fiscal year 2007 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning.  The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.  The 10-K is available through the company or online.</p>
          <p>Last item, during the call non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance.  These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2008.  If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area.</p>
          <p>Worldwide sales to customers were $15.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, down 4.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  On an operational basis, sales were down 1% and currency had a negative impact of 3.9%.  In the US, sales declined 6.9%.  In regions outside the US, our operational growth was 5.4%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 8.1 points.  Our strongest performing region was the Asia-Pacific-Africa region, which grew 9.9% on an operational basis.  The Western Hemisphere excluding the US grew by 6% operationally while Europe grew 2.7% operationally.</p>
          <p>If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings on a reported basis were $2.7 billion and earnings per share were $0.97.  This compares to $2.4 billion and $0.82 in the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided adjusted earnings information.  As referenced in the footnote, fourth quarter 2008 results were adjusted to exclude special items, including charges for in-process research and development and the after-tax net gain from several litigation matters.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, results were adjusted to exclude the write-down of the intangible asset related to NATRECOR, and a tax gain associated with the restructuring of certain international subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>Net earnings on an adjusted basis were $2.6 billion and earnings per share were $0.94, up 3.1% and 6.8% respectively versus the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights.  Cost of goods sold at 28.8% of sales was 90 basis points less than the same period in 2007.  In 2007, the results were impacted by one-time charges.  The 2008 results had some favorable impact of one-time items, which were substantially offset by charges in other income and expense.  Excluding one-time items, cost of goods sold would have increased approximately 30 basis points due to the ongoing changing mix of the business.</p>
          <p>Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 37.3% of sales were up 150 basis points versus last year.  As we discussed last quarter, we planned some investment spending in the fourth quarter.  The increase in selling, marketing, and administration is in combination of this investment spending and the change in the mix of our business, driven by the growth in the consumer business and the lower sales in the pharmaceutical business.</p>
          <p>Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 13.9%, 70 basis points less than the fourth quarter of 2007, due to a combination of the change of mix of businesses and lower spending in our pharmaceutical business.</p>
          <p>Interest expense net of interest income of $17 million compares to $35 million of net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2007.  This change in net expense was due to lower interest income resulting from lower rates on invested cash and higher interest expense due to a higher average debt position in the quarter versus the same period last year as we continue buying back shares as part of the repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Other income net of other expense was $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $877 million of net other expense in the same period last year.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, we closed on the sale of the Professional Wound Care business.  The resulting gain as well as the net gain from litigation settlements that I mentioned earlier are included in this account.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, the write-down of the intangible asset related to NATRECOR was recorded in this account.</p>
          <p>With regard to taxes, please direct your attention to the effective tax rate excluding special charges showed in the box section of the schedule.  Taxes were 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus 15.3% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Dominic will provide additional commentary on both other income and expense and taxes in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Looking at full year data, consolidated sales to customers for 2008 were $63.7 billion, an increase of 4.3% as compared to 2007.  On an operational basis, growth was 1.9% and currency had a positive impact of 2.4 points.  On the consolidated statement of year-to-date earnings, I'd first like to draw your attention to the box section.  In 2008 and 2007, net income and earnings per share have been adjusted for special items.  In both years, charges for in-process research and development have been excluded.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in 2008, the after-tax net litigation gains have been excluded.  In 2007, the after-tax costs associated with the restructuring program, the non-cash charge related to NATRECOR write-down, and the one-time gain associated with the restructuring of certain international subsidiaries have been excluded.</p>
          <p>With these adjustments, net earnings for the 12 months of 2008 were $12.9 billion or $4.55 per share, up 6.8% and 9.6% respectively as compared to the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedules highlighting major products or business franchises.  I'll begin with the Consumer segment.  Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $3.9 billion increased 1.2% as compared to the same period last year.  Operational growth was 6.9% while the impact of currency was negative 5.7 points.  US sales were up 1.8% while international sales grew 10.6% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2008, sales for the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 8.5% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2007.  Sales in the US were up 4.7% due to the successful US launch of ZYRTEC, partially offset by lower sales of cough and cold products due to the slower start to the season versus last year.  Sales outside the US were up 12.6% operationally, driven by strong growth of adult TYLENOL, NICORETTE, other respiratory products, and nutritionals.</p>
          <p>Our skin care business achieved operational sales growth of 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008, with sales in the US growing at 6.2% and sales outside the US up 15.3% on an operational basis.  Strong growth was driven by the newly acquired products from Dabao, the leading moisturizer in China.  Johnson's adult, AVEENO, NEUTROGENA also made significant contributions to the growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Baby Care products achieved operational growth of 3.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Sales in the US were down 6%, primarily due to the lower sales for BabyCenter.com.  Solid growth across most product lines resulted in an operational increase in sales outside the US of 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Women's Health achieved operational growth of 1.1%.  Sales in the US were flat while sales outside the US were up on an operational basis by 1.6%.  Solid growth in external sanitary protection was partially offset by sales declines in other products.</p>
          <p>Operational sales growth in the Oral Care franchise was 10.5%, with US sales up 1.6%.  In the US, strong growth in REMBRANDT products has been partially offset by slower sales in floss and mouth fresheners.  Sales outside the US increased 19.3% operationally, driven by very strong growth for LISTERINE across the major regions.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Wound Care/Other category were down 6.1% on an operational basis, with the US down 17.2% and the business outside the US up 7%.  The lower sales in the US were due to increased competition and a reduction to the trade inventory levels.</p>
          <p>That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceutical segment.  Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $5.7 billion were down 11.1% versus the same period last year.  On an operational basis, sales were down 7.8%, with a currency impact of negative 3.3 points.  Sales in the US decreased 13% while sales outside the US increased on an operational basis by 0.5%.</p>
          <p>Our results continue to be impacted by generic competition on some of our products, namely DURAGESIC, RAZADYNE, and RISPERDAL Oral.  The patent for RISPERDAL expired in the US at the end of June 2008, and there are generic competitors for RISPERDAL in most markets.  Generic competitors for RAZADYNE entered the US market in the latter half of the year.</p>
          <p>The combined impact of these three products has reduced the fourth quarter worldwide Pharmaceutical operational growth rate by approximately 9.5 points, with the US impact estimated at approximately 13% and the impact outside the US estimated at 4%.  Excluding the impact of generic competition, operational sales growth was approximately 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Now reviewing the major products, ACIPHEX, as it's known in the US market and PARIET outside the US, is a proton pump inhibitor or PPI that we co-market with Eisai.  On an operational basis, sales were down 15.6%, with similar results both in and outside of the US.  In the US, script share has been negatively impacted by additional generic launches in the PPI category.  Sales have also been impacted by the market entry in Canada of generic rabeprazole, the active ingredient in PARIET.</p>
          <p>CONCERTA, a product for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, grew 3.1% operationally in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year, with sales in the US down 6.3%.  In the US, market growth has been offset by lower market share.  The FDA approval earlier this year of the adult indication for CONCERTA will enable us to compete in the broader ADHD market.  Sales outside the US were up 34% operationally, with strong growth seen across the major regions.</p>
          <p>Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were down 4.2% on an operational basis when compared to the same period a year ago, due to lower prescription share.  Share was negatively impacted by generics in the category.</p>
          <p>PROCRIT/EPREX declined operationally by 5.9% during the quarter as compared to the same period last year, with PROCRIT down 3.9% and EPREX down 8.2% operationally.  New competition and the softening of the market have contributed to the lower sales results for EPREX.  PROCRIT results have been impacted by a decline in the market versus the fourth quarter of 2007, estimated at 13%, partially offset by an increase in overall market share.  PROCRIT aggregate share across all markets was approximately 49% in the fourth quarter of 2008, up four points versus the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Sales of REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, were down 2.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  Sales growth in the US was 1.7%.  Sales were impacted by lower customer inventory levels as well as a lower market share due to increased competition.  Sales to our customers for markets outside the US were down 15%, due to the timing of shipments related to production scheduling due to maintenance.  Excluding this impact, sales outside the US are estimated to have grown over 20%.</p>
          <p>RISPERDAL CONSTA, our long-acting injectable formulation, achieved fourth quarter sales growth of 16.3% on an operational basis.  US sales growth was 8.3% while sales outside the US were up 20.9% operationally with continued positive momentum and share.</p>
          <p>Sales of TOPAMAX, which is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis, increased operationally by 6.4%.  Sales in the US were up 7.7% while sales outside the US were up 0.9% on an operational basis.  In the US, market share in the migraine category increased versus the same period last year.  Outside the US, strong growth was achieved in many markets, offset by generic entries in certain other markets.</p>
          <p>VELCADE, a treatment for the relapsed multiple myeloma, is being co-developed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals.  We have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the US.  Operational sales growth was 33.5%, with very strong results achieved across the regions.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up the review of the Pharmaceutical segment, after careful consideration, all research and commercial activities related to IONSYS have been stopped.  Technical challenges with IONSYS led to this decision.  We remain committed to exploring novel delivery technologies, and believe strongly in the potential that innovative drug device combinations may offer.</p>
          <p>Additionally, regarding TMC-207, a compound for the treatment of tuberculosis, the planned filing is now projected for the 2011 timeframe.  The compound looks very promising.  However, patient enrollment in the clinical trials is taking longer than anticipated.</p>
          <p>Regarding ustekinumab, we have submitted our response to the FDA complete response letter.</p>
          <p>I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results.  Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $5.6 billion grew 1.6% operationally as compared to the same period in 2007.  Currency had a negative impact of 3.5 points, resulting in total sales decline of 1.9%.  Sales in the U.S. were down 3% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 5.6%.  Results have been impacted by lower sales of drug-eluting stents.  Sales excluding the impact of lower sales of drug-eluting stents grew nearly 4.5% operationally.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 15.5% operationally, with the U.S. down 35.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.3%.  Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of CYPHER, our sirolimus-eluting stent, and endovascular products, partially offset by the solid growth in our Biosense Webster business.</p>
          <p>CYPHER sales were approximately $270 million, down 34% on an operational basis versus the prior year.  Sales in the U.S. of approximately $70 million were down 63%.  In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2007, the U.S. drug-eluting stent market growth is estimated at 17%.  Penetration rates are estimated at 73%, up from 61% a year ago, while PCI procedures are up approximately 4% in the quarter versus the same period last year.  The estimated price for CYPHER in the U.S. is down approximately 6% versus the fourth quarter of 2007.  Estimated share in the U.S. of 15% was down eight points sequentially and down 32 points from the fourth quarter of 2007, due to the market entry of two new competitors in 2008.  Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $200 million declined 10% operationally.</p>
          <p>The estimated market share in the quarter of 32% was up two points on a sequential basis and down four points from the fourth quarter of 2007.  Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S. CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 25%, down three points sequentially and down 15 points from the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Endovascular sales were impacted by the recall of a re-entry catheter.</p>
          <p>Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved solid operational growth in the quarter, driven by disposable catheter products.</p>
          <p>Our DePuy franchise had operational sales growth of 8.3% when compared to the same period in 2007, with the U.S. growing 10% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 6.2% operationally.</p>
          <p>Hip growth on a worldwide basis was 11% operational, outpacing the market growth in both the US and international businesses.  On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was 6%, while spine grew 8%.  The rate of growth in our spine business has accelerated throughout the year due to the successful launch of a number of products.</p>
          <p>Mitek, our sports medicine business, grew 12% operationally, outpacing the estimated market growth.</p>
          <p>The Diabetes franchise was down 6.1% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the US business down 18.4%.  The US results were impacted by an adjustment to prior period estimates of sales rebate reserves.  Excluding this adjustment, US sales in the quarter would have been down approximately 2%.  Positive momentum and share have been offset by pricing pressure and slower category growth.  Outside the US, sales increased 7.5% operationally, due to the successful launch of a number of new products.</p>
          <p>Animas, our insulin pump business, grew 40% on an operational basis due to new product launches and continued development of the international market.</p>
          <p>Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 9% in the fourth quarter of 2008, with US sales growing 7.1% and sales outside the US growing on an operational basis by 11.6%.  The HARMONIC technology business achieved strong double digit operational growth due to the global success of recently launched products and the underlying strength of this platform.  Also contributing to growth in the quarter was the REALIZE Gastric Band, launched earlier this year in the US, and the strong performance of the endoscopy products in the international market, driven by increased awareness of the benefits of minimally invasive procedures as well as the metabolic benefits of obesity surgery.</p>
          <p>Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 3.3%, with the US up 2.8% and sales outside the US up 3.5%.  Slower growth in sutures due to lower distributor inventory levels and the divestiture of the Professional Wound Care business in December impacted growth in the quarter.  This impact has been offset by strong double digit growth in hemostasis, meshes, and biosurgicals.</p>
          <p>Ortho Clinical Diagnostics achieved operational growth of 1.7% in the fourth quarter.  Sales growth in the US was 1.2% while sales outside the US were up 2.3% on an operational basis.  Results have been impacted by order timing and lower sales in donor screening.</p>
          <p>Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 5.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.  Sales in the US increased 5.8%.  Sales outside the US grew 5.5% on an operational basis.  The rate of growth has been impacted by the softness in the lens category overall and competitive launches.  ACUVUE OASYS, 1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST, and the ACUVUE OASYS for astigmatism were major growth drivers in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The completes highlights for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson's fourth quarter of 2008.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Bill Weldon.  Bill?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Louise, and thank you all for being here today.  Many of us are going to remember 2008 as a year of extraordinary economic events that shook our financial markets and the global economy.  With that backdrop as context, I'm extremely proud of Johnson &amp; Johnson's accomplishments in 2008 and the way our people met our commitments with continued sales and earnings growth, with significant progress in our pipelines and product launches, and with continued investments in the future growth of our business.  We faced and will continue to face challenges.  But our people, our products, our pipelines, and our financial strength give me confidence that we are well positioned for the future.</p>
          <p>This morning, I'll briefly review Johnson &amp; Johnson's 2008 business and financial results, and provide an update on how we are executing against our strategic plans for leadership and growth in the healthcare industry.  I will also explain how we are preparing to deal with recent economic events and seize new growth opportunities.  I'd like to leave you today with a deeper understanding of what we have done to prepare our business for 2009 and the longer term.  From this, you'll see why I am confident that Johnson &amp; Johnson will emerge from this period stronger and even better positioned for growth as the economy and healthcare markets recover.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we delivered on our financial commitments despite the near-term pressures on our business and unforeseen shifts in the economic climate.  We strengthened our core businesses and made significant progress in launching new products and line extensions and advancing our pipelines.</p>
          <p>In addition to the growth that comes from our internal R&amp;D, we also pursued licensing agreements and acquisitions that provided us new capabilities in Medical Devices and Diagnostics, and a stronger consumer presence in markets like China.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we have largely implemented the major cost structure improvements we outlined for our Pharmaceuticals and Cordis business in mid-2007, and we have realized approximately $1.6 billion in annual savings from these actions, which is at the higher end of our earlier guidance.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the integration of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business is on track.  We are comfortable that we will achieve cost synergies at the higher end of our previously disclosed range of 500 to $600 million by the end of 2009.  And we still expect this transaction to be breakeven or modestly accretive this year, one year ahead of schedule than the original schedule.</p>
          <p>We also continued throughout the year with our $10 billion share repurchase program.  As of the end of December, we have purchased approximately $8.1 billion of stock.</p>
          <p>Our business, driven by committed financial discipline, continued to deliver strong adjusted earnings growth and solid sales growth when considering the generic challenges we faced.  Our broad base of Consumer, Pharmaceutical, and Medical Device and Diagnostics businesses increased sales to $63.7 billion, despite the loss of exclusivity of RISPERDAL Oral for half the year, continuing pressures on our drug-eluting stent and PROCRIT business, and the additional impact of the economic decline.</p>
          <p>We achieved strong adjusted earnings growth of 6.8% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.6%, which was higher than earnings due to our share repurchase program.  And we also generated a strong free cash flow of approximately $12.2 billion.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you of the expectations we set at this meeting last January.  We said we expected operational sales in 2008 to increase 1 to 2% as we faced the patent expiration and business pressures I mentioned a moment ago.  We delivered 1.9%.  This is a significant achievement when you take into account the additional economic challenges that arose later in the year.  In January, we projected an adjusted EPS range of $4.39 to $4.44.  And at the end of the year, we generated an adjusted EPS of $4.55, a 9.6% increase.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales by segment, Consumer generated approximately $16 billion in revenue or 25% of our total; Pharmaceuticals approximately $24.6 billion or 39% of our total; and MD&amp;D generated $23.1 billion or 36% of our total.  Our Consumer business once again provided (sic) [proved] why it's the premier consumer healthcare company in the world.  With its science based innovations and iconic global brands, Consumer segment sales grew 8.3% operationally year over year.</p>
          <p>In the OTC/Nutritionals business, the successful launch of ZYRTEC as an over-the-counter allergy medicine was a major contributor to this growth.  Strong sales of other consumer products like NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, LISTERINE, and our international baby care brands helped drive significant growth in our other franchises.</p>
          <p>The Pharmaceutical segment saw an operational sales decline of 3.1% for the year.  Excluding the impact of generic competition and continuing declines in PROCRIT, Pharmaceutical sales would have known by 6% operationally.  Nine products had sales of more than $1 billion, including REMICADE, RISPERDAL CONSTA, and TOPAMAX.</p>
          <p>In addition, we saw strong sales growth from newer promising products like PREZISTA, VELCADE, and INVEGA.  With these newer drugs and promising compounds in our late stage pipeline, we see positive momentum building for the longer term.</p>
          <p>Our Medical Device and Diagnostics business is the largest medical technology business in the world, with sales of $23 billion.  More than 80% of MD&amp;D sales were derived from businesses where we hold the number one or number two market position.  We continued to see solid growth and performance in six of our seven franchises in the face of tough competition.  MD&amp;D sales grew by 3.5% operationally.  Excluding the impact of lower drug-eluting stent sales, operational growth would have been a healthy 6%.</p>
          <p>Some of the key growth drivers included Vision Care with products like ACUVUE OASYS and 1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST, Ethicon Endo-Surgery's HARMONIC technology and REALIZE Adjustable Gastric Band, and the DePuy orthopedic and Mitek sports medicine products.</p>
          <p>Our Cordis business continued to see the impact of new entrants in the drug-eluting stent market, but it succeeded in broadening the strength of the cardiovascular franchise by continuing to build momentum in its Biosense Webster and neurovascular businesses.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for 2008 was $17.3 billion and 27% to sales; and that compares to $15.9 billion or 26% in 2007.  This 110 basis point increase can be attributed to the excellent job our leadership team did in managing their businesses and containing costs during the year, even as the volatile economic climate began driving increases in commodity costs and shifts in consumer and patient behaviors.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the people of Johnson &amp; Johnson, we have managed through difficult economic cycles many times throughout our history.  The past year presented its own extraordinary challenges, some we anticipated and planned for.  Others could not be foreseen and required decisive actions during the year.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenges, we continued a legacy of performance that few if any companies can claim.  During 2008, stock indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 were down more than 30%.  And other drug and healthcare indices were down about 20 to 30% in terms of total return to shareholders.  Comparatively, Johnson &amp; Johnson's total return to shareholders declined just 8%.  While we're never pleased with declines in our returns, we were the third best performer in the Dow for 2008.  When you look at our total shareholder returns over three, five, and ten-year periods, we beat and consistently beat the major indices that we compare to.</p>
          <p>I'd like to spend the rest of my time talking to you about how we plan to execute against our strategies for leadership and growth in healthcare.  This chart will be familiar to most of you.  It sizes the global healthcare market for 2007 at $4.1 billion (sic) [$4.1 trillion], and breaks out those areas where we compete today and the areas of healthcare where we have not yet entered.  About $1.3 trillion of that figure includes a variety of healthcare product areas where we do compete: Consumer, Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices and Diagnostics, and where we hold about 5% market share.  The remaining $2.8 trillion consists of healthcare markets that include providers, payors, administration, fitness, health information, and many others.  So there is plenty of opportunity for Johnson &amp; Johnson in the global healthcare market as we grow share in our existing markets and move into fertile grounds for expansion.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to a discussion of four major factors that will influence our business performance in 2009.  These are the general healthcare environment and trends that are shaping the future, our own near-term business pressures, the macroeconomic factors that every business is facing, and the volatility of currency.</p>
          <p>To begin, there are many forces shaping healthcare, the healthcare environment that we have considered in our planning.  For instance, an aging world population is creating incredible demand.  In fact, every 3.5 seconds somewhere [somebody] in the world is turning 65.  People are becoming increasingly interested in knowing about and managing their own health, not just their illnesses.  And as the movement to wellness and prevention gains more momentum, even medical practitioners are more concerned with keeping patients healthy rather than just treating them when they become ill.</p>
          <p>Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity are on the rise, driving up the cost of healthcare.  Significant changes in healthcare systems and reimbursement models are being considered in United States and elsewhere.  These and other trends are putting more pressure than ever on healthcare systems to meet demands for innovation, quality healthcare, and to do that in more effective and cost efficient ways.</p>
          <p>The second factor for discussion includes the near-term business pressures that we have known about and have been preparing for.  These include a well understood &#x2013; and during the past year, our company has made adjustments to their business plans to address the conditions we anticipated: generic competition for some pharmaceutical products, aggressive new competitors in some of our surgical and comprehensive care businesses, and low cost brands fighting for market share with our consumer products.</p>
          <p>We have made modifications where and when appropriate.  These included streamlining our infrastructure to reduce our cost basis, prioritizing our R&amp;D investments to ensure the success of the most promising products, continuing our investments in new product launches, focusing on emerging markets, and expanding our presence in new and adjacent markets.  While some of these actions have been difficult, all were necessary to ensure the strength of our business, and we should see the full-year benefits of a number of these actions in 2009.</p>
          <p>The third factor we must consider in 2009 is the macroeconomic environment that every business is facing.  Over the past several months, we have experienced a global financial and business slowdown unlike anything we have seen during our lifetimes.  Much has already been written or reported about the early effects the economic slowdown is having on healthcare spending and behaviors.</p>
          <p>IMS projects a slowing growth in the U.S. prescription drug market, down 1 to 2% a year from 4.2% in 2007.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, with unemployment on the rise, people have begun avoiding healthcare treatment or cutting back even for serious conditions.  Many analysts have reported that surgeries, especially elective procedures, are being postponed.  Hospitals and healthcare providers are tightening their inventory levels and budgets, while consumers are watching their spending more closely.</p>
          <p>In Johnson &amp; Johnson, we are seeing early effects in a few parts of our business.  For example, while growth is still strong in an area like sports medicine, we have recently seen slight declines in growth rates in the market.  Also in markets that require more out-of-pocket spending like diabetes test strips and contact lenses, we are seeing some signs that consumers and patients are becoming more frugal.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the strength of our leadership team, our broad base of businesses and our fiscal discipline, I remain very optimistic about our ability to adjust to the evolving economic conditions.  I'm also very excited about the new products and strong pipelines that position us well for the future.</p>
          <p>The fourth factor that could have a significant impact on our business in 2009 is currency.  The fluctuation in exchange rates over the last six months has been dramatic.  These fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future financial results and Dominic will discuss the potential impact of currency in more detail during his remarks.</p>
          <p>Every challenging period brings with it a corresponding opportunity for growth and this one is no exception.  By working in a disciplined way, Johnson &amp; Johnson will emerge stronger than ever, remaining the world's leading company in addressing human health and well being.  And I believe this for several reasons.  As always, success starts with leadership and we are fortunate to have an experienced management team in place with the right skills to capitalize on market conditions and build businesses for the long-term growth.</p>
          <p>We are strengthening our core franchises, advancing our pipelines and introducing new products that will replenish and grow our revenue streams.  We are building our market leadership positions and venturing into new growth spaces for Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our financial strength and flexibility with a combination of strong cash flows and a AAA credit rating, which gives us access to credit at favorable rates.  We have implemented cost structure improvements that should reap benefits for the bottom line and help us operate more efficiently.  We are actively participating in the dialogues on public policy that will shape our business environment for years to come.  In the meantime, we continue to implement our strategic plan, which will strengthen our company for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are looking for new opportunities that may exist for our businesses under today's unique market conditions.  Whenever the economy and healthcare markets return to a more robust growth, we will be stronger and better positioned for leadership in the markets where we choose to compete.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to spend my remaining time discussing the progress we have made on the four business priorities that we outlined last year.  At the foundation of Johnson &amp; Johnson's business is a fundamental commitment to our credo, which provides a common set of values for our approximately 120,000 employees around the globe.  The four tenets of our credo provide a clear focus and mindset for how we approach every decision: patients and customers first, then our employees, our communities, and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also work under an operating model that has served us well for decades.  Its four elements are being broadly based in human healthcare, managing our businesses for the long term, taking a decentralized management approach, and focusing on our people and values.</p>
          <p>Last year, I introduced four enterprise-wide business priorities that continue to be critical to achieving our long-term growth plans.  They are winning in healthcare, capitalizing on convergence, accelerating growth in emerging markets, and developing leadership and talent.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by discussing what we mean by winning in healthcare.  There are three major elements to winning in healthcare.  First is growing our existing businesses.  This encompasses advancing the pipeline, launching new products and extensions, and enhancing our core strengths and franchises.  Second is building new platforms for growth.  These include making acquisitions and executing licensing agreements and also building new businesses in healthcare markets where we do not currently compete.  And third is actively participating in the dialogue around public policy that will help shape the healthcare landscape for the future.</p>
          <p>Developing our own products and technologies within the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies is the most efficient way to grow our existing businesses.  We have continued to make significant investments in R&amp;D across the business with approximate spending of $7.6 billion in 2008.  As planned, our R&amp;D investments began leveling off last year because we have substantially increased investments over the past several years to accommodate progress in our late-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>At our investor meeting in 2007, we set new goals for our pharmaceutical pipeline.  We said we would file seven to ten new products for approval between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2010.  And despite some setbacks, we remain on course with that commitment.  We have eight new compounds currently in registration and five of those were filed with the FDA in 2008.  Tapentadol, an immediate release tablet for the relief of moderate to severe pain, was also approved later in the year.  We plan to file several more compounds by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>At our investor meeting in June, we briefed you on many of the exciting developments in our Medical Devices and Diagnostics businesses.  We have robust pipelines in both our surgical care and comprehensive care groups.  Here's an updated look at our surgical care pipeline.  There are many projects on this comprehensive list worth highlighting.  But in the interest of time, let me mention just two.  In surgical care, we have developed the first computer assisted personalized sedation system called SEDASYS.  The device which is currently under review by the FDA will make it easier for physician and nurse teams to deliver propofol to patients undergoing screening and diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer and disorders of the upper GI tract.  By integrating drug delivery and patient monitoring, the SEDASYS system has the potential to change the way sedation is delivered.</p>
          <p>We talked in June about the PRINEO Skin Closure system.  PRINEO will be used in surgical applications that require significant intradermal suturing time like body contouring procedures.  This time saving system allows for a significant reduction in OR time for the hospital and a reduction in general anesthesia time for patients, which should improve patient outcomes.  PRINEO is currently used in Europe and is expected to launch in the United States this year.</p>
          <p>In the comprehensive care pipeline, we are also seeing good progress on several fronts.  Again in the interest of time, let me mention just a few.  In 2008, we received approval for two new diagnostic systems: VITROS 5600 integrated system shown here, which is uniquely designed to integrate clinical chemistry and immunoassay testing to increase laboratory productivity; and the VITROS 3600, a high throughput system used for immunoassay and infectious diseases.  Both of these next-generation platforms can simultaneously run more than 100 tests and are designed to run innovative, high impact diagnostic tests in the future.</p>
          <p>We feel very positive about the progress we are making on clinical trials for our NEVO sirolimus-eluting stent.  This cobalt chromium stent features a bioabsorbable polymer and a unique reservoir technology.  The first clinical trial for NEVO, RES-ELUTION I, completed patient enrollment ahead of schedule, and we plan to present six-month primary endpoint data from this trial at the EuroPCR MIP conference in May.  We expect to file NEVO for CE Mark approval in Europe in 2009.</p>
          <p>Within our Biosense Webster business, we are awaiting FDA approval for an atrial fibrillation indication for the NaviStar ThermoCool Ablation Catheter.  In December, an FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended approval for this indication, which will make Biosense Webster the first and only company in the United States with an approved AFib indication, opening up a market with a penetration rate of less than 2%.</p>
          <p>The foundation of our Consumer product success has always been based on superior science and technology with recent developments like Helioplex technology for sunscreens or rapid-release gel technology for OTC medication.  We feature a wide array of scientific research competencies in areas like skin biology, pharmacokinetics, drug delivery, and microbiology to name a few.</p>
          <p>We have built a significant portfolio of proprietary technologies including dissolvable strips and taste masking for oral care and OTC drug delivery, active naturals and fragrances used in skin care, and cellular resuscitation and advanced adhesives for wound care and healing.</p>
          <p>We also continue to enhance our clinical trial expertise and expand our R&amp;D capabilities around the world, developing products for emerging markets where our business has grown considerably.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our existing and new products, the result from our investments, as well as our acquisition and licensing activities.  Our existing franchises make up the broadest base of healthcare businesses in the world and are well known leaders across our three segments, holding the number one or number two market leadership positions in various markets.  In 2008, approximately 70% of our revenues came from products with these market leading positions.</p>
          <p>Last year across all three of our businesses, we launched hundreds of new products and line extensions, some of which are highlighted on this screen.  In addition to the products we developed internally, we have made several acquisitions to add technology platforms, brands, and market presence in areas where we saw opportunities.  We acquired Dabao Cosmetics in China, which brings with it the country's number one moisturizer and a brand that is well known and respected among Chinese consumers.  This acquisition also opens up opportunities to do more business in mid-tier markets, expanding the base of consumers we can serve in this region.</p>
          <p>In late 2008, we announced several other acquisitions in our Surgical Care business.  We acquired Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, a company we knew well through existing partnerships and distribution agreements.  Omrix develops and markets biosurgical and immunotherapy products.  It will strengthen our presence in active biologic based hemostasis as well as convergent products for surgical procedures like the Fibrin Pad, which is in clinical trials.</p>
          <p>Another is Mentor Corporation, a highly respected market leader for breast augmentation and reconstructive procedures.  Once completed, this acquisition will established a major presence for Johnson &amp; Johnson in aesthetics medicine.</p>
          <p>We also acquired SurgRx, whose NCL products complement our HARMONIC technology and broaden the energy franchise in our Ethicon Endo-Surgery business.  And in Comprehensive Care, we acquired two companies, Immunicon and AMIC, for new diagnostic capabilities.</p>
          <p>Last year, I introduced the Office of Strategy and Growth as a new organization that would be looking at the whitespaces in healthcare for Johnson &amp; Johnson, places where we envision building new businesses.  We have defined the area of wellness and prevention as one of those opportunities and we have taken initial actions to establish this new business platform.</p>
          <p>In late 2008, we made two acquisitions to begin laying the groundwork for this new business.  HealthMedia is a provider of web-based behavioral interventions that emulate a health coaching session without the human intervention.  And the Human Performance Institute is developing science based training programs to improve employee engagement and productivity.  We expect this new business to contribute to the performance of workforces through products and services that are designed to keep employees healthy, engaged, and productive.</p>
          <p>Lastly, it is more important than ever that Johnson &amp; Johnson be an active participant in the dialogues that are taking place around the world to improve healthcare.  We are invited to participate in these discussions because of our well established reputation as a healthcare leader and the unique perspective we can provide based on the diverse set of businesses we manage.</p>
          <p>We've been willing to experiment and innovate in new ways to address the problems inherent in today's healthcare systems.  And we believe any discussion of healthcare policy reform must put the needs of the patients and consumers first.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our second priority, which is capitalizing on convergence.  This is an area where we can leverage the breadth and combination of our businesses for a unique competitive advantage.  We look at convergence in three ways: the combination of products and technologies, the development of patient-centric solutions, and the collective power and breadth of the Johnson &amp; Johnson enterprise.</p>
          <p>The most conventional view of convergence is in the combination of products and technologies across non-traditional boundaries, drugs delivered on a stent using a reservoir technology like NEVO; medication delivered on a contact lens to treat allergic symptoms in the eye; or SEDASYS and the Fibrin Pad, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>When we established our Comprehensive Care group last year, we talked about convergence in the form of patient-centric solutions that ignored product silos and looked at a patient's continuous cycle of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery.  We asked what were the needs we could serve or gaps in this cycle we can fill with our products, expertise, and knowledge of diseases and healthcare.  Let me give you just one example in this area.</p>
          <p>Last year we mentioned the role that Ortho Clinical Diagnostics is playing in convergence as it works with our other businesses on the use of companion diagnostics in areas like oncology, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease.  By identifying biomarkers in patients who will benefit most from cancer drug or by targeting early indications that occur before the first signs of heart failure, we are uniquely positioned to assist patients from the moment of diagnosis through monitoring and on to therapeutic intervention or treatment with our full range of products.</p>
          <p>Finally, we look at convergence in the way we leverage the power of our enterprise across business segments for unique insights and solutions.  Our launch of ZYRTEC was a powerful example of how we used experience and knowledge in both our Pharmaceuticals and Consumer businesses to help with the largest prescription to over-the-counter switch in our history.  It was cited in the Tan Sheet as a model for any OTC switch.  McNeil Consumer Healthcare worked with our Pharmaceutical business to educate and inform healthcare plans, pharmacy benefit managers, national retailers, and employers about the switch.  Thanks to these efforts, millions of consumers received ZYRTEC switch information from their healthcare plans while many more received similar communication from their employers.  This tremendous collaboration enabled ZYRTEC to achieve 26% market share since its launch in 2008.</p>
          <p>A decentralized management approach is fundamental to the success of our operating model.  Our operating companies and local management teams know their markets the best and they execute their business strategies with great autonomy.  But there are many common functions where standardization can benefit Johnson &amp; Johnson with greater efficiency, faster processes, better use of our talent, and more leverage to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We must increasingly use our scale as an advantage, and we are in the midst of efforts to build more standardized approaches in areas like finance, human resources, procurement, and information technology.  These are not changes that can be implemented overnight in a global enterprise like Johnson &amp; Johnson, but we have the resources committed to ensure we reap the benefits of the work we have already begun.</p>
          <p>Our third priority is accelerating growth in emerging markets.  Johnson &amp; Johnson has been a global company since the 1920s when we established our first international affiliate in Canada and first overseas affiliate in Great Britain.  We have continued since then to build businesses throughout the world.  Today, we have facilities in 57 countries and almost half our revenues come from outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets look to provide the most robust healthcare opportunities over the next decade, and we are preparing our businesses to capitalize on this growth.  We define high growth emerging markets on a business-by-business basis.  We typically include countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China, usually called the BRIC countries, along with other important growth areas such as Turkey and Mexico.</p>
          <p>While the current economic crisis might temper these markets' growth rates from the highs shown here, the opportunities remain significant.  Over the next five years, Russia, India, China, and Turkey are now projected to grow at the high single digit rates while more developed markets are seeming to grow even slower.  This growth and maturity of these markets will globally impact healthcare through the products and medicines being developed, where and how clinical trials are being carried out, and the way we run our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our business in the BRIC countries grew 19% operationally in 2008 and we continue to build our local capabilities and presence to strengthen these efforts. We are not newcomers to these countries.  We have a significant presence and well established roots.  For instance, we began operations in Brazil and India in the '30s and '40s and China and Russia in the '80s and '90s, and our commitment to these markets continues to grow.  I mentioned the Dabao Cosmetics acquisition in China earlier.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we opened the Emerging Markets Innovation Center in Shanghai to develop new and affordable products addressing the consumer needs of emerging markets.  One of the center's first successes was the launch of Johnson's Baby Long-Protecting cream in 2008, which addressed the dry skin that babies can experience in cold weather.  The team used local market research, natural ingredients, and a competitively priced 25-gram package to meet the need of China's emerging market.</p>
          <p>We also continue to invest in professional education in these and other markets to help teach physicians how to use our medical technology and to prepare markets for the introduction of new healthcare practices.  Our MD&amp;D businesses have more than 20 training centers outside the United States and are dedicated to just this type of work.  Our Vision Care business for example has been using this approach, establishing training centers in the US and around the world to train more than 30,000 practitioners and introduce them to the latest breakthroughs in contact lenses and eye care research.</p>
          <p>And finally, our most important priority is developing leadership and talent because none of our other strategies and priorities can succeed without the talented and dedicated people at Johnson &amp; Johnson.  When you look at our credo, our operating model, and our business priorities, people are the common thread.  It is because of them that I am confident in our ability to continue meeting our patients' and customers' needs while furthering our excellent track record and performance.</p>
          <p>With more than 250 operating companies around the world, we have the capability to develop leaders by exposing them to a wide variety of businesses with ever increasing responsibilities.  We look for people who can work in a decentralized environment, develop winning strategies, and execute the plans that lead to success across our business segments.  And we allow them to take prudent risks as they enhance their own judgment and business building capabilities.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, my confidence in our future stems from the talents of our people and their individual commitments to living our credo responsibilities in their daily work.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to reinforce for you our commitment to growth.  For us, this means competing in the most attractive spaces in healthcare.  It means building and sustaining leadership positions through our pipelines, people, and strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements.  And finally, it means growing our sales faster than the markets where we compete and growing our earnings faster than sales through a thoughtful, disciplined management approach.</p>
          <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered a strong track record of performance over time.  We have managed through difficult economic cycles in the past and we are confident that our people, our products, our pipelines, and our financial strength position us well for continued leadership and growth in healthcare.</p>
          <p>I'd like to thank you for your attention and now I would like to turn the podium over to Dominic for some additional comments and then we'll have Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone.  To wrap up our formal presentation, I would like to touch briefly on our results for 2008 and then provide some comments for you to consider as you refine your models for 2009.</p>
          <p>As Bill indicated, we are pleased with our solid financial results for 2008.  While we recognize there are challenging factors in today's economic environment such as currency volatility and uncertainties surrounding the depth and length of the current recession, we are positioned well for long-term profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Our sales results for 2008 reflected solid performances across many of our businesses.  As I am sure you are aware, we experienced significant volatility in currency exchange rates during the year.  In fact, currency positively impacted our sales results by 2.4% for the year but negatively impacted our sales results by 3.9% for the fourth quarter.  Similarly regarding EPS, changes in currency positively impacted our full-year EPS results by 1.9% but negatively impacted our fourth quarter EPS results by 3.4%.</p>
          <p>Our strong earnings performance demonstrated again our ability to continue managing costs and improving margins, all the while continuing to invest to advance our pipeline of new products or enter into in new markets through licensing and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now before we discuss 2009, I'd like to point out some items in our fourth quarter results.  Our adjusted earnings per share results in the fourth quarter exclude special items such as in-process research and development charges related to the acquisitions we made in the fourth quarter and several litigation matters.  The most significant of these litigation matters is related to the judgment in our favor of longstanding stent litigation with Medtronic, which was previously announced.  The receipt of the payment related to this litigation judgment of approximately $520 million was partially offset by amounts related to several other litigation matters.  This net impact has been reflected in other income and expense, but has been excluded from the adjusted earnings results.</p>
          <p>Additionally during the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale the Professional Wound Care business to One Equity Partners.  You will remember that during my discussion of our third quarter results, this transaction was not included in my guidance for 2008.  Since we view this transaction as in essence a decision to reshape our portfolio, we expected then that any gain from this divestiture would be used to make additional investments or other business decisions that would enhance our long-term growth.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we took these actions.  You will note that our other income and expense line item reflects net higher other income than my previous guidance, as it now includes the gain from this divestiture of approximately $500 million as well as some offsetting items of approximately half of that amount.  Additionally, you will note some higher level of selling, marketing, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter, which reflect the use of the remaining half of this gain to make the investments and other business decisions, as we had expected.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2009.  This guidance takes into consideration the addition of Omrix Biopharmaceuticals and other acquisitions made in 2008; the divestiture of the Professional Wound Care business, which was completed in 2008; as well as the pending acquisition of Mentor Corporation, which is expected to close later this month.  As previously disclosed, the Mentor acquisition is expected to be dilutive to 2009 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share.  This dilutive effect includes the transaction costs which are now expensed according to the new accounting guidelines related to business combinations.</p>
          <p>Let's start with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense.  During 2008, we continued to generate strong cash flows.  In fact, as Bill pointed out earlier, we generated free cash flow or cash flow after necessary capital expenditures of approximately $12.2 billion.  At the end of 2008, we had approximately $1 billion of net cash.  This consists of approximately $12.8 billion of cash and investments and $11.8 billion of debt.  This is an improvement of $1.2 billion in our overall net cash position from year-end 2007.</p>
          <p>Our financial position remains strong, and we continue to have good access to the credit markets for our financing needs at reasonable rates.  For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions and assuming the completion of the share repurchase program during the early part of 2009, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to other income and expense &#x2013; as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and asset sales or write-offs.  This account is difficult to forecast, but assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2009 as a net gain ranging from approximately $150 million to $250 million.</p>
          <p>And now, a word on taxes; for 2008, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was 22.9%.  We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2009 in the range of 24% to 25%.  This rate takes into consideration changes in the mix of our business for 2009 as well as the extension of the R&amp;D tax credit for 2009.  As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to sales and earnings; as I previously mentioned, we experienced significant volatility in terms of currency exchange rates especially late in the year, as you can see it from this chart.  It is very difficult to predict movements in currency exchange rates, especially given the current economic conditions and the resulting monetary policy changes that governments around the world are employing to address the situation.  Some of these actions have had an impact on interest rates and a resulting impact on the volatility of currency exchange rates.  And it appears that additional actions are likely to be taken that may continue to impact the volatility of exchange rates even further.</p>
          <p>Therefore, our guidance for 2009 will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations assuming that average currency rates for 2009 will be the same as they were for 2008.  This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of the business.  I will then provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2009 with the impact that current exchange rates could have, showing the euro as an example.  Of course, the actual impact is dependent on many currencies, but the euro represents about 50% of this impact.  I believe this will provide you with some helpful insight for your modeling purposes.</p>
          <p>Turning to sales, the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call indicates sales of $63.7 billion for 2009.  As we looked at the various models, it appears that not all the analysts have updated for currency fluctuations and some of those that have, have not fully reflected what the impact could be at current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Taken into consideration the loss of US patent exclusivity of both RISPERDAL Oral and TOPAMAX, which have about a 4 to 5% impact to our overall sales growth rate, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales change on a constant currency basis of between negative 1% and positive 1%.  This would result in sales for 2009 on a constant currency basis of between 63 billion and $64 billion.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for all of 2009 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 4% or approximately $2.4 billion.  Thus under this scenario, we would then expect reported sales to decline to a range between 3% and negative 5%, for a total expected level of reported sales of between 61 billion and $62 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to earnings, when I last checked, the First Call mean estimate for our EPS for full-year 2009 was $4.61 per share, which excludes the dilutive impact of the Mentor acquisition.  It appears that many of the analyst models include a 2009 tax rate that is lower than the guidance I just provided.  And as I noted earlier, it does not appear that all the models have been updated to reflect the potential impact of currency at current rates.  I suggest you consider full-year 2009 EPS estimates excluding the impact of special items of between $4.60 and $4.70 per share on an operational basis; that is assuming the same average exchange rates for 2009 as we saw in 2008.   This represents an operational growth rate of 1 to 3%.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for all of 2009 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our EPS growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 3% or approximately $0.15 per share.  Thus under this scenario, we would then expect total reported EPS excluding special items of between $4.45 and $4.55 per share.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2009, we will provide you with the operational growth rates for our actual sales and EPS results in order to give you the visibility to the underlying performance of the business, and we will also provide the impact of currency on our actual results.</p>
          <p>As you refine your models for 2009, I want to remind you to consider the impact to our results from the loss of US patent exclusivity of RISPERDAL Oral at the end of June 2008, and the loss of US patent exclusivity of TOPAMAX at the end of March 2009.  These events will obviously have significant impacts to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons.</p>
          <p>As you work through the guidance I provided a few minutes ago, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an improvement in pre-tax operating margins for 2009.  While operating margins may vary by business segment year to year and may be impacted from time to time by short-term dilutive impact of acquisitions, improving the overall pre-tax operating margin by growing income faster than sales over time is a fundamental discipline we use in managing our business.</p>
          <p>In closing, I'd like to offer these final thoughts.  Johnson &amp; Johnson is a company that is financially strong and we continue to be committed to growth, as Bill has pointed out.  I am very proud of the financial performance we delivered in 2008, and I look forward to updating you on our progress for 2009 throughout the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Larry Biegelsen, Wachovia; two for Bill and two for Dominic.  Bill, on the Pharma side, many of your competitors have reevaluated their strategy in this difficult environment by focusing for example on specialty markets or certain therapeutic categories.  Could you articulate J&amp;J's strategy in the Pharmaceutical business please?  And second is services, that other area that you're targeting, the pace that we saw in 2008 in terms of two small acquisitions, is that what we can expect going forward or something more accelerated?  And just quickly for Dominic, do you see 2009 as a one-time event in terms of EPS growth?  In other words, do you expect to return to historical EPS growth rates in 2010?  I'll just stop; I'll leave it there, three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me see the others. The first one is really the strategy around our Pharm business.  Yes, we have historically been very focused on the specialty markets; so when you look at the impacts, we have much less of the impact.  But we have, like everyone else, really assessed our sales force, different ways of going to market.  But we have identified the specific therapeutic areas where we continue to focus on, continue to develop our products where we think there is high potential, whether it's here in the United States or around the world.  So I would say that we've modified our strategy but haven't really changed it other than some of the ways we go to market with sales organizations and new ways of looking at promoting our products that we think make us more efficient.</p>
          <p>But as far as the specialty area, it has been an area that we've historically been focused on and will continue to be focus on and we think it gives us a lot of leverage and a lot of strength.  The second question was really around acquisitions, I think?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wellness and prevention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Here you don't participate and today &#x2013; this year and last year, you showed us that pie chart.  You had two small acquisitions, and I'm just wondering if that's the pace that we can expect going forward, in terms of penetrating that segment.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me comment on the wellness and prevention area and what has really driven us into that, because I think with the new administration, and truly to focus on obesity around the world and diabetes and the problems that are there that more and more people are getting focused on, taking care of their own health.  And I think the administrations are starting to look at how do we reimburse and treat these people and keep people healthy, which is really the answer to the long-term, I think, healthcare costs that we have to deal with.</p>
          <p>So, we took last year really in trying to look across the landscape, we looked at Health Information Technology, for example. But we zeroed in on prevention and wellness and the two acquisitions we have coupled with the experiences we've had over the last two decades at Johnson &amp; Johnson.  And we think there is a very strong business model looking at that in that today, we pay about $400 less per employee for our healthcare cost than the normal company would pay.  And the reason for that is for two decades now, we had 4% tobacco users at J&amp;J, where a normal population has about 20%.  We have a focus on obesity and weight loss.  We have a focus on cholesterol, hypertension and the areas that really many of the co-morbidities associated with obesity and keeping people healthy and well.  We think that will also drive to engagement; absenteeism, we know.  We've documented it in our own programs.</p>
          <p>So by looking at the behavior modification technology that HealthMedia has, coupled with the health for The Human Performance Institute, which looks at nutrition, exercise, recovery, and the critical pieces, putting it together with the facts we have, we think we have a very strong model to go to governments and other businesses with to improve the health of their employees.  So I don't know if &#x2013; I wouldn't expect that you'd see us going into large acquisitions, trying to move things forward, but build from the base that we have in wellness and prevention as we continue to assess other opportunities.  Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, I think your question was really related to the level of EPS growth in our guidance for 2009 versus what could happen in 2010 or how that might change. Just a couple of things.  I think 2009 is a year that's very well understood by everyone.  We know the business pressures we are facing in 2009, and in fact that's now coupled with some economic pressures that we are beginning to see as well.  I would say that we've been able to manage through that very well both in 2008, where you saw increase in operating margins, pre-tax operating margins, and my guidance indicates an increase again in 2009.  And pre-tax operating margins obviously impacts our EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Now moving into 2010, I think a few things will change. One is that our comparisons obviously will be a little bit easier when the business pressures are a little bit further behind us.  But more importantly than that, we have a great deal of confidence in our new platforms for growth, our products, our pipeline, and our leadership in terms of their ability to manage through these difficult times, while at the same time preparing ourselves for continued growth in the future.  And when we look at managing our business, although it's very difficult to manage to pre-tax operating margin increases in difficult times like 2008 and 2009, we did that and I guess that's the way we manage our business.  And I'd see that we would continue doing that going forward.  So I can't give you a specific outlook for 2010, but we're confident with our products, we are confident with our ability to manage our business appropriately.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, two questions.  First of all, I was wondering with a lot of your competitors talking about going down the path of biosimilars or biobetters as some of them like to call it, if you would have a similar interest given your capabilities and expertise in that area, and how you might see that changing the landscape of your participation in biologics in general?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Dominic, you mentioned that we should expect operating margin improvement in '09.  Clearly that's at the same time that you are undergoing a significant amount of cash cow loss, if you will, from particularly in the Pharmaceutical business and the Med Device business.  Could you give us a little bit more color around that?  As I look at your gross margins for instance in the quarter, there may have been some currency noise and so forth, but it's surprisingly higher than we would have expected.  SG&amp;A, you still are pretty robust, and to me it seems like you have an opportunity to contract there, just react to some of those comments.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll speak about biosimilars.  We continue to assess, whether it's generics, biosimilars, or anything else, we'll continue to assess it.  We don't see it as a real opportunity at the moment, and part of that is because with biosimilars, you're probably going to still have to show because of the size of the molecule and everything else, the way it forms, the way it shapes, the way it fits into the receptor.  There's going to have to be clinical trials, so it's going to require significant investment.  Our belief is we need to keep focused on creating new opportunities in the marketplace, driving them forward through the products that we can.  But as far as getting into the biosimilar area, we don't see any opportunity for us at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Catherine, with respect to improving operating margins in '09, you're right.  The '08 fourth quarter, in particular, COGS number, had some one-time items as did the fourth quarter of '07.  As Louise pointed out, those items in '08 were essentially offset by some other items and other income.  But that level is not the level we would expect going into 2009.  We would expect gross margin to be under pressure in 2009 as compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Now offsetting that, we do have these various programs in place, which Bill has talked about and I've talked about in the past, which is our standardization efforts.  We also have the general notion that our business leaders run the business in an appropriate way considering economic times.  And so we would expect that our &#x2013; both our SG&amp;A and R&amp;D cost as a percent of sales would be lower in '09 versus '08, which in fact are the major drivers, then, of the pre-tax operating margin improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can just add one thing to that.  Dominic has talked about the standardization initiatives and we've been investing in these over time.  And I think we're starting to implement now and we're going to start to see the benefits of these through 2009 and beyond, because it has really been the investment phase we've been going through and will continue to go through.  I think we're getting to the point where starting to execute it really implements some of these programs that are going to start to yield some of the benefits as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.  Dominic, let me start with you with just a couple of financial clarifications.  One, do you have the &#x2013; do you already have the plan in place to achieve operating margin expansion in 2009 in the face of the fundamental pressures you will have?  Is everything already in place to make that happen?  Two, the tax rate guidance for 2009, the tax rate moving up in '09, is that a function of declining sales from pharmaceutical products manufactured out of Puerto Rico?  Is that what's driving that?</p>
          <p>And then turning to Bill, the company is in great position financially.  '09 is going to be a tough year, but financially you're in a great position.  You've managed the company for the long term.  Shall we be thinking about 2009 as well as we model, as we start to think about impact of events in 2009?  Should we assume that J&amp;J is likely to be an acquirer over the course of 2009, taking advantage of your financial strength when a lot of companies are relatively weak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, let me touch on the first two, Mike.  Yes, the plans are in place for 2009 operating performance that would improve pre-tax operating margins over 2008.  Just as a reminder, we started on this path back in 2007 where we conducted the restructuring of the Pharmaceutical business and the Cordis business.  So this is &#x2013; again, 2009 was not a surprise for us.  We knew about this for some time, put the plans in place.  Now as Bill said, we're executing on a number of those plans.  We're very happy we're able to achieve the higher end of our cost improvement guidance that we provided earlier.  And we have of course the higher level of the PCH integration synergies happening in 2009.  So those plans are in place, we feel comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>The tax rate increase from year over year is primarily due to the fact with lower pharmaceutical sales revenues, especially products like RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX, we lose some tax benefit there that we have enjoyed over the last couple of years.  So that's the primary driver of that change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mike, I think the answer to the second question is that we're always looking for the right opportunities and we think that the pressures on the economy right now are going to create very unique opportunities for us.  So we have our list of candidates that we think would be good opportunities and other ones are going to be popping up and coming to us as the year progresses.  So we are very focused on the opportunities &#x2013; unique opportunities that will be presented to us based on the market conditions that we see today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David Roman, Morgan Stanley, a couple of questions.  First, one of the areas you highlighted on the slides where you're not currently participating is disease management.  Can you talk a little bit about the avenues you might use to enter that a little more, whether it's IT services or diagnostics?  And then on the guidance, there are clearly a lot of moving parts in 2009. Obviously, there is probably some contribution from new pharmaceutical products, some slowing you mentioned in elective procedure volumes.  Can you just maybe talk just a little bit more about the drivers of the 2 to 400 basis point deceleration in operational top line growth outside of the obvious, being TOPAMAX and RISPERDAL?  And then lastly on the buyback, that probably will be completed shortly.  What's in the assumption share count for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take the first one on disease management.  I think that disease management is kind of a bad word to be choosing these days because a lot of the programs that have been run have not been successful.  I think the way we're trying to look at it is basically looking at a patient and saying how do we deal with that patient, and taking the resources that J&amp;J has and putting them against it.  When we look at the management of the patient, we're talking about the area of diabetes, for example, and metabolic disease.</p>
          <p>And part of it goes to what we were talking about before, this wellness and prevention. If you look at obesity here in the United States or around the world, it's one of the biggest drivers of problems.  And if you extrapolate that out to the co-morbidities associated with obesity, if we can get obesity under control and that may be through surgical intervention, which could be bypass or gastric band, REALIZE Gastric Band.  It could be through some of the behavior modification programs and diet and exercise.  And those areas &#x2013; those are the things that we're thinking about in that area.</p>
          <p>As far as diabetes specifically, we have the Animas pump now, and we have obviously the glucose strips.  But we also have the &#x2013; if you look at SPLENDA, we look at surgical intervention.  We look at the behavior modification programs.  So we're actually looking at how do we approach the patient in a way that offers them the comprehensive treatment and bringing that out to further looking at biomarkers and earlier indicators through our Ortho Clinical Diagnostics programs.  It will allow for a treatment of an individual and the management of an individual throughout the whole continuum of care as opposed to just trying to put a piece together here.  So we think that it's not really disease management, it's really patient management and the behavior that we can influence and affect through our products or resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to answer the question on sales guidance, and I think, David, you're referring to the operational sales guidance excluding the impact of currency, just a couple of things.  As you know, both RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX together impact our growth rate 4 to 5% year over year.  So in addition to that, just a couple of factors that we considered; one is that we've seen some impact in several franchises that are impacted by consumer behaviors; for example in our Consumer business or in businesses where consumer discretionary spending is a major factor such as diabetes test strips or in Vision Care with contact lenses.  So we have seen some impact there that we have taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>We've also seen some greater pricing pressures, especially in countries outside the U.S., as countries tend to look for ways to balance their budgets or improve their budgets by reducing the price &#x2013; or the cost of healthcare.  And also in Medical Devices and Diagnostics, we have mentioned before we have seen some impact already in elective procedures or procedures where there are some higher out-of-pocket expenditures.  And then finally in the Pharmaceuticals business, I think the way to best characterize it is until we see the FDA approvals come forward for some of the products that are awaiting FDA approval, we generally are fairly conservative in the way we model those new products.  And we think that's a prudent way for us to manage the business going into the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add two more comments to that, that I think are really important.  Dominic talked about the elective surgery and some of the disposable income that patient and individuals may have &#x2013; that consumers have.  But I think you also have to look at the Pharmaceutical business where we are seeing a slowing down in the rate of growth.  If you go back earlier in the year where people were saying prescriptions were actually declining, but we think that has reversed itself and there is a, let's say a 1 to 2% growth, I think IMS is forecasting for the coming year, so there's a slowdown there.</p>
          <p>But I think the one element that we all have to &#x2013; and we talk around it, but it's this whole economic environment.  And if you just take unemployment here in the United States, I don't know what the numbers are going to be, but we know they're going to get greater.  We know there's going to be an impact, and we know that many of the people that will become unemployed are people that have insurance today.  So those people are going to stop going to the doctor.  They're going to stop getting the prescriptions filled.  They're going to stop having elective surgery.  There's going to be downward pressure on all of these areas.</p>
          <p>So I think the economic conditions that we're dealing with today are going to create downward pressure in lots of areas in healthcare, but in other areas also.  And I think we have to be realistic about the impact that that can have on the whole healthcare market here in the United States.  But I think it's also &#x2013; you can take it to Venezuela or to Russia when you look at the price of oil.  We have an economic decline around the world that is going to affect the total healthcare expenditures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, finally on the buyback question, we assume that we'll complete the $2 billion left of the $10 billion share buyback in the early part of 2009, so our share count estimates reflect that and they do not reflect any assumption of any additional buyback in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Bob Hopkins, Banc of America, Merrill Lynch.  Two questions, I'll keep it simple; one for Dominic, one for Bill.  Dominic, on the consumer side, I know you don't give line item guidance.  But I'm just curious from a 50,000-foot perspective, do you expect that business to be a growth business in 2009?</p>
          <p>And then for Bill, you talked a lot about policy in Washington DC and I think it's a critically important topic.  And so I'm curious, a two-part question, one specifically for 2009.  What major changes do you anticipate happening, if any?  And then beyond 2009, what emphasis on any major changes that you as CEO of J&amp;J are anticipating beyond 2009 to the way healthcare policy is formed in this country?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly on the Consumer business, again we don't give guidance by sector.  But generally speaking, we still look at our Consumer business as a growth business.  Just a reminder that in 2008, obviously we had the fantastic launch of ZYRTEC in our '08 results, so that will be a tougher comparison for the Consumer business in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you look at policy in Washington, we've used the term access and affordability for a long time.  I think that the administration is talking about coverage and cost.  And they really mean the same thing.  We do believe that we have to look at how do people gain more access at more affordable prices and there are lots of different ways to look at.  And I think we'll wait and see what the administration has to do here.  And we'll work closely with them and try and support and work in ways that is going to allow patients to get better healthcare.  I think the critical thing right now though is addressing the economic situation that we have. I think that's going to be first and foremost.</p>
          <p>So when you look at 2009, there are lots of things that could be done to have short-term impacts.  I mean you can look at negotiating the pricing.  You can look at all of these things that can have some short term.  There will be some changes and some effects in those areas.  But I think as you look out further, I think we're all going to have to get together and really look at how do we get better healthcare?</p>
          <p>The one area that I think is a unique opportunity for J&amp;J today, and I keep going back to this, is the whole area of dealing with &#x2013; I was at a group in Washington where they asked a group of us to get together and look at some of the challenges, whether it's the economy, trade, energy, or healthcare and the single largest issue that has to be dealt with is obesity.  When you start looking at prevention and wellness and dealing with obesity, if we don't get childhood obesity under control, if we don't start dealing with this, they say today one out of three children born today will have diabetes.  The healthcare costs of today will be nothing compared to what they're going to be.  So I think there will be a real focus on this area of prevention and keeping people healthy rather than letting them get sick and treating them.  So I think there will be focus on that.</p>
          <p>But I think first and foremost, the administration is going to have to address the economic conditions.  And I think that will have a positive impact.  But I do believe it's going to &#x2013; whether you want to call it coverage and cost, if you want to call it access and affordability.  And then I think you have to also look at the whole area of health and prevention.</p>

          <p>Thank you; Rick Wise, Leerink Swann, a couple of questions.  First, Bill, you highlighted the customer inventory draw-downs.  Do you think there is a lot further to go?</p>
          <p>And maybe, Dominic, you could quantify the impact, if you can, on the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Rick, I think that most of the &#x2013; whether they'd be hospitals or major companies like Wal-Mart or others, I think they've all been very tightly looking at their inventories, as we've looked at ours.  And I think it's just prudent today in the environment we're in to try to get your inventories down and manage our capital.  So we're doing that and everyone else is.  I think that the draw-down has taken place significantly, but I think it's hard to tell if there is more to come, and there may be ways of doing business that may change, but I think there has been a significant draw-down in many areas of inventories.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I can't quantify it for the fourth quarter.  We do expect it to continue throughout 2009.  Really the impact that we saw in the fourth quarter other than currency was really the impact of not shipping some REMICADE at the end of the year due to our scheduling &#x2013; production scheduling and maintenance schedule, which of course is not a significant impact; similar thing in the quarter, but not a sign of anything other than the timing of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good.  Let me come with the strategic issue on the cash use a little differently.  I mean, clearly you have the cash.  Maybe Bill, your and the Board's priorities, I mean is it continuing the share buyback?  Is it making acquisitions?  And maybe one last quick one, a little unfair; do you think Pharma growth will be positive in 2010?  I'm not looking for a precise forecast, but is that your...</p>

          <p>Although you never know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...but keep asking it.  No, I mean the priorities for us have never changed, they're simple.  I mean our first priority is making sure we have the money to pay our dividends, right, so that's 40% of what we have available.  But when you start to look at what we then want to do with the money, it's invest in the business.  So if we had an opportunity to make an acquisition or to do something that would be really positive for the business, that would take precedence for us even over completing the share buyback.  So our intent is to ensure that we continue to look at opportunities that are going to bring strategic value to the business in growing.</p>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; and I was mentioning this earlier to a couple of people. I think the opportunities this year are going to be extraordinary, and I think it is a matter of sitting on what we have, making sure we understand where our priorities are, and what opportunities may be there.  And if they present themselves, then we'll be in a great position to move on them.  But absolutely, I think that we will &#x2013; this economic environment creates opportunities that we may never see again.  So we need to be positioned to capitalize on them if they present themselves.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Matt?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Matt Dodds, Citigroup; Bill, a couple for you.  First, when you look at the R&amp;D, even though you have spent less I think in Pharma this year, you're still spending more than the average.  I'm just wondering as you moved through '08, how are you thinking about the cost/benefit of those dollars.  First in the US, how much harder is it going to be to get a return and then does the worldwide potential offset that, so just how you're viewing that?  And then second on SEDASYS, you highlight that a lot.  Is that a capital spend product and is the potential for that lower now given the environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay.  As far as the R&amp;D goes, probably two &#x2013; I want to say two or three years ago, we actually increased our percent of sales up into the 20-plus percent range.  The industry is around 16 &#x2013; 15.  We did that because we had such a what we really believe and still believe is such a rich pipeline.  So as products started to mature, we made early investments six, seven years ago in early stage discovery and early products, and they came to fruition.  And of course the cost of bringing a product to market is much greater.  We've moved our lot of our clinical trials outside of the country, so we're getting a lot bigger bang for the buck today than we've ever gotten before.</p>
          <p>But it's really &#x2013; we are starting to see a leveling off now because we think we are going to get to a steady state, which will be pretty much the same as an industry norm in the ability to invest in the products.  And it is not that we don't have confidence in our pipeline going forward and don't need the investment.  It's that we've been able to really be more efficient in the way we manage our clinical trials and the way we manage our go-to-market.  So yes, we'll see a leveling off of the expenses.  We will see it more normalizing I guess what the industry norms would be.  But the increase I think as we said for the last few years has really been because of the strength of the late-stage development era pipeline.</p>
          <p>You talked about the returns in the US.  Our feeling and belief and we hope this strongly is that we will get a strong person in charge of the FDA.  We do hope that science will progress and be able to make scientific decisions for approval of products.  It puts more pressure on the industry to do better research and to make sure we're doing really good research that's going to pass the scrutiny of this.  But we think that's an advantage to us.  We think it's an advantage to the industry to have a really strong regulatory body.  And then we will reap the benefits of the products that we have coming.</p>
          <p>But I think there's going to be a lot more pressure on both pricing as well as the cost of bringing our products to market.  And I think we'll see more and more reviews and discussions about additional work that may be required.  But I think that the benefit of innovation in bringing better products to market will more than offset the incremental cost, if there are any that we're going to have to deal with both here in the US.  And then I think as you mentioned, the emerging markets in some of these areas, we're making significant investments in healthcare in their countries.  And we think that we're able to not only bring the products we have, but modifications and the innovation center we have in China for example to bring better products there.  So, you'll see a leveling off but we'll continue to promote &#x2013; to work in that area.</p>
          <p>As far as SEDASYS, yes; there is some capital equipment in that area, but it's not: a) it's not huge capital equipment cost.  And b), I think we have some unique ways of helping to move that to the consumer that will allow them to pay that we're not going to be a bank, but to buy these things over time or usage upon the product that will pay for itself in a short period of time.  So we're looking at unique ways to help offset some of the costs for the consumer or the doctor.</p>

          <p>With respect to everybody's time, we'll ask for two more questions.  Glenn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Glenn Novarro with RBC; another question on M&amp;A and for Bill, particularly on the pharma side.  It dovetails a little bit with your comment you just made.  In the past, you've talked about a challenging FDA and a challenging regulatory body.  And if you look over the last couple of years, your deals have been more outside the pharma side, on consumer and in devices, and I'm just wondering.  I is the reason why we haven't seen something on the pharma side in recent years, is it because the company has made a strategic decision to diversify away from pharma, or is it more because the price wasn't right or the culture of the company that you may have been looking at didn't fit?  I'm just curious why we haven't seen more on the pharma side on the M&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Glenn, I think it's a bit of all of the above.  I mean if you look at &#x2013; first of all if you look at the balance, we were becoming way out of balance in the pharma area.  And the PCH acquisition really helped to balance our portfolio in that way.</p>
          <p>But I think that the regulatory bodies in many parts of the world, especially here in the US, have been struggling.  And they've been struggling to make decisions to approve products.  And I think with some of the adverse events they had, they became risk averse.  So I think it was very hard to &#x2013; and it continues to be difficult getting products approved.  But the strategy that we have is if we have &#x2013; whether it's in Pharm, Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Consumer, or anyplace else, if it's the right acquisition or the right license that will afford us the opportunity to advance the long term and create shareholder value, we're going to do it.  So we haven't shied away from it.  We've just seen, the prices have been very high.  If you look at &#x2013; you have to look at where are the products in their life cycle and where is the pipeline, and do you gain access to something that's going to bring real value vis-&#xE0;-vis what you already have in your investments.</p>
          <p>Again, if you buy something &#x2013; there are going to be lots of biotech companies.  Everyone talks about biotech companies that are going to come up, right.  The cost of the biotech company isn't the important thing.  It's the cost of the investment to bring the product to market and is it going to bring value that's going to be important.  So we have to look at the total investment and make sure that whether it's Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Diagnostics, or Consumer that we're making the right investment that's going to bring the benefit to our shareholders.  And we haven't shied away from it.  We just recognized that there were challenges that maybe made it more difficult, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bruce Nudell from UBS; a couple of questions for Dominic.  Structurally, a decent chunk of your cash is ex-US.  Does that create relative advantages for acquisition versus share buyback?  And I just wanted to clarify with regards to REMICADE, the scale of the I guess destocking.  And from what I've thought, I just heard it was more internal timing as to manufacture rather than credit issues or share issues in the marketplace.  So I just want to clarify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  With respect to our capital structure of ex-US versus in-US cash, I would say generally speaking, Bruce, we're comfortable with the level of cash we have.  And obviously, we're also very comfortable today given our strong financial position on our access to credit markets at reasonable rates.  So the cash location or dislocation isn't that much of a factor for us because of our ability to access capital when we need at very reasonable rates.</p>
          <p>The REMICADE issue was in the several hundred million dollar range of sales due to scheduling issues in the production plant, due to the maintenance in the plant was simply deferred due to the timing of completing those events, and it had nothing to do with any credit issues or any other issues with respect to the product.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could make just a closing comment.  I'd like to first of all thank you all for coming today.  I know it's a very important day for a lot of reasons.  But we do appreciate your interest and your support of J&amp;J.</p>
          <p>I also want to say in parting that I was asked a question earlier and that is about the morale of the people at J&amp;J because a lot of things are going on around the world.  And I want to tell you that the people at J&amp;J look at this year as an extraordinary opportunity, and an opportunity that if we stay true to what we believe and stay true to our plans and stay focused on our business that we can come out of 2009 in a much stronger way than we've ever gone into it, and we have gone into it in a very strong way.  So I just want to let you all know that the people at J&amp;J are very committed, and that's what makes me feel so optimistic about the year.</p>
          <p>So once again thanks very much and we'll see you later.</p>
