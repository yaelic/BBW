      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody; happy to be with you in interesting times. I am going to give you the general picture and as usual, Denis is going to go into more details.</p>
          <p>First, to start with, what are the big lessons from this first half? I think there are very interesting ones as far as our business model is concerned and you will see that in a tough environment, the business model is resisting very well, and the company is in good shape even if in some numbers you can notice that the environment has been a tough one.</p>
          <p>So, what do we see? The first very important point is that, we are seeing positive net inflows in all business lines: in Life and Savings, in Asset Management and in Property/Casualty. With an increased retention in Life and Savings, clients are probably more cautious and this is reflected by lower APEs but they are also more cautious because they are staying with us rather than going elsewhere and low APEs stable with better retention is leading to pretty stable cash flows. So this creates a situation where revenues are stable. They are not growing as much as we would hope in normal times, but they are stable and the fact that we have positive net inflows is, of course, important.</p>
          <p>Second point, important, underlying earnings are growing by 7%, 5% on a per share basis, which is in line with what we said in February, and which is showing that despite market conditions, which have very substantially deteriorated since the beginning of the year, even if they seem to have stabilized in recent weeks, more or less. The business is resisting very well, and I think this is an illustration of the, I would say payback, we are starting to get on the initiatives we have taken along the Ambition 2012 lines. There is some volatility in the adjusted earnings and in the net income due to the mark-to-market of assets, but you will see that we are not overly worried by that.</p>
          <p>The next point is, I think, an important one for some of you. We know that some people were doubtful about what we were saying about our solvency. I think it's absolutely clear today that we are proving wrong the people who thought that our solvency was an issue. I mean, it's always slightly disappointing for Denis and myself because you remember that between 2001 and 2003 we were among the very few players who didn't do any rights issue despite the skepticism which was going around.</p>
          <p>We have built a very strong and a very efficient risk management. I think this also very visible in today's numbers and this explains the fact that the solvency is a very strong one; strong, according to Solvency I, stronger according to Solvency II. We have for a number of years anticipated what would come out from Solvency II. You will see that there we have absolutely no worries, and I would add something, which is something new and different from the situation between 2001 and 2003. We are in a situation where we start from a very strong solvency, but the solvency's speeded by various strong operating earnings.</p>
          <p>The operating earnings are four times what they were in 2000, so which makes us pretty relaxed on that point. I would add that the hedging of the equity portfolio has, of course, been substantially helpful and is an illustration for you of the fact that when we say that we are actively managing the balance sheet, we are really actively managing the balance sheet, and I think it's an important part of the business today.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, how do we see the future? Well, if market conditions do not deteriorate further, we really think that underlying earnings for the full year should be in line around what they were in 2007. The markets are lower than where they were February, but we think we can deliver underlying earnings inline with where they were in 2007. And our intention is to propose a dividend which for &#x2013; I mean, it's slightly unusual to say that at this stage, but we see that as a sign of confidence. We intend to propose a stable dividend for the year, for the year at 1.20 euros, which makes the yield on the stock quite attractive. So this is the general framework.</p>
          <p>Now, if you go a little more into the details, where is the activity, where are the margins? Activities I've already started to mention, that Life &amp; Savings' APEs are down 6%. We are going to go into the detail geographically from this evolution. Getting growth in Life &amp; Savings is tougher because the clients are, say, more scared about the markets on one hand, on the other hand we are seeing more competition from banking deposits, especially in Europe. The banks are so eager to find liquidity anywhere at any price that they are offering conditions which are attractive when compared to what they were offering a year ago, and for people who don't want to take long term decisions too quickly it's here that. I mean, it's enough for which compares to what we are offering at least for the short term, attractively. We are resisting to that but it makes goals more difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p>On the Property/Casualty side, the business is growing, a little less than last year but not much less. The business remains a very positive one and a very profitable one and there, I would like to insist on the fact that we've been saying now for years that Property/Casualty was less cyclical than before. I think this is another illustration of that, and the combined ratio, as you see on this page, is improving significantly. Denis will come back to the details. I'll always know that there are people who are thinking that we are extracting bonus from the reserves which are not sustainable. It's not our view. I think we are very strongly reserved, we think the business is very profitable.</p>
          <p>Assets management; revenues, which were up in the first half are slightly down in the second half. Where does it come from? You will understand that very easily. Despite positive inflows, which are of course lower than what they were the year before; but despite positive inflows, the average asset base is because of the decline in the markets have decreased. We are extracting less commissions. It's explaining the reasons for which revenues are slightly down. We are not worried about the competitiveness of the asset management businesses. We just think it's a reflection of a tougher environment.</p>
          <p>Positive net inflows, I've already mentioned them. Profitability levels, we are not buying growth because the profitability levels have stayed high. It's true for the new business value; it's true for the combined ratio, it's on the asset management for the cost income, so we think it's a sound situation. If we look at the underlying earnings and try to understand where does the growth come from? It's clear that the growth is mainly coming from the Property/Casualty business. Life earnings are stable, asset management earnings are up 9%.</p>
          <p>Most of the positive contribution is coming from the Property/Casualty business. I think this is good news. You have to take into account also the fact that, once more, the foreign exchange is going against us. We have approximately 50% of our earnings in dollars. Despite the hedges we are taking year-to-year, it's clear that the evolution has not been a favorable one so far and that this is decreasing the growth rate of the underlying earnings. So today, what's going to go in the other direction, we will of course see the reverse. One of the reasons for the increase of the earnings in Property/Casualty is, of course, the fact that some of the natural catastrophes we had seen last year have not been repeating themselves this year.</p>
          <p>If you move to adjusted earnings, and this works probably for some of your surprise, adjusted earnings are stable when compared with last year; resulting something different from what you had seen in previous cycles where equity markets were decreasing sharply. Where does it come from, how does it compare to last year?</p>
          <p>Last year, we had extracted a little more than 700 million, 760 million of capital gains in the first half with very, very low, very little impairments. This year, we've been extracting 800 million capital gains in the first half. Given the view we had, we thought it was cautious to extract capital gains, but we also have had to take a little less than 800 million of impairments on the equity portfolio; and this, so far, was what had happened between 2001 and 2003. But, what is different is the fact that this time we had taken hedges against a decline on the equity markets, which are creating positive earnings.</p>
          <p>So, the risk management of the group, the way we built the risk management of the group, is now enabling us to be much more proactive and these hedges have had a positive contribution of nearly 500 million on the adjusted earnings. There is, you will see later on the fixed income, the time value of this options which is so far, because it's going to disappear when they will expire, which is a negative one and which is affecting the net income for 150 million, a little more, but on the adjusted earnings, there was a positive impact of nearly 500 million which leads to a situation where, net-net, the contribution is 500 million for the semester. Underlying EPS, I have mentioned that, up 5% on a per share basis, adjusted EPS down 2%, so stable.</p>
          <p>If I now go, I'll say region-by-region or business-by-business through the various businesses, interestingly, you will see that six out of the seven big regions or businesses have underlying earnings, which are up; and most of the time double-digit or very close to double-digits.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the French business. Underlying earnings are up 16%, it's a good performance both in life and property/casualty. In life, on personal lines &#x2013; sorry, on individual business, it's up approximately 10 to 11% in a market which was down. The group business is slower but will become better in the second half of the year, we know that. On property/casualty, the business remains a very good business with the 3% growth in revenues, and the combined ratio is at record levels. So, the business is working well, even if on the life and savings side the competition is tough. The fact that we've put in place a new organization with more P&amp;Ls for the teams is, I think, in the middle term also going to be helpful.</p>
          <p>Northern Europe, it's a region where usually you see low growth, because of Switzerland, Belgium and Germany which are pretty major markets. And there I would say two things. We are seeing a very acceptable performance in terms of growth in these major markets, with very good profitability and we are seeing one of the positives of the Winterthur addition in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Central and Eastern European in operations are showing, on the life side, a growth in the APEs by nearly 50%. Another positive element is, I think, the growth in the life business in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>When we bought Winterthur, some of you were telling us that the Swiss market was nearly hopeless, because it was hopeless to grow the businesses. Well, when you look at the life business in Switzerland, I think we are starting to see the fruits of the efforts, which have been done by Philippe Egger and his team. The business is growing.</p>
          <p>U.S., it's the region where the underlying earnings are down when compared to where they were last year. But if you start with the revenues, the revenues are interesting to look at. The world market is down, APEs are down, but we are gaining market share, which means that the competitiveness of our products remains a very, very solid one. We have very strong inflows because redemptions are going down, and the fact that our distribution is a diverse one is helping us resist probably better than others, because the proprietary channels are resisting quite well. The negative evolution of the profitability comes from the evolution of the technical margin in the U.S., which is due to the underperformance of certain separate account funds, during the turmoil. These funds have underperformed the indices against which we are hedging the guarantees, and Denis will come into more details about that. We think it's an interesting lesson to learn from this period, to improve the hedging going further. We do not think it changes anything to the real competitiveness of the products.</p>
          <p>Mediterranean region, this region is once more proving the fact that, both in terms of profitability and in terms of growth, it's a good place to be. On the Property/Casualty side, 7% growth in revenues, so it's nearly three times the average of the group. It's coming from markets like Turkey. Spain is probably decelerating a bit because of the environment in Spain, but it remains a solid situation. The combined ratio is a very solid one and the Winterthur integration there is going very, very smoothly. On one of the significant pieces which has been added last year, or this year, to the Mediterranean region, which is the deal we've done in Italy with Monte dei Paschi, it's interesting to look at the evolution. The bancassurance market in Italy is serially down. We are gaining market share with a mix, which is a better mix. On an absolute basis, we would like to see higher sales, but the market is down. We are doing well because we are doing what we were intending to do which is to change the business mix and have more unit-linked products with better margins. So, we think at this stage this is satisfactory.</p>
          <p>U.K. and Ireland, improvement in underlying earnings mainly coming from the fact that we have not seen the natural events we had been seeing last year in the first half. So, the Property/Casualty is improving. We think also that, I would say, there are fundamental elements which are now in place on the Life and Savings side which are positioning us well for the future. Of course, on the Life side, the APEs and the NBV have been impacted by the change in legislation on investment bonds, but we have progressed on the platforms, we have progressed on the wrap, and the fact that we've put in place Architas, which is a sub-advisory platform is going, we think, to help us going forward. And this is also one of the nice additions of the Winterthur operation. Winterthur had a quite interesting business in discount, repositioning us well on the high end of the IFS. On top of that, of course, we still have the cost reduction program going on in this country, which should bear fruit.</p>
          <p>Asia, decent underlying earnings growth, with a business which is more or less stable or slightly declining in volumes in Japan, but with still very high margins. India, the business is, of course, at this stage very small numbers, but growing very fast; and there we think we have the right partner and it's going to be very interesting going forward. In China, we are seeing some acceleration, I don't know if this acceleration is Olympics related or not, in the process of getting licenses so, probably going to accelerate the business down the road. More important, we have some interesting agreements which are now in place and bearing fruit with Citigroup in Hong Kong to sell viable energies products. And in Australia the wealth management strategy is also working quite well.</p>
          <p>Asset management, I already mentioned that underlying earnings are up 9%, essentially due to the improvement of the performance of AXA Investment Managers and within AXA Investment Managers is a real estate segment, AXA Re, which has done particularly well in the first half. AllianceBernstein has, I would say, seen slightly negative inflows for the first half. AXA Investment Managers has seen positive inflows.</p>
          <p>On the strategic side, we are very interested by the agreement we have now with Kyobo in Korea, where we are setting up an asset management joint venture which is going to start with 10 billion of assets under management. We think it's a positive development for the Asian asset management business. So, overall, in a time where, I would say, times are certainly tough for asset managers, the way &#x2013; the fact that we still have positive inflows, and the fact that the operating earnings are resisting quite well in both firms is, I think, boding well for the future.</p>
          <p>So, overall, before I give the floor to Denis, what does this show? I think it shows the resilience of the AXA model, both on the operations side and on the balance sheet side, and I think this positions us quite well for what's going to happen. We don't know if the markets are going to get better or worse in the next months, and at the end of the day I don't think it's what we should mostly focus on. I think we should focus on continuing to increase the profitability of our existing businesses, and we should focus on continuing to manage the balance sheet as tightly as we have managed it in the recent past.</p>
          <p>We are very well positioned to benefit from any upturn in the environment. These times are very interesting, because clients are, I would say, available; teams are available. It's interesting to see that there is a real flight to quality. We are seeing business partners who are coming to us because they want to get with AXA and not with anybody else. And through some of the recent hires we've been doing, we clearly see that offering very &#x2013; we have very strong teams, but you should always reinforce your teams and these times are great for us offering job to great people outside. We've just made appointments in Asia, which show that AXA is seen by the people who are performing well in this business as a very attractive place to be. It's a great way to expand your business without stretching your balance sheet. Denis, I leave you the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all here. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to go through the IFRS earnings for the first half in more detail; and first, I am on slide 20, start with the Life and Savings new business on a volume basis and value basis. You see that the volumes declined 6%, and the value of new business also declined 6%, which means that we've maintained our margin during the periods, in spite of a slight decline in the proportion of unit-linked from 52% to 48%. This stable margin comes from a positive impact of business mix, largely due to Japan, where we've continued to expand our medical business and through the Northern Europe region where we've continued to be successful with our TwinStar, i.e., variable annuity product in Germany, partially offset by France where the proportion of unit-linked has declined sharply on the individual business.</p>
          <p>We have a slight negative impact on the country mix as a result of slightly lower contributions from high margin countries, notably Japan. Just an additional comment on the U.S., where you see a decline of 14% of the volume and 15% of the new business value. This decline in volume is made up of minus 6% in Variable Annuities where we've clearly continued to outperform the market, strengthening our number one position; and a sharp decline in Universal Life of 46% decline in Universal Life, new business, which was intended because you will recall that last year in the first half we were a subject of adverse selection in our Universal Life business with people over 70 years of age. We've re-priced the product in July 2007, and as a result we have lower new business there, which was what we intended to have.</p>
          <p>Looking at the reserves portfolios on the unit-linked business, first our reserves went from &#x20AC;183 billion to 161 billion. We had a 4 billion net positive inflow, but a 16 billion negative from market appreciation and 9 billion negative from foreign exchange. In spite of that, our unit-linked managements fees went up 8%, even though the reserves went down 7%. Because of an improved margin, our margin on reserves was 125 basis points, again 117 basis points in the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>On the General Accounts reserves, you see also that we have positive inflows, 2 billion positive inflows, much bigger movements both inflows and outflows. This is unusual. We had stable flows in the previous periods; you see that people are more conservative now. We had a slight market appreciation, because it's essentially a portfolio which is backed by bonds. We have a negative 3 billion ForEx of very stable reserves there, and also a fairly stable, slightly increasing investment margin from 83 basis points to 87 basis points, which as a result, leads to a 4% increase in our General Account investment margin.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Life P&amp;L, the margin that is produced for each period, our gross margins were negative 2%, our expenses and taxes were negative 1%, so I've commented on the investment margin in the previous slide, I've commented the fees and revenues on one of the previous slides as well with loading some premiums up 2% and unit-linked fees up 8%. The one area which I need to comment now is the technical margin, which was down 34%. The technical margin was negatively impacted by a negative impact from the GMDB/IB results in the U.S.; after DAC, after tax, it's 64 million negative, but the impact on the technical margin is a bigger number. This was mostly due to underperformance of certain separate account funds against indices used in the delta hedging.</p>
          <p>So, this doesn't &#x2013; puts in question the quality of the hedging that we have, but what we had was a negative performance of the underlying funds and its &#x2013; I mean it's clearly a sign of alert for us, because we had been little bit complacent on this in the past periods from 2003 to 2007. We had positive experience on that, and so we didn't care too much about the fact that our hedging was not perfect on certain marginal asset classes, and we had good performance of the underlying funds. Now we need to look at that much more cautiously, and we'll move for some of the funds from the Allocation funds where we have complete control over the asset allocation to more index plus formula than to single managed funds inside the Allocation funds going forward.</p>
          <p>On Property/Casualty, we had profitable growth in the first half. Revenues went up 2.3%; this is a combination of flat revenues in Northern Europe and the U.K.; good growth of 3% in France where we continue to expand in commercial lines, in SMEs and a very strong growth in the Med region with a 6.5%; and the rest of the world, which is essentially Korea and Japan, our direct businesses, a growth of 8.4%. Combined ratios were good across the board. You see the improvement in combined ratios that are the strongest in the areas which had been impacted by the floods in the U.K. and the storms in Northern Europe last year, but a good situation overall there.</p>
          <p>More details on the combined ratio, you see that our expense ratio is essentially flat, so the improvement comes from the loss ratio. You see the significant impact of the non-recurrence of natural catastrophes represents 2.6 points of combined ratio. We have a slight deterioration of the current accident year. We have a good number on the positive development on past years, slightly higher than last year, but not significantly. And to make you comfortable about our reserving ratio, our reserves to premiums ratio, which we said would have to stabilize at some point, continues to increase this year from 194 to 198%, which means that we are &#x2013; we remain very conservative in our reserving practices, and in our current accident year we also reserved conservatively.</p>
          <p>Looking at the detail of the P&amp;C earnings, they are driven by improved technical results, as I mentioned earlier, but also on the investment side, our reserves continue to increase, our asset yield grows by 10 basis points, which means that our net investment income increases by 6%. We have increasing taxes as our margins increase and that translates into a 20% growth in our P&amp;C underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Moving to Asset Management, our fees on Asset Management have stayed stable at 37 basis points. Our assets have declined in spite of slight positive net inflows of two billion, six billion of AXA IM, negative four, AllianceBernstein. We have a negative impact of market depreciation of &#x20AC;73 billion, negative impact of ForEx of 44.</p>
          <p>The revenues, excluding distribution fees are stable, in line with the average AUM. Obviously, we will have in the second half, lower average AUM than in the first half, except if, as if market values rebound quite sharply. On the earnings side for Asset Management, saw revenues down 2.7%. Underlying cost to income ratio down 0.8 points, helped by lower compensation and distribution expenses, obviously, but also a positive guidance for us at AXA Real Estate Investment Managers, as a result of the maturity of significant real estate funds. Underlying earnings growth of 9%, which is quite extraordinary given the revenue decline, but it's also the combination of this carried interest and the positive non-recurring tax item in the same area of real estate at AXA IM.</p>
          <p>Quickly going through the other segments, International Insurance up 44%; it's essentially positive run-off developments in AXA Liabilities Managers, partly offset by a decline in profitability at AXA Corporate Solutions coming from the impact of a big impact of the Chinese Earthquake on one of our clients. On the bank side, positive development as well; negative on the holdings because of an increased in the interest charge on the debt.</p>
          <p>All in all, you see that our underlying earnings growth of 7% on a comparable basis is just a factor of our business diversification, which we've emphasized in past periods and proves to be apparent in these numbers as we had expected.</p>
          <p>I now need to turn to the explanation of movement from underlying earnings to adjusted earnings. I don't think I need to go back to that because Henri did that in this presentation, but I want to spend a little more time on the move from adjusted earnings to net income because even though adjusted earnings held pretty much stable, minus 1%, our net income was down 29% and this is a reflection of a number of moves that I am going to detail now.</p>
          <p>First, changing the fair value of mutual funds and other assets that are classed in available for sale, sales through the P&amp;L. This is both the ABS portfolio and &#x2013; I mean a portion of the ABS portfolio, but about 20 billion of fixed income assets, which are in that category of available for sale through the P&amp;L where we had an increase in spreads and this increase in spreads led to a negative mark-to-market. So ABS is &#x20AC;237 million negative, other assets, other fixed income assets, is &#x20AC;500 million. You see a minus 152, which comes from the time value of the options on the equity portfolio. This time value would trend down to zero, if markets held at the current level to the maturity of the hedges, but there is a negative time value, as expected, as of now.</p>
          <p>On the price derivatives and others, a negative 162; this is offset on the balance sheet by the fact that &#x2013; you have a negative on the derivative, we have a positive on the underlying assets, or liabilities. So, it's not an economic movement, but it's a purely P&amp;L movements, centering on the interest rate derivatives of 87 million. So, all in all this leads to a decline of 29% of our net income. This does not take into account in any way, the fact that if you look at our debts, the mark-to-market of our debts would be a 1 billion positive, which under IFRS is not reflected in the net income and not reflected in the balance sheet. So I think it's just an indication for you from a value standpoint that we have also this 1 billion that is ignored by the accounts; 1 billion present year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement, nothing spectacular to report in this period. We have 2.8 billion of cash flows from operating activities in the first half. We have 3.3 billion of uses of these cash flows, because we paid the dividend in the first half. We had 1.1 billion of acquisitions minus 200 million of divestitures, which means that we have increased our debt by 600 million to finance that during the period.</p>
          <p>Shareholder equity roll-forwards, our shareholder equity moved down by 5 billion. The bulk of this move comes from variation in unrealized capital gains and foreign exchange. On the unrealized capital gains side, this negative movement of 4.3 billion is explained at the top of the slide. We have still at the end of the first half a positive 2.6 billion unrealized capital gains. You see that we have a stable real estate unrealized capital gains, which is not taken into account in the shareholders' equity, and we have unrealized capital gain on equities, which moved from 5.2 billion to 2.8 billion. We still have unrealized capital gains on equities in our portfolio, and we have negative unrealized capital gain position on the fixed income assets of 2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I want to turn to a third part of this presentation, which we call checking the macro economic radar screen, because we want to tell you that all the black clouds that are hanging &#x2013; that have been hanging over our stock should dissipate, because we are managing our balance sheet carefully. So, we will cover in this presentation all the items that are on this slide, slide 35, I will not comment it and I will go directly into the various sections.</p>
          <p>Equity gearing, our General Account exposure, our net equity &#x2013; I mean our equities in our General Accounts were 28 billion at the end of June, coming from 37 billion a year earlier. We've sold some equities, but the market has also gone down significantly. Of those 28 billion, 26 billion are hedged now, 12 billion have been hedged at the local level and we've started hedging at the local level, in fact, in June 2007 in France and Germany on our Life participating portfolios, and we've taken 14 billion of macro hedges at the AXA SA level, the parent company, during the last few months.</p>
          <p>We have 9 billion which are hedges over a 21-month period and 5 billion, which are hedges over a 12-month periods, which are protecting us against declines of 15 to 20%. To finance that, we've sold call options with strikes price between 113% and 125% of the current market price, and we will manage that, those hedging positions, dynamically are going forward depending on the direction of the stock markets.</p>
          <p>Looking at the impact of further declines of the equity markets, we've taken 10% and 20% as examples. 10% decline of the equity markets would translate to a negative 0.5 billion on equity for 10%, 1.1 billion on the equity in the case of decline of 20%, P&amp;L impact of 200 million and 300 million respectively. That means that we are fairly immunized against further equity market drops. The immunization is not perfect because of the tax impacts, because of the per shareholder participation impacts, but the immunization, I would say, is quite complete.</p>
          <p>The second aspect of the equity gearing of the balance sheet &#x2013; rather of the P&amp;L of AXA, is on the Life and Savings unit-linked business and the asset management. On the unit-linked, we have &#x20AC;160 billion of portfolio, two-thirds of that are equities. A decline of 10% of the equity market equates to &#x20AC;100 million net impact on the earnings. Asset management of the &#x20AC;1 trillion of assets that we manage in our asset managers, 48% of our equities, a decline of 10% equates also to roughly &#x20AC;100 million, net of tax. So, a 10% drop in equities means clearly less than 5% impact on the earnings of the group.</p>
          <p>Asset portfolio, we are confident that we have a high quality asset portfolio, well diversified. I have already mentioned the decline in our equity portfolio from 10 to 8% of our asset base. We have a stable 5% exposure to real estate, which we believe is quite safe, mainly invested in France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium and we don't anticipate any decline in the asset values. On the fixed income portfolio, which I will comment further in more detail, we have an average rating of A+. We have on our asset based securities portfolio negative impact of &#x20AC;1.6 billion during the periods, which translate into 600 million after tax, after policyholder participation that can be direct activity, which is going through the P&amp;L for half of it and through OCI for half of it, so an impact which is quite comparable with &#x2013; to the ones we had in the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>On the fixed income portfolio, we have &#x2013; we are managing duration and convexity quite tightly. We have clearly to apply the accounting rules and we have 2% of level three assets in our evaluations. What's remarkable is that we suffered from very few credit events in the period. Even though we have to mark down our fixed income portfolio, we only had 54 million of impairments in our fixed income portfolio in the periods. We have our asset based securities portfolio, which is now at 80% of par against 89% at the end of December.</p>
          <p>We have very little exposure to the Fannie Maes, Freddie Macs of the world. It's only &#x20AC;1.4 billion of pass through securities in our U.S. General Account portfolio and it's been declining steadily because those assets are not bad for diversification, but quite bad for duration and convexity matching. Our monoline exposure is &#x2013; remains minimal and it's essentially in the U.K. with profit funds.</p>
          <p>We have used credit swaps as an &#x2013; credit default swaps as an alternative to corporate bonds, not as speculative instruments, and you see on the right hand side of this slide, the sensitivity is going forward of our balance sheet to interest rates &#x2013; balance sheet and earnings of &#x2013; changes in interest rates, credit spreads and asset based securities evaluations.</p>
          <p>The next item which people talk about is the risk of impairment of deferred acquisition costs assets. We are not worried about this, to say very quickly. So, 10% decline of equity markets would have no impact, 20% decline would mean an impairment of the order of 100 million after tax in the U.S., a 30% decline would mean about &#x20AC;200 million in the U.S., again no impact on the U.K. portfolio. So, very limited sensitivity of DAC assets at this current stage to further equity market deterioration.</p>
          <p>Inflation is another concern because people talk about recession, they also talk about inflation. So, on the Life and Savings side, for us inflation, the inflation risk is not something new. We have &#x2013; we are managing our General Account portfolio with constant maturity swaps, saps, swap options, that have been put in place on the rolling basis for a large number of years already. So, those instruments protect us against both much lower interest rates or much higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side the new thing is that we have been looking at our long-term P&amp;C portfolio and decided that it would be worth spending a little bit of money to protect ourselves against future inflation and with more protection against inflation rates above 4% for the next 15 years. The protection is smaller in the early years and bigger in the later years, but we have good protection against inflation over the next 15 years. And we have done that at the time when inflation worries were not that strong in the markets and we believe that our timing was not too bad.</p>
          <p>USVA risk management, I already covered that but maybe I need to go through these slides. We have a diversified VA product offering with GMDB, IB and WBL which we continue to update on a regular basis. We have a new version of our VA launched each year. We have certain limits on the fund options and more than 50% of our new business now is in Allocation funds which give us the flexibility to react quickly. We have a GMIB 10-year annuitization with waiting periods. We have increased the hedges within product features because people cannot elect GMIB and GB at the same time, and we have a dynamic delta hedging. But, we are managing a big portfolio. We have &#x2013; our VA portfolio is now &#x20AC;37 billion and we have some impacts of market movements.</p>
          <p>Equity market volatility was a negative 10 million in the first half because we are pricing the products at the 95th percentile of relativity, and during the first half the volatility was higher than the 95th percentile, so that's a negative 10 million. We do not expect this to last forever. If it was to last forever, we would change the pricing.</p>
          <p>Interest rate movements, we had lower interest rates in the first half. Those interest rates movements led to a 12 million negative. We are adjusting the hedging on the interest rates going forwards and we are sensitive to a low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>The rest &#x2013; but essentially the rest is basis risk was 42 million negative. Our action is to adjust the asset side of the portfolio which means that on the Allocation funds we will move, as I said, to index plus. In the product that we will launch in October, the 2008 accumulator, we will restrict some investment choices which we didn't do in the past so people could be invested in emerging markets without limitation. Now they we will have a restriction on the investment in the asset classes that are either impossible to hedge or difficult to hedge. So, I think it's something that we needed to correct. We have been hit in the first half and that will not happen again. We will correct that during the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange, nothing new here; we have a strong diversification of our portfolios, but a high proportion of our net asset values is in non-euro than the latest currencies, and 50% of our earnings, as Henri said before, are non-euros, principally dollar but also yen, sterling and swiss franc.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet side, which is the bottom left part of the slide, we have hedged a significant portion of our net assets so that's a 10% appreciation of the euro translates into a 3% impact on the net assets. On the P&amp;L we are not educated about the direction of currencies which means that our hedging is through options and we, because of the time value of options, we cannot hedge forwards more than, I would say, 12 months in advance the translation risk on our earnings, which means that last year we were hedged at a $1 of &#x2013; I mean, $1.33 for the euro. This year we are hedged at 1.4750, that means 200 million negative impact. We have, the good news is we have hedging, but we cannot fully anticipate the deterioration. Next year, we wouldn't be able to match the 1.4750, we would be probably hedging at 1.50 or 1.52, something like that. So this &#x2013; we are managing that dynamically but we cannot completely defy gravity there.</p>
          <p>Debt gearing and liquidity, interest coverage remains very strong at 12.7 times. Gearing was fairly stable at 31%. We have, as you know, very strong cash flows in our business. We have a conservative financing strategy, more than 50% of our debts is perpetual, no significant maturity before 2010. We have backup resources with 6 billion of undrawn committed credit lines without covenants and we have liquidity contingency plans through the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p>Solvency I, our Solvency ratio held up impressively well during the during in the period, clearly much better than a number of analysts were anticipating, at 148% and this is a combination of good earnings growth, capital management as usual, and mark-to-market impacts. With the equity hedging that we've put in place, we keep a little bit of sensitivity, but it's limited. You see that even with 20 market &#x2013; equity market is down 20%, our Solvency would only decline by 9 points. This is because &#x2013; I mean, there is still a decline because when you do hedging you pay tax on the hedging but the unrealized capital gains on the equities, or capital loss on the equities, is not taxed. So, you cannot, so you would have to over hedge to mitigate the tax impact, which I'm not sure it would be a sensible thing to do.</p>
          <p>Rating agency of Solvency II, AA financial strength confirmed by S&amp;P at the end of June, together with excellence enterprises management, which is something we are proud to keep; Fitch AA and Moody's AA3, both with stable outlook. We have done, as probably most of the larger European companies, the Quantitative Impact Study Number 4, which was organized by the European Commission and CEIOPS, the college of European supervisors. At the end of December, we were at 170% of minimum in QIS4; at the end of June, a simulation gives us 175. Why 175? Two reasons essentially: first, Solvency II is more sophisticated and takes into account asset liability reactivity. So, that's one point, but also Solvency II takes into account equities, and as we have hedged our equity portfolio we have a lower capital charge on equities at the end of June than we had at the end of December. This is pretty much in line with our internal capital models. Solvency II provides a better economic framework, and there is a shock-absorbing mechanism with the policyholder benefits in taxes that I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>I would now hand over to Henri De Castries, and I would thank you for all your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. I don't think I have much to add, and I just come back to what I said at the beginning. I think these numbers are showing the resilience of the model. Well, if I had to sum up things in a very, very brief way, what I would say is tough environment, robust numbers, solid confidence point.</p>
          <p>What I suggest is that we now take the questions. You should, just could put more light in the room so that we can see, yeah. Is it Nick? Yeah, it's Nick. Nick and his neighbor.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes at Lehman. A couple of questions sort of on broader issues. First one, looking at your equity gearing, you've done an absolutely fantastic job hedging it, but do you think that the level of equities that you currently have is appropriate or do you think it's still &#x2013; I mean, your hedging, I know, gives a very cast iron position, but we've all been put through some uncertainty in the last few months. And I wonder if that pain is really worth it for you in the longer term. That's the first question. Second question is on Solvency II. You've got a very good level of cover here, 175%, although we don't know, of course, what it is for the rest of the industry. I wondered if you could give us some sort of indication as to whether that is the level that you would like to see going forward, or whether you think that in fact there is a lower level that would be more appropriate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two great questions, Nick. The first one is the subject of permanent discussions within &#x2013; I will let Denis answer, because I think he's going to sum up quite well what we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the equity exposure, you need to look at it in two buckets: the life portfolio and the P&amp;C portfolio. On the life side, I believe that we need to continue to hold some equities against our life participating portfolio, small amounts, but I believe that from a diversification standpoint, it's good to have that; and I believe that the rationale is to have the hedging done inside the funds, because it's &#x2013; I think we shouldn't give a free option to the policyholder, a free put option to the policyholders, and the policyholders can afford to pay that protection within the funds. And that I think it makes sense to have some equities there.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, I believe that with Solvency II coming around, we can't be stupid. We need to listen to what the rules are going to be, and we will have to, over time, reduce our equity allocation. I believe that equities do form a diversification, do give us a diversification benefit. But the natural allocation in the Solvency II framework for equities would be closer to 5% than it is close to 15% where we had it in AXA. The reason we've done hedging rather than straight sale on that front, is because we believe that it would be &#x2013; it's not good for us to be photographed at the current level of markets, and we want to be able to regain some of the upside that we've lost in the last year. So, I think, directionally, we would trend towards a position closer to 5%. But we've done the hedging the way we've done it because we want to be able to benefit from the upside in the next period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is perfect, and what we could just add is if you look at what the portfolio was, we had a lot of Govies and some equities, and there is a weight in the middle. I mean, with spreads being better on corporate bonds, as part of the 2012 action plans, we had a plan to decrease Govies and increase corporates. So in terms of yield, I think this is going to make up for some of the potential upside loss.</p>
          <p>On the second question on Solvency II, I'll start, and you can finish. First, Solvency II is not approved yet. So we want to understand, know, prepare, what's going to happen, but there is still the uncertainty on is it going to be approved, is it not going to be approved, is it going to be exactly QIS4, is it going to be slightly different from QIS4? We don't know. We are prepared.</p>
          <p>It's clear that 170, 175 is a very solid and comfortable number. And the fact that we are at this level in this times is showing that we have no worries in terms of solvency. If you ask me could we go further down if times were going to get tougher, yes, of course. I think we are in a situation where we are very comfortable, and the key point, I mean the key situation we want to be in is a situation where the operations are giving very solid earnings, where the Solvency is appropriate, and where we do not need to go to the shareholders to do things which are just protecting the existing business rather than growing the business. And I think we are in that situation, and at 175 we have the solid margin. Once we will have lived with Solvency II for a couple of years, maybe we can decrease the bar. But so far I think we are very comfortable and very fine. Denis, what would you add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add a few things. I agree, obviously, with Henri's response. I think that one of the lessons of QIS4, as well as our internal models, which are, I would say, based on the short-term economic capital over a one-year horizon, and very close in concept from QIS4. What's striking is that because of the shock-absorbing mechanism that we've put in place in our balance sheet, we have a very low sensitivity of our Solvency II ratio to market movements. That's point one.</p>
          <p>Point two, what we show here is QIS4, which is a standard model, but we are not, what we are not showing you at this stage is the results of our internal capital model. We are not showing that to you, because we need to go through the process of validation with our supervisors, and we won't be able to share that until the model is validated, and it may take some time.</p>
          <p>Third point, we need to develop this dialog with the supervisors on our internal model. They have the possibility to ask for capital add-on based on the quality of our risk management, and this is a process we need to go through. And, the regulation will only be adopted, I mean will only be in force in 2011, so it's an evolutionary process.</p>
          <p>Last point to address more directly your question, Nick, I believe that the way we would look it is to say, okay we are at 175. We need to be able to withstand a market shock of this magnitude in terms of interest rate movements up or down, in terms of spreads, movements, up or down, in terms of equity market movements, up or down, in terms of major catastrophes, and that gives us the level where we are. I believe, intuitively, that we &#x2013; our minimum level should be more, something like 150, but unless &#x2013; until we've proven that with all our sensitivity testing, we won't tell you that for certainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe what we can say, Denis, that as far as the calibration, because that's your question, of the coverage ratio is concerned, this is done as you know, the QSI4 is done on a percentage of security factor of 99.5%. If you would move to 99.9, the threshold instead of being 100 would be 130, something like this, that gives you a flavor of the margin that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Exactly &#x2013; I was going to say that's such a clear answer, I can't think of any further questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Farooq from Morgan Stanley. Your critics would say that there's a miracle when the markets go up, but obviously you've sold some of the upside. Could just go through when that would kick in when, I mean you've given some information, but just explain a bit more clearly, sort of 13 to 25%. And also, you are quite dynamic coming in &#x2013; how dynamic can you be coming out, if necessary? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>I'll just quickly ask question number two, to give you time to think. Yes, I'm very kind that way. Looking at your technical margin in the U.S., I think the gross impact before DAC and taxes was quite big, &#x20AC;250 million or something. Could you explain exactly what funds or what part of the market, where this basis risk came from? Is this a one-off impact, and just a little bit more information about that going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if it's the hedging, it's quite simple. We've done &#x2013; we've bought a, put spreads to protect us against the downside, for the first 15 or 20% of downside, and we've sold, of course, at levels which are the ones that are indicated in the slide that I covered earlier, which is the slide 36, where, so it's 113% of the current level and 125% of the current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And do we intend to manage it dynamically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we obviously intend to manage that dynamically, which means that if markets were to fall significantly, we would probably buy back the upper leg, and we might decide to also buy some additional protection downward, and so, I think it's &#x2013; I mean, this is a picture we need to give for the accounts, but you don't expect us to stay idle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and again, just to be completely clear, the 113 is the 12 month, presumably, and the 125 is the 21 month, is that right? Or, okay. But on the downsides, you've obviously got limited protections to make the hedge cheaper. So, beyond 20, it becomes normal again. You've got protection for the first 20, which is timed by the effect but &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But which would mean that we would start at minus 20 with the solvency, which would be a very strong solvency when compared to the ones who would not have taken such a protection.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Nick, I think &#x2013; I'm sorry, Farooq. I think your the question was on the technical margin in the U.S., and particularly about the separate account performance. What happened in the first half of the year is underperformance of a series of funds, we have open architect with $50 plus billion of separate accounts, and the big impact was really in some of the funds that were value players, overweighted in financials, which way underperformed. I think everybody in the room can appreciate that. So that was one category of underperformance. Another was in emerging markets where some of our funds are invested in emerging markets, or a percent of the overall, and those generally underperformed as well versus related benchmark. Those are the two big categories.</p>
          <p>What we're doing going forward is to try to limit the investment opportunities for our clients into those categories and have better &#x2013; one, better diversification, and two, more funds that have performance orientated towards an index as opposed to, you might say, orientated indexes that we can't hedge well.</p>

We have, do have a bit of a concentration in certain funds. Those funds that underperformed, which have bigger concentrations, were the ones that were more impacted. But it was a series of asset managers, it wasn't any single asset manager, a series of asset managers that had this experience in the first half of the year. Should say over the life of the hedging business, we have made money on basis, or should say have had positive basis for most periods except for this six months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Blair Stewart from Merrill. I've got two questions on earnings. Firstly, on the underlying earnings, you've given a broad outlook of flat underlying earnings, and clearly the averaging effect of lower assets becomes more relevant in the second half of the year, which is implying that you're going to push your margins up. Just wonder how you can do that, can you provide some details there? And on the adjusted earnings, you've been able to keep some unrealized gains in equities, and I just wonder if you can help us forecast their adjusted earnings by giving us an indication of what you look to be harvesting on the assumption of normalized equity markets from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the &#x2013; I would say on the underlying earnings, it's true that we have the asset base factor for the life on the asset management business, but on the other hand, I think we can still hope that we will see positive cash flows for the second half of the year. Second point, we still expect to see from the Property/Casualty business further growth and further good results. So, that's what I would say on the underlying earnings. And if you look at the average asset basis, if you look at the sensitivities we have given, I think you will see that it's not unreasonable to think that we can be a, clearly around where we were last year. Because we've had also some negative things in the first half; we don't expect the basis risk to be at the same level in the second half. There are some elements here and there which should not be repeated.</p>
          <p>On the adjusted earnings, I'm not sure I want to give you too precise an indication, because I think by giving you an indication of the dividend level, I think it's enough. I think the very fundamental difference, Blair, with 2003 is the fact that we still have five billion of unrealized capital gains in real estate and equities, at the stage where equity markets, I would say, are not at their best. If you remember in 2003, at the bottom of the market, we did not have capital gains anymore. So, I think it's a much more comfortable situation. Then put your own assumption on what the harvesting rate is going to be, but if we state that our intention is to maintain the dividend at 120, and if we do not change our policy of distributing between 40 and 50% of the adjusted...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the 800 to 1 billion is going to be a difficult if markets where to stay where they are right now. We have 2.8 billion less on the equity side, that's before &#x2013; that's an after tax, so after tax number, but 2.8, if we harvest 8 billion, it means that we have 3.5 years left. So we would probably not meet that number if markets stay there, where they are, over the next five years. On the underlying earnings, to go back to Henri's question &#x2013; Henri's answer, it's really P&amp;C and international offsetting what's going to happen on the life and asset management side, and the non-recurrence, as he said, of the basis risk, negative of the first half to the same extent.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Marc Thiele, UBS. Given that the balance sheet came out stronger than we anticipated, can you talk about M&amp;A? I think you said earlier in the year that you have done the M&amp;A for the year, and you were indicating there's a bit of a concern regarding the crisis that we're in. How do you feel about M&amp;A at the moment? My second question is, coming back to these segregated funds in the U.S. Can you give us a bit more flavor of the vintage? When have these products been sold? How quickly can you change the pricing on them? And then, thirdly and finally, on variable annuity hedging, previously you have been talking about avoiding counterparty risk. Can you talk about hedging costs in general and how do you think you can hand that over to policyholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have a solid balance sheet, but it's not because we have a solid balance sheet that we want to throw money out of the window, jumping on the first opportunity, or whatever. What I keep telling to the teams is, in these times, the first thing to do is to approach clients from weaker balance sheets. The second thing is to approach teams, and the last thing, because it's the most expensive one, is to use the balance sheet to expand your business. The second point I would make is I think, many of the players around there in the financial services have seen the pain, but not yet borne the strategic conclusions. So, no hurry. We will probably see opportunities in the next two, three years. It's not a reason to jump on the first one. If you believe that in this city, because of the decline of the bonuses, a lot of fancy cars are going to be available for sale, you are not going to buy the first one available. Denis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the VAs, first you need to understand that we have two situations. We have the Allocation funds, which are entirely at our hands, subject to the agreements of the fund boards. And I believe that we've already received the agreement of the fund boards to change the content of the Allocation funds. So, this can be pretty much immediate the change of funds.</p>
          <p>And we have the single managed funds, where investors are invested, and we cannot change that at our discretion. So the simple answer is we can change very quickly the Allocation funds; it will take more time &#x2013; which will present about half of the assets under management &#x2013; and it will take more time to change the single managed funds. And we can change on new business, which we are going to do in October, with our new generation of VAs, where we will restrict quite considerably the proportion of assets that can be put in the exotic asset categories of emerging markets, real estate and so on.</p>
          <p>As far as the hedged costs are concerned, first counterparty risks &#x2013; we can continue to say that our counterparty risk very limited because most of the hedging is done with futures where there is no counterparty risk. And on the costs side, that's what I explained to you about the volatility. The cost is a direct function of the volatility. So when volatility exceeds the 95th percentile, we have a slight negative. But I think there is a limit to the length of time during which volatility exceeds the 95th percentile, or we are going to changed paradigm, we could change the pricing prospectively.

          <p>A couple of questions, this is Andrew Crean at Citi. Most of your M&amp;As have been recently focused in growth markets. Do you actually see prices coming down there, or likely to come down there, on the sort of two to three year view that you won't be buying first thing which comes along. And secondly, I wasn't quite sure as to why the fee margin had expanded on your unit-linked business and whether that was a sustainable feature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on M&amp;A pricing, it's probably too early to tell, but middle term, certainly, <mark type="inaudible" /> I think the &#x2013; I would say in the recent transactions, and we've lost some transactions. There are cases where we had put a bid &#x2013; we did not want to lose our discipline. We have not been the buyer, why so? Because the view we had of the price was lower than the view paid by the buyer, and the buyer probably had not taken into account in its own price the fact that valuations have been going down on listed companies. If you assume that listed companies are going to be buyers long-term, they cannot ignore the fact their share prices have declined. I don't see how they can keep paying the prices from yesterday for the assets of tomorrow. So, we'll see. That's why also, I mean I'm not particularly in a hurry.</p>
          <p>Having said that, long-term I'm optimistic about this sector because at the very difference of the some aspects of the banking sector I think there is nothing flawed in the business model of this sector. When you are in the asset gathering and risk taking business, why would you be pessimistic. The world is not going to enter into a deep recession for long. There's going to be slightly slower growth. We've been increasing our exposure to emerging countries, I mean in Russia, Mexico, Vietnam, India. So we have, I would say, pockets of future growth. And if anything I think the U.S. citizens are going to have to save more going forward than before. This is not bad news for us. I think the networks are in good shape, so I' m not optimistic about the business. I think in the intermediary period, some of the prices will have to adjust and I think it's one of the reasons not to be in a hurry.</p>
          <p>Look at some of the players, I'm not going to quote names, but who have said that they would sell some of their insurance assets because they were not strategic; not sure they are getting the prices they were expecting initially. So, it's one point to make the decision to sell the asset, it's another point to become realistic and to sell them at the future price while they're under, rather than to sell them at the price of yesterday.</p>

          <p>Duncan Russell from JPMorgan. First question, just interested in what you're saying about equity exposure in the P&amp;C business, taking it down from 15 to 5%. How will hedge inflation going forward, because I've always thought equities were a bit of an inflation hedge. And second, what does that imply about pricing and your target combined ratio, particularly for longer tail lines, and so if you could just talk about that a bit; and then secondly, and thanks very much for all the disclosure on the asset risk, and just a few more questions, because we're still going to have a lot of questions about it, could you give us the split between level 1 and level 2 assets, now and at the full year '07? And secondly, the corporate bond exposure, is that all plain vanilla corporate bonds? How much colored bonds do you have in there? A bit more information on your corporate bond exposure, please. And the monoline exposure, have you impacted that at all? And then finally, could you just talk a bit about the impairment policy; and we had a very low level of impairments currently. What would drive impairments and when will we &#x2013; when should we expect them to happen? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. I will take the first one and let Gerald answer level 1, level 2, corporate bond, covered bonds, and monoline, and I can take, or he can take impairment policy. So on the P&amp;C &#x2013; P&amp;C points. Yes, I believe that will reduce our equity exposure. Equities are a good protection against inflation, except at the beginning. In other words, when inflation starts up, it affects all asset classes, perhaps with the exception of real estate. So, the way we &#x2013; so, reducing equity exposure to 5% is not zero, and we have decided to protect our portfolio, our long-term portfolio, with two elements. One is bonds that are protected against inflation, and with inflation derivatives. So, that we thought that, and we continue to keep some real estate. So we thought that those three characteristics were slightly better hedges against inflation, and the fact the holding equities is so opportunitive in Solvency II convinced us that this was probably not sustainable in the long-term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the bond portfolio, we move from 172 to 176 billion of corporate bonds. We are investing in plain vanilla, single A, single A+ bonds so that means that what we are targeting and our present market conditions is to get right of, let's say, 150, 170 basis points above the risky right. So, that means that we are mixing some traditional corporate bonds and we are limiting as a percentage of fractals in this investment.</p>
          <p>To give more &#x2013; to be more precise, we have been investing this year something like, in the first half, 12 billion in corporate bonds, and normally we should have the capacity to invest in such corporate bonds, let's say between 20 and 30 billion a year. So, that means that we said that our objective was to target a single A+ portfolio. That's something that will be spread over time, but up to now, you know, at 150 basis points is an extremely attractive just to keep in your mind that the level of the fold, including the down rating, is only 8 basis points. So, that means that even if you assume something like a tripling of this level of the fold and down rating, we are still &#x2013; it's still a very attractive class of assets that it's not necessary for us to invest in other, more exotic products.</p>

          <p>And on page 59 you will see that the feature is almost the same at the end of last year, so that means that we don't &#x2013; we have almost no direct investments in monolines, so it's less than 20 million, ten plus nine; and the general account exposure to monolines investment with credit enhanced securities is pretty limited, because it's 361 million for non-participating and 78 for participating. Where we have the most important on a relative basis, more important investment in credit enhanced securities is in UK with profit at 641. So, it's absolutely limited in our balance sheet.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as impairment policy is concerned, we &#x2013; I think it's important to compare and contrast our impairment policy on equities and impairment policy on bonds. On equities, we have taken a fairly mechanistic approach which is minus 20% or six months. It's not minus 20% and six months, it's minus 20% or six months, so any security that is &#x2013; that has been down for more than six months is impaired. On the fixed income side, on the investment grade fixed income side, our policy is different and is consistent with IFRS. It's to say that we impair a security when its cash flow is impaired. So, if we have no credit events, no anticipation of a deterioration of the credit quality of the bonds, even if the value of the security is down significantly, we take this valuation adjustment through the OCI when it's in an available for sale, through OCI, portfolio. We take the hit directly to net income if it's in IFRS P&amp;L funds, but we do not impair unless we believe that the cash flow is impaired.</p>

          <p>Tony Silverman with Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. I would like to ask a couple of questions if I may. The first one was just on slide 21, when you were going through that, you mentioned, I think, verbally a number of 450 million as the time value of options remaining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the question &#x2013; that's the number in there, so the question then is what is the time value for shareholders of all the options that you currently hold? In other words, this is money you've paid and if values, for example, stay where they are, then that would all come back through and similarly to the minus 152 on this table. So, I was just wondering, if you like, what potentially is &#x2013; what you can say anyway, about what, potentially, is behind that 152, that might behave similarly going forward? It's not clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, it's a broad question. We have implicit options and guarantees in our Life portfolios, for example, that we give to the policyholders and those implicit options and guarantees are valued in our embedded value report, they are not valued in our IFRS earnings report. So, if you want to have an idea of the value of all our options and guarantees, you go back to our year-end '07 embedded value report and you have the answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking of the options and guarantees given to policyholders, I'm thinking of the options that you've bought yourselves to protect against equities, currencies and interest rates, and that have given rise to the three items for equities, currencies and interest rates on slide 31. So, I was just wondering what the total time value of those options is, because that's mainly &#x2013; I suppose you've paid for protection, obviously.</p>

          <p>I was wondering &#x2013; there will be a stock, if you like, at that number, perhaps I'll come back to it later, but there certainly will be a stock of time value if you like, this is just the time value that's eroded in the period. Sorry, I missed it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are concerns, you know. Since we started quite recently &#x2013; before, we didn't hedge, we had no margin on hedges of our equity portfolio, so that means that there is no stock, beyond on top of this 152 that we're presenting here. So that means that you should consider that it &#x2013; the total of the time value of option and guarantees, time value of these equity options, that is the dimension here.</p>

          <p>Okay. Kevin, do you want to take that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think what &#x2013; with our new products, we look at more &#x2013; a different approach to the product line up. We'll have some restrictions for what policyholders could invest in some of the more alternate type of investments. It's actually planned to be, I should say, beneficial to the policyholder because it would give them a broader diversification when they look at the overall product. Several of our competitors have approached products in the same way or are approaching the products in the same way, so we're not viewing that we're going to be the &#x2013; it's going to restrict us from a sales point of view or a competitive point of view.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think Kevin makes a great point here. Kevin makes a great point here, because I believe that our &#x2013; we generally have a duty to give sound advice to our customers. It's also the duty of the third party distributors that do that, so basically on half of our sales, or little less than half of our sales, it's our duty because it's proprietary sales; a little more than half it's the duty of the distributors to do that, and I believe that letting people invest 100% of their funds in emerging markets will not be a good advice. So, giving some &#x2013; I mean having some restrictions in the fund allocation is not, I believe, a bad thing to do; on the contrary.</p>

          <p>From Prudential, very high profile, successful in career. What's he going to do in your AXA Asia Pacific business, what are you going to put him in charge of, and what does it mean for the shape of that?</p>

          <p>Thanks. Mike will be taking the responsibilities that previously Mark Pearson had based in Hong Kong, part of the AXA Asia Pacific Holding Group, responsible for all the Asian Life businesses out of Hong Kong. Mark Pearson was promoted up to become the CEO of our Japanese business and is actually, I can say, in place physically; arrived in his new apartment in Tokyo this previous Sunday and is taking control of the Japanese business. So, I think we're in good shape, having found that both the opportunity for talent inside the group to be promoted and then to attract, I'd probably not use the word poach, we were actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality of candidates who were interested in this job in Hong Kong, and I think we'll be able to continue to strengthen management teams across the region as we grow those businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interestingly, I mean we've discussed a lot today about risk management. One day or the other we should share with us what we do in terms of talent management, because I think it's one of the key strengths of the group. I mean, the top team is spending more and more time on really human resources management to be sure that we have, let's say, all the appropriate people at the appropriate levels, but also the next generation which is giving more depths to the organization. And I think it's one of the areas where we have made the most significant progresses over the last five years. If there is no question, there is one question on the phone. Okay.</p>

          <p>There is a question on the phone from Mr. Stephan Kalb from Sal. Oppenheim. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. Kalb you have the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just have one question regarding the potential value change of the hedge value. In the P&amp;L account you have first 477 million and then the minus 152. If we would assume that equity markets stay where they are, what would we see in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the 152 going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other one would stay where it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to stay where they were on the 30th of June, I mean it should &#x2013; we have, I think, some sensitivity; at least we need some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that means that at the end of December, assuming that the market, for example, would drop by 10%, we would be at minus 290 million of time value and instead of &#x2013; so that means that on a relative basis, there would be a deterioration, a worsening, of the time value by 70 to 75 million. On the reverse, if you would have an improvement of 10% of the equity market, then the time value would move at the end of December to minus 11, so...</p>
