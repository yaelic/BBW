          <p>Good day and welcome to the third quarter report 2011 international telephone conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, welcome to this presentation. With me I  have Mr. Frederik Rystedt, our CFO; Mr. Ari Kaperi, our CRO and also Andreas Larsson, our Senior IR Officer. And also we will be joined at a later stage by Mr. Christian Clausen, President and Group CEO.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over first to Mr. Frederik Rystedt. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. I will start with some initial remarks on our financial results and then Ari will about the risk picture and credit situation and Christian will finally talk about the future and the strategy and the financial targets of the bank.</p>
          <p>So just to start the presentation, some key messages. We have a result which is down in the quarter, but the underlying customer business and the underlying result is in fact robust and it's a positive development. So we have customer-driven revenues. It's up from the second quarter, increases in the lending volumes both on the house and on the corporate side. Underlying costs are down by 3%, which is more than the usual quarterly development.</p>
          <p>However, having said that, we have had a fairly significant impact from the financial turmoil in the Q3 itself as to be expected. Of course, increased volatility, increased spreads play significant role, we have weak equity markets and of course also lower interest rates and that affected the holdings we have in the bank.</p>
          <p>We have also a specific issue, which was similar to that of 2009, where we have the accrual of the fee income we have to put to the reservation account in the Danish Life operation so thereby we have reversed the fee income that we have received from the Danish Life operation in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we feel we are well prepared to reach an ROE of 15%, so we have now replaced the three previous financial targets by just one target of reaching 15% ROE under normalized circumstances, we'll come back to that. And this is in line with our previous communication that we should be in the top league of the European bank. The way to do this is not through a change of strategy. On the contrary, we think our strategy, the relationship strategy is very adequate, we are merely focusing slightly more than we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>So these are the main points and let me thereby go to the next slide, four, and to show you the result in more figures. You can see from that table that net interest income is up both from a q-on-q basis, but also year-to-date, fees and commissions is significantly up on a year-to-date basis, but on the back of lower activity on the advisory business among the corporate and also of course lower asset under management fees and commissions is down in the quarter and where you see the main impact is of course on the fair value results, let me come back to that.</p>
          <p>Total expenses is up as I said in the quarter, but you can also see in the table that excluding the restructuring charge, we are down by 3%. So let me just touch up on the financial turmoil and how that has actually impacted us. You can see on slide five that there are a few areas where we have been impacted. And the first one relates to the challenging market conditions and this is our unallocated market results, which is significantly &#x20AC;150 million lower than what it was in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This is partly due to a fair value adjustment, which is automatic as a consequence of the interest rate decline when the position simply by default expand inside and the other one is an expansion of CDS spreads. So both of these things are sort of more or less automatic and has not had any impact on the &#x2013; or had any influence from the actual trading made.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that, that part of course will come back to the results if interest rates go back up. Of course also when the contract matures and that will actually &#x2013; will also come back.</p>
          <p>We have had an impact from the equity interest rate positions, a fairly significant part of that is actually equity, to be exact is approximately &#x20AC;58 million and out of that, a significant portion relates to Andorra as you have seen from the report. And the other part of the equity is minor equity positions that we have just revalued as a consequence of the decline of the stock market.</p>
          <p>And finally, the impact on lower Life fees, you can see on the bar chart of &#x20AC;52 million and that is basically we've had approximately &#x20AC;15 million per quarter, so in Q2, we had a positive of &#x20AC;50 million. Now we have reversed both Q1 and Q2 fees from the Danish holding and that has resulted in that swings in the different quarters. If you except or exclude all these factors that have been directly impacted by the turmoil, then as you can see, the underlying business is continuing to grow in a stable manner.</p>
          <p>So just going to the &#x2013; some quick comments on net interest income as I already alluded to, has been &#x2013; have been positive in the quarter. We have a modest increase in both lending volumes on the corporate and on the household side and mortgages. We can see that for both those classes, we have improved lending margins and generally, the profit margins are also improving. And the backside of the coin to the interest rate positions, we've had in treasury, we also have a positive contribution to the treasury in on the NII line.</p>
          <p>You can clearly see the impact of this on next slide. Slide eight where you can see that the volume has contributed on the lending side, with as you can see the &#x20AC;30 million, volume driven NII generally &#x20AC;50 million and the margin contributing with &#x20AC;25 million. Group corporate <mark type="ph" /> transfer (07:02) including treasury has had a positive contribution of 29 group functions, the rest of it, 916, thereby giving that difference in NII.</p>
          <p>I alluded to before that we have had a decline in the quarter about &#x2013; of the &#x2013; on the fees and commissions and the reason for that in the year of course, one of the reasons is the asset under management that has declined. This is not a result of outflows. In fact, the outflows have been very marginal during the quarter as you see from the report. Rather, it's a revaluation of the primarily the equity holdings, the equity bonds and that brings less performance fees and other related &#x2013; and other similar fees. So those are the main drivers.</p>
          <p>If we look at the items of fair value, I've already alluded to most of those issues, but as you can see, which is very important, on slide 10, the underlying customer business is continuing to generate good results, so this is not a matter of lower activity or lower margins on the customer trade flow that we have. In fact that has been performing well.</p>
          <p>This is just a result of the hedging activities underlying those customer activities, as I alluded to, and the negative valuation effects that we have in the market business. And the rest of it, as I alluded to, equity holdings primarily in treasury and the Life business. So that sums up the items at fair value.</p>
          <p>Cost is, of course, an important feature for us in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:43) which we'll come back to, but we have already started to execute on those plans. And if you exclude that restructuring charge, you can see that expenses are in fact down by 3%. We normally have a decline in the third quarter between 1%, 1.5% or in some cases even 2%, but this is clearly lower than 2%. So we had a good performance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We have set a restructuring charge, and if you look at the next page on page 12, you can see that the total amount is &#x20AC;171 million and this relates to reduction, primarily the reduction of the employees in the Nordic countries and of course, this is aimed at reaching the cost efficiency that we anticipate in the new Nordea plan. About 80% of that &#x20AC;171 million relates to those staff cost reduction and the rest mainly to premises that will be made redundant in combination with plant closures and other similar restructuring activities. So as I said, the main part is related to staff costs.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I'll leave over to you, Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Fredrik. So the asset quality, credit quality was strong, as you can see, from the size of lower loan losses on page 13. There were &#x20AC;112 million that is 14 basis points from lending if you include this Danish <mark type="ph" /> R&amp;D scheme (10:12) impact that's 16 basis points meaning that in this quarter we had a reversal from the deposit scheme, more than that we have to pay from the new, let's say, FX. There was some increase in Denmark, still in a very moderate level in shipping, which is a little bit higher than on the normal market circumstances. But in other portfolios, there was an improvement.</p>
          <p>And then you can see on the following page that the more exact split to various portfolios so that you can see that the level of losses in Sweden, Norway and Finland is very low, was in politics and politics in Poland, there was a some increase in terms of basis points, but in absolute terms the loan losses are very low, its only &#x20AC;6 million.</p>
          <p>Also in wholesale banking this 9 basis points includes also the shipping, which is part of the wholesale banking, so that if it just takes the large corporates out from wholesale banking, then we had even positive loan losses i.e., more reversals than loan losses.</p>
          <p>In shipping, we are still at the level of 70, 80 basis points. Actually now, in Q3, the loan loss in shipping came from practically from one old Nordic problem customer. But we started to be in the final steps in the workout case. But in other loan losses in shipping, were very moderate that's because we are still &#x2013; our strength in the shipping portfolio is very a diversified lending to various sub-segments. So for example, 25% of our shipping portfolio is oil and offshore segment, which is very solid even today.</p>
          <p>The diverse segment today in shipping is tank or specifically crude tankers, but our &#x2013; that's a lending to their crude tanker segment is representing only roughly 10% of our total loans in shipping. There was an increase in Denmark. The increase came from relatively low level in Q2. Some of that base level is still relatively moderate. The increase came from mostly from the household segment, so two-thirds of the loan loss is in the third quarter in Denmark was coming from this household segment. Still in the corporate segment in Denmark the situation is the same as in previous quarters. So, still there are SME customers in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:06) where we see some level of new loan losses, whereas the large corporate customers are still very strong.</p>
          <p>Following page, you see the positive rate in migration which is of course very promising now that the trade portfolio is in &#x2013; of good quality and still improving, that the positive rate in migration was 1% in terms of the impact of positive industry risk-weighted assets. And what is important is that this positive rate in migration was visible in all trade portfolios, actually also in Denmark and also in shipping, so that overall quality is still improving also in those portfolios. And you can see that there were more up ratings than down ratings.</p>
          <p>Following page 16, impaired loans and no big issues, relatively stable. In the bottom graph, you can see that our total allowances, i.e., total reserve for the loan loss is &#x2013; they were also quite stable. We are still coming down in our collective provisions because of this positive rating migration whereas individual loan loss is more or less at the same level.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, you can see that still we are growing on our lending book with moderate growth, but growth anyway, so that on the corporate side we are relatively stable, a little bit up, more or less in all the markets, whereas in mortgages, we still see some growth, 2% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Then moving to our capital position on page 18, you can see that that's still a risk-weighted assets. They are relatively stable. There was some growth in those &#x20AC;3 billion that is coming from this mentioned volume growth that is partly mitigated by this positive rating migration and thereby with these developmental risk-weighted assets and profits. Our core Tier 1 ratio was stable at the high level of 11%.</p>
          <p>Then on page 19, you see this kind of breakdown on the risk-weighted asset growth, this &#x20AC;3 billion growth. You can see that in the middle of the graph, you see that the impact of the volume growth. So it was &#x20AC;5.1 billion in the Nordic portfolios which are internal rating based models and then &#x20AC;2.2 billion in those portfolios we are still in standardized, i.e., in Poland and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:42) and Russia and international branches.</p>
          <p>Half of this growth, this &#x20AC;5.1 billion growth, comes from this growth in the market value of derivatives which Fredrik already mentioned in his summary. And then the rest comes from this kind of volume growth in ordinary lending, but partly this growth was mitigated by this credit quality improvement, &#x20AC;1.9 billion, as well as very low level in our market risk levels, as well as we have been continuously finding ways to improve our risk-weighted asset efficiency and also in this quarter that benefited close to &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>With these words, I hand back to Fredrik.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ari. I will just say very brief &#x2013; few brief comments on the business. Ari, as you have seen, we have now put together the business areas in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:46) value chains and this is the first quarter where we are reporting in accordance with that new organizational structure. As you can see from slide 21, the retail banking results, lending volumes are up. The underlying business is solid as I have already alluded to. The transformation of the branch network continues. So, overall, a good performance by retail banking in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The wholesale banking is also experiencing a solid customer trend. Of course, the result was impacted by the factors relating to market turmoil as we &#x2013; as I have already alluded to. As is the case with the retail banking, the loan loss situation is stable.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the next, wealth management results. Of course, the influence is visible here in practically two ways. The assets under management have been reduced by 7% as a consequence of asset revaluation, and of course, also the previously described life adjustment or reversal of fee income. Worth perhaps noting is that the performance is good and 65% of the investment composite results forming the benchmark last 36 months.</p>
          <p>So with those very short comments, I will leave over to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, and I will touch upon the strategy and future. And first of all, a few words about the financial crisis. I mean, we all know, all those listening here that of course the big answer to the big question, how can we avoid new <mark type="ph" /> barbers (18:26) to make the banking sector fail and create economic recessions? By that fact is of course the new regulation with more capital, more liquidity and more funding, and relative what has been created as a new economic environment where the banks are supposed to be the buffer zone of the economy. So if the economy &#x2013; the banks can absorb the losses from the <mark type="ph" /> barber (18:48) and avoid the rest of the economy goes into recession.</p>
          <p>Let's put it very simply and of course it has been a massive value destruction, which have happened in the past four years. The slide shows that the reality that European banks and the Euro STOXX Index has lost 75% of their value if we include capital raised in those years. They had some significant <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:12), but the value destruction is obvious. So obviously, it is necessary to do something about this. So, we support the new measures. Of course, they need to be calibrated so we don't overdo it, the parameters which need to be set right. And of course, that's huge discussion above level playing field because it seems that individual countries seems to have individual views on where to go.</p>
          <p>And on the next slide, it's clear that some business models were tested and failed. And business models has to be reviewed and worked upon and we can see that Nordea has done well and compared with the group, <mark type="ph" /> we are now the fifth largest (19:51) bank in terms of market cash.</p>
          <p>The journey continues. Our new normal plan is &#x2013; will <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:59) a continuation of our strategy. It has been much more focused with the aim of restoring ROE and making it possible to continue to service our customers. That's a very short version.</p>
          <p>And the relationship strategy has been a strategy that we pursued now for four to five years and we continue on that one. We have done it through the crisis. We have kept helping our customers, we've kept showing off our balance sheet and ensuring that we could actually do this, and the new normal does not differ from this. It is again restoring ROE and secured that which serviced our customers. At the same time, ROE has come down obviously from 20% to 11%. At the same time, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:32) our quarter one has gone up from 7% to 11%, so the difference is maybe not that big in real profitability, but of course, the capital has increased significantly. That is something we're going to mitigate and restore ROE. The relationship strategy is a win-win strategy.</p>
          <p>And the next slide, I've actually been showing for some years, because it is the largest ROI, it is a sustainable business model that delivers extraordinary results with low risk and with high potential. And it is because we satisfy some real customer needs, the full range of advice, products innovation driven &#x2013; directed towards customer and not through anything else.</p>
          <p>These segments, the relationship segments are very profitable. They have a high potential for growth that actually where the underlying growth really is. They are more satisfied in laws that they do not leave, they stay with us if we treat them right. And we had this possibility of increasing the efficiency and service. These customers use the Internet and mobile banking more than others. We have the chance to meet them face-to-face and talk all products therefore making the meeting efficient. And they deliver the full volumes, so it's both capital and funding. So we get this balance and sustainability in our business model.</p>
          <p>It's the mirror of the economy, we get the funding and we have lending. And thereby, we create the procedures. And it's very low risk. We have proven during this crisis that the loan losses in these segments are very low. And we know them well. They also made their credit scores, some of them and means that whenever problems arise, we are quickly reacting, we get in contact with the customer and we can help them and avoid difficulties.</p>
          <p>So the new normal is actually, it's choosing a more focused relationship strategy where we focus and being more cost efficiency, more capital efficient, more funding, liquidity efficient, creating new products and new behaviors and thereby creating a sustainable business model, which had a long term potential and is in the sweet spot in the market where the potential of profitability and efficiency is good. And we aim in creating great top league ROE.</p>
          <p>The top league ROE we are defining now as our target 15% in a normalized macroeconomic environment. It is a high number and of course, it requires some normalization of the macro economy to get there. But we will deliver actions, which will enhance our cost efficiency, delivering our ROE enhancement, we will deliver capital efficiencies, delivering our reinvestment and some will need to come from the normalization on the economy.</p>
          <p>The next slide, I will not cover, that will be the key slide on our capital markets day, how we actually do this, how we through very disciplined, our ROE focus and working capital was in business units, reallocation of resources between segments and creating new products all the way down to the customers, how we actually generate new behaviors that will make possible to solve the problem -the needs of the customer with less capital and less liquidity and less long funding. That is something we worried and we are always doing it and I think we can come a long way this way and this will be the call of the capital market day.</p>
          <p>This being about our ROE focus is being questioned in some areas, why high ROE. That obviously, the logic is that we do not return somewhat over the cost of capital, we cannot remain a strong bank in attracting low funding cost. And the low funding cost will be the key going forward because the cost of funding and liquidity has gone up dramatically in recent years.</p>
          <p>And the low funding cost will be the key going forward, because the cost of funding and liquidity has gone up dramatically in recent years. And this is the key to be a competitive bank, to service our customers, to get momentum and do ROE.</p>
          <p>So there is only one way to do this. The average will probably not be 15, the average will probably more likely to be around 10 or something. But there will be a group of bank, maybe a small group, that will go towards 15 and they will, of course, have a superior competitive position, and it is our clear decision to be there. We already have one of the strongest capital basis. We're very strong in funding, liquidity. And our profitability is also very strong, many banks have between 10 or 11% ROE in this environment.</p>
          <p>We will elaborate on all that on the Capital Market Day. And you see the smiling faces on the slide, they will greet you and tell an exciting story about our New Normal Plan, and we'll still have some tickets available on the first row at a very reasonable price. So I can only encourage you to come to our Capital Market Day next week, and I look forward to see you to make it there.</p>
          <p>So that was the presentation. I would do &#x2013; and now we are ready for questions. Rodney?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we take our first question from Chintan Joshi with Nomura. Please go ahead. Mr. Joshi, sir, your line is open to ask a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sorry, I was on mute there. Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, let me put in a bid for that first-row seat, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My three questions for you. Firstly, could you elaborate a little bit more on the Swedish mortgage margin trends? If I could ask you what your front book margins are versus the book margins and perhaps what percentage of your book has been re-priced to the front book levels, if you could give that detail?</p>
          <p>Second question is, I would be interested in your thoughts around the risk rates in Sweden. Do you see this kind of coming and pretty much on the cards or is there a large uncertainty around how these ratings will be treated in Sweden?</p>
          <p>And also if you could share your thoughts on how the increased risk ratings should be implemented, do you think there'll be a floor or do you think there will be a factor of multiplication or something of that sort?</p>
          <p>And finally, I guess, this is for you, Christian. The banks in Europe are pretty cheap by historical standards, perhaps for a good reason. How do you think about acquiring assets in this environment, especially given that Nordic banks are among the few banks that do actually have some capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first, I will start with the Swedish mortgage market. I did not actually fully hear your question but I think it was how big part of the mortgage markets has been re-priced. And I think the fair statement is actually a fairly big part is actually up-to-date in terms of pricing and the reason that I'm saying that is that a significant portion is on relatively short interest rate payment terms are typically three months. So therefore, it is a fairly large portion that is up to date in terms of margin.</p>
          <p>Now, a couple of general comments. First of all, it is a very, very competitive market for various reasons. And of course, the main reason for that is it's a product that also attracts a more customer relationship kind of status. So, that's why it is a fairly competitive market. But in recent times, the obvious need to re-price mortgages have clearly evolve in the market, and we believe that there is that potential going forward, and we've actually seen some tendencies in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So our estimation or our belief is that margin should continue to go up and that margins on the back of higher funding costs in general for the banks will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>I will, then, maybe start with the risk rates. Should I do that &#x2013; in the Swedish market, first of all, nothing is decided on the risk rates. I think that's important to remember. The loan loss levels in Sweden have been very low for a very long period of time, also in the dramatic years of '91 to '93. So of course, with no loan losses as we currently have and had for a very long time, risk rates will, over time, if interest rates or if loan losses stay at zero, they will basically converge down to practically nothing or 2% or 3%. That is, of course, something that is real because loan losses are low, but there's been adjustments as you alluded to as to how you would implement some sort of floor. I think it would be in the shape and form of floors because you cannot actually do the math to make risk rates higher. It's very, very difficult to stimulate other types of scenarios. So I would estimate the floor and I wouldn't estimate that they've fairly gone higher than where we are at the current time. But in fact, we don't actually know that. But that hopefully answers your second and third question and then, Christian on the fourth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand question. Actually, Nordea has gone up to a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:14) so that is not too bad, but you can say that I think it's necessary even for Nordea to execute the new normal plan before we consider any acquisitions. This is an extreme volatile environment, and we don't know exactly whether this is going to end in a worse situation or some improved situation. It depends a lot on the G20 meeting and other meetings in coming weeks. But you can say that the New Normal Plan, which actually mitigates the effect of capital funding and liquidity and gives a very clear direction and that Nordea will reach the 15% or somewhere close there to something we need to deliver in coming months, quarters, maybe even a year, to convince you and the market that we would go there.</p>
          <p>And as soon as we see that, I'm sure we will see our stock price going up and then, the price will go up maybe 1.5 or 2 is even what could easily be the result. Then, we have done the adjustment to the New Normal or have come a long way through it, I would say. And then, it's obvious that still a lot of banks, I believe, will be struggling with funding cost and weaker ratings. And then, this thing about acquiring assets is much more relevant, because right now, any calculation you do at acquiring assets, even those which are up for sale and we get offered, we still have to &#x2013; the upside, we can calculate, but the downside is very big if the turmoil gets worse and we sort of valued our capital position. That risk is too big to take right now, so we need more clarity in the market and I also think we like to see a higher price book in our home share. And I think we can deliver that faster than many other banks in Europe. So I'm not worried that this will go away.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick Davey with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Nick Davey from UBS. Thanks for taking the time for the call. Two quick questions from my side, please. The first on the balance sheet and currency mix. You give us, hopefully, a slide in your fact book slide, 114 on your split of assets and liabilities by currency. Clearly, there's plenty of focus, at least, in the domestic regulation, I guess, more recently from the market on dollar funding. Could you please just talk around the slide on the dollar side? I mean, clearly, you've got around the 300% loan-to-deposit ratio in US dollars. You clearly have very strong access to commercial paper market; it's improved or increased in the quarter. But could you just help us think about perhaps how the regulators use this currency split, whether you feel any pressure or you would yourselves aim to close this funding capital in the US market or perhaps decrease some of the currency mismatches in the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>The second question is on a theme which, Mr. Clausen, you've talked about already, the trade-off between ROE and capital. And I think the question is really when you think about your ROE going up significantly in the next two years, as you say, or heading towards the 15% ROE target, what sort of capital planning do you put into that process? Because, as you've alluded to, the rest of Europe is &#x2013; capital need is changing by the day, really, but heading upwards of 9% level. When your regulator speaks, he talks about, I suppose, starting the process nearer 12% quarter one and perhaps even implementing Basel III early. And in the meantime, you seem quite happy to consume capital with growth. So I'd just like to get your thoughts on that 15% return, what sort of capital levels you think it might be achievable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, I can give you an extremely long answer on your first question, I'll try not to do that. I think the short story is that this has been debated from regulators and from politicians in, primarily, Sweden, the dollar dependency of the funding situation, and where they've particularly been or actually where have been concerned is where you use dollar funding to actually also do dollar lending. That's been where they think there could be a stability problem. And as a consequence, they urge banks to do finance such dollar lending either through long-term funding or through deposits.</p>
          <p>If you look at that slide you alluded to, you can see that our total deposit is EUR23 billion approximately. Out of the total funding, you see a little lower on the slide, approximately another EUR16 billion is long-term funding. So, of course, the EUR23 billion and the EUR16 billion taken as a whole, that EUR39 billion is of course significantly bigger than the EUR25 billion we actually do the lending. So from the regulatory perspective, this is not a stability issue.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are also using the very deep and liquid money market in the United States to also swap into other currencies. And the reason is, of course, commercial. We are always able to do that from other countries or other sources, but it is an advantageous situation for us that few other banks can access. So that's not from a stability standpoint any issue.</p>
          <p>Having said all of those things, just a final remark, we access, of course, the Fed through our U.S. branch. We access the dollar facilities in ECB and we access Swiss Bank facilities, et cetera, et cetera. So from an accessibility problem, this is not an issue for us.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, it is actually one of the real strength you can see on the funding situation at Nordea, so it's a good part, a good story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Fredrik. And then, the ROE, on capital planning, we assume 11% core capital on the 15%. And this implies, of course, since we built capital with our present ROE and growth is probably not going to be that big in the coming years and lending, then we will build some capital which we then plan, of course, to either payout or to share buybacks. Not in the short term, because in the short term this is of course not possible with the regulatory pressure. But I think, in the medium term, we will see that. And then maybe even growth will also be &#x2013; we have this organic growth which actually is that &#x2013; it's very profitable in these relationship segments.</p>
          <p>The assumption is 11%, the capital, and 15% ROE. Now the regulator pressure is &#x2013; I think the Swedish regulator is still at 10% to 12% quarter one. And I think the gaps on there, I don't think the spread is that wide anymore. I think Europe is moving <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:12) in the discussions. Also, Central Europe. I hear very few countries talking below 10% now, maybe 9% to 10% will be a reasonable number. And 10% to 12% &#x2013; and 10% is very clear, close to each other, and we had 11%, so that's close too.</p>
          <p>We don't know exactly where it will end. You can say that the U.S. is probably the problem because they're talking about lower numbers. So I think, what is &#x2013; and I know that this could be discussed among certain members of the G20, coming out of this calibration, because I know all regulators, especially to be super worried about their outlook to have different capital ratios which is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:50) clearly to the system.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I think that we will have this calibration and that number will be chosen. Then, there are other details in how we actually implement the transition rules and dates and so on, but doesn't really impact Nordea that much. We're at 11% and I do not foresee a higher ratio than 11%. Actually, it's more likely in a matter of one to two years down the road, if markets hopefully have quiet down and we are on a more normalized environment, then I actually think 10% is more the number.</p>
          <p>Then there might be other discussions coming up and there are resolution recoveries set up in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:29) which has not been said yet, and that's the work we are going to embark upon now because there are a lot of things. Becomes a question about Tier II and bail-in &#x2013; and bail-in methods for other liabilities which is a huge discussion. How that will actually work out, that is still outstanding. And that is also an unknown, of course, to us today. So we're assuming that 11% will hold well. And as I said, this is what we have and we will probably even bid some more in the short run.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just two questions. Firstly on Denmark, you talked about having re-priced by up to 50 basis points in the middle of the quarter and still, your net interest margin on the lending side doesn't really move. So, is the net effect of this re-pricing basically just to offset costs that you already had and not actually any positive NII impact?</p>
          <p>And the other question was just on the trading loss. If I look at your notes, you have a $2 billion loss on equity positions. Could you just talk about what the size of that position is and how we should understand this number? Is it offset, technically, by the other numbers or is this sort of separate position that reduced those losses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jacob, I will try answer your question. First of all, we &#x2013; if we start by the margin, margins, as you rightly say, are flat. We have actually imposed in the middle of that quarter an increase to the <mark type="ph" /> spend (40:33). Our expectation is still that it will generate approximately the kind of profit that we have assumed, approximately EUR20 billion per year or some 20 basis points roughly, so &#x2013; in average, for the portfolio. And so I actually think that margins should go up in the next quarter in Denmark, but you're right, it has not so far. But I think that's more for other reasons and you should see that margin actually coming through. Our expectation or the way we see it, nothing would suggest that it's not working so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:13).</p>
          <p>I'll comment on the equity position of the 2,189 that you're suggesting or were you asking about on <mark type="ph" /> the note for (41:22). That's a really complicated IFRS note. You can actually see the corresponding amount in the balance sheet. If you look at the balance sheet from the report, you'll see that the equity holdings is a bit over EUR50 billion. And of course, it's down from a bit over <mark type="ph" /> EUR17 (41:40) billion, so that's the decline, that's the basis for it. And of course the absolute majority of that relates to Life. So if you take the total amount of 2,189, the Life part is 2,100. So the actual bank is, in fact, 89, out of which a part of that has counter &#x2013; counter items for the down in that note.</p>
          <p>So the actual revaluation or loss in the P&amp;L for the bank as a whole equals EUR58 million. That's basically what's left of that very significant adjustment. It's not easy to understand the IFRS accounting in the note for &#x2013; I can clearly understand that issue, but as I've said, it relates to the revaluation of the full share possession of the bank.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A few questions from my side as well, starting off in Denmark. I could see the average risk weight, and I put it against loans has gone up. What's the driver behind it? Do you see like the average risk weight of your own loans already increasing given the difficult environment or what else might be behind it?</p>
          <p>And secondly, do you have any exposure to Swiss Franc lending in Denmark? Just wanted to get this question off my chest.</p>
          <p>And then, the last question, or two, in fact, in terms of the normal macro that you assume for your target setting, what's the sort of interest rate assumptions that you have in mind? If you choose to disclose that today already, unless, otherwise I'm happy to wait for the capital markets day.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I just wanted to get a quick update on your leverage finance operations, the size of the book and sort of how it's been behaving so far? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. From the Danish risks, it's a mix impact on the risk weight, but all in all, the rating migrations have been &#x2013; the rating migrations have been positive meaning that our profitability for being in the corporate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:59) market has actually improved, which is good sign of this type of overall quality improvement in the average improvement in our portfolio. There are still problem cases in Denmark. Now it's said it's coming from the SME corporate customers. I think this quarter, also from the household customers, so in that way, we have a mix in Denmark. But all in all, actually we are not so concerned about the future level of loss fees. We are not forecasting the loan loss fees going forward, but there are no indications that there would be any trauma in Denmark. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:48) a little bit on this kind of macro situation in Denmark and that the way we see this economic environment that's developing in Denmark.</p>
          <p>The Danish public financing, for example, are very strong. Unemployment still is very low. So that what are now a little bit weaker side and I've seen it in Denmark, it's going to reduce consumer confidence. And also, some, let's say, disturbances in the housing market, so that is becoming a little bit weaker. So in that way, actually, we have been cautious and went through our household lending book in prudence, just to identify those potential problem customers that's the reason for increased household lending loan loss in Denmark.</p>

          <p>Leverage finance book, so we still have very diversified book. We have roughly 100 steel companies in that lending book. In the third quarter, we didn't see any kind of deterioration of that lending book. It is, in fact, some of those deals are quite highly leveraged and, of course, that may signal some kind of let's say higher caution if this economic environment continues or if it's getting worse. But we have to remember that those deals we have made now, because lately, they have been done with a very high equity caution by the sponsors of the fund. So that we still have lots of cautions also to take a little bit weaker, let's say, economic environment. So, there is no bigger issues in the quality of that book.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll elaborate on what we mean by normalizing more detail. But then of course normalized interest rate is of course not 1% or so that we see as big time movement. So it's more in the sort of 2% to 4% range exactly where that is. It's not the important issue, because it's related to many different things. Among others are our possibilities to increase margins or blended margins there and all sorts of other factors. So we'll elaborate on that much more as we meet next week. But just to give you a hunch, it's in the sort of 2% to 4% range.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I just had a quick question, I guess, on NII and funding. You referenced in the release that there is maturing funding, one of the benefits that maturing long-term funding refinances at lower market rates. And I guess, this quarter you've done mainly a secured funding. So was that secured funding rolling off? I guess that's the first question. And then I have a follow-through question, should we expect further impact for this in the fourth quarter once we get, I guess, a full quarter effect of the cheaper funding that you've issued this quarter because I guess it's secured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think you should expect &#x2013; first of all, it's actually difficult to answer your question, because it depends of course on the spread levels of the prevailing market. So of course <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:49:41). Generally speaking, you can say that the spread market has moved up and down and we're high, very high at some stage of 2008 and '09 as you recall, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you could get that from that period, it's expensive and that's basically what has been replaced at this point in time. So this is actually not &#x2013; it is not a substitution between secured and non-secured. It's rather owned that's actually maturing and that happen to be expensive in the change. Generally on that note, we have funded pretty much more, a lot more than our actual redemption for the year. So we prefunded all of the unsecured funding at the early part of the year. We're approximately &#x20AC;11 billion so far this year out of the total of &#x20AC;28 billion. So we have performed well. And in the quarter, this was basically old funding as our expensive rates have matured and were refinanced by our existing funding pretty much at the end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And would you expect any further impact in the fourth quarter? So I guess...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think so really, because for the time being, spreads are fairly high. We are in average, for the total funding book, maybe even slightly below where the current spreads all. But there is no really material things that will evolve in the near future. But of course, the spread remain for the banking market where it is at this point in time. Of course there is not &#x2013; one could not, of course, avoid high funding cost as old funding mature going forward in the next few years. But that is, of course, extremely difficult to speculate on and will depend on the spread levels prevailing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This is Claire Kane from RBC. I've got two questions for you. The first is just a follow up to the last funding question. Can you just give us an idea of what your strategy is? As that secured funding is rolling down, are you replacing it with the same maturity or extended maturity? And is there a formal policy not to term in?</p>
          <p>And then, given you said your competitive advantage is your lower funding cost appears, how will you reconcile that with the ability to term out and who is to term out faster? Do you have a timeline to meet in the liquidity rules which you said you are embracing somewhat?</p>
          <p>And then moving on to your profitability trends and the 20% ROE for 7% core Tier 1 and it's now 11% for '11, I guess the implication is a lot of that has to do with your leverage. How will you manage leverage going forward? I guess the expectation is that that will continue to fall. And I guess I'm somewhat surprised on the comments about the regulatory background given where discussing the implementation of level with great from mortgages and the regulators said they're keen for 10% to 12%.</p>
          <p>And so now you want to go any lower from current your peer have stopped its buyback program for the time being. So I'm just wondering, can we assume that if you do have to lower the leverage and the core Tier 1 does to stay higher that that 15% ROE target won't really be achievable? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me start with the strategy on funding, it was a complicated set of questions you have there. But generally speaking, we think we have a good mix in terms of covered bonds and senior deposits and short term, et cetera. So we're basically maintaining that strategy, we've had an increasing size of our long-term funding, considerable size increase in the last several years, and we have reached a position now which we think is very adequate from the behavioral maturity standpoint. So the difference between behavioral assets and liabilities is basically 0.3 years, a quarter of a year.</p>
          <p>So we think we have a very good funding and maturity position, that's our strategy and that's basically to maintain it. Then I think your question was also secured maybe versus unsecured, and of course, we will continue to do secure but it's also important to note that we have, in the last year, established covered bond programs both in Finland and in Norway, both of them which are a very good market, and we have significant assets that are available for funding just like that. So of course we want to maintain the beneficial money market, covered bond market and we have -- we feel we have a very significant potential in those two covered bond programs. So we would utilize them, but we will of course remain on senior unsecured. It's not something imminent for us for the simple reason that we pre-funded such a big amount, as I alluded to before, &#x20AC;11 billion. So I think the conditions need to be ripe for us to issue on the senior unsecured, but we were able to access that market at any time.</p>
          <p>Now your second question was a more difficult one, I think you alluded perhaps to the <mark type="ph" /> Anasafor (55:25) implementation and what our stance is there. I think we concluded just that the future <mark type="ph" /> of Anasafor (55:31) is highly uncertain at this stage, I think it's more likely than not that parameter settings and maybe the whole mythology will be changed as we go forward in the coming years. I think we are addressing it as -- we of course track this development, we also track figures of petrol although still actually difficult to calculate for any bank, but we track them. And of course our ambition is not to deteriorate in terms of <mark type="ph" /> Anasafor (55:59) as we go forward, but we just don't think <mark type="ph" /> Anasafor (56:05) is a very good measure. So that's why we stick to the economic funding <mark type="ph" /> there that (56:06) I alluded before, and that we think is a very, very strong position we have there. So I think, that was also your second question.</p>
          <p>The leverage continue to fall, I'm not sure, I fully understood that question if you could...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, do you consider, how do -- I guess in terms of your profitability, and I guess we'll get more detail out of the Capital Markets Day, but how do you look your return on assets because I guess that has fallen since 2007 and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's a good point. I'm sorry, I didn't get that question -- your question first. Fine, I think return on assets in general, of course, are expected to increase, or we expect it to increase in the coming years as far as the New Normal plan, and there is real simple reason for -- actually two very simple reasons. Of course, one is the obvious one, the reason -- one of the major reasons why it has actually fallen is that deposit income has fallen fairly dramatically over the time span that you mentioned. And of course deposit does not require any capital, so what we have compensated on the NII line to a large extent by margin increases on the lending side, lending of course requires a large capital and large deposit now. So of course, if and when normalized interest rate situations occur then by definition asset return is also increasing.</p>
          <p>The second thing that we much more control on our own is the capitalization fee as a group as such and of course, we are working very heavily with all sorts of different things. We'll be impacted by the Basel II as you know. We've given you those figures but we're also working with various modern things and other efficiency gains within the existing business. So we also feel we have the ability to increase asset return as we go forward in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so just my final part, that was &#x2013; if the leverage you're not able to stay 11%, the regulator won't allow you to return capital to keep it that level. Can we assume that the ROE talk it will be adjusted down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a general uncertainty on the capital requirements as we said, but you should separate between political rhetoric going on right now and then the sort of more outgoing concern development some time in the future, I think in one to two years from now. So obviously, when the capital is set we are, of course, allowed to return capital. Then the very short run with all the turmoil and with political discussion going on in Europe about the banks and their profit, then right now is probably not a very good idea to buy back shares. So I'm not too worried about this as I said. I clearly hear among key positions make us that the calibration will have a non-capital and there will be a rule setting and that will be in the area we talked about, 10%, maybe 11%, but I actually think 10%. And when that is said and all the parameters are finally done and we are further ahead than now then I think it's time to lease capital if we have too much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. That's all very clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we have our next question from Jan Erik Gjerland with DnB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Jan Erik Gjerland from DnB Oslo. I have some questions and the first one is the size of your own holdings or equity in the year in your group treasury area, where you have this softness performed around the remaining private equity and stuff. Can you just elaborate on the size of that portfolio please?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you have some increased technical provision in the Life part or in your note four again and it's been jumping up and down quite. So, I just wonder if you have some reversal of the provision as you had last quarter in this quarter?</p>
          <p>Also on the Life side, it looks like the buffers are running down quite dramatically in Denmark and Norway and if you could elaborate a little bit about the risks in those two portfolios. Also how much is traditional versus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:35)?</p>
          <p>Finally, on your net interest income slide, if you could specify household and corporate development on both the margin and the volume side, it will be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, despite of the equity holdings in treasury, that was your first question, it is approximately &#x20AC;360 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;358 million, I think it is. The second question was the technical provisions, I didn't actually fully get that. That was <mark type="ph" /> in '04 again? (01:01:18)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you have some &#x20AC;155 million loss &#x2013; cost last quarter and then a &#x20AC;51 million gain this quarter. I just wondered that those items moved around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we will come back with that with a comprehensive answer. It's basically coming from the return we can have and the premium income. So I will come back to you with a more detailed answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Rodney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the third question was rates and how much was Unit Link, in Denmark it's very little. Unit Link related is mostly traditional in the Danish market and there we are still above 100% for all the four classes of guarantees that we have related to the business. But the buffer size is not sufficient to actually take out shareholder fees to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So what we've done there is to reverse, as I initially commented on, the shareholders fee that we took for first and second quarters, that's the amount to &#x20AC;30 million. So I think while that's unfortunate, it's also important to say that most Life companies, I guess, in Denmark have reached this situation where they are in the so-called push down or basically where they're off to do not cover the guarantees issued; we are not in that position. So in relative terms we have performed well.</p>
          <p>When you talk about Norway, it is a similar kind of a situation by principal, so they're decreased and we've also in Norway not taken shareholders this quarter. So what's the impact from Denmark was approximately &#x20AC;45 million, the impact from Norway was approximately &#x20AC;7 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just you follow up on Denmark. If your buffer should go below zero here, is it a one-to-one shareholder induction into that company just to cover any guarantees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John Eric, we will come back with you with the full answer of that. The rough answer is no, but I will come back with more detail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, I think I'd then like to close this conference call. Thank you for your many good questions. I hope we have delivered good answers. And next week we will see each other and we still have great seats on the front row for very limited fees. And we hope to see you all. And I think we will elaborate on a lot of these questions. So see you all next week in London. Thank you very much.</p>
