          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the Presentation of 2009 Third Quarter Results, hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Phil and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, good afternoon to everybody and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Before we start with the formal presentation, let me just outline a couple of points that might be useful for the presentation. We are quite pleased about our quarter results. We have again delivered quarter-on-quarter growth in sustainable profitability and I stress the point, sustainable. The third quarter net income is at 674, that means more than 30% increase versus the previous quarter. And the nine months net income is close to 2.3 billion. That means that we will certainly deliver what we promised at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Our revenues proved highly resilient and that despite a number of negative effect. I mean, the elimination of the overdraft fees, main element, but probably not the main element, the main element is an unexpected fall in the Euribor rates. We are at an all-time low. That was not expected. We absorbed it, but certainly it did not contribute to the improvement of our results as in every year, so that has certainly had an impact. But despite all these effects and despite the fact that we are in the process of completing the Banca dei Territori internal reorganization, and we are almost finished but not yet with the IT migrations, we consider that the revenue performance is more than satisfactory.</p>
          <p>From the operating cost point of view, they are further down. The sign will remain negative also in the future, I mean in the next years. And simplification, simplification of the company at any level will be one of our main focus. We have been working mainly on the merger in the last three years. Now it's time for the second phase that has to do with the optimization and simplification of the whole Group.</p>
          <p>Net adjustments, provisions on the bad loans. Net adjustments to loans are down 24% from Q2. We expected such a decrease, maybe not such a decrease, but certainly a decrease. And we confirm that as far as we understand, the second quarter 2009 will remain the negative peak in this area.</p>
          <p>Tier 1, Tier 1 ratio at the end of September stood at 8%. And you know that after the end of September, we issued a 1.5 billion of Tier 1 that is not yet included. The same way, the capital gain on Findomestic is not included yet in the nine months results.</p>
          <p>Disposals, disposals and the preparation of the possible listings of non-core assets, they are underway. We confirm that we will complete, that we expect to complete the first lot of these activities by the time of the shareholders meeting. Hopefully, we will make some announcements before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In the light of all these results, we are announcing today sounds reasonable, seems reasonable to expect what they said before that the consolidated net income for the whole year for 2009 could be higher than what we recorded in 2008.</p>
          <p>So these are the main points before we go into all the details. And if you agree, we go directly to page number four where we have the usual slide concerning sustainable profitability. We keep saying the same thing, we stick to these rules. There is no silver bullet, there is no shortcut to long-term results. Sustainable profitability is the result of a number of other levers and we are working and we will keep working on all of them.</p>
          <p>The operating management of the company both in terms of income and cost, but all the other components also because results can be sustainable in environment like the one we are living in today, only if the risk profile is kept the right level, the liquidity, short-term and long-term is guaranteed and so with solidity and leverage. We are enjoying today the lowest CDS among the largest European banking groups and probably this is the result of the philosophy, I just described.</p>
          <p>Page five. Sustainable profitability from the point of view of operating margin, you see that quarter-after-quarter the operating margin after net adjustments to loans is increasing and that is despite the negative effect I mentioned before the overdraft charge elimination, the further falls in market yields, but I already mentioned this point. In terms of pre-tax income, quarter-after-quarter after the bad end of 2008, we are getting back to where we wanted to be.</p>
          <p>Page six. Sustainable profitability from the point of view of operating costs, you know that we had to increase our targets in terms of cost reduction. And if you look on the left-hand side of the page, you see that we have gone much farther than what the business plan provided for, but obviously you have to change your priorities when things change in the scenario. In terms of cost synergies that's on the right-hand side, you see we had a target in the round of 1.245 billion. We are already above that level and we have 180 million of additional cost synergies to be realized between the present quarter and the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Page seven. Seven is liquidity. Liquidity remains and will remain a priority. We believe that building and keeping a strong liquidity position is a key factor for success in such a highly uncertain environment. The different components of the liquidity are in the three boxes. The left-hand side, the customer deposits more than covering the loan to customers and 70% of such deposits are from the retail activity of the company.</p>
          <p>Same on the left-hand side, the amount of eligible assets we have accumulated in case of need with Central Banks and we have reached to 72 billion. On the right-hand side, the medium and long-term funding, you might remember that we had a total target &#x2013; funding target for 2009 at &#x20AC;29 billion worth of long, medium and long-term facilities. The network &#x2013; our network has been even more capable than that and we have now reached 31 billion. Last point is the net interbank position that at the end of September was positive for 4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Page eight, I will not go through the page, it's only to remember what we decided at the end of September, we decided not to issue the so-called Tremonti bonds. That does not mean that we did not appreciate what the government has done to allow Italian banks to go through the crisis, but fortunately our results in this scenario put us in the position to walk or maybe run with our own legs.</p>
          <p>As decided on the occasion of that board meeting, we launched an issue of Tier 1 that was successfully issued in October for 1.5 billion. And we are actively working on the disposal plan, the disposal/listing plan is made of two different phases. One is to be completed in the short term and for 100 basis points, and further 100 basis points available if needed. As I said before, we gave us the time between now and the shareholders meeting, but as I said at the beginning of the presentation, we are hopeful to make some announcement already before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Page nine, page nine is the page with the capital ratios. The first column is the capital ratios &#x2013; is the list of the capital ratios, the way they come out from our accounts at the end of September. Core Tier 1, 7.2; Tier 1, 8% and Total Capital, 11.6. Second column are the factors that can be used in a pro forma calculation, because they account for events that have already happened like the Tier 1 issue I mentioned before or like the Findomestic disposal that has already been signed and closed, but not yet accounted for in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So, if we take into account those elements, we get to 7.6 Core Tier 1, 8.8 Tier 1, and 12.4 Total Ratio. Then we have the two sets of capital management actions. The amount that we took the commitment to implement in the next month and the second part that are available if needed. By adding those effects, we get close to 10% Core Tier 1, 11% Tier 1, and more than 14% Total Tier.</p>
          <p>Page 10, page 10 is our position in the leverage ranking. When we say leverage, obviously we mean tangible net shareholders equity on tangible total assets. Our position is clear. Our tangible equity has increased in the last quarter by 1.3 billion and in the first nine months of the year, the tangible equity of Intesa Sanpaolo has increased by 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Page 11 has to do our risk profile that we consider low and very much under control. The break down in terms of the different businesses is on the left-hand side, while on the right-hand side we have our competitive position in the main activities of the Banca dei Territori. We enjoy very similar ranking portions also in the corporate and investment banking activity that, as you know, has performed in a very excellent way in the last few quarters included third one.</p>
          <p>Page 12. The low-risk profile has to do with the cost of credit. Cost of credit is growing as expected in the sense that the second quarter will remain as far as we understand today the peak quarter in terms of provisions and in terms of a new flow of substandard and doubtful loans. We will remain on the basis of what we know today under the 100 basis points of cost of credit we announced at the beginning of the year. The coverage of the doubtful loans remain very, very comfortable. Total coverage that means including collateral and guarantees is stable at more than 120%.</p>
          <p>Page 13 and page 14 are the two pages where you find all the details about our presence in Central Eastern Europe. We have always given these figures for those who believe that those countries represent some sort of higher than the normal risks. Actually, we believe that only countries that for us are very, very small like Ukraine have that kind of profile, but as I said Ukraine accounts for less than 0.1% of our loans.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to page &#x2013; let's skip page 16 and let's go to page 17. 17 is the &#x20AC;1 trillion worth of customer financial assets we often refer to. The real figures, or the figures that have a stronger meaning from a management point of view are the ones in the two yellow clouds. The point figures and the average figures are different because there are a number of institutional customers that tend to close their position at the end of the month or the quarters. But you see that both the average volumes of our direct customer deposits and the average volumes of our loan to customers is very positive.</p>
          <p>One thing that should be noted is, that what's been written in the first note, in the third quarter of this year the total customer financial assets have increased by more than &#x20AC;10 billion. We will comment later a very interesting trend that we expected. And I am referring to the trend of asset under management that is probably taking off.</p>
          <p>Page 18, the P&amp;L, we have already pointed out the main points. Very good resilience in terms of operating income, good cost control, a lower amount of net adjustments the sum of these elements make the income before tax going up 13% and the net income up 31%.</p>
          <p>Page 19, you have the analysis of the net income adjusted for what we consider to be non-recurring items, integration charges and amortization of acquisition cost. You see that if we compare the net adjusted income second quarter and third quarter, the increase is very significant.</p>
          <p>Page 20, the nine months P&amp;L, same kind of trends, a bit more emphasized. Revenues down, but actually lower than what the scenario and the recession would cause normally. And a very strong operating cost management, down 3.5%. Obviously the comparison with last year is very negative because of the higher than last year, but a bit lower than expected net adjustments to loans.</p>
          <p>Page 21. Net interest income that are not inflated by any leverage effect. This is really our industrial activities, if I can use this word. The decrease in the last quarter was expected. One event that was not expected is the decline &#x2013; is the further decline in markdown due to the further drop in market yields. The red line is the Euribor one month line that has reached really never seen levels. Despite of the elimination of overdraft charges, despite the expected repricing of public finance assets that are done on June the 30, the results are compatible, more than compatible with our targets. On the right-hand side you see the year-on-year results. An incredible decrease in market yields, that in a way are a negative news today, but are also the evidence of the potential we have in the future for getting back to very interesting results. In terms of volumes, you have the figures on the bottom of the right-hand side, you see that more or less despite the very deep recession of our country, but the whole world is suffering from our figures are more than acceptable.</p>
          <p>Page 22, is the analysis of the net interest income with the different components. On a quarterly basis, on the left-hand side you see that effect of the overdraft charges decreased. You know that we got back part of those 90 through new commissions that are on the commission line obviously. While on the right-hand side, you might be interested in the breakdown of the spread effect. The 1.6 billion negative effect, in terms of spreads come from 2.7 billion worth of decrease in the markdown and 1 billion positive effect in the markups. The 2.7 billion decrease, in markdowns is approximately what we can get back that they interest rates &#x2013; market interest rates get back to normal levels.</p>
          <p>Page 23, net fee and commission. The trend is certainly positive. We are very happy about the way insurance product and portfolio management fees are moving. We have been working for a number of quarters as you know on this aspect. The collaboration and the integration of both our life insurance companies and of our asset management company with the retail network is improving, we are not yet where we would like to be, but the synergies between those product companies and the distribution network is starting paying and probably the higher draft of people in the future scenarios make the rest.</p>
          <p>So if you go to the page 24, you see that for two quarters now, the net flows of assets under management are in the right direction. The quarterly net fees and commissions from both &#x2013; from asset management products and the bank insurance products are on the right track. And even the breakdown, the portfolios in terms of mutual funds is improving. Where at the end of last year, only less than 20% of the funds had stock components, while we are now at 23, not at all at the level we want and we will reach, but the trend, the difference in direction is what today accounts the most.</p>
          <p>Page 25, trading profit. Trading profit in the fourth quarter with a positive sign, but positive in terms of improvement. It's the best quarter, the last quarter has been the best quarter since the second quarter 2007. All the components that we will see which of them have performed better, best, but all of them are showing good performance. One thing that you have to take into account is that 114 million of benefits come from the sale of our shareholdings in Natixis and in Banca Generali that have been completed during the third quarter. These results that are sustainable with the exception or what I said about Natixis and Banca Generali have been achieved without increasing the risk profile. Actually, we have decreased the average VAR by 16.5%.</p>
          <p>And on page 26, you have the different components. All of them are moving in the right direction. The only real trading activities is the prop trading and treasury that accounts for 19. The customer activity is basically as you know activities with service activities with our customers. And in the capital market and financial asset available for sale you have the 114 million effect I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Page 27, insurance business. Moving in the right direction. New management taking the situation and improving from any point of view the management of these companies. We still have four life insurance companies, but now as you know we have the total control of all of them. And as soon as we get all the authorizations, we will be able to consolidate all the activity in one big effective, efficient life insurance company servicing the retail networks, while we will have a smaller company in integrated in Fideuram.</p>
          <p>Page 28, costs. Cost as usual are under control. If we compare this last quarter with the same quarter of last year, they are down 3%. Cost income is getting close to 51% is not bad, but is certainly a level that is not sufficient to guarantee the best performance, we want to be as soon as possible below the 50% and we will get there.</p>
          <p>Page 29, cost of credit. We have already mentioned this point before. Last quarter has seen a decrease in provisions on loans. And one other point that might be worth stressing is that we have increased the performing loan reserve the so-called generic reserve that is now not far from 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On page 30, you have the details. You see that the increase in substandard loans is by far lower in the third quarter than in the second quarter. And on page 31, you see how these &#x2013; how the different components develop in the different divisions. Nothing really relevant to signal.</p>
          <p>One point we might comment together on page 32, is the sharp fall in new domestic substandard loans in the third quarter vis-a-vis the second quarter, you have it on the left hand side from 4.2 to 2.5 billion. And one other point that is worth noticing is that the new &#x2013; the flow in new doubtful loan is in line with the previous quarter, while we could have expected or someone could have expected a different trend after looking at the new substandard loans that were added in the second quarter. In terms of sectors, the main figures remain concentrated in those industries and sectors that are structurally more exposed to economic cycle and that is a good news.</p>
          <p>Page 23 (sic) [33]. The usual analysis we provide about our portfolio, both in terms of kind of business areas on the left hand side, very well diversified. An important component, the main component of the portfolio is residential mortgages, where these bank &#x2013; these group of banks have a clear area of competence and where we might develop some further success factors in the future. In terms of the breakdown by economic industries and sectors, you have the analysis on the right-hand side.</p>
          <p>Page 34, the last one that I will comment before leaving the stage to all of you, is the divisional analysis. You see that all the divisions are contributing in a very &#x2013; in positive way or very positive way to the overall results. Obviously, the trend in market yields has a different impact on the retail activities and in the corporate activities, but resilience and improvements in all the divisions are very visible. The only figure that might attract your attention is the 1 billion worth of negative EVA coming from the corporate center. The three main elements are excess capital, 200 million; the amortization of acquisition cost, 300 million and the headquarter cost, 400 million.</p>
          <p>No other comments now. I will close the presentation the same way I opened it, and that means by referring to our sustainable profitability approach that luckily enough is growing quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>So, let's wait for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes through from the line of Alessandro Roccati of Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Mr. Passera. Three quick questions from me, the first one is on net interest income. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any idea of what the impact of the cancellation of the overdraft fees on NII? And the second question again on net interest income is a view on the hedging policies. We've seen a decrease of the hedging, the impact in the second quarter was 165 million. That decreased to 50 million in the third quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any outlook for the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is on commissions. Decent performance, you have 1.363 billion. If you look at the breakdowns, the 260 million is coming from current accounts, which is an all-time high. Just wondering whether you have increased fees accounts? Whether this figure is sustainable?</p>
          <p>And finally on the loan loss charge, the corporate division has recorded a very strong decrease. I'm just wondering whether this decrease is sustainable? Whether you see fourth quarter cost of risk in line with the third quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the last part of the question, because I lost your comment on the corporate division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The third question was on the cost of risk in the corporate division, where we've seen a strong decrease in the cost of risk. I'm just wondering whether this decrease is sustainable i.e. whether you see fourth quarter cost of risk in line with the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far a net interest income is concerned, the overall effect in terms of net interest income is 90, while we get 40 million, about 40 million, 42 million more in terms of commission. So the net effect for the whole group is in around of 50, 48, 50 million. We hope we will be able to absorb these effects with the beginning of the New Year.</p>
          <p>In terms of hedging policy, we do not see what you saw. I mean, the effect and the impact of the hedging facilities is even improving in the third quarter. On page 22, you see that there is a higher impact of 50 million, a positive larger impact on the overall results. And the hedging facilities we have established for the Group are very solid at least for the two years we said. That means 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Commissions, there is nothing special. We just increased the control on the application of the commissions. And we don't consider the third quarter there as a special quarter in terms of commissions on current accounts.</p>
          <p>And as far as the flow of non-performing loans in the corporate and investment bank division, as you might remember in the second quarter, we had a couple of big positions being added, both in terms of substandard and in terms of restructured positions. The cost of them was more than &#x20AC;100 million, how to say and how to take any commitment for the future, but obviously we do not expect anything like that in the future quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Going back to the cost of risk in the CIB division, the cost of risk in the third quarter was 68 basis points, which in my view is very low as compared to your competitors. So your view is that this is sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening, Mr. Passera and colleagues. The first question is on loans. On page 21, I see that although average volumes in the retail Italian SMEs are down year-on-year and if I look at quarter-on-quarter, there is a 2.2% fall. So the question is considering that the asset quality is improving, the flows of watch list is slowing down, when do you expect domestic demand to start picking up again, especially on the retail and the SMEs Italy? This is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on cost, you are hoping to achieve a cost income ratio below 50%, you said as soon as possible. And you guided to a negative cost growth, actually a falling cost over the next two years. So the question is can you, I know you are thinking about or doing your industrial plan for next year, but could you explain a bit more for what you can what are the levers at the Group level where you can actually keeping cutting cost, i.e. domestic staff, other costs?</p>
          <p>And then, I'm a bit curious, your biggest domestic competitor is likely also to implement a significant cost-cutting program in Italy starting from next year. This is what we read in the press, so let's see what happens. But I think it's quite likely. So I was wondering if this is going to affect any significant cost-cutting program you might have at the domestic staff level because of basically the two biggest Italian banks being quite aggressive on staffing, cutting staff, if this is the case obviously from your side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question about loans and in particular loans to retail and SMEs customers. Your question is when do we expect the demand of loans from these two segments to start increasing again. Obviously would be a bit arrogant to give a precise answer, but we count on the fact that in the first half of next year, we would see a coming back in terms of loan demands.</p>
          <p>Cost income below 50%, I confirm negative figures for the next two years. The main levers are the consequences of what we have been doing in the last three years. We have already done most of what could have been done in terms of staff reduction. We have done it when the money was available, when the situation was less troublesome than today, and we are happy we did it on time. Now, we are starting getting all the benefits of what we have been doing in terms of IT migration, for example, that we are in an exercise that we are completing, that will be completed by the end of the year. There is certainly some room in the rationalization of the branch networks. There is still room in a number of costs at the Group level.</p>
          <p>There is an effort that is being designed and is being launched in terms of simplification of the whole group that only today after the migration of all the units of the Group to the same IT platform can be performed. And this exercise will cross and will really affect the whole group in terms of number of products, in terms of number of procedures. And we are talking about hundreds of, thousands of pieces of procedures for example. We are talking about the way paper is managed throughout the Group.</p>
          <p>So the kind of exercise we have been preparing in the last few months and that we launched last week with the top 150 managers in Venice, is something that will be very productive in terms of cost reduction. You don't have to believe me just because I'm saying it, but you can agree with me that we never missed the cost reduction target in the last several years.</p>
          <p>The comment you have made on what &#x2013; when a creditor is doing &#x2013; when a creditor is doing, there is nothing I can add and there is nothing I can say actually because we never make any comment on what our competitors are doing. But if the question is, do you expect any negative impact or any negative implications for you because of what other banks might do, the answer is no.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon all. I also have three or four questions. Going back to your interest income impact because of the interest rates decline, I was curious to understand a little bit how the progression is changing because you had a negative impact of 400 million in Q1, then that was nearly 1 billion in Q2 and that nearly 1.7 billion obviously dissolve cumulative in Q3. So, it seems to have actually accelerated in terms of the spread impact, whilst the curve at interest rates actually, the decrease has decelerated. I don't know whether you can explain a little bit more the dynamic there?</p>
          <p>And also I'd be interested, even if Euribor stays flat at this level, should we see a further lag of impact in the fourth quarter and then the improvement even if interest rates that move coming in 2010 and indeed what I'd like to understand is, what happens if interest rates say don't move for a few months, will you still be able to see some improvement there?</p>
          <p>And I was very interested in hearing your comment that actually that negative sensitivity that we have seen will actually be seen again on the positive side when interest rates are going up if you also could reconfirm that?</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; one quick question on Public Finance negative impact of the repricing. If you could just expand on what is the dynamic there? On new NPL flow, could you give us the flow of the comparison that you had in the third quarter 2008? I just looked back at the presentation of the time and I don't seem to see that. And also, you've slightly improved your guidance for the end of this year. For last quarter, you were saying not much below 2008, now you're saying probably above 2008 level. What have changed in this quarter to make it better, I assume that the capital gains you have incorporated at the same, if you could comment on where the underlines are better than you thought in the last quarter? Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's about four questions. One on interest rate sensitivity...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Four chapters of questions, and in each chapter, there are a number of subtitles. But as far as net interest income, the effect you are mentioning is simply nothing acceleration, but the fact that throughout the year you accumulate the effect of the decrease in interest income, the overall interest rates. So, you add not only what is happening, but you added quarter-after-quarter what is happening. So if your question is what happens if the rates remain at the level they are today, probably we will try to &#x2013; we will have a positive effect because all the positive actions we are taking might compensate for the effect I mentioned before. Actually, we expect in the next few quarters those entered &#x2013; those market is to start moving a little bit. But really a little bit because we don't expect market yields to get back to where they were for certainly the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Public finance repricing, there are a number of facilities that are &#x2013; have a fixing at the end of June. And in this case, as you might imagine given the drop in market yields in the previous quarters all of us have been, but not all of us, have been it was not expected, but in terms of step downward all the effect start &#x2013; happened at the end of June.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure I can answer the third question on the non-performing loans flow in 2008, first, because I did not understand and probably if you agree, I will ask my colleague to give you direct figure, but we don't have it with us now.</p>
          <p>And in terms of net income guidance, the main reason why we expect to go a bit &#x2013; at least a bit higher than last year is because we are already there. If you take our net income at the end of September and you add the capital gain, we have already achieved on the sale of the Findomestic. We are already at the level of 2009. So, even, if you are very &#x2013; we are very prudent would have been quite difficult for us that the result will be lower than last year. So, I hope I answered your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean you have done 2.3 billion so far, last year was 2.5 billion, I was just asking the last couple of months what have changed certainly the high profitable to the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, that was the question. I can get back to the main points of the presentation. Commissions have moved better than we expected, cost have gone a little bit better than expected, provisions have gone better than expected, and the total effect of all these points plus the capital gain not yet accounted for put the company at 2.5 billion more or less. So I'm sure that the fourth quarter will have a positive result. And so we will very likely be above what we had last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just to clarify one point on the net interest spread compression, obviously each quarter you accumulate, but the new impact on each quarter has been increasing. My question was, beside that accumulation fact in the fourth quarter, will you see a further increase in the negative impact as a carryover effect or are we going to see a stablization here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi good afternoon. This is Giovanni Carriere from Autonomous Research. The first question is regarding the statement that your adjusted recurring net profit was 816 million in the quarter. Now that obviously includes the capital gains from Banca Generali and Natixis. And my question is, to what extent you are going to be able to have similar capital gains in the next few quarters? And also some write backs what else should we think about the write backs on the structure of credit portfolio, if spreads go back to normal what's the cumulative total positive impact that we may be able to see over the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>And the other question is a bit of a detailed one on slide 31. When you show your total gross impaired loans in international subsidiary banks divisions, you said it's 7.7% in June, 8.3% in September. If I look at last quarter in June, you said that 7.2%. So I was just wondering whether there has been a change of criteria or parameter in the way you measure your NPLs in that division? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, I simply said something that I strongly believe that if you take away what we consider non-recurrent in the trading line in the third quarter given the way the company and the bank is behaving and given the volumes of activity we see, we consider that figure a sustainable one. Obviously, it's not a commitment, but since the question was what the level we expected a sustainable one? We expect that figure to be sustainable.</p>
          <p>The last question as far as I know, there is no change in any criteria in our international subsidiary bank division as far as NPL are concerned. And I will ask my people to get in touch with you to go in more detail because that's what I can tell you as of today.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Per Lofgren from Morgan Stanley. And gentlemen, I have a follow-up on the question on loan growth. When you say here that growth is coming back in the first half of 2010, I was just curious what do you see in your business that gives you this view? Our corporate at this very moment, you draw down less and less, but at the same time, are they asking for larger or expanded credit facilities or what is behind it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said what I said, because we have been organizing in the last few weeks and months a very large number of meetings with entrepreneurs and SMEs representatives throughout the country. And that's the impression we got. Obviously, I'm not talking about the country as a whole. I'm not talking about &#x2013; I cannot say what as a meeting general will do, but given the industry, the sectors where we are concentrated, given the portfolio of customers we follow more in detail and given the scenario forecast we see, we expect a number of industrial districts to start moving again in terms of turnovers in the first quarters of next year. So, that's why I expect what I said. Obviously, there is no certainty in what I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And let me just follow-up on that, with your experience here, I'm pretty sure that everyone around looking at the system at the moment is expecting very subdued loan growth, but just trying to think out of the box, I mean, how big could it be, I mean potentially 1% chance, could we end up with a plus 5%, plus 10%, I don't know, loan growth in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The best way to answer to your question would be not to answer your question. But if you look at the recent histories in the last few years, the bank has always been able to grow in terms of volume three, four, five percentage points higher than the GNP performance. So given that we expect something around zero in terms of GNP, something between three and five might be reasonable expectations, but again I'm trying to be polite with you and not to say I do not know. So, I'm trying to find a reasonable answer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening to everybody. I just have two questions. The first one is on slide nine, the one on the capital, on the second &#x2013; in the second box, you mention the potential benefit of the Basel 2 Advanced, I was wondering whether these 0.4% includes some effect on the pro-cyclicality of Basel 2?</p>
          <p>And the second question I have is on net interest income in Q4, do you expect the hedging you have in place to be able to affect the further decline in short-term interest rates, your eyeball is positioning around 0.7% to have a kind of flat NII Q4 versus Q3? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the 0.4, we have as I thought we had written, but in any case, we have included a negative impact of pro-cyclicality in around between 10 and 15%. As far as the hedging, the hedging effect hard to say what will happen if interest rates further decrease. We expect a flat or it depends on the amount of the decrease obviously, but something flat or something slightly negative only because of a LIBOR possible decrease is a reasonable forecast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. Just two question, again on the NII net interest income, just to simplify is it correct to expect with the visibility that we have right now, NII basically to be flat in Q4 vis-a-vis Q3 enhanced to already bottom out in Q3 and in 2010 gaining momentum depending on what is the level of interest rate of course and volumes, just to simplify and to be clear?</p>
          <p>The second is on loan-loss provision and credit quality, I was wondering if you could give us any more color on the credit quality in Italy, we have understood that you said before that the &#x2013; we should consider loan-loss provision in the second quarter as a peak, but what about Q4, should we expect any seasonality here as we feel last year or may be we should expect loan-loss provision stable?</p>
          <p>And also a comment on 2010, I understand that the visibility is very, very low but maybe you can also comment on what could be the level of loan-loss provision that you would expect the next year?</p>
          <p>The third question is on the performance fees actually, I was wondering if you could quantify the contribution of &#x2013; what could be the contribution of the performance fees in the next quarter, in the fourth quarter in the asset management or maybe if you could not quantify at least say what it was the amount in a good year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have been able to make three impossible questions in a row, that's quite remarkable, but let's see what I can tell you. In terms of net interest income next quarter, we actually we do not expect any further significant decline in the LIBOR rates. So a flattish situation is more &#x2013; is reasonable to expect, that's what I can tell.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we expect volumes to move at a certain point. We don't expect the interest rates to go more down. So then the effects of those two elements would probably move the net interest income in a positive way.</p>
          <p>Credit quality in Italy, again, a very hard to say, we can talk about our self, we expect the guidance we think we can give everybody that the second quarter will remain the peak. And so we will probably not reach the 100 basis points guidance we gave for the whole year, given the level we have reached at the end of the third quarter. Next year will be a difficult year, but we expect it to be less difficult than this year on our portfolio. That does not mean that I'm making any forecast for the economy as a whole, but as far as we understand and we know our customers and our portfolio, we don't expect anything certainly &#x2013; we don't expect anything worse than this year.</p>
          <p>Performance fee in the asset management area will have a very limited effect in the fourth quarter. And it's really difficult to make any estimate on a yearly figure for next year. So, sorry, but I tried to answer two out of three impossible questions and I cannot do more than that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. One, clarification on the hedging, there is a big &#x2013; there is a significant contribution to net interest income, can you give us an indication until when this hedging on net interest income are in place or when they start to mature next year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a clarification on your statement on dividend, you say, it's too early to quantify, I was trying to understand if the issues that is the uncertainty related to the results in the last quarter or in the coming quarter, so it's also depending on the outcome of asset disposal and also from potential changes in capital regulation that can put some constraint on dividend policy going forward?

          <p>The hedging facilities we have &#x2013; will have full effect for this year and next year, then they will start decreasing their effect after 2000 &#x2013; from 2011. Obviously, if you assume interest rates remain at the level they are today, but the whole 2010 will be fully covered the same way 2009 was covered.</p>
          <p>As far as dividend, happily enough for me, you made the questions and you also gave the answers. So there is nothing I can add. We will have to take into account everything, but we really account on the fact that we will restart paying dividends from next year.</p>

          <p>Good evening. I have three questions. The first one is on cost; you said that they will be down both in 2010 and 2011. Are you talking in homogeneous terms or including potential disposals that you can close in the next &#x2013; mindfully in the next quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the coverage, which was down in the mid-teen in the third quarter because clearly loan-loss provisions were down, but impaired loans were up. Why is the coverage decreasing because you have more collateral or there is an &#x2013; is there any other explanation for that?</p>
          <p>And the final question on Delta, we read that you are involved in due diligence just you can tell us if there is any pre-condition to go ahead just to understand the general feature of your involvement in acquisition of Delta Group? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question about cost. Obviously I'm &#x2013; I was referring to the same parameter and I was not trying to mislead you in terms of effect of disposals. Coverage is lightly down because collaterals are significantly higher than what is needed to guarantee the total coverage we want. Delta, the due diligence is under way. The only pre-condition we have set for this negotiation is that our bank should not and will not in any way pay any cost for the past and we are interested only on a performing area of activity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is referring to loan evolution in 2010, I appreciate the outlook that you try to paying for us I understand visibility is a very low also for you. But my question is referring to the starting point because if you look at the lending evolution quarter-by-quarter it seems like in the last quarter, in the last three months there has been the sharpest reduction, we're talking about 2%, nothing dramatic, but it seems like this decline rate is somehow worsening each quarter. So I understand that in 2010 things will definitely look better. But my question is, there is already some sign that at least this declining rate is softening and in last quarter of this year, first quarter of next year, things are kind of normalizing? That was the question.</p>
          <p>And the second one, I would take the opportunity to hear from your voice as far as we read a lot about what will happen on Fideuram, so if you can or as much as you can say in this, if you can clarify a bit, what's the state-of-the-art for Fideuram? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Loan volumes evolution, the fact that the third quarter is showing the strongest reduction is absolutely logical because when the crisis happened until the day it starts moving in the opposite direction, the situation worsened progressively. And worsening this case means simply the demand for credit when production, exports, investments, turnovers go down two digits can only go down. Actually, the trend in our loan volumes are very much the evidence of the fact that there is a large percentage of the Italian industry and economy that still is working quite well because again given that the average decrease in those variables I mentioned before production, investment, exports, and turnover is between 20 and 30 and to sometimes even 40%. Our decreasing volumes is a very positive figure.</p>
          <p>The last question if I understood correctly is, do you already see any sign of a change in the trends in the economy. No, the answer is, no. We can &#x2013; we have the evidence of a sort of &#x2013; a reduction of the decrease, a sort of plateau effect in terms of the trends, but I cannot tell you that we have any evidence of a real change in &#x2013; a change of sign, but we expect it. And on the basis of previous crisis and on the basis of the context we have with hundreds of thousands of companies, we expect it for next year.</p>
          <p>As far as Fideuram, there is really nothing we have to announce. It's a company on which we have been investing a lot in the last few years. The decision of the Board two years ago was to make it as a strong and as independent as possible to enable us to lease it back as soon as possible. So that was the decision we took two years ago and for which we are working very actively. Obviously, other opportunities might arise and we will consider all of them. But as of today, there is nothing we have or we can announce.</p>
          <p>The only thing I want to stress that that company, Fideuram, will benefit from what is happening in the world of savings, in the world of asset management, in the world of independent financial adviser networks because the company is getting stronger and stronger quarter-after-quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I may follow-up on the loan issue. I don't want to seem I'm polite, it is a question regarding let's say big banks, not only Intesa Sanpaolo, if I look at the last industry data in terms of lending evolution, it seems like big banks are somehow showing declining volumes in the last quarters, whereas big &#x2013; whereas the small-to-mid banks are somehow giving flat numbers. So, apart from the picture you provide to us in terms of potential mark revolution, the other question is, do you think that big banks and there were some problem, what is concerning you, is already, say, ready to take this opportunity and to start growing again loans in the last &#x2013; in the next few months?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You are not unpolite. Your question is more than reasonable. As I said, given the trends in all the macroeconomic variables, the almost flat figures we are showing means a very strong commitment with the SMEs work. Just to give you another figure that goes in this direction, our Group by itself gives to SMEs more in absolute terms than all the more, the almost 500, there is more local co-operative banks in our country. So our commitment is very high and what we are not doing is growing subprime in those segments that we do not consider capable to go through the crisis.</p>
          <p>The last part of your question is, are you ready to start lending again? First of all, we never stopped and in the last 12 months, the new long-term facilities we have granted, the corporate word the SMEs and medium-sized companies in Italy are more than 20 billion. And we have &#x2013; we are the bank that has invented a number of new ways to support SMEs in this very difficult period of time. But not only we have 62 billion worth of lines already decided and granted and not yet used by the companies available, but we have already announced that we have more than 30 more billion available if requests, proper request, right to request are made. So, a figure that is not far from 100 billion, obviously we don't expect more than 10% of it to become real in the next month, even if the macroeconomic scenario improves.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. Got a couple of quick questions. The first one refers to the capital management options. If I understand correctly, you are aiming at in getting to a 9.6% Core Tier 1 ratio provided in all actions will be put in place. That actually seems to me very high for your business model. And actually at the same time, you are planning to divest from businesses, which carry a very high ROE. So my question would be you're going to end up with a very strong Core Tier 1 with probably bit lower sustainable return on equity because you are divesting from highly profitable activity.</p>
          <p>Where are you going to redeploy the capital, is that in your commercial retail banking business, CEE, returning it to shareholders. Or on the other words, do you feel like regulators will further distress all banks to get to such a high Core Tier 1 ratio or it's just something that you are aiming at, but probably you are not going to achieve? And the second questions is, what is your sensitivity to arrive in interest rate given your macro hedging let's say rise in 100 basis point in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question is very useful because I probably said something not clear if you think that we said that we want to get to 9.6 Core Tier 1. What we wrote on that piece of paper is only that we have all the instruments and all the resources to get to that level should we need to go there. But actually we do not expect in any respect that our risk profile will require such high level of capital ratios. So we are not going to use, if that assumption is right, we are not going to use all the disposals we theoretically have in our hands.</p>
          <p>And another implicit assumption you are making is that we are divesting from very profitable activity, and we would be forced to invest in lower profitable industries. That's not the case. In fact, in a number of cases, we are divesting not from very profitable activities but from activities where we are not the best owners, while other players are best owners and they're available to pay much more in terms of value of what those assets are valuable today.</p>
          <p>Sensibility or sensitivity, the right figure to look at is the one I mentioned when we analyzed the spread effect on the net interest income because of the very strong drop in market yields. Our bank has lost almost three billion in terms of markdowns. And that's the amount we can try to recuperate when interest rates get back to where they used to be and where they can get back in the next years.</p>

          <p>No, the macro hedging? Obviously, if we get back to the normal interest rate market yields, the macro hedging doesn't work anymore by definition. But you lose one and you get three.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, Mr. Passera. Good evening to everybody. I have a couple of follow-up questions, just to understand better what you said about credit quality. First of all, does it have any impact, the moratorium that we had that have been approved by the government in the last three months, on this strong improvement in the credit quality?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I look back at your coverage ratio in 2008, since Q1 or Q2 including the generic provision, I have a 64%. If I look now at this number, it's in the range of 51, 52%, currently 51 I think. So my question is, should we expect, not in the short term, but should we expect this level to be replaced going forward? Or are you happy with this coverage ratio going forward for the next, I don't know, three, four, five quarters? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the moratorium effect, no effect as you know by the moratorium on the P&amp;L because you don't lose any in P&amp;L.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me answer. The total amount of the moratorium request is today in around of 7,000 cases less than 2 billion, that means less than 0.5% of our portfolio. And the very large part of this moratorium are not very poor quality situations, but there is a mix of many different rating situations.</p>
          <p>So the answer to your question is, the moratorium will not decrease the quality of the portfolio. Actually by helping a number of companies to go through this period that will improve prospectively the quality of our portfolio. And in any case, we are talking about a very minor component of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>As far as coverage is concerned, the decrease in the total coverage comes from a number of factors. The main reason why the total figures went down, the total percentage went down is because a number of positions that have moved to restructured loans do not need for any provision.</p>
          <p>Second effect, we have been working a lot in the last month to increase the collaterals and the other guarantees. So what we need in terms of specific provisions is lower than we used to need in the past. So I cannot use the word happy given that we are talking about non-performing loans, but we feel comfortable with the levels we have reached today.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening, everyone. I still have two questions. You were mentioning your limited exposure on Central Eastern Europe, which is true. But looking specifically at Ukraine and Russia, which are very small in terms of loan exposure, the losses are visible. I was eventually asking if you intended to close some of these implementation, for example, Ukraine where the prospects are very poor and your residual size and exposure are very small?</p>
          <p>And the second question regards your market risk weighted assets, which is potentially are subject to be multiplied by two &#x2013; three, sorry &#x2013; by the regulator end of 2010. The last number I had was 15 billion, which would mean 30 billion more risk-weighted assets on this activity for next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our presence in Central Eastern Europe, we are not going to close any of our operations. We have reduced the risk also in Ukraine, but we believe that there is room for reasonable activity. And the history has not finished not even in that country.</p>
          <p>As far as the impact of the new rules on market risks, and as far as we are concerned, the impact is much, much, much lower than the figure you mentioned. But since the rules and the effect of the rules are still unclear, we don't provide any figure. But we are really talking about a different level of impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. But the market risk-weighted assets are around 15 billion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The only conclusion I can give you is that we believe that the approach we have given and the philosophy we have given the bank is helping our bank to manage the crisis in a very comfortable &#x2013; not comfortable way, but certainly in the right way. We expect our sustainable profitability to keep growing. And we believe that our country, that the country where we have most of our activity, has a lot of growth potential that we will start seeing again from next year. Thank you very much to all of you.</p>
