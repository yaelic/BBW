          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin our presentation for the First Half of 2009. But before I begin, I would like to mention that Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro is not with us today. Jos&#xE9; Luis just one week ago had a small accident and he has broken his leg and he is still recovering. So, we wish him a very fast recovery. Let's hope he will be back with us at the next presentation of results and will continue to give us his wisdom.</p>
          <p>Chairman, Mr. Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n has the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for your attendance here, and those of you who are also here with us through the telephone or the webpage. Today, the presentation will be structured as follows.</p>
          <p>First of all, I'll talk about the major aspects of the first half and then Jos&#xE9; Sainz will get into greater depth in the economic and financial results. And finally, as always we'll have some conclusions and then we'll get into the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>The first semester of 2009, IBERDROLA has shown its capacity to manage any environment and get positive results. And so, in this situation characterized by a strong fall in demand which we hadn't seen in all my years in this business and also a fall in prices as a result of the macroeconomic situation, we have increased EBITDA by 4.7% to &#x20AC;3.43 billion, and 3.4% rise in cash flow, which stands at &#x20AC;2.35 billion and net profit is over 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In this first half of 2009 the main markets have continued to show a growing trend &#x2013; down fall in energy demand with falls that had not been seen since the 70s and are ranging from 7% in Spain to 4% in the United States.</p>
          <p>We have to highlight, however, that in the last month and a half we are starting to see the first signs of deceleration of the fall in demand, especially in Spain. The falls in the month of June and July have moderated to reaching 2 and 3% compared to the 7% in June and if this trend continues, we can &#x2013; it could be a certain improvement, especially in Q4 of this year.</p>
          <p>So even in this environment, the mix of generation in IBERDROLA has maintained production of the company at a same level of last year at 70,000 gigawatts. To this wind energy has grown greater hydro production and recuperation of production with coal in terms of distributed energy. The integration of energy has brought us to 100,000 gigawatts in one semester &#x2013; one half year. That's an increase of 14% compared to June of last year. More than 50% of this amount has been distributed outside of Spain. Most -- more than half is distributed outside of Spain &#x2013; produced and distributed outside of Spain.</p>
          <p>Now, we've also getting &#x2013; delve deeper into different aspects of the company optimizing the situation of the Group here with the short-term and improving its position in the positive change focusing on three fundamental areas, realization effort &#x2013; additional effort into improved efficiency, which we will talk about more later, strengthening of the financial structure of the Group and the proactive management of regulatory aspects with a view to contributing to an improvement in the existing frameworks in the countries where we are carrying out our operations.</p>
          <p>Now beginning with operational efficiency, in the first half of 2009 we reduced the operational &#x2013; net operational cost by 7.5% excluding Energy East, which was not with us last year. To achieve this we've concentrated on businesses that have incorporated recently to the Group, especially ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>Once again, the British company had reduced its cost, which fell by 13% in costs, and their expenses over gross margin are at 29%, 200 basis &#x2013; improvement of 200 basis points. Iberdrola Renovables is also making progress in this sense and in June improved by 8% in the ratio of operational expenses over and &#x2013; per megawatt. In the first quarters we continued to &#x2013; continue making headway, especially in the United States.</p>
          <p>In terms of the balance management, Q2 2009, we carried out different initiatives to strengthen our financial structure. First of all, we've continued with a strict control of our investments, not only applying rigorous profitability criteria but also seeking efficiencies in the field such as procurement, basically in new business. In addition, we've advanced in our divestment plan with operations reaching &#x20AC;1.3 billion, more than half. And so we &#x2013; and we've got capital gains of &#x20AC;223 million in the results of our Q1.</p>
          <p>Also in June, we carried out a capital increase of &#x20AC;1.32 billion in operation. And that we closed successfully in just a few hours. And finally we've increased our liquidity up to &#x20AC;10.6 billion &#x2013; the financials that we'll talk about in just a minute. So all of these measures are clearly visible in the accounts of June 2009. The financial debt has been reduced by more than 2 billion to 26.4 billion and owned funds are now over &#x20AC;28 billion. With that the solvency of the company has been strengthened. The leverage has been reduced to 48% excluding the tariff deficit and the cash flow ratio over debt is at 17.5%.</p>
          <p>In the Q1 results we talked about our determination to defend the interest of our shareholders and the recovery of the tariff deficit and I predicted that the decision would be announced as soon. And on 30 April, the company did announce a series of measures that, as you know, allow for the creation of the totally liberalised markets which were supported by the parliament on the 24th of June. If my memory serves me right, 80% of the consumption is in the market and the remaining 20% is subject to additional tariffs that do not generate a deficit and are not unfair competition in the market. No one could imagine that this would happen after eight years of struggle.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the tariff deficit, it will completely disappear by 2013 with a securitization fund has also been created that will allow for the early payment of the current deficit, with the guarantee of the Treasury. Right now all of the necessary documents for this securitization are at the Council of State after going through the Treasury and the Ministry of Industry and over the next couple of days this subject will be ready to go directly to the Cabinet for approval and therefore implemented in Q4 of this year. There is also a framework for the last reserved tariff and the social bonus for certain groups.</p>
          <p>And finally, and this is also important, Royal Decree 11/2007 has been eliminated. This was the CO2 emission clawbacks because it was more distorting than anything else for the energy generation market.</p>
          <p>So this new framework is an opportunity for IBERDROLA. And the company now is currently making a considered effort to adapt to that and doing that as quickly as possible. Now this effort is in terms of intensifying sales initiatives, focused on the high-end customers and this connection. Right now IBERDROLA is signing more than 25,000 contracts per week and has doubled its portfolio since beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The company is also focused on a series of initiatives to assure orderly transition to the new market. We're carrying out an intense campaign of meetings with public organizations, association &#x2013; consumer associations and the media. We have reinforced our call centers and we've adapted our systems.</p>
          <p>Over the last several months, we have also made significant headway in regulation of two of our main markets in United States and the United Kingdom. In the United State, the tariff review of our distributors in the state of New York continues its course and in this connection, we're working to achieve a framework that allow us to meet the important investment challenges and improve the quality that that state requires.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewable energies, with the regulation implementing the so-called, that has been put into place. This will allow us to obtain around $500 million in 2009. This measure of the North American government is an incentive to our investment in that country which could reach $6 billion between 2009 and 2013. This is in the area of renewables that will give us access to $2 billion in grants over the next several years, and gives a much our value to our pipeline more than 220,000 megawatts in that country.</p>
          <p>In the UK the national climate change strategy has been published and the government speaks of a scenario for 2020 where emissions should be reduced by 34% compared with the 1990 levels. And to do that they'll need to invest very strongly into the IBERDROLA technologies and nuclear and wind energy where they will continue with the remuneration system up until 2037. And this will result in bottlenecks that often happen in terms of permits &#x2013; permits and access to the grid.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; in terms of coal infrastructures, we're working on our technology to capture the CO2 emissions there. The ambition of the government is to achieve these technologies. And they will contribute 40% to production in 2020 compared with the 15% in 2008. So the growth will come by renewable energies that will account for 30% of the production by the end of this period. Also the document also is going to improve the electric grids. This is very important in the UK which are now being &#x2013; the regulatory framework is being reviewed and this reflects the need for strong investment in the UK.</p>
          <p>Results from the first half of 2009 reflect &#x2013; reflects its positive impact of the management effort that I have been talking about. So in June of 2009 EBITDA, the Group reached &#x20AC;3.43 billion with an increase of 5% despite the fact, as you know, the new businesses of the Group which contribute greatly to this growth are very seasonal. Also in 2009, the pound has suffered devaluation compared to the euro and has an effect on the results of the Group. So the results of the management of the different businesses in local currency reflect a growth, which is close to actually 10% if you work with a currency change.</p>
          <p>So the solidness of IBERDROLA is a result of the strategic &#x2013; of the strategy of the Group as you can see in its portfolio. The increase in the relative weight of the regulated and renewable business, which are less exposed the effects of change in economic cycles have allowed us to continue improving our results. Even our liberalised business has &#x2013; has been &#x2013; has &#x2013; had only a very limited decline. Thanks to the efficiency in Spain and the UK I early spoke about.</p>
          <p>And finally, cash flow has grown by 3.4% reaching &#x20AC;2.35 billion. And net profit is over 1.5 billion in a half of year that in comparative terms affected by the capital gains of the Q1 of the pervious year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll give the floor to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, who will get into greater depth in the different financial issues.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Chairman. Good morning. As is our want, we will not tell you about the more salient aspects of the profit and loss account for the first half. And then we'll look at the main points in our main areas of business and I'll wind up with an analysis of the Group's financial situation.</p>
          <p>It should be said that this account has been affected by integrating Energy East into the Group in the first half of the year that had an impact on the figures, we'll be telling about.</p>
          <p>As the Chairman has said, EBITDA is up 4.7% to &#x20AC;3.4 billion but I would like to stress that if you exclude Energy East EBITDA is falling by only 2.4%, which shows the strength of IBERDROLA'S business model in an environment where there is very strong falls in demand and in tariffs.</p>
          <p>Income is up 9%. In Spain, there is a loss in demand and in prices. I'll go into further detail later. We've registered Ordinary Regime production decrease of only 3.3%, which is compared very favorably with the system as a whole, where the fall is around 15%. Despite the fall in the value of the pound sterling, ScottishPower has become the component to the Group, giving us the greatest part of our growth. This despite depreciation of 17% in the value of pound sterling, 31% of our income comes from ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>Renewable business, growth 1.1% up to &#x20AC;948 million. In Latin America, our business has fallen by 27% due to tariff reviews in Brazil. Non-energy down 14% due to slowdown in business &#x2013; in the real estate business. Energy East is providing &#x20AC;1.7 billion, 13% of the total of income. As to procurement, has grown &#x2013; of energy has grown 9% to &#x20AC;7.4 billion. ScottishPower, 38% of the total; energy is 13%. The Spanish business is 26% with a downcrease of 7% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin is expanding 10.9% to &#x20AC;5.4 billion. Traditional energy business in Spain, 37% of this gross margin, up to &#x20AC;2.002 billion, 21% is liberalised business and 16% in the regulated sector. Renovables and the international power mix explain the change in the makeup of the Group's gross margin. Renovables or renewables are supplying 15%; ScottishPower 20%, which is &#x20AC;1.055 billion, Energy East 13%, Latin America is 9% of our gross margin, as I say. If you take the basic margin, which includes the net effect arising from emission rights, it is up by 8.9%, 2 percentage points less than the gross margin I told you about. This is due to the down &#x2013; to the fall in prices of CO2 rights.</p>
          <p>The gross profit includes the negative impact from the emission rights consumed, &#x20AC;242 million, 69 million in Spain and 173 million in ScottishPower. The basic profit margin can be achieved &#x2013; can be figured out by adding the gross margin to the positive effect of &#x20AC;144 million coming from free rights received, 55 million in Spain and 89 million in ScottishPower. These are put into the account as less expenditure.</p>
          <p>The operative &#x2013; the net operative expenditure is up 19% to &#x20AC;1.776 billion. If we exclude Energy East, which is 22% of the total, then this operative net expenditure is down 7.5%. The main drivers in this drop in our net operative expenditure is staff including Energy East, 4% down to &#x20AC;1,776 million.</p>
          <p>Our national energy business is level because we have <mark type="inaudible" /> (18.02) restraint. Renovables is up only 2.4%. I should also underscore the downturn of 21% in net staff expenditure in ScottishPower, which shows how efficient they've been in decreasing such expenditure. And this is 8% this effect, if you rule out the exchange rate effect. In Latin America, there is a downturn of 24% in staff costs due to efficiency, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Our external energy services, excluding Energy East, our down 10.6% to &#x20AC;702 million. There are certain non-recurrent effects accounting for 70 million. If we exclude insurance, et cetera, if we exclude them, the reduction will be 1.6%. Levies, up 4.3% to &#x20AC;385 million. Energy East accounts for &#x20AC;99 million. This is compensated for by a lower provision for a clawback of emission rights, which is &#x20AC;98 million less than in the first half of 2008 due to decrease in the price of these emission rights. This provision covers both assigned and non-assigned facilities.</p>
          <p>It has to be underscored also the Royal Decree Law 11/2007 has been announced (19.38). So it is not going to have any effect as of the 1st of July 2009. With regard to IBERDROLA, most of this provision for a clawback in emission rights corresponds to non-assigned &#x2013; to power plants that have not been assigned any emission rights.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA would have grown 13% if we were to exclude the impacts beyond the normal development of the business, which shows that business is developing well despite the market environment.</p>
          <p>We've eliminated &#x20AC;71 million of non-recurring expenditure, including the net operative expenditure of the company, when it comes to the heading, Other Operating Income. But we've also got accountancy adjustments to the tune of 121 million, 99 million coming from the effect of transferring results of Energy East to U.S. GAAP and then transferring from GAAP to the IFRS standards and 22 million due to recalculating the <mark type="inaudible" /> (20.47) of renewables were dealt with.</p>
          <p>There is also the exchange rate which cost us 123 million from the EBITDA, and a mark-to-market effect cost us 82 million. But <mark type="inaudible" /> we hope that IFRS and the exchange rate for the pound sterling will work in our favor in the future and this mark-to-market effect will change in the future also; that's to be hoped.</p>
          <p>The Group's EBIT is down 1.2% to &#x20AC;2.338 billion due to an increase of 20% in the depreciation and amortization heading to 1.097 billion. Amortizations, D&amp;A, &#x20AC;1.066 million, including &#x20AC;104 million from Energy East; PPA, 110 million. The Group's financial result is up 28.3% to minus &#x20AC;605 million. This is due to the greater expenditure and the debt, which is up 44%. This is a result in part of the accumulated tariff deficit and the debt &#x2013; indebtedness associated with the purchase of Energy East. We've been able to expand the spreads on our debt. We have taken advantage of drops in interest rates, and we've brought about a drop in the financial cost of 50 base points.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax is down 20% to &#x20AC;1.981 billion. When it comes to non-recurring results, at June 2009, we have capital gains of &#x20AC;223 million, largely a result of selling 10% of our holding in Gamesa and disinvesting from energy assets in Chile. We have not included the sale of regasification plants. This is 320 &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;312 million less than the figure for June 2008. And the results for equivalents are 25 million, which is 34 million less than in June 2008. This is largely due to Gamesa. But as in June 2008, they have made a contribution to non-recurrent 25 million as a result of the sale of its solar energy business.</p>
          <p>Net profit, down 23% to &#x20AC;1.506 billion, and this drop is somewhat more than the drop in the profit before tax, 20.4%, due to the greater effective tax rate, 21.1%, in comparison with 19.0% in the first half of 2008. But as the Chairman has stressed, we have an increase in operative cash flow of 3.4% up to &#x20AC;2.355 billion.</p>
          <p>Now the highlights of our different business areas, and I'll start with the liberalised business in Spain. There our results have been affected by the following points. As I said, our production is down by only 3.3% in an environment where the demand in general has dropped considerably, 6.4%, and system production has dropped 14.9%. But our production dropped as I say only 3.3%. Increased hydro production 7%, compensating for the fall in nuclear production minus 8%. We should stress also that there has been a fall of 35% in the average Spanish pool price to &#x20AC;40 per megawatt-hour. But our combined cycles are based upon mid merit. So we are getting higher prices than you can see on this slide, because the mid merit is a higher price, and we are getting higher prices also for <mark type="inaudible" /> complementary service markets.</p>
          <p>Now, the unit average cost of our conventional thermal fuel is down 13% to &#x20AC;46.7 per megawatt-hour. This includes gas where we have a time delay of three to six months. So there'll be a greater effect later on this year and also includes the decreased cost of CO2. EBITDA of our Spain liberalised business sector is down 7.2% to &#x20AC;719 million as a result of the increases in generation costs. We have lower prices and lower demand, which was related to that. And against that backdrop, our net operating cost is &#x2013; has been contained. It is a growth of 5%. And the turnover includes 59 million of repaid capacity payments, which have been compensated in part by the 96 million put into the account due to clawback for CO2 emission rights.</p>
          <p>Now as to the perspectives for the liberalised part of our business activities in Spain, there are a number of different factors which will give rise to different kinds of effects. Firstly, in the second half of the year, there'll be no more CO2 clawbacks. And secondly, with regard to the demand and price environment, whereas there has been a decrease in both demand and prices in the first half of this year, it is to be expected that by the fourth quarter we should see increase &#x2013; we should see signs of recovery in both demand and tariffs.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of our regulated sector in Spain is up by 9.1%. This improves the &#x2013; upon the result of our gross margin, which was only 8.7%, despite the fact that the net operating expenditure is up. There's been expenditure due to hurricanes, tornadoes in particular. This increase in the gross margin up to &#x20AC;842 million is a reflection of the increase of regulated tariffs under 2009.</p>
          <p>Installed capacity, 10,000 megawatts, an increase of 26% year-on-year. But our capacity to produce has grown 24% to 10.585 gigawatt-hour. Average load factor, 27%. Efficiency has increased, because our cost per megawatt is down 8.2% and the average price has come down 15%. But in the second half of the year, there is prospectives of improvement, because there has been a coverage agreement for Spain since July 2009 for a period of two years at a price of &#x20AC;46 per megawatt hour. And we have to add to that the bonus, which should give us an estimated price of between 85 and &#x20AC;90 watts &#x2013; euros per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Now, I have to stress the way &#x2013; different way in which PTC should be accounted for in the first half of 2008 and through the first half of 2009, which means that basically EBITDA has been increased 6% rather than 1.8% that we've reported. The brute &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; gross margin is up 6.3% to &#x20AC;828 million. If we were to use homogeneous accounting standards, we'll be talking about a growth of 10% there. I should again stress the containing effect we've had on our staff expenditure.</p>
          <p>With regard to ScottishPower, in local currency, its gross margin was &#xA3;1.021 billion, up 11% in homogeneous terms, despite decreased production and demand in the general environment. The net operating cost improved by 13%. This net operating cost in local currency was down 3%. EBITDA ScottishPower, excluding the impact of the MtM, &#xA3;737 million, the 135 million due to the exchange rate variation means that EBITDA is down 7.7% in euros to &#x20AC;829 million.</p>
          <p>More details now on the ScottishPower as follows. Production down 4.9% due to less use of combined-cycle plant used highly flexibly. Energy transmitted down 5.3%, in line with the mean decrease in the UK, only limited impact on income. Better domestic rates in retail compensated for also by an increase in the average cost of fuel.</p>
          <p>I'd also stress, efficiency and synergy well managed in this business, 75% of the objectives were determined after the acquisition of this company. So, the ratio between net operating cost divided by brute &#x2013; gross profit is increasing by 31%, or rather from 31% in the first half of '08 to 29% in the first half of '09.</p>
          <p>Energy Wholesale &amp; Retail is something that has contributed &#x20AC;730 million. Energy Retail has contributed &#x20AC;415 million and Canada and Corporation provide &#x20AC;21.4 million of the remaining EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Energy East has made a contribution of &#x20AC;235 million to the Group's EBITDA under IFRS standards. Energy East business is highly seasonal, because it makes 65% of its turnover in the first and fourth quarters of the year. We sell less energy in quarters two and three, because the climate's better than &#x2013; which is when we carry out maintenance and the net operating cost goes up. Furthermore, this business is affected by accountancy corrections as a result of transferring from U.S. GAAP to IFRS. This has had a negative effect of &#x20AC;98.6 million in this half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now using the tariff assets under NIIF standards means that this volatility in energy, it accounts if you use a cash basis. The basic effect is that price of sales to the end customer have come down, whereas provision costs have not done the same. Now this is &#x2013; this difference is known as NBC, non-bypassable charges. That's accepted by the regulator for future tariffs, but not under U.S. GAAP &#x2013; or rather, it is accepted under GAAP, but not under IFRS. And this will be charged in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, there has been a fall of 1.7% to &#x20AC;423 million, that's lower than that registered gross margin of 6.8%, that thanks to the positive development of net operating cost which reduced by 25%, in line with the efficiency management carried out by the Group. In this half, Brazil and Mexico have opposite effects. Brazil contributed 231 million to EBITDA, a fall of 11% affected by the tariff review for the period 2008-2012, a reduction which is called Parcel B with a 12.1% in Coelba and 6.5% in Cosern and 8% in Celpe.</p>
          <p>And then a slight improvement of demand of the distributors 1.2% on average and a negative effect of the exchange rate with a devaluation year-on-year of the Brazilian real of 13%. Mexico has contributed 192 million to EBITDA and the effect by &#x2013; had a positive effect of exchange rate with the year-on-year with the dollar of 13% and the business also has been behaving better than a year ago due to the good yield of the plants.</p>
          <p>And EBITDA, non-energy EBITDA has fell by 33.6% reaching &#x20AC;140 million due to the lower activity of the real estate business. Engineering has a portfolio of &#x20AC;2.7 billion and includes the recent project that was just won in Lithuania, &#x20AC;328 million. And we have invoicing of &#x20AC;622 million and continues developing its activity in a satisfactory manner despite the deceleration in the world economy.</p>
          <p>In terms of financing, beginning with the tariff deficit in the balance sheet, in the first half of 2009, the tariff insufficiency accumulated for IBERDROLA through December 2008 was &#x20AC;2.36 billion. Now during the first half of 2009, we obtained funds of &#x20AC;132 million and a new tariff insufficiency was generated for IBERDROLA of &#x20AC;642 million. So at the close of the first half of 2009, the tariff insufficiency is &#x20AC;2.87 billion.</p>
          <p>However, within the framework &#x2013; of the regulatory framework that we &#x2013; the Chairman mentioned, there has been important changes in terms of possible payment of this through Royal Decree 6/2009 and will have a positive effect on the balance sheet and debt &#x2013; Group debt. So we are working now with the &#x2013; with those deficits. And this should &#x2013; we should have effects of this by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, continuing with the analysis of the financial situation and the &#x2013; those significant improvement in net debt, which &#x2013; for this second &#x2013; Q2 of this year, I think end of the Q1 the net debt was &#x20AC;28.5 million. The net cash flow before divestments increased by &#x20AC;1 billion. Once again, the sale of the regasification plant announced for a price of &#x20AC;200 million will not to be &#x2013; will not be paid until the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>There is also a capital increase of &#x20AC;1.3 billion. The tariff deficit increased by &#x20AC;240 million in the quarter and cash flow generated has covered the investments without having any impact on the debt. So we've decreased the debt from &#x2013; more than 2 billion, and right now we stand at &#x20AC;26.44 billion. Until the end of year we hope to continue with the divestment plan announced in Q1 to end up with a net debt between 25 and &#x20AC;26 billion.</p>
          <p>Our own funds at the close of the first half of 2009 were &#x20AC;28.2 billion, greater than the 26.1 billion at the close of the &#x2013; of Q1 after the effect of the capital increase and the increase corresponding to the non-distributed assets and this 200 in capital gains and divestments. The leverage therefore is at 48.4%, 3.8 points lower than the 52.2 that we had at the end of March. If we include the tariff deficit, the leverage will be at 51%, three points below last &#x2013; this time last year.</p>
          <p>The rest of the financial ratios also have improved significantly in line with the commitments required by the rating agencies. FFO over net debt has improved by 17.5% and the RCF over net debt improved to 12.2%. These ratios are within the ranges A3/A that are required by the agencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of the breakdown of debt by financing resources, we have proper diversification. In terms of the debt structure by currencies and where the percentage of the debt minimizes leverage and ratios and helps with solvency. And so the debt in euros is 46%, and in pounds and dollars around 25% of the debt.</p>
          <p>In terms of the debt by interest rates, in the first half of 2009, we've increased to 47.5% in variable interest rate of the total amount of debt. We should also point out our liquidity, right now we have &#x20AC;10.6 billion of liquidity in this &#x2013; available lines and this covers all of the needs for liquidity from 2009 and part of 2010.</p>
          <p>And to finish up, I am going to talk about the maturity of the debt. The average maturity rate is almost six years. And now the Chairman will conclude this presentation with a presentation of results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Jos&#xE9;. Having looked at these results of the first half I would like to very briefly get into the perspectives of the Group for 2009. And we need to differentiate very clearly here the two quarters that we have left in this year, given the seasonal nature of the new businesses and the evolution of the different energy variables and macroeconomic variables in terms of demand will be characterized by certain moderation while as from October there will be greater recovery due to seasonal factors, as well as the consolidation of the reactivation of energy consumption that we're starting to see.</p>
          <p>Also, production will also be affected by demand and by the &#x2013; and by distribution typical of wind energy throughout the year, meaning Q3 is greater and Q4 are greater than the first half of the year. So the wholesale prices will be less &#x2013; lower as is normal and will recover as from October.</p>
          <p>And finally, the measures taken to reduce the volatility of the markets will mean that impact of the raw materials market will be reduced compared to the previous years. And we have to look at the positive effect that this chapter had on Q3 last year and had that positive effect at the end of the year. So with all of this, we expect that the results for the end of the year will reach &#x2013; will have a good operational growth and stability in net gains.</p>
          <p>And just to conclude, the figures that we presented today show the commitment that we have with the comprehensive integration of the company with all of the macroeconomic situations. So in the first half of 2009, especially just over the last several months, we've implemented series of initiatives focused on optimizing our results and preparing the company for improvement in this situation, with increased efficiency through control &#x2013; our cost control measures focused on our business in the UK and in Renewables. And over the upcoming months we'll continue delving deeper into these and will implement other new programs, especially internationally and especially in the United States as I mentioned at the beginning.</p>
          <p>We've also shown our financial flexibility which has allowed us to improve our balance sheet through three different measures. Strict investment control and divestment of non-strategic assets and capital increase. And with that, our financial structure shows ratios that we think will allow the Group to proceed very comfortably within our credit rating.</p>
          <p>And finally, and to guarantee sustainable growth, IBERDROLA has put its energy on its new businesses in the United States where there are magnificent expectations and very good aid as well. In this sense, the administration, the American administration has fostered our investments in the electricity sector to improve the economic situation there. So in this connection you can all be rest assured that the men and women working in this company are going to continue working pretty hard to maximize our results and benefit of all shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now is the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Now we're going to start with the questions from the room here. Please raise your hand and we'll be happy to pass you a microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning from the Citi Group. Just two or three questions. The first with regard to the tariff that you talked about working on this in Q4. And we're still at 600 some million, so your hope is to completely eradicate this, or will that also go into 2010?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with the PPA announced yesterday with Iberdrola Renovables. I'd like to know what was the rationale behind this contract at a &#x20AC;46 per megawatt price with the prices that we see on the forward market in Spain.</p>
          <p>And also, I would like to ask a question with regard to generation. Can you give us a little bit more information or the liberalised activity and give us an update on the forward markets &#x2013; the forward sales in the different markets in terms of percentages of production. And what price levels are you signing these agreements at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the deficit that I talked about before, the first thing I'd like to mention, I'd like to first apologize because I said that the Royal Decree, it wasn't 30, I think it was six days later than my prediction, so I apologize for that.</p>
          <p>The second thing, as I mentioned before, right now the Treasury has come up with the Royal Decree for this. It's sent this to the Ministry of Industry, they have validated it. So right now it's going to go to the cabinet and the Council of State will look at it -- to look in this through an emergency procedure. So I think in a week or ten days the Council &#x2013; State Council will return this. So the government cabinet, in August, if they meet, can approve that. So that means that everything will be ready to set up the committee to deal with this by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So the greatest expectations that we have right now is that before the end of year all of that money will be declared. Then these funds will be &#x2013; will start out for 10 &#x2013; amount of &#x20AC;10 billion and this will also cover the funds from 2009. But the recent measures that the government has taken as from July 2 by approving, I think it was the <mark type="inaudible" /> raising the fees in July. This means that the maximum deficit for this year will be the amounts that are contained in that Royal Decree. So these are in line with what was passed by Parliament about decreasing tariff deficit. So expectations, everything could be finished up this year. Everything is being implemented and so things are moving as fast as they possibly can.</p>
          <p>Just in a few words, I mentioned this yesterday and I will reiterate. In the last meeting that we had in the presentation of results of renewables, there was an investor who asked us why we had PPAs in renewables around the world and here in Spain we had this volatility where we had much better elements to get certain costs in renewables, everything having to do with the deviations around &#x20AC;4 that it was costing &#x2013; costing this management. We could have benefited from those 3 or &#x20AC;4 that we had on those deviation costs and that's what we're &#x2013; that's what we're trying to do.</p>
          <p>So once again, the investors and analysts, you have very good ideas and make us think. So we do have PPAs in the U.S. and Europe, in the UK and in Spain the question was, why don't we? Since when you have the best conditions to be able to resolve this issue, especially with the cost, the Group was losing 3 or &#x20AC;4 that third parties were taking. So the analysis &#x2013; a thorough analysis was done by our renewable and IBERDROLA teams and I'm sure they did their work very well. They've analyzed the forward prices with all the limitations that we have there, but there are &#x20AC;4 that were lost. That's the first major message.</p>
          <p>The second message is that price of 46 is not a theoretical price. But for me, this is the average price of energy sales between 2007 and 2008. We're talking about a price over the last two years that we applied for the futures. And the price of the next two years has a review formula. If the prices go very much higher in renewables then we'll benefit, if they go below, renewables, then we'll be a little bit penalized. But the model is basically on those &#x20AC;4 that were lost.</p>
          <p>And the other issue is that we were seeking a price that was as objective as possible and most objective is the average price of the last two years and the forward price that you can talk about. <mark type="inaudible" /> why don't you mention limits in this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These prices I think are in line with the forward prices for 2010 and we have to bear in mind that this will also apply to renewables. As the Chairman said, this is part of the negotiation and this has &#x2013; I think it's been the fairest negotiation. But the forward prices for 2010 around &#x2013; are around &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour in Europe and in Spain they are at 46, &#x20AC;47.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question, levels of sales forward, I think you're talking about Spain are you? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2009 could be summed up as follows. It's practically all sold already. So, if you like, we are cautioned against changes on the spot market. It's not actually truly all sold, for various reasons. There was around 5 million megawatt hour from Renovables, which we still have to manage and place. That's one point. That's less than 5% of our total energy available.</p>
          <p>And then there's another point. There's some power which we reserve due to volatility in some of our main sources such as hydro power and we also need reserves to sell at last minute to certain sectors of the market, or to sell in the medium term, which can be very profitable. So we've always got a little bit &#x2013; we're always long on generation.</p>
          <p>Turning to tariffs, well they're of course a bit less than a quarter ago. Around 130 or 140% of the cash prices in fact. Certainly, it's adequately above &#x2013; comfortably above 50%. Next question please? Javier Garrido?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Javier Garrido from Morgan. I have a number of questions. Firstly, on your liberalised segment in Spain. You said you expect demands to pick up in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to shed some light on that. Are you saying that you expect demand to start declining less fast, or to actually pick up? Do you expect there to be actual growth, or just a slowdown in the decrease? And pursuant to that, as to the price figures of the last couple of months, as you said, demand has started to drop less fast over the last couple of months but the forwards prices haven't reflected that. So in your opinion, what would it take for the forward energy prices on the Spanish markets to reflect, to suggest more a positive trend in demand?</p>
          <p>Second question regarding ScottishPower. What are your perspectives with regards to the marketing margins at ScottishPower? As the hedge factors change on the British market, do you think there will be change in the retail prices and the prices to the end user?</p>
          <p>Third question regarding Energy East. There's been a whole series of reviews in the regulatory framework of recent months. They have been looking for lower ROEs than expected. Do you think that that will have an impact on New York and the regulations there, or is it going to be a one-off? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll prefer to answer the first question. Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your question about marketing margins and direction of prices in the UK, I think that what you're going to &#x2013; what you have seen over the course of the summer is a couple of small price reductions, one from British Gas, one from E.ON. The fact that there have been no subsequent competitor moves would suggest that actually probably on an energy basis, they are where they should be.</p>
          <p>I think the more important underlying factor is the cost of the increasing number of government programs that we see coming through. The carbon emissions reduction target, which is ramped up year-on-year and needs to be recovered. The increase in the distribution costs that <mark type="inaudible" /> is talking about in terms of the distribution price control. So I think the issue is less about where prices are going in a downward direction. I think it's more about the recovery of an increasing proportion of our energy costs that come from these government initiatives, the carbon reduction targets and the rewiring of the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, on the liberalised segment, I'm looking at the figures for the last quarter of last year. There, there was a 3% decrease vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous year and now in June/July 2009 we're looking at a lesser drop year-on-year. So if that goes on, we're looking at positive results vis-&#xE0;-vis last year. Regarding Energy East -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In United States with the regulation, how are you expecting it's going to happen in the next few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Chairman. The New York refilings will be filed in September, middle of September. And to the question of lower ROEs, the trend in the northeast section of the United States has been to lower ROEs, that is true. However, what we have seen in the state of New York recently, there's an increase in the ROEs. They were in the 9% range about a year ago, two years ago and recently they've gone through 10%. So we are cautiously optimistic that the ROE general refilings will be higher than what we've been seeing in New York over the past year or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What about Connecticut and emission?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Connecticut is &#x2013; we've had some disappointment in Connecticut and we're in the process of looking at appealing the two decisions that we recently received and also refiling as quickly as we can. And refiling for ROEs in excess of 10%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In case you don't know, that's Wes Von Shack, the CEO of Energy East.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the next question in the room will be by Alexander Hill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexander Hill. I have two questions please. Firstly, again about prices or tariffs in Spain. If you look at the spot prices around 33 or 34 right now, I'd like to ask what factors could increase those spot prices on the Spanish market? And then secondly, I'd like to identify what IBERDROLA'S exposure is going to be to spot prices? You have said that's been decreased, could you put a figure on that please? Second question on 2010 at the presentation on Renovables yesterday, you gave us some perspective on next year. Could you do the same for IBERDROLA as a Group please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Group on 2010, we haven't started. I don't have any figures. We haven't started looking at those perspectives. They're not being brewed up yet. So November at the earliest. On the first question, Paco? (57.46)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for exposure, as I said earlier, it's around &#x2013; it was close to nil, because what we haven't sold or reserved to sell, we'll sell on the complementary markets where the prices we get are totally different. They're far higher than the spot prices. So I'd say that our exposure to spot prices in 2009 is almost nil. In any event, if the price really is low, it might suit us to stop our means of production, shut them down, and purchase from those who are irrationally selling at these really low prices. But that would only be a marginal effect, really.</p>
          <p>As to what it would take to increase the prices, well prices. Thermal prices were a response to demand and to the production under the general regime and a special regime, basically. And they also depend upon commodities' prices and on the level of competition spreads, et cetera. And if you take that whole mass of factors, we're looking at the second half of this year, and we reckon that the prices will be where they are now. Although in the press you can see reports of 34, when that's adequately weighted, that's around 40.</p>
          <p>The point is that most of our production has been sold up elsewhere than on the spot market. Two clients who are of course paying higher prices than on the spot market, and when the spot prices go up to 75, these clients will be paying less. So as always the spot price is a benchmark, the forward price is another benchmark, but in practice each kilowatt hour is paid for at the price that the client and the vendor feel appropriate.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Virginia Sanz, Deutsche Bank. Alejandra has asked about this, I'd like more details. Have you got forward sales for 2010, so as to decrease your exposures in the spot market in 2010, which I think we're interested in right now? And in the first quarter, you gave a certain guidance as for 2010. You said you might be around 10% short of the 3500 you'd forecast. I'd like to ask whether you can confirm that that's still the case, or are you going to review that in November, depending upon progress on the market?</p>
          <p>And also I'd like to ask whether you could estimate what the impact of the social bonus might be in 2010? Could you also give us some guidance on &#x2013; about 1.2 billion of assets you've got pending, selling between now and the end of the year? There's been a lot of talk about relations with nuclear colleagues, not just in the UK but elsewhere. What's IBERDROLA'S strategy regarding nuclear?</p>

          <p>Paco, tell us something about forward sales for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've already told them...</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tell them again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on forward sales, I'm sorry, I'm not very refined. I am an engineer and I don't really understand too much about forward sales. I'm sure there are mystics out there who can tell you. What I can tell you is that in &#x2013; we've just begun on 2010, and around 30 terrawatts hour have come to us as a &#x2013; under the tariff of last recourse. And secondly, the best clients have not yet closed off their consumption for the year.</p>
          <p>And we're going through this very briskly now, but it's still July 2009, so most of the electricity for next year hasn't been sold. But I can tell you that we've sold around 20 terrawatts hour at similar prices to this year. But as our financial director has said, the prices for next year are around 48 and we've got 25,000 contracts per hour, that's another 25 terrawatts a year. And I think that we may have made great progress by the end of the year, and by this time next year we may have a deficit &#x2013; or by the end of this year, we may have a deficit so as to be able to supply those 30 terrawatts hour under the tariff of last resort. I don't know if the Chairman wishes to continue?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On nuclear power, I'll leave strategic issues to the Chairman and I'll say that the other place we're exploring various possibilities is Romania. There's two plants of Canadian technology with which we have no experience and we'd be very interested in participating in those two plants. There's a consortium including most &#x2013; no, all of the nuclear utilities in Europe, I'd say. Well, our holding in that consortium is a very low, 9 or 10%, and we're looking at the economics and the technology of taking part in nuclear production in Romania. I'll leave, as I say, the Chairman to talk about strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think you've put it very well. On 2010, as I said earlier, we're still looking at what the commodity prices will be for next year. We think demand will develop, but we're going to have to see which way and how it will develop over the next few months. One or two months' change is not &#x2013; in trend is not sufficient to forecast next year, so the commodities' prices plus demand scenario will give us an impression of net prices for next year. As I said, we've got major programs underway to cut costs, and in the UK that cost-cutting program even has a name, it's called Cobra and we'll have to see what happens in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We only just bought Energy East, that was just the other day practically, so to speak, wasn't it? And the ScottishPower has been two years. So in the States we'll start to take measures to cut costs, but right now they're still on the back of an envelope. So we'll see. We don't have a global picture of investment in the Group, so I can't answer. In March, we give very general, ballpark figures. I'd like to give you more precise figures once we've got the scenarios defined.</p>
          <p>As to the social bonus, I think it's only around 3% of the total energy we sell and Paco correct me if I'm wrong. So it will depend upon the tariffs for next year, but on the face of it, when it comes to the volume of energy sold under the social bonus, it's really quite limited. So unless the prices zoom up, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact. And I think that under the social bonus, the price is around 60 or 70, is it?</p>

          <p>Around 40. So that's more or less market prices. So it's going to depend upon future prices, but the point is that the volume is low. As to selling assets, we're going to continue. We're looking at a number of points. You've had some surprises in the past and you may have some more in the future, when you see what we do.</p>
          <p>And nuclear, Paco said we're focusing quite clearly on the UK, in the UK there's a clear decision in that direction, and <mark type="inaudible" /> is negotiating with the national authority there for a number of sites. And with the deal we have with Scottish and Southern and Suez Gaz de France, it's working just fine. We're looking for a site at reasonable cost price. We don't want to pay over the market price. I don't know if Pedro wishes to add something?</p>

          <p>We have several different things on the table right now. We're taking some decisions over the next several months. From here to the end of the year, we will have some real estate divestments. In terms of the valuation of our real estate assets, according to Richard Ellis that does a valuation every six months, we're practically at the same level as one year ago. We've maintained a very careful policy, so there is no significant impact on our portfolio of real estate.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. If there are no more questions from the room, let's go to the telephone questions. The first is Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, yes. Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch. Good morning. Many of my questions were already answered. Just two quick ones. One has to do with a load factor of the cycles in Spain with a very good results compared to what we've seen in other markets and good volumes. Could you update us on the spot market in this environment of prices and the review program of the supply contract and do you think these load factors will be sustainable for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second has to do with the dividend to this capital increase. Could you tell us what your ideas, in terms of the dividend for this year, if you'll maintain the same payout as last year in absolute terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, would you talk about the spot spread please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The load factor of the combined cycles, as the speaker said, around 30, 37% and has been better than the decrease in our competitors. We haven't undergone that same decrease. In terms of gas, everything has been sold for 2009. All of our commitments are sold, therefore. We'll have to see if we have an opportunity to buy on the spot market to resell, but the contractor gas has been sold. In terms of the spreads, this year and next year are not good years for thermal energy. The spread &#x2013; the strict spread, I'm talking about the margin, the variable margin for management, is around four, &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour. And then when we bear in mind the fixed revenues, it improves a little bit, but this is a low spread that justifies its operation.</p>
          <p>But it does not allow us to recover investment with all the volume that should be recovered. And it is true that the lower demand is &#x2013; thermal production is suffering this lower demand in terms of construction that's within the prices, at two-thirds of our competitors and more than half of the investments are recovered. This gives us a certain state of calm. Of course, we have to be careful. But around 25 or 30 years ahead for the situation to improve, but this year and 2010 will not be years where the spreads are reaching 10, 12 or 15 as they were last year.</p>
          <p>In any case, our thermal production compared to our competitors is quite small in Spain, as you know. Spreads are important, but our spread &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> with spread, so many of our competitors do depend strictly on those spreads.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the dividend, our intention is to maintain the payout. So we'll continue with the same levels of payout up until now. The results of the year, I said before, our expectations are that the result, before extraordinaries, it will be in line with last year, just slightly better actually. And it will depend on the extraordinaries, the different assets to see whether &#x2013; what we'll &#x2013; exactly what we'll have at the end of the year. I don't think that with the vision that we have right now, it is going to be very far from the results that we had last year, but it will depend as Pep&#xE9; said, on the divestments being made now.</p>
          <p> We still have to make it to see how another series of issues develops. Those are certain variables that are very difficult to predict. If the pound helps us, well then things will go well. The Real is helping us in the &#x2013; but the pound doesn't seem to be working too well. So there's a certain number of variables that could affect things, either in one direction or another. We had a first half that went very well, as the financial director said, in terms of &#x2013; but it has been negative in terms of exchange rates and there are different factors that could &#x2013; but our policy is to maintain the same levels of debt as we've had around 57, 60, 59, in that range.</p>

          <p>The next question is the Alberto Gandolfi [UBS]. Alberto Gandolfi, sir, you have the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three quick questions. First, talking about the EBITDA in the first half, is it correct that the two main factors, non-recurring purchase that you have, 198 negative in Energy East, and practically if we look at the load factor of Iberdrola Renovables, which was above average, another 25 million, so EBITA should be 125 million higher?</p>
          <p>My second question; if we analyze the first half, it seems quite negative. The second half, there could be a normalization of Energy East, and the decree on CO2, it doesn't exist anymore, that will decrease, so we will have a little bit more from Iberdrola Renovables. So at the EBITA level, how much do you &#x2013; how much bigger do you think it could be in the second half vis-&#xE0;-vis the first half of the year?</p>
          <p>And my last question, talking about leverage, when additional measures can be used excluding the sale of assets, for example, are you thinking about paying dividends on paper with a discount given option for the payment of dividends on paper? And another question, on the subject of the United States, to increase investment in 2012, will there be a capital increase in Iberdrola Renovables for those investments in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question, very easy, the answer is no. No, we're not going to have a capital increase in Iberdrola Renovables. In terms of the dividend, right now we are struggling to generate this and we'll see how we'll pay it. First we have to generate this. Right now, we're at the stage of achieving this, and once it is achieved, then we'll discuss in the Board the best measures. But right now, we have not thought about any type of initiative different than fighting to maximize as much as possible our bottom line.</p>
          <p>And so that gets me to the first question, what will we do in the second half of the year? We'll do as much as we can. We've taken measures in terms of expenses, interim costs, from the point of view of prices as Paco talked about. So our vision for this second half is that prices are not going to get worse in the second half of the year, demand seems that it will improve in the second half of the year. As I spoke before, the cost of fuels, as Paco said, due to the reviews that we have, price reviews, will improve vis-&#xE0;-vis the first half of the year and our fuel costs will improve. So we'll continue to hold expenses at bay and so we hope that the exchange rate with the Pound will help us to maximize our bottom line. So this is really all I can say.</p>
          <p>So we'll do everything possible to pay the dividend at the same level of payout, and as we decide in the Board, we &#x2013; I understand the different measures to what you're talking about, and we will put this on the table. All good ideas, we always like to study and listen to those.</p>

          <p>Next question from Daniel Lakalle. Daniel, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on your results. I have three questions, if I may, going to greater depth on the subject of Scottish Power and Energy East. Do you intend to have any CapEx review regarding those two companies? And more generally, what do you see as possibilities for maintaining or changing those companies' CapEx over the next couple of years? Second question, if I may, on the balance with &#x20AC;26 billion at the end of the year, does that include the divestments you mentioned at the last conference call? Are there no further disinvestments included in that figure?</p>
          <p>And lastly on cash prices, we're seeing a bit of a bubble with LNG, what do you think the effect will be in the mid-term? Will this be an opportunity or a risk? How are you managing that one? The last question had to do with gas prices in the medium-term and how we're managing that opportunity, clarifies the speaker, due to poor reception of the signal perhaps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for those words. Firstly, we are reviewing the tariffs in the regulated sector with Scottish Power and so the plans will depend upon how that emerges from the executive. We are not, in principle, looking at cutting back on anything that's required to keep the regulated sector going.</p>
          <p>Then turning strictly to investment, the major investments at the desulphur of and other kinds of installation at Longannet finished, and we'll probably have to make decisions on some new combined cycle plant in forthcoming months. But they will never be within the next 12 months' expenditure. So we're not looking at more capital expenditure, maybe just maintenance. And the same goes for Energy East, there's a regulatory process underway there.</p>
          <p>And for your information, Energy East's power base is New York. What happens in New York really has a preponderant effect, whereas Connecticut only accounts for what, seven, 8% of the total. New York is really where 60 or 70% of their activities are. So our investment plans are to keep service going there in a regulated basis. But I will add that we are now negotiating Maine-Canada interconnection lines with Energy East. Now the return on investment there would be very, very good. Amparo has the figures. She knows the most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a connection between Maine and Canada, a 1.5 billion investment. 12.5% return on equity to be begun next year, and will make it possible for increasing return on equity in 2012 and 2013. And that's &#x2013; this is a major and extremely attractive project and we plan to invest heavily in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like to answer the other question, Pep&#xE9;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The goal of between 25 and 26 billion means that we will continue with the disinvestment plan as announced. We announced 2.5 billion and we've achieved around 1.3 billion, which means that between the end of this year and early next year we will on the face of it conclude that plan, i.e. continue with divestments generically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, could you answer on gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we have a portfolio of around 7 BCMs. Next year it will be around seven or seven point something. We have three kinds of management here. Like everybody else, we're looking for price, but above all we're looking for flexibility. We've got a team permanently devoted to normal and extraordinary reviews of contract prices. Extraordinary, if required. And we're constantly negotiating flexibility conditions with the big producers, who are the people that sell to us.</p>
          <p>We've bought nearly all of our gas from big producers. And they can be flexible because they've got the wells. That ties in with price. And we've got an operations team constantly seeking for opportunities to place and optimize the year's balance, and they try to tally supply with demand. And we're also seeking to diversify our scope to place gas, looking at gasifying &#x2013; regasifying plants in markets other than Spain, such as the U.K. and the U.S.</p>
          <p>We have the position in the regasification plant at Grange, which will probably come online in 2011, and also in two similar plants in the States. So we're looking to find as much flexibility as possible, so we can react briskly in any conditions, and otherwise it's going to be a matter of seeing it on a day-by-day basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two points, gas suppliers in Spain. Well, they're all coming from the same place. Algeria is our big supplier. And I think the second supplier of Spain is Nigeria and then some from the Gulf. Now there are others here who know more about this than I do. Conrad, I'm looking at. So the review formulae are almost all identical. So for better or worse, we're all being treated in the same fashion. So the degree of competition in that area, as Paco said, has much more to do with flexibility in shifting the gas one way or another way than anything else. And we've shown year after year that we have that capacity.</p>
          <p>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but we said that in 2009, 100% of our gas has been settled. We have no surplus. For next year, we've sold around or we've placed 90 something percent of the gas, between our own consumption, what we've sold with commercial contracts or what we've sold to &#x2013; on a wholesale basis. And then there's a bit of margin. But as Paco said, it's good to have a bit of flexibility to play with. But essentially, it's all done and dusted. So there's no risk in that area. Next question? I don't know which person from this broker will be. I've got two names. If that's right, perhaps we could just hear from one of them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In fact, Bruno Silva from BPI. Good morning. Sorry about that confusion. Almost all of my questions have been answered. Could I just ask firstly on your business with Iberdrola Renovables? With this contract, is there a loss for the group? Does that mean that there's no integration of the whole group in Spain, because you told us about a possible loss? And secondly, what's the strategic interest for IBERDROLA as a group in its position and its holding in Gamesa and in BIP? And thirdly, what will be the cost involved with the decision at the Garo&#xF1;a plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Garo&#xF1;a cost? None, as of now. Garo&#xF1;a is going to go on running until 2013. So no change. Our holding in Gamesa, we've said before that Gamesa is our main supplier of machinery, of plant and turbines. I've said before that this is a strategic investment for us and we've been involved with Gamesa since the outset. With the investments we have in renewables, we've always said we want to have a producer of turbines that we can rely upon. As to BIP, as I said, that's an asset that's in our fridge and is going to stay in the fridge for the time being.</p>
          <p>As to non-integration, it's true, it's true. We didn't have a single energy balance between on one hand or Renovables on the other. Each was managed separately. And we've rethought that because we realized that without this integrated management, there were costs that we were paying to third parties. We now think we can manage this better on an integrated basis. This is the synergy we're making. Next question, Jose Javier Ruiz from BNP.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Yes. Good morning everybody. Just one question remaining. The prices you get in the second half of this year for retail, would it be fair to say that they're going to be lower prices than in the first half of the year? Logically you had some hedging last year. You have benefited from higher prices last year. Is that &#x2013; does that make sense or have I missed something, asks the speaker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're absolutely right. We'll get lower prices in the second half. The figures I gave you were overall figures for the entire financial year. You will recall that for last year we weren't talking about 30 or 40 over spot, we were talking about 50% over spot.</p>
          <p>But the mix with lower prices in the first half of this year, of course, we were closing off contracts in a general environment of lower prices and so, of course, customers are demanding lower prices and competition is offering lower prices, as a result of which the mix for the year is around 30 to 40% above spot than &#x2013; rather than 50% above spot like last year. I repeat, the figures I gave were for the entire year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a few questions. The financial situation, first, do you confirm the target that you set in Q1 '09 result presentation, i.e. I think a ratio of FFO over net debt above 19% by the end of the year?</p>
          <p>The second question was on the tariff deficit. I think that's something that you discuss with rating agencies. What is the timeframe that you have set in terms of recovering the 2.9 billion that are outstanding on your side because you are now communicating your ratios excluding tariff deficits. Is it possible to have some granularity on what could be the timing of evacuating this tariff deficit?</p>
          <p>And my third point will be on the bond issue side. You have been already very active this year with almost 4 billion. Do you plan to come back to the bond market in H2 '09, especially taking into our account the 1.4 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> due in November on the ScottishPower loan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope that I did understand everything. One question was on the debt ratios on the first quarter. Then the deficit &#x2013; tariff deficit. Yes, the idea that we have is to reach our target of 19% above FFO over debt by the end of the year. And what we are talking about now with the rating agencies is when &#x2013; about recovering that tariff deficit, we are working and thinking about recovering this at least all of 2006 to 2008 before the end of the year. As the Chairman says, things are underway to create this securitization group. Yes, this everything is very recent says the Chairman. This week we should have some news about this. So this is very new information. We know that work is being done in the Ministry of Industry and the Treasury right now on this issue and if the markets continue working or functioning well, this operation could be carried out in the second half of the year. In any case the important issue here is that the rating agencies are saying that the process is being implemented. The calendar is &#x2013; we are sticking to the calendar and the commitments of the company for &#x2013; to the rating agencies. If it's done in December or October, I don't think that's going to be a major problem for the agencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of the bonds, we are working. We'll probably issue bonds in the last part of this year, around 1 billion &#x2013; someone &#x2013; around &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x2013; and we will be opening this up to the American market. So we do have plans to do &#x2013; go on to the market and we could issue these bonds on the American market, yes.</p>
          <p>Let's go onto the rest of the questions from the web page. We have Antonio Cruz from Banesto who has a question. Antonio, you have the first one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very quickly, we saw in the first half of 2009 that expenses were &#x2013; fell in the liberalised market <mark type="inaudible" /> just interested in why in terms of the guidance given for 2010, we saw that the initial objective of 3.5 billion could be reduced due to the tariff deficit. Now that outlook for 2010 are you maintaining that or should &#x2013; would there be a decrease in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second question has already been answered, says the Chairman, so we'll answer that once we have the budget made at the end of the year as I stated before. Now with respect to the first question, Pepe, could you field that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the structural costs have fallen and personnel costs, I think there was a &#x2013; there was a part that is non-recurring, then there is another 30 million that was non-recurring. And then we had the <mark type="inaudible" /> holding in terms of publicity image and so forth and corporate governance as well. All this has been &#x2013; all these expenses have been reduced under the heading of structural costs. But that is listed under the description of expenses that I gave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Morton from Credit Suisse. He asks about the cash &#x2013; the cash for the recovery of the tariff deficit for 2009. Well, we're trying to recover in our budgets from 2006 to 2008, the chapters from 2006 to 2008. Now, if we can include 2009 as well that would be great. But right now, we're working for the front of tariff deficit between 2006-2008?</p>
          <p>Next question, can we estimate the expected development of the U.S. GAAP and IFRS in EBITDA of Energy East for the first two quarters and an estimate of EBITDA of Energy East for the end of this year?</p>
          <p>Second question, has to do with the tax rate, if it's going to be under 11%, what was the reason for that? And if any of the capital gains have any other repercussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the tax rate for the second quarter, it was relatively low. But we expect that to be sustainable throughout the rest of the year. We're expecting a tax rate of around 21% for different impacts in one direction or another. It's also true that this rate is just slightly under, what was recurring without extraordinary. But part of the extraordinary did not have a tax expense in the sale. What we expect is that the &#x2013; if our assets would be accounted for in the second half of the year, so we're expecting these 98, 99 million of negative impact will be turned around in the second half of the year; that's what we're working on and that's what I expect is that the agreement with the regulators. So that this &#x2013; actually does occur and there was no negative surprises that will happen.</p>
          <p>Just to ratify that in terms of those 99 million that we had in the impact, that regulatory impact that's not reflected in the American accountability. But in the IFRS we do have a resolution from the <mark type="inaudible" /> New York so that this recovery could be done in an accelerated fashion in the second half of the year in 2009. So those 99 million, we will see them reflected in our P&amp;L in this second half of this year.</p>

          <p>And the last question is from Matija Gergolet from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He has four questions. One has already been answered that quantification of the cost of the social bonus for 2009, 2010. The second question has to do whether if we can clarify the one-off in the guarantee of energy for the nuclear energy plants in the first half of the year or do we have any other one-off for the second half of the year and in Spain or the U.K.?</p>
          <p>The third question is if we are interested in offering for the natural gas assets in the community of <mark type="inaudible" /> making a bid, excuse me? And the fourth is about 3% that was mentioned. And for the total consumption of the social bonus is equivalent to the three or four million of the consumers that has been mentioned in the press, 3.4 million, you mentioned in the press. In principle, these are &#x2013; this is referred to previous years that will not continue in the second half of the year. In contrast, we do have a positive impact. The CO2 product that disappear in the second half of the year that was 98 million there of negative impact in the first half.</p>
          <p>In terms of Gas Natural assets, the answer is no, we are not interested in purchasing gas distribution. And in terms of the social bonus, Paco could you answer that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the social bonus is controversial and difficult to quantify because we're still receiving requests. What I can say is that we do have approximately 1.2 million consumers that automatically have our &#x2013; are within that social bonus, 1.2 million. And approximately we have about 100,000 requests registered, usually mostly from retirees, so we have &#x2013; we're talking about &#x20AC;1.5 million.</p>
          <p>Now, how to extrapolate this through the entire system? Well, those would be the 3.5 million, 4 million, that figure that we see in principle, we'll have to wait and to see this &#x2013; until this is consolidated. In terms of consumption, we don't know. There are groups that consume quite a bit more and we still have not developed the threshold of income for this social benefit, so we'll have to &#x2013; there will be some groups that will have higher incomes and so some will be included within these social bonuses and others not.</p>
          <p>So we'll have to really see how this is going to work. Our cost center is really <mark type="inaudible" /> almost collapsed with all the different costs. But there will be about 1 million people that will have the right to, and that's going to be around 3%, maybe even a little bit lower. Maybe even a little bit lower than that number that will have &#x2013; be eligible for that.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more question. Within your divestment plan and depending on how this develops, and you already mentioned that you're not thinking about a capital increase for renewables, is it feasible to reduce your participation in renewables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't thought about it. We're &#x2013; it's not in our plans. There is the &#x2013; the regulator did ask us, at least 25% in free flow. But looking at the volume right now, we haven't had any further input from the regulators. So in principle we're not thinking about that.</p>
          <p>Ignacio, I don't know if you're going to have some concluding remarks?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd just like to thank you all once again for your very intelligent questions. I trust that the answers have been intelligent too and have cleared up any queries you may have had regarding the company.</p>
          <p>I do quite candidly believe that in the current environment things are being managed along the right direction.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Have an excellent summer.</p>
