          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Linde Group First Half 2010 Results Conference Call. Your call today is hosted by Mr. Georg Denoke, CFO and Members of the Executive Board of the Linde Group. My name is Ana Magabor , and I'll be the operator for today.</p>
          <p>At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, and I will open the lines for the question-and-answer session at the end of Mr. Denoke's presentation. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to Mr. Thomas Eisenlohr, Head of Investor Relations of the Linde Group for the introductory remarks. Mr. Eisenlohr, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ana. Hello and good afternoon everybody. It's Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining the call for our half year results today. Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO will be hosting the call and Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board is also available for your questions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg and he will open the line again for your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello and good afternoon. This is Georg Denoke. I'd start my presentation with the highlights on page three of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Linde's business has further accelerated in the course of the first half year. Underlying growth is showing increasing momentum, driven by the ongoing global economic recovery, and additionally the positive development was supported by stronger currency effects.</p>
          <p>Group sales in the first half year grew 11.5% to &#x20AC;6.104 billion. Group operating profit increased again over proportionately by 26.4% to &#x20AC;1.396 billion. Supported by further contributions from our HPO program, the group's operating margin improved by 270 basis points to 22.9%.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, we recorded an EPS growth of 78.9% to &#x20AC;2.63 on reported basis. Taking into account the purchase price allocation, our adjusted earnings per share figure of &#x20AC;3.15 was up 52.9%. This strong operating performance is also reflected in our cash generation. Operating cash flow in the first six months went up by 7.3% to &#x20AC;902 million. This development was driven by a 17.7% increase in quarter two.</p>
          <p>Based on the positive development in the first half year, we reinforced our full-year guidance for growth in group sales and an over-proportionate increase in group operating profit in 2010. In terms of operating profit, we expect to exceed the record year 2008.</p>
          <p>The more detailed business reviews starts with the divisional breakdown of group sales on page four. Gases sales at end of June were up by 13.4% to &#x20AC;4.931 billion. On a comparable basis, sales growth accelerated to 7.1% in the second quarter. This strengthening momentum in the gases division is driven by an improving market environment across all our regions and all our product areas.</p>
          <p>As we will show later on in the gases sales bridge, the currency development also contributed to growth in the first half year. The execution of order backlog in the engineering division is fully on track. Sales in the first six months of &#x20AC;1.095 billion were in line with the previous year. Our expectation for full-year sales to reach at least last year's level is unchanged.</p>
          <p>As you see on page five, the 26.4% increase in group operating profit in the first half year is supported by strong growth in both divisions. Operating profit in gases of &#x20AC;1.337 billion was up by 17.5% versus the previous year. Driven by our high-performance organization measures, the gases operating margin hence improved further to now 27.1%. This represents a 90 basis points increase year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The engineering division posted a strong operating profit of &#x20AC;123 million at end of June. This represents an increase of 36.7% versus last year.</p>
          <p>The operating margin in this business improved to 11.2%. This strong performance was also supported by the successful completion of several projects in the second quarter. Factoring in the margin development in 2010 so far, we expect to exceed the 8% target margin on a full-year basis. Please have in mind that last year's corporate cost figure includes &#x20AC;67 million of restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Moving to page six, and going deeper into our gases performance, you will find the sales bridge. Compared, the growth accelerated from 3.9% in quarter one to 7.1% in quarter two. This has led to a 5.6% underlying price and volume effect excluding acquisitions for the first half year.</p>
          <p>Currency effects increased in the second quarter towards the sales contribution of 6.5% in the first six months. Besides the mentioned impact from the Australian dollar and the South African rand, most other important currencies also strengthened against the euro.</p>
          <p>The sales contribution from the passthrough of natural gas price changes was positive in the first half year by 1.1% while we had no significant consolidation effects.</p>
          <p>On a regional basis, we recorded a sales acceleration in all four operating segments of our gases division as shown on page seven. The volume recovery in our industrial end-markets is hence becoming more and more visible as the economy worldwide further recover.</p>
          <p>Our emerging market activities posted again the strongest underlying growth rate in the first six months. The operating segment, Asia and Eastern Europe, recorded a sales growth of 21.6% to &#x20AC;1.066 billion.</p>
          <p>On the comparative basis, sales rose 12.7%, driven by double-digit increases in greater China and South and East Asia. Moreover, also our Eastern European activities have shown a pick-up in sales momentum towards the end of the first half year.</p>
          <p>The growth acceleration was hence really visible throughout all major regions, including our more mature markets in Western Europe and the US. In Western Europe, sales of &#x20AC;1.979 billion were up 7% year-on-year. On a comparable basis, sales growth increased from 2.6% in quarter one to 5.3% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This acceleration shows that the ongoing economic recovery in Western Europe is translating into improving sales momentum for our gases business. Let me remind you that as in quarter one, the contractual passthrough of lower electricity prices in the UK is diluting growth in this region. We expect this adverse effect to persist in the second half year.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment, Americas, sales went up by 10.3% to &#x20AC;1.095 billion. Comparable sales growth increased to 7.2% in the first half year. Just as in Europe, the US market is posting an ongoing recovery driven mainly by our steel, metal, chemical and manufacturing customers.</p>
          <p>In South America, our activities in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina are the main contributors to sales growth with industrial volumes recovering most significantly in our bulk and tonnage product areas.</p>
          <p>Gases sales in South Pacific and Africa were up by 25.1% to &#x20AC;833 million, driven by strong currency gains. On a comparable basis, sales for the first half year were unchanged with the year-on-year improvement of 2.8% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This operating segment is hence returning to growth after still recording a comparable decline in the first quarter. While the South Pacific business is slightly up on sales, Africa remains weak. On the back of a slow moving manufacturing environment in South Africa, countries outside South Africa show an even weaker recovery.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating profit on page eight, all our operating segments posted double-digit increases versus the previous year.</p>
          <p>The strongest operating margin increase was achieved in the regions Western Europe and Americas, where the economic recovery is gaining strength. Western Europe improved its operating profit by 13% to &#x20AC;572 million. The operating profit margin hence increased by 150 basis points to 28.9%.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, operating profit advanced by 18.1% to &#x20AC;248 million. At 22.6%, the operating margin for this region was 150 basis points higher than last year. In line with the strong sales development, the operating profit in Asia and Eastern Europe improved by 21.4% to &#x20AC;323 million. The operating margin remains at 30.3% despite the diluted effect of natural gas price increases in the first half year.</p>
          <p>The strong increase of 24.4% of our operating profit in South Pacific and Africa to &#x20AC;194 million is supported by currency gains. The operating margin remained unchanged at 23.3% for the first six months.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, you find the comparable sales growth of our four product areas for end of June. Excluding currency, natural gas price and consolidation effects, the tonnage segment posted the strongest growth rate with an 11.8% sales increase to &#x20AC;1.182 billion. Besides higher capacity loadings versus last year, this double-digit growth also reflects the continuous ramp-up of projects out of our tonnage pipeline.</p>
          <p>Sales in the healthcare business advanced 3.2% on comparable basis from &#x20AC;547 million. In the merchant product areas, bulk sales rose by 7.6% to &#x20AC;1.203 billion, while cylinders sales advanced by 1.7% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.999 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we have met the comparable growth rate of our product areas for every quarter since the fourth quarter 2008, the first quarter that was really impacted by the global recession. As expected, we've seen a further recovery in the merchant business over the second quarter. As the cylinder business has held up longest in the crisis, it is as expected also the latest to come out of the downturn.</p>
          <p>However, this product area is now also back to growth with an increase of 3.2% in the last quarter. The bulk business is also further accelerating its 9.9% increase in quarter two.</p>
          <p>Overall, the development of the merchant product areas clearly shows that the global economic recovery is getting more and more visible in our business performance.</p>
          <p>Sales in healthcare increased by 3.7% in the second quarter. The growth target for 2010 remains around 5%. Growth in the tonnage business accelerated to 13.3% in quarter two. We expect a double-digit growth rate also for the full-year supported by new plant start-up out of our pipeline.</p>
          <p>You find an update of the gases project pipeline on page 11. We had a strong first-half year 2010 and decided new large project investment worth around &#x20AC;450 million. Let me remind you that this number only includes projects with an investment volume above &#x20AC;10 million.</p>
          <p>These new signings show that the general investment climate is recovering, including our steel, chemicals and electronics end-markets. The total project amount until 2012 stands at &#x20AC;2.9 billion with 65% of this CapEx allocated to emerging markets.</p>
          <p>For 2012, our pipeline is already on the level of 2008. Considering the plant construction timeline of 18 to 24 months for the standard plant types, you can expect this figure to further strengthen over the next month.</p>
          <p>I'm now turning to page 12 for some more insights in our engineering division. We already reviewed the operating performance, the stable sales development leverage to a strong operating profit improvement, driven by successful execution of several projects leading to a high margin of 11.2%. We saw a strong order intake of small and mid-sized contracts across all product segments in the first six months.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, due to the mega olefin project, the Ruwais project in Abu Dhabi of more than US$1 billion signed in the second quarter of last year, order intake for the first six months 2010 is down year-on-year. This is, of course, the usual pitfall of comparing quarterly figures for project related business. We are still enjoying an order backlog well in excess of &#x20AC;4 billion at &#x20AC;4.315 billion providing the basis for a relatively stable business development over the next two years.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 13 for the review of the major items of our cash flow statement. Based on the growth in operating profit, we further strengthened our cash generation in the first half year with a 7.3% increase of our operating cash flow to &#x20AC;902 million. This positive development was mainly driven by a 17.7% increase in the last quarter. As you can see, the definition of the operating cash flow thus include changes in working capital and other operating changes.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow for the first half-year increased by &#x20AC;161 million or 52.8% to &#x20AC;466 million. Despite the dividend payment for the full-year dividend, we were able to reduce net debt in the first half year already.</p>
          <p>Based on our strong performance in the first six months, we reinforced our guidance for the year 2010. This is on page 14. For the group, we expect growth in sales and over-proportionate increase in operating profit. As indicated earlier, we expect that the operating profit will exceed the record year 2008. We remain fully focused on HPO and confirm our target of 650 to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings by 2012.</p>
          <p>In the gases division, we forecast sales and operating profit to increase with an operating profit ahead of the 2008 record level. In the engineering division, we foresee 2010 sales to reach at least 2009 year's level. We expect the 2010 operating margin to exceed the target of 8% based on the strong performance in the first six months.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our half year figures. The ongoing economic recovery is clearly gaining traction in our gases business, while the investment climate for new gases and engineering projects has further stabilized. Against this background, we have posted the strong set of numbers in the first half year and therefore look confident towards our full-year and long-term development.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. We are happy to answer your questions now. And operator, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Peter Clark. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just two questions, it's nice to see cylinders growing again. I'm just wondering what was happening in Europe in terms of that mix in terms of cylinders and potentially if it's all volume attached, which I presume it is primarily?</p>
          <p>And then secondly just on the margin you saw in the South Pacific and Africa and Asia which came under a little bit of pressure, just wondering what was going on in terms of that when I look year-on-year? And also actually I suppose in South Africa, if there's any sign of the sort of World Cup hangover effect obviously with the construction ahead of us, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter, thank you for your questions. Overall, of course the cylinder growth is as expected as I mentioned, it came as last product area into the crisis, but it's now moving as product area latest out of the crisis. So, what we see here is, from a volume perspective, a recovery mainly driven by our Western European and Eastern European business and also positively influenced by our business in South Pacific.</p>
          <p>Overall, the momentum in Eastern Europe is still a little bit behind from the overall development, which we have seen in this segment. So, we hope, of course, to foresee a further recovery in the next quarter of that segment.</p>
          <p>And related to your questions South Pacific and Africa, clearly here we have a volume issue in South Africa and in the Africa region. I think it's not a hangover, to be very honest, from the Soccer Championship here that we see here a slow moving region. It's rather from a manufacturing perspective, overall not the strongest performance which we have seen also pre-Soccer Championship.</p>
          <p>So here that's different &#x2013; South Pacific is different here. I think here we have seen a very stable development through the crisis. I think we have to take this into consideration when we compare that now with the growth rate in South Pacific because this was very strong pre-crisis and it is coming back with a kind of same magnitude as it was down. It was not very volatile business, and this of course supported by the growth in the Asian markets with the support out of off-trade. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thanks for making it clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Peter Mackey, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking my call. So, I have a few questions if I can please. First, I wonder if you could just talk around your continued confidence in your 5% comparable growth in healthcare for the full-year please. Obviously, we've seen a couple of quarters this year when it's been below that level. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I wonder if you could just address the issue in engineering. Clearly, you're indicating a margin in excess of the 8% target for this year. Should we in some way interpret that as a &#x2013; do you see 2010 being a little unusual or and you would revert to your 8% target beyond 2010 or do you &#x2013; can you put a little bit of color on how you see profitability just in general in the engineering business please? And then just finally on, going back to the Africa situation, you're talking obviously a little bit more about an underlying weakness in Africa.</p>
          <p>In Q1, the focus was more on the pass-through of LPG prices. Has something weakened further in Africa in Q2, or is it simply that it stands out in contrast to a recovery elsewhere that is the focus of your comment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'd start with your last question on Africa, in South Africa. So it's a mixed effect also with other countries out of South Africa. Overall, I think from a South African perspective, the country is a little bit hit by the very strong South African currency, which is an issue for, of course the manufacturing parts of that business. An additional effect in the second quarter for us was that we have an outage of our air separation unit, roughly for three weeks in April. So that is something which is here when we compare that extraordinary.</p>
          <p>But of course, against the currency development, I think we are from that perspective, seeing this slow moving momentum. I think also, there is volume recovery, I think this is no question, which is in line with other regions, but from an overall perspective it is not that significant as the downturn was impacting the country. I think this is here the point we have to take into consideration.</p>
          <p>On your second question which is in the engineering margin, of course, I can confirm that the 8% target margin remains the target, because it is against our explanation that in a good execution mode, we keep some of the contingency to really have the 8% margin and I would argue that 2010, of course, is participating a little bit from a strong execution of the previous project. This is twofold, one is against the claim management for some of the projects and the other is, of course, against the procurement in a very overheated market in 2008, when some of the projects were put into the order book.</p>
          <p>On the healthcare business, the 5% remains the target. I think for us, this is an overall target. It depends a little bit also on the tenders, which are in front of us. I think we are still confident to achieve this for this year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Stott from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Georg. One question actually I need to clear. You mentioned the range again, and obviously you're fully confident of hitting that range. We're getting closer to 2012. I just wondered if you give us slight as to we're going to come in at the upper end of that range, middle of that range, and just I guess some more color on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I think it's a recap of what the Reitzle said in the first quarter call. I think overall, we are confident we have taken off cost momentum on many of the standardization issues. We are going through on a global basis for our regional business in the gases division, including the standardization of plant types in the combination with our Linda Engineering Division.</p>
          <p>So there is really nothing to update. What we expect for this year, this is something below last year's level, which was impacted by a very strong impact through the mitigation with the number slightly above 300 on a gross cost basis. Now we expect 150, 200 and then we come back when we have a year-end position, how we will foresee this until 2012. But at this stage, of course we are ahead of the curve. And I think we are looking to this contribution from the gross cost number which is 650 to 800 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Can I just follow-up on cash flow? You mentioned yourself; the other changes have been higher than the previous year, the 393 in the first half. Can you give some idea of the key constituents and then also the full year guidance if possible? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we definitely have, we have a weaker first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. I think this is very visible in the numbers. And including items like the restructuring, for example, which has been impacting some of the other items in the cash flow comparison, including some dividend payments, which we will expect for the full year, which we have from our Chinese joint venture last year in the first half year fully considered, these are the main items besides the impact of ramping up business impact from our working capital.</p>
          <p>So when we compare receivables and then we compare here the numbers, this is the main impact out of the growth which we foresee at that stage and we are not fully able to get that in line with our operational performance of our operating profit margin. So from that perspective, I think these are the main items.</p>
          <p>Full-year guidance, as you know, we do not want to give a full year guidance, but definitely the target is to exceed the cash flow of the previous year. From a working capital situation, it's not easy, but I think it's important to understand when we talk about operating cash flow, this includes our working capital items we have in that environment. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Markus Mayer, UniCredit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Three indeed; first of all on the growth rates beyond 2010. Historically you have posted five to 10% growth rates in your gases division. Do you expect these growth rates even further on in 2011-12 and so on? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second one is regarding the cash flow again. These cash out flows from the restructuring, can you give us a flavor how big they are and how big they should be in second half?</p>
          <p>And a third one on your end-market sentiment; can you give us flavor what your end customers give you on indications for the second half of this year? That's all. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with your cash flow question first, Markus. So, all the restructuring impacts are included in the first half year, so there is nothing which is extraordinary for the second half year.</p>
          <p>I think on the growth question, you allow us not to comment now on 2011, 2012. Overall, of course, we rely on our tonnage pipeline development. This is, I think, one first important recognition. So we will still participate next year from the further ramp-up of new schemes and existing schemes coming on-stream this year. I think this is important to understand that next year's comparison will be, of course, a little bit more difficult compared to this year and, on the other hand, the volatility in the market is not out.</p>
          <p>I think even if we have positive signs of our &#x2013; and this is your third question &#x2013; of our customers, it's not beyond a time horizon which goes into really late 2011-2012. So, from that perspective, we see really positive momentum. But it is not excluded that some significant events can disturb the economical development. You read about the growth locomotive of China and the expectation there. So, I think, these are the uncertainties which we are sharing with all other companies. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe follow-on on China; do you see already any indications for a slow growth or slower growth maintained in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage, we don't see this. Of course, we rather see the opposite when we look into our tonnage pipeline. When you look into the presentation, you can see a lot of tonnage projects related to that, not only steel, also chemical, also electronics. So from that perspective, it is not visible. Of course, we've heard about <mark type="inaudible" /> of the Chinese Government. So, that is something which we definitely take serious. But at this stage, we don't see any disruption on the Chinese growth. And overall, we are confident I think for a mid-term perspective definitely what's happened in China here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Neil, we hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, thanks sorry. A couple of questions actually, I wonder with regard to the margin development specifically in the Americas and in Western Europe, the improvements in the margin presumably is against a &#x2013; there's some sort of headwind of improving tonnage utilization rates. I wonder if you could just provide any distinction between what sort of headwinds that was and perhaps how regionally the benefits from the HPO program in a way sort of the greatest benefits year-on-year?</p>
          <p>And then within the like-for-like sales growth, where do you can sort of pullout any detail on the contribution from new projects versus what you see as sort of volume recovery to some extent? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions, Neil. I think from an overall perspective, we have to take into consideration that also in the decline environment of 2009, of course, margin-wise with the take-or-pay clause in tonnage contracts, we were participating here from the decline. I think now we have overall in volume recovery and when we talked about the first six months, definitely the volume recovery in the merchant business is here the positive momentum in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I think this is clear, but when we talk about margin, we definitely have to stress the point again that the margin improvement is strongly supported by HPO, because from a volume perspective, some cost items, as you know, are moving than faster when we look into the distribution cost development, for example. So, you ramp up and when you balance out. So, overall, I think most of the margin development is contributed really through our HPO business and negatively impacted is margin development through the increase in the natural gas price. I think, this is something which we have to take into consideration from the tonnage development when you compare that.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think, as we said, 2010 tonnage development is equally distributed over the quarters more or less. So, that has a full impact, and overall I think we do not share it by product segment from a tonnage perspective, how much contribution comes on-stream. I think we have given additional guidance to you. When you compared that on page 11 and then you see here the project volume of the investment amount and here you can play with your metrics. Overall, of course, the contribution in 2010, as we always have, is very significant.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth, WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Perhaps one question on the healthcare business, because you said, okay, you confirmed your 5% target and in the formal presentation you said a long-term growth rate is at least about five to 6%, but nevertheless, do you feel that current healthcare reforms more or less in all countries coming up might influence this target of five to 6% growth rate? And the second question is about pricing, especially in cylinder and in bulk business. Can you give a little bit flavor by most important region what is currently the environment there?</p>
          <p>And thirdly still on the outlook statement; despite you were not too concrete, I would say, would you confirm that the second half in absolute terms on operating profit would more or less be in line with the first half year, is that the assumption which you can live with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Norbert for all your questions. I think overall when we talk about the healthcare target of five to 6%, you also have to include in this comparison that in the year after the acquisition, acquisitions do have an impact even if we exclude this on a yearly basis. And as you are aware of in 2009, we really have no additional healthcare acquisitions in the year of the crisis. I think this is also something which we have to take into consideration.</p>
          <p>So, when we talk about five to 6%, I think this definitely remains our target because we do grow our business with some acquisitional support and also with opening up additional applications as you know in the middle space area where we have offers in the marketplace, which is doing two things: I think it's supporting our growth, and additionally it is supporting reduction in the healthcare reimbursement system, because, a hospital bed for example, is much more expensive if you supply 24/7 oxygen than for example some of our Middle Care centers, which we call <mark type="inaudible" /> for example.</p>
          <p>So, that is something which we are introducing into the market. So, I don't want to give the impression that we are diluting that target from a mid-term perspective. That remains the same. New applications, of course, does support growth. The tender pressure definitely is something, which is visible, and this is not a surprise. I think with the states having additional pressure on their state budgets, this is something we have to live with.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, as I said earlier, the development of additional applications is really something which will support the structural growth. And also, the ageing populations, as you know, and we have talked about that in some of our strategy discussions, ageing populations and additional support for COPD, for example, in many of the geography is supporting this mega trend. So I don't want to dilute here our long-term ambition.</p>
          <p>On pricing, I think, I said what really I want to say here. We have overall a positive pricing impact. Looking now into the operational segments, we see definitely a positive pricing in all geographies with the exception of Western Europe and the Western European impact is driven also by the decrease in energy cost in UK as you know, and that is something as I said earlier, which we expect for the course of the year. This this negative impact on energy cost is pass-through obligation which we have that sit on the full year 2010. On the outlook, I think, can you repeat your question here please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, only to be a little bit more specific, can you live with the estimation that second half of 2010, in absolute terms, on operating profit level would be more or less the same as in the first half year? It's clear that second half year growth rates will decline because of the base effect, but on an absolute term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I want to answer your question a little bit different. Normally, we have seen always a better second half than the first half in all historical patterns. And I think this should be applicable also to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gilbert, UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, four short questions please. First of all, in the cylinder business, can you just give us a qualitative comment whether the equipment part in the cylinder business has started to recover as well just looking at relative margins in the cylinder business?</p>
          <p>Second question, you mentioned of the new startup for steel customers, can I ask you about the base business your existing business with large volume steel customers because we had quite a fluctuation in steel prices, how nervous or confident you see the max capacity utilization rate there is moving, is it very volatile or do you see it's really just rising quarter-after-quarter? That's the second question.</p>
          <p>Third question is on the pensions, your pension obligations, obviously, you do not detail them at the half year stage, but in the balance sheet are back to the level now where Linde Board BOCs have a combined pension. <mark type="inaudible" /> despite the top-ups, can you remind us on meetings with trustees, triennial reviews, anything like that coming up and describe your level of confidence that the cash flow will not be hit by any top-ups?</p>
          <p>And the final question is, coming back on the pricing situation in Germany, specifically we're hearing that Messer Griesheim is trying to get back into Germany from the Eastern European part of their business which they retained. Are you seeing any signs of that or would you describe Germany as above average quality on cylinder and bulk pricing in Europe? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think I start with pension and then I hand over for some of the answers to Aldo too. So on the pensions, I think if we do the comparison without referring really to any discussions with the trustees, I think when we do the comparison with the point in time when we have the merger discussions, I think there is no additional pressure for the cash flow in the system against the negotiations we had at the time of the merger in 2006. I think this would be very unlikely, because I think we have proven that the new set-up of the group to the trustees, we have proven that the new combination is as strong as the old BOC, which was at that point in time one questions mark. And I think this is not the case.</p>
          <p>And as you know from your analysis at that point in time, debt levels are significantly below that level. We have received an rating upgrade. So trustees will look more confident in the development of the group as the market is also looking into the development. So, no additional risk for top-ups. I think this is clear.</p>
          <p>I take then your first question on the equipment, yes, we see also in some of the geographies some slightly positive development, but overall, the mix is more neutral and this is already pricking up. I think this comes with some further recovery of the cylinder business. And then, I hand over to Dr. Belloni on the steel customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thomas, yes, certainly, there are information about the volatility of certain base metal products in the market, maybe we are a little bit lucky. We have a good portfolio. The start-ups, which you mentioned, are ramping up according to the business pace of the investments.</p>
          <p>And this applies both to Asia as well as to Eastern Europe for instance. So, I think that the metal customers are definitely very cautious. Also with regard to the announcement, they have announced for instance some shutdown of furnaces, but this has not yet occurred.</p>
          <p>You also had a question with regard to the pricing levels in Germany, a potential impact by the reentry of company you mentioned. I think that for the time being we can reconfirm that the price quality in this part of the world for cylinder and bulk is very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Aldo, can I just ask you a follow-up, the capacity utilization rate at your steel customers, obviously that's the one that fell most in the downturn below take-or-pay in certain countries. Is that back to 100%, loading at 90%, could you give color where you are in the base business and excluding new start-ups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, the Asian customers are presently are about take-or-pay, we have in Europe different loadings. Some of this loading, we are benefiting from the shutdown of plants like the one in keysite as you well know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's between 90 and 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question comes from the line of Jean De Watteville, Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Jean De Watteville, Nomura, three questions. First question on electronic gases. We know that you don't report electronic gases as a segment as <mark type="inaudible" /> are doing, but you have some exposure to that sector that has enjoyed some mature recoveries since last year. Can you just describe, what's the size of the electronic gases business, what's the growth you've enjoyed in the start of this year?</p>
          <p>And strategically, can you just qualify for us what's the market share, and in which area of electronics you believe you have a significant competitive advantage against your big competitors? So, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, you mentioned to an answer to an earlier question that you see that the cylinder business in Eastern Europe is clearly lagging at the moment. Can you put a bit more colors on that comment? What are the reasons as you see that that business is lagging? And what are the customers' industry that you invite us to look at in terms of identifying a recovery trend?</p>
          <p>And the third question I have is regarding the engineering business, obviously, the order intake in H1 was relatively low, can you just give some color about the portfolio of contracts you're pitching at the moment? Do you see a very active backlog or do you sort of expect further delays to see the order intakes recovery? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jean, I start with your second question and then Dr. Belloni will answer electronic gases and then Linde engineering.</p>
          <p>On the cylinder business in Eastern Europe, I think the best example is really related to shipyards for example, but when you compare that with the order backlog of shipyards, pre-crisis, of course they were blocking through that order backlog into the crisis in the year 2009. And when you then compared that with the beginning of the year, these kinds of customers were running out of order backlog as you know, some of the shipyards were still shut down.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective these kinds of business is now hopefully coming back, and we see here a recovery on a broader basis, a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the year, to be very honest. So when we see the development of the second quarter, this was especially at the end of the quarter, positively impacted by a rebound of order volumes for our customers. So, I hand over now to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jean. I start with your question on electronics. It's true, we're not describing or identifying this market segment to the same extent as our competitors. I'll give you some insight about that. First of all, what we call secondary electronics or electronic packaging, this is included in the industrial gas numbers.</p>
          <p>Then we have the semiconductor business and the solar business. And this two together has an order of magnitude over &#x20AC;354,000 million, okay.</p>
          <p>And then with regard to the strong holds of Linde in this business, in the semiconductor business definitely Taiwan <mark type="inaudible" /> at play, so you know we have this company named BOC Lien Hwa, which we control and we have a very strong market share there in semiconductors with companies like TSMC, for instance, and with big, big pipeline clusters, close to Taipei in the cluster of Xinju.</p>
          <p>Solar business, definitely we claim a leading position in Europe. As you know, Germany is a very strong market for solar, especially thin film solar, and we have a very good customer portfolio with double-digit growth, both in terms of realized sales as well as new accounts, which we are in the process of building, the bulk and electronics specialty gas.</p>
          <p>You asked a question about the order intake. For Linde Engineering of course, predictions and forecasts for Linde Engineering order intake are always very difficult. I can tell you that we have an improving pipeline of projects in the olefin business. We have a number of revamps projects, sizeable revamps of existing plants in Russia, in the Middle East. We have two big opportunities for new build ethylene projects in India and in Vietnam.</p>
          <p>The natural gas business is also coming back with projects in Thailand, Mexico, Australia. Hydrogen, again is going strong and syngas &#x2013; more than hydrogen, syngas project in the Middle East and China with two big ones also in North and South America.</p>
          <p>And then of course, there is a terrific list of <mark type="inaudible" /> separation opportunity, especially in China, for metal customers, but also coal gasification projects and also very sizeable at the moment the supply of hardware, LNG heat exchangers, two projects in the South Pacific. So it's difficult to answer your question on where it would be at the end of the year. I think there is a sufficient potential to, for instance, match last year, but we shall see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a follow-up question from the line of Peter Mackey. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you again. Just a couple of quick questions. One was on CapEx. I wonder given your visibility now into 2011, and the project pipeline there, whether you have any gut feel for how the CapEx number is going to look that year, please?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I just wanted to follow-up on comment, Georg, you made a moment ago about the second half versus the first half, and the second half normally being better than the first half, are you referring to business just broadly or an EBITDA number or an EPS number or should we be comfortable in hanging a specific number on that comment please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter, I think I do not want to increase our guidance otherwise we would put it on paper. I think it was a general remark and you can apply it, of course, to the EBITDA line. And I think we said what we really want to say without becoming too concrete which would be a surprise for the guidance of Linde, I would say.</p>
          <p>So, from that perspective I do not want to dig deeper into that. Definitely, we see the basis of the first half of the year as a strong development with the second quarter. I think this is the basis for our outlook.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx, definitely, as we've said we have an &#x2013; expect a stronger CapEx number for 2010 compared to 2009. We already said that beginning of the year and when we take into consideration that the development of the opportunity list as we described it also in the last quarter call and also at the year-end.</p>
          <p>I think this is a difference which we see compared to the year-end which is definitely there and if this holds on and customers come to decisions which they postponed in the crisis, then definitely we will see a higher CapEx number in 2011 than in 2010. I think that is the natural result out of the positive development which we described on our opportunity list.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>We have a follow up question from the line of Markus Mayer [UniCredit]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two follow-up, another on the Zlimos. You said if Europe is still depressed, that's currently in the doldrums bit is coming out of the doldrums, can you tell us something on the returns in Eastern Europe? Has there been some returns? There has been little turns in Germany and Europe? And the second one is on engineering, are any big or large projects on the market around the small and mid-sized projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Marcus, I'll take your first question. Of course, turns are increasing when volumes are increasing normally, so that is what we can see. Also with the introductions of the intelligence cylinder control, which helps then capacity utilization, normally that is all in one direction to turn the cylinders more often. To Linde engineering I hand over to Dr. Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all to the order intakes, which have already been booked in the H1, definitely there is a predominance of small and medium sized projects, which on the perspective of risk and return, I think we are delighted very much. And the pipeline, which I just described answering the question of Jean, I can tell you there are also very big opportunities. But these in geographies where we would normally share the order intake with a partner like the Korean contractor so that the order intake &#x2013; the piece of order intake for Linde Engineering would probably again be more in the medium, medium/large size.</p>
