      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining Jamie and I, sorry for the long preamble there. We're going to go through as usual a slide presentation that is available on our website as the operator just described. So if you have that in front of you, I hope, let me first like I did last quarter with Bear Stearns just describe up front the impact in the quarter of the Washington Mutual transaction that closed during the quarter to clear that up before we start talking about what went on in the JPMorgan businesses for the full quarter.</p>
          <p>So the first point I would make here is the italicized comment up top that the numbers &#x2013; it has only been less than three weeks since we announced and closed the Washington Mutual transaction, so take the numbers that I'll talk about here on this page related to Washington Mutual as our best estimates at this stage and do expect us to be working on future refinements if and as needed.</p>
          <p>But with that, if you go into the table, you see that we reported firmwide net income including Washington Mutual impact of $527 million or $0.11 per share. Then you see the WaMu related merger items that you're going to see in our corporate segment for the quarter. Conforming loan loss reserve adjustment of $1.221 billion, a little higher than what we said on the WaMu call a couple weeks back, and then an extraordinary gain of 581 [million], which is actually zero at the time of the call. Those two together are about $0.18 negative, so bring you down to results before WaMu of 1.167 billion or about $0.28 per share.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the some of the bullets at the bottom, just to give you a sense for what's coming in the future, merger related items ongoing from this point forward, so in the fourth quarter and beyond will again be booked in corporate the same way you're going to see what happened with the nonoperating results of Bear Stearns. That's going to include whatever merger costs there are that flow in the future. We're giving you an estimate that that could be after tax about 100 million plus or minus in the fourth quarter, and cumulatively as much as 500 million plus or minus over the next several years.</p>
          <p>In addition, the refinements that I talked about to the purchase accounting, to the extent that they occur, are going to run through P&amp;L, and that's related to the fact that there's a negative goodwill situation. And for the accounting aficionados, you can follow up after the call on what all that means. But any refinements will run through P&amp;L, but we will count them in this merger related items line that we'll show you and talk about in the corporate segment.</p>
          <p>Lastly, beginning next quarter, we'll obviously show the ongoing operating results as appropriate in our relevant business segments, Retail, Card Services, and Commercial Banking, and we'll be spending time to improve and refine the reporting methodology we have to capture all the details we want to give you.</p>
          <p>Just a high level comment on the earnings impact, we still feel comfortable that about a $0.50 incremental EPS for 2009 is a reasonable expectation. And as far as the fourth quarter goes, you can pretty much expect our best guess would be a pro rata portion of that $0.10, $0.12 of EPS in the fourth quarter or so related to WaMu.</p>
          <p>Moving along to slide two, I won't comment on the first several items on the page here because we're going to hit them in the businesses, but just some firm-wide items down toward the middle of the page. You see the results include &#x2013; overall results include &#x2013; this is JPMorgan Chase away from Washington Mutual -- after-tax items that include the &#x2013; a slightly larger benefit from reduction of deferred tax liabilities. And what I talked about on the WaMu call a couple weeks ago, it's 927 after tax. It's spread across our business units, the bulk of it in the Investment Bank. And then the next two items, auction-rate and Fannie and Freddie write-downs, you're going to see in our corporate segment.</p>
          <p>On credit reserves, firm-wide we increased credit reserves through the P&amp;L by 1.3 billion in the quarter, bringing the total to 15.3 billion of loan loss allowance, and that's strong coverage ratios that you'll see here. I'll show you a final slide that gives you that across the full firm, and that's before Washington Mutual again. As you know, in addition we brought over and then added to the reserves Washington Mutual had for its nonmarked portfolios to the tune of $4.5 billion added to the 15.3 billion that we had. And lastly, we maintained very strong Tier 1 capital, 112 billion or 8.9% Tier 1 ratio on the back of the successful capital raise of 11.5 billion of common equity that we did a couple weeks ago.</p>
          <p>I'm going to skip now slide three and go right to getting into the results for the Investment Bank on slide four. So here you see the Investment Bank had 882 of net income on pre-tax income of $16 million, so that's really the flowthrough of the deferred tax liability benefit that I talked about on the prior page largely going to the Investment Bank. If you now work down the P&amp;L for the business, four billion of overall revenues; pieces of that included $1.6 billion of Investment Banking fee revenues, up 20% year over year. And you'll see on the next slide that we continue to be leading market share across the league tables as well as the top &#x2013; this $1.6 billion for the year-to-date equivalent is actually the top fee earner on the Street. So I feel very good about the Investment Banking fee franchise.</p>
          <p>Moving along to fixed income markets, you see we had on the revenue side a total of $815 million of revenues. That includes $2.6 billion of write-downs related to our mortgage positions that we have been talking about before as well as a billion related to leveraged lending, and I'll show a slide on each of those. I won't go into that in more detail right now. And then underlying that in fixed income, it was very strong results in a bunch of other areas; record results in rates and currencies, credit trading very strong, emerging markets and commodities.</p>
          <p>On the equity market side, you see 1.650 billion of revenues, up strongly year over year, and that's on strong client revenue and on the trading side. And then lastly, you see credit portfolio down a lot from a year ago, but that's really related to derivative receivables, the widening of our counterparty credit spreads obviously driving the values lower there, and the negative revenues, which in large part offset the benefit that you see in the bullets in fixed income markets and equity markets related to the benefit we get on our own credit spread widening.</p>
          <p>On the credit cost line, you see $234 million of credit costs. Actually the preponderance of that is additions to loan loss allowance, only $13 million of actual charge-offs in the quarter. That brings the allowance for loan losses in the Investment Bank to $2.7 billion, for the 3.85% reserves to loans ratio.</p>
          <p>And then the last point I'll make here is you see at the bottom the end of period equity, $33 billion. I'll comment on the back of how we arrived that, but we really spent time in the quarter looking to refine our capital allocation methodologies to our businesses, and you can think of this as a common equity equivalent for the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Moving along to slide 5, I'm going to skip it. You won't go through it here, but you can see for yourself the strong rankings we have in the league tables on the fee side.</p>
          <p>So moving to slide 6, I'll just quickly comment on the legacy leveraged lending positions. You see we had net markdowns as I said of $1 billion for the quarter. That brings our gross markdowns to $3.8 billion on the remaining $12.9 billion of commitments that we have or a 29% markdown to a carrying value on the balance sheet of $9.1 billion. That is a reduction of 3.4 billion or 21% from last quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 7, you see on the mortgage related side, same numbers we've been showing you in prior periods. I'll start in the table. If you go to the left, you see the bottom line of the table, $33 billion of mortgage exposure across the products shown here, both residential and commercial, reduced by 14.4 billion to end this past quarter at $18.6 billion for the Investment Bank. If you look at the first bullet below the table, that reduction in two parts: 2.6 billion of write-downs as I talked about in the P&amp;L running through the P&amp;L, as well as $11.8 billion worth of sales including 4.3 of which was moved over to our corporate investment portfolio, which is a real buyer of these type of assets.</p>
          <p>I'll skip going through the details because you can read them for yourself of what comprises the different buckets that we have on the page. You see in the next couple of bullets, but obviously I would feel well marked here. But when you go down to the final bullet, just to explain how we think about the remaining $18.6 billion, we would think about that in two ways. There is a natural level of inventory that you need to support the ongoing trading and client activity in normal times. That could be anywhere from 12 to $15 billion, and so you see 12 billion right now of that would be assets of that very nature that you expect to be business as usual and flowing in and out the door. On top of that though, we do have $6.6 billion worth of remaining positions from what we have been through, obviously marked down, and we're just going to manage that on a mark-to-market basis in a liquidating portfolio in the Investment Bank under Bill and Steve, but leave our trading debt focused on facilitating client business and put that in the hands of a special team to deal with.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Retail now on slide 8, you see again the main drivers as we always go through of what is going on in the P&amp;L. So you see the growth in the branch stats, checking accounts up 10%. You can read for yourself the growth in branches and ATMs et cetera, et cetera. Average deposits up 2% year over year and flattish versus last quarter, but I do feel good about the strength of this franchise. Mortgages, obviously originations on the mortgage loan side down some. Most of what we're originating is conforming to government guarantee standards there and holding the market share gains that we've had there; home equity originations down 77% year over year.</p>
          <p>When you translate that on slide 9 into the P&amp;L for the Retail business, we end up with the $4.9 billion worth of revenue in the retail business overall, which is up 16% year over year. That drops down to $247 million of net income, which is down from the year ago and prior quarter, and the big reason for that is credit. So you see credit costs circled there of 1.678 billion. Obviously charge-offs are higher, and you can see the charge-off rate overall down below. It's 244 basis points, up from prior year and prior quarter. But also included in that $1.7 billion of credit costs is $450 million of additions to loan loss reserves, part of the firmwide $1.3 billion increase. In addition, we added $250 million of loan loss reserves related to prime mortgages held in corporate. So I'm going to show you a couple slides in a second on what is going on in the major portfolios.</p>
          <p>Lastly at the bottom of the page, same thing as the Investment Bank, you see the equity allocated to the business taking into account the WaMu acquisition increasing from 17 billion to $25 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 11, I'll talk &#x2013; 10 rather, I'll talk you through the same slides we've seen before on our major residential mortgage portfolios. So slide 10 is home equity. I'll just take you to the upper right box. The key stats focus on the net charge-offs dollar line, so you see $663 million of net charge-offs, up from 511 last quarter. I'll just take you right down to &#x2013; our outlook from here on this is that we talked about last quarter the pace of deterioration slowing off of what we had given to you earlier in the year. It had slowed, but nonetheless it continues to deteriorate, so our best outlook for the near term is at quarterly losses of 663. It could trend as high as 725 million per quarter to 800 million a quarter over the next several quarters or so.</p>
          <p>When you move on to subprime, a little more severe degradation, so you see 192 million of net charge-offs last quarter going up to 273. And our outlook again down at the bottom bullet could be as high as 375 to 425 over the coming quarters by early '09, and here was a major component of our 450 million reserve increase in the Retail business was related to subprime.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, prime mortgage, remember I said earlier that we carry some of the balances here in our Retail business, but many in the corporate segment in the investment portfolio. Overall, the charge-offs on this portfolio of $177 million in the quarter or 1.51%, that's going to trend as high as 300 million by early '09. And just to remind people &#x2013; we talked about this last quarter. The increase in prime, just to clarify a bit, this portfolio we have &#x2013; mix drives a lot of what is going on here. You see that 80% of our losses in the quarter came from California and Florida, which represented 37% of the portfolio. The more important I think portion of why the charge-off rates are higher than you might expect is that this is not a well balanced portfolio by vintage. So of the $47 billion you see in balances, about 50% are '06 &#x2013; '07 vintages, which drive 90-plus percent of the losses related to this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Card, slide 13, here you see we had profits of 292 million in the quarter, down substantially from a year ago; the main driver again credit costs, $2.2 billion, up substantially from the prior year; charge-off rate of 5%, pretty much on what we had previously expected, up from 498 last quarter, but essentially flat. In addition, on top of charge-offs we added 250 million to the allowance for loan loss reserves in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, we had outstandings grow by 6% from a year ago to about $158 billion and charge volume growth of 5%; when you translate that into its modest revenue growth, basically flat to a year ago. And lastly, same point at the bottom, $15 billion of capital, and I'll just tell you that is with a view of where the business is going to go once card securitizations come on balance sheet, and we're under Basel II, so a good number for capital allocation to the Card business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Commercial Bank on slide 14, here we had profits of $312 million, up 21% from a year ago. And that is on record revenue, so the 1.125 billion is up 11% from the prior year. That's on the back of loan growth of 18% from a year ago, and deposit or liability balances up 13% from a year ago, and that revenue growth is really coming across all products in the business. Here credit costs of $126 million, actually again very modest charge-offs. You see the 22 basis point net charge-off rate in the quarter. So all in all, below normalized levels for credit costs and as we'll comment later, expect this to worsen. It just will worsen from these levels given the economy, but so far so good for this business.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, Treasury and Securities Services, you see profits of $406 million, up from the year ago. Again, liability balances up 10%, helping translate to revenues up 12% from a year ago. Including two segments here, Treasury Services, the cash management businesses, and Securities Services, a custody business, on the Treasury Services sides, the 897 of revenues were a record quarterly revenue level. WSS benefited from the market we're in, but obviously faces challenges as the market has come off in what we've seen in this month so far. Overall liability balances as you see of $260 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Asset Management, $351 million worth of net income, down from a year ago and down from last quarter. The story here again as I mentioned with Treasury and Securities Services is market levels impact this, so our assets under management are down by $133 billion solely due to market declines. On the other side of that, over the past 12 months we continue to have inflows, 123 billion for the past year and $46 billion in for the quarter, helping offset some of that. Nonetheless it translates into revenues down 11% given lower market level effect as well as performance fees.</p>
          <p>Finally moving on to P&amp;L to corporate in slide 17, I'll just walk through the pieces here. Private equity, we've been talking about weaker conditions for liquidations and valuations on private equity, so we got it this quarter. Negative revenue on unrealized losses of $206 million translates into after-tax losses of $164 million. Moving down a row you see corporate, 1.064 billion negative, so this is where you see in the bullets to the bottom right. Inside that number, some of the big items are the write-down of the Fannie and Freddie preferred securities that we owned, $642 million after tax; also the 400 million pre-tax estimated charge related to auction-rate security settlement, 248 million after tax.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I commented earlier the prime loans that we hold in corporate. Both the 250 increase in loan loss allowance as well as actual charge-offs in the quarter translate into 234 million of after-tax costs all running through that 1.064 billion negative for corporate. Outlook for there continues to be 50 to 100 negative in the quarter, but you're going to have volatility around the investment portfolio as well as the credit costs related to that prime portfolio.</p>
          <p>And then the last piece is the $735 million after tax of merger related items. This as I said earlier is where we're going to continue to show you the impact in future quarters of Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns related items. So here for the quarter you see the 1.2 billion conforming loan loss reserve for WaMu as well as the 600 million extraordinary gain as well as about 95 million after tax of Bear Stearns merger related costs, in line with what we had expected.</p>
          <p>Moving on to capital, so slide 18, you see the firmwide view of capital obviously came in a bit better than what we talked about a couple weeks ago on the Washington Mutual call. So you see about five rows down Tier 1 capital ratio. This is Basel I basis. 8.9% for the quarter, again that includes taking on the Washington Mutual balance sheet and the 11.5 billion of common equity we raised and closed in the quarter, and again that's on a Basel I basis. On a Basel II basis, our best estimate is there is substantial &#x2013; there may be a 100 basis point spread between the two to the positive going to Basel II.</p>
          <p>And then just the points down at the bottom, the capital allocation and funding costs; capital allocation, we spent a lot of time in this environment and thinking about what's going on in our industry, making sure we have capital allocated properly in the businesses, so we have people making good decisions as our industry obviously faces a lot of different challenges. What we did in trying to arrive at that is take a couple of things into mind. Two of those are that Basel II will be in effect for us January of 2010 or thereabouts, as well as the off-balance sheet accounting rules that bring on in particular the credit card off-balance sheet securitization. So we tried to take a forward view of where we're going as we thought about allocating capital to the business.</p>
          <p>And then the final point is that obviously with credit spreads where they are, the cost of money, the cost of goods sold in our company period is obviously much, much higher, and we've been regularly passing through the higher cost of money to our businesses so they can again make good economic decisions for the shareholders on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 19 now, I'll just recap the numbers or let you read them yourselves. These are just refreshes of the pages we showed you the night of the WaMu announcement. That top table on page 19 just shows you the 31 billion of tangible assets acquired from WaMu as booked on their books net of our write-downs and purchase accounting and the consideration we paid gets you to the estimated after-tax gain of 581 for the quarter as well as the conforming loan loss reserve adjustments you see at the bottom. I'll make the same caveat on this page that these are our best estimates as we sit here now and to expect some future refinements to these numbers if necessary.</p>
          <p>One last slide on WaMu is page 20. Think of this as a preamble to the disclosure we're going to be giving you in future quarters, which really goes to the loan balances and the reserves associated with those since obviously we took a lot of loans and marked them down. I just wanted you to understand how it's going to flow through our numbers. So over to the left, you see the first three columns, it's just JPMorgan standalone before WaMu. You see our loan balances in the first blue row. If you follow your eye across there, the next column is our loan loss allowance, $14.5 million related to loan coverage and that's 2.72% loan loss reserve coverage.</p>
          <p>When you move to the middle, you see WaMu, but first I'll point you over to the side. Remember that we took $108 billion worth of WaMu loans that are credit impaired, the bad stuff. We wrote that down by the $30 billion to get to the $78 billion carrying value on our books now related to these loans for a markdown of just around 28%. What remains then is in the middle of the page under the green column for Washington Mutual loan balances, the remainder, the good stuff that wasn't marked down is $131 billion that needs normal loan loss reserves against it. So including the additional conforming loan accounting entry we booked, we have $4.5 billion of loan loss reserve related to the Washington Mutual loans that have reserves, and then those two columns &#x2013; those two sets of columns add over to JPMorgan consolidated. So again there are things moving through those numbers that we're going to be very clear when we get to our fourth quarter results on how it flows through the numbers.</p>
          <p>Washington Mutual integration on page 21, we'll just say that it's progressing well. An important point is that the deposit base is really stabilizing and growing since September 30 with positive net inflows on seven out of the past nine days.</p>
          <p>And then finally our outlook, I think I've hit all the comments here. I'll just say one or two things in addition that really across Retail, really across all the businesses, you see our comment that you can generally be expecting higher credit costs. And the worse economic conditions get, the more likely it is or it is likely if economic conditions worsen that we will continue adding to our loan loss reserves in coming quarters.</p>
          <p>But in Card in particular, if you see down there on the left side of the page, you can expect losses of the 5% or so range in the fourth quarter, which is in line with what we previously said. But given what we're seeing in the economy, it's reasonable at this stage to up the expectations for losses in Card for 2009, so we say here that you can expect something more to the tune of 6% loan losses at the beginning of the year growing to something more like 7% at the end of the year, but again highly dependent upon the economy.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, TSS, subject to market conditions; corporate the 50 to 100 earlier I described, and Washington Mutual the $0.50 of EPS incremental next year with a pro rata piece of that coming in the fourth quarter as I said earlier.</p>
          <p>So with all that, one other item is Paymentech gain from the dissolution of our Merchant Services business with First Data. That will be about an after-tax gain, assuming it goes through in early November on schedule, of 800 million, so after tax. But obviously given expectations for loan loss reserving, we will see. Don't expect that to be dropping to the bottom line is what I'd say.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me wrap that up and Jamie and I can take some questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give a couple overall comments before we take some questions. Obviously we necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment, but we don't know what the environment is going to be. Mike took you through all the credit numbers. If you look at them other than home lending, which we think is far worse than we would have expected, we're actually not that bad, non-performers, delinquencies, in Card, et cetera. But, but when you see this kind of unemployment, this kind of uncertainty, the reduced consumer spend, we are getting braced for increasing loan loss reserves going forward.</p>
          <p>So it's reasonable as a shareholder for you all to expect that trading results can be very tough going forward. The charge-offs are going to be going up. The loan losses reserve will be added for at least the next couple of quarters. But we're going into the environment with an extremely strong balance sheet, 8.9% Tier 1 before the government's addition to that, very strong loan losses reserves, we think among the strongest in the industry which probably would be strengthened going forward.</p>
          <p>I think of note when you go through this press release, there is real growth. In some areas, it's in market share like Investment Banking and mortgages even though it's a tough business. In other areas it's really raw growth in deposits and loans and you'll see that in TSS, Private Bank, Commercial, so we feel pretty good about it. Even in the Card business where we have low expectations for spend, our spend is up 5%. And from what we know, Visa numbers are more like zero, so we seem to be gaining a little bit of share there too.</p>
          <p>I also want to point out that in the Investment Bank, one of the things if you back out those losses, which we don't think you really should do, the trading results were pretty good. But another way to view that is that based on what we just went through in September and obviously for the whole quarter but September in particular, you've got to feel pretty good that with the violent swings in volatility that we were able to manage through that process across all of our products globally and not be highly surprised. That goes from the Lehman bankruptcy to the AIG issue to swings in certain securities of 25% in a day. And you can imagine what it is like to manage through that process.</p>
          <p>I think for our people here, I think it's very important to note it was an unbelievable thing to watch the people accomplish the WaMu acquisition, managing the portfolios, a lot of you saying people are dealing with clients on mortgages and issues, trying to do the right thing for clients every day. So it makes you really proud to watch what the people here are able to accomplish and it also portends very well what can be accomplished in the future.</p>
          <p>I'll also mention on the Treasury package because I know in the back of your minds &#x2013; we were presented with a package from the government, and this is the way the JPMorgan saw it. The government is trying to do &#x2013; the United States government is trying to do some very powerful things to fix the situation. A lot of people can cover the whole bunch of different programs, but they had one, and I think what they're doing in this package plus all the prior things that have been done is very powerful and you will start to see some effect. So we really saw this as doing something which is very good for the system.</p>
          <p>It is equally true if you said there are asymmetric benefits that could be a negative for JPMorgan versus the competition. That may very well be true, but we did not think that JPMorgan should be selfish or parochial in trying to stop what is good for the system because it might be mildly bad for us relative to some of our competitors, so we hope it will work. There is 25 billion of capital if it comes in the door. We hope to be able to find ways to use it to benefit our shareholders and to continue to be there for our clients.</p>
          <p>I do want to point out that we are there for our clients. Commercial loans are up 18%. The Investment Banking loans are way up. And a lot of the things we do every day, we're trying to do the best we can to be able to do it for our clients. Even in some categories if you ask the question, if you borrowed at today's marginal cost and lent out at today's yields in home equity and auto, you're probably losing money. But we're still trying to stay in business in the right way for people to walk into our branches and deal with our bankers.</p>
          <p>So we will stop there and open the floor to any questions you all may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering in the equity trading, could you comment on share gains in prime brokerage and also the contribution of the Bear Stearns business this quarter versus last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had some gain in prime broker, and I'm going to say if you look at total balance there, I'm going to go something like 25% over the quarter. Bear is performing the way we expect. But I don't remember the specific numbers of what it did in equity. It's definitely an improvement in P&amp;L over the last quarter, but not yet &#x2013; and I would still say we're tracking towards the incremental profits we expected to get by the end of '09, health in the business, but not a dramatic change in P&amp;L just yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's not yet a net positive but it should be still towards the 250 million per quarter by the end of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A small net positive, but not a big net positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the Credit Card business, the margin was up quarter to quarter. I was wondering if the prime LIBOR spread was something that started to hurt towards the end of the quarter and you expect that to impact you more going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number alone if it stayed where it is today, it would cost us $100 million a month in that business. We don't expect it to stay there, and obviously there are actions we can take to reduce it over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're right; it wasn't a significant factor in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And final thing on the Card, any changes towards the end of the quarter in payment rates and behavior as the market fell apart in terms of just revolve and payment rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spend numbers dropped from a year ago, and they're now running in the consumer side plus 3, 4, 5% a week. I think the industry is closer &#x2013; at least we know the Visa numbers are around zero. Payment rates came down a little bit, which you expect to see in an environment like this. And obviously, losses are trending upward in a nice steady fashion like we totally expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jamie, one question on the government's plan with the preferred, do you expect them to be restrictive on how banks deploy the capital or pretty much free rein for the banks to use their discretion subject to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's a non-voting preferred, so we don't expect the government to get involved in our business. But it's clear that the government would like us to use the capital to facilitate clients, to make loans, and stuff like that, and we want to do that too. So I think we have a common interest in this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

          <p>Hi, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow up on the use of the government capital. Would you think it's reasonably leverageable especially given the availability of the debt guarantee or is the government actually you think expecting you to maintain Tier 1 close to 12%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I don't think the government is telling us what to do with the capital. When you say leverageable, I think you can use it. We fully expect to use some of it to do a good job for shareholders. The government guarantee on the debt side just makes it easier for banks to roll over their liabilities. Some banks were having trouble doing that; JPMorgan was not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably given that you'll be receiving an injection of 25 billion of Tier 1 capital if you leveraged it even a few times over and use the fact that you can borrow it basically treasuries plus 75, given the 75 basis point cost of the guarantee, it would seem like it could actually be an interesting opportunity. Or am I looking at it wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the right way to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you are a bank that's filling a hole, you obviously can't do that. If you're a bank that's not filling a hole, obviously you can do some of that. We just got it, so we haven't even got it yet, so we're just sitting here making sure we do it right. Obviously it will relate to the environment you see going ahead. It's very important for us just like I think it's very important for the government that all of these institutions be able to weather whatever happens coming forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you plan to use the TARP [Troubled Asset Relief Program] asset sale facility to reduce some of those mortgage exposures that you talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's highly relevant to us honestly, and we're down to smaller numbers now. So the answer is probably not, but we'll see how the details come out and we'll figure it out then. I think the TARP facility when it comes out may very well help the markets, and that will help anyone who wants to trade in those markets because you'll have real prices and real discovery and real ability to how you manage your own assets and capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; fair point. Finally just to follow up on Bear Stearns, given what you paid for the company versus the book value that they stated at the time of the merger and the fact that you didn't record an extraordinary gain there, you would essentially be carrying maybe $10 billion of reserves. And you talked about a variety of the things that those were set up for, but largely it would be for securities valuation, and I was just wondering. Have you burned through all those reserves at this point and would some of the securities losses that you showed this quarter have been from the Bear Stearns portfolio or do you still have some of those valuation reserves available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've been clear right from the beginning. There are no valuation reserves, okay, ever in the Bear Stearns deal. All those assets came over and were marked fair value, at fair value. There were reserves for litigation, severance, a whole bunch of stuff like that, but they were our best estimate. There is nothing left over from Bear Stearns. If you said what would your losses have been in mortgages this quarter had you not done the Bear Stearns deal, my guess is about 40% of that came from Bear Stearns.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no Fed backup. The Fed is financing $30 billion of assets and we're taking the first 1.1 billion or whatever the number is of loss there. Again, we've been very consistent. We think the Fed is going to get all their money back, and we expect to get a little bit of our first loss note back too, but I don't know. They're managing that. It's up to them, and it depends how they manage it over time. They make their own reports by the way what they think the market value of that is, and the last report I saw said it was about...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you made any changes to mark-to-market accounting? I guess there has been a lot of noise from the SEC, and there's an IASB [International Accounting Standards Board] proposal for European banks that would allow them to move assets from fair value accounting to more loan-type accounting. Any views on all this, any changes ahead or any changes already made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made no changes to our accounting. I think what the SEC guidelines sent out is that in markets where there is no trading, you've got to use your judgment in models and stuff like that. We have made no change in ours. I think the European banks, we are already allowed if we want to move from a trading account to a held-to-maturity account. We took you all through that last time. We did do that with a little bit of stuff and put up a lot more reserves, not less, when we did that because as a matter of fact, we wanted more reserves. They said the banks can do that themselves in Europe now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last question, as far as your outlook, you mentioned the Lehman bankruptcy risks remain.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we're going to be fine on those risks, but we just want to point out it's really two things to simplify it a little bit. One is trading, and honestly all of us thought that if you ever saw what you call the major deal exit that it would be very tough on trading. It was, but I think it was &#x2013; I think the Street was able to get through that rather quickly and easily, but there are still some open issues relating to that, but not big. And the second is we were a huge financing tri-party agent, and we have collateral against that, and some of that collateral we have to liquidate, and some of that collateral belongs to some other people, and we think that will all sort out.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about the Card business? We realize that the House had passed some legislation that potentially will make its way to the Senate in the beginning of the year, and you've got the Fed regulators looking at a proposal for an open common period. What are you doing in the Card business to prepare yourself for the potential that these regulations or legislation changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, keep in mind that we already had eliminated double-cycle billing, and we had already eliminated off plus pricing. That is where we were pricing &#x2013; that we changed your pricing because of a FICO score change or something like that. So two of the biggest things that people complain about, we already don't do, so put them to the side. That costs us money. I forgot the number we disclosed here at one point. It's up like 3 or $400 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the other stuff and there's a whole bunch of stuff out there, I would put in the category of it could be significant, so any one change on its own could be hundreds of millions of dollars or something like that. In total, they could be well over a billion, but there are actions that would take place that would change a lot of that. So for example, if you can't reprice your loans, you're not going to make certain types of loans. If you have to have people pay off teaser rate loans last on a series of loans, we're not going to make teaser rate loans. So a lot of that stuff I think competitively it'll cause changes in profits in the short run but not in the long run. It will change the prices. If you cannot price for risk, you're going to charge everybody else more. That's what's going to happen. So...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I know in your proposal or in your comments to the Fed, you indicated that the industry or your portfolio in particular would be smaller. Can you give us any sense of the degree to which you think you might need to pull back on outstandings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we already have, but honestly like some of the teaser outstandings that we had to pull back on weren't that profitable anyway. So we're going to run the business for profit. If outstandings go down $10 billion, so be it.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. And when you did the WaMu announcement, you indicated a slide where you had your home lending loss severity expectations based on current estimates, deeper recession, severe recession. Based on what you were saying earlier, it seems like you might be triangulating more towards a deeper recession in your outlook. Is that fair to say or not?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me explain, so corporate has a $100 billion portfolio, and that portfolio is for interest rate exposures, for collateral reasons, to manage the balance sheet of the company. We are moving some of that portfolio slowly and carefully into higher yielding assets because remember, we're here for shareholders and some of these assets we think are going to give great returns to shareholders over time. So it's not in a great rush, but those assets will include a little bit of AAA CLO, a little bit of bank preferred, a little bit of Alt-A, a little bit of CMBS. We're not going to do it ad hoc, we're going to just do it over time, so those assets that move are the same kind of assets that we're buying. And they were moved at fair value, so there was no benefit to anyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as we then look, are they marked to market...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of those will continue to be marked to market in the Treasury portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you will see a little more volatility in corporate because more of the assets there are being held in a trading portfolio because they have &#x2013; there are a whole bunch of reasons they have to be. But again, like we said, we are here for shareholder results and if we have to take a little bit more risk to do a good thing for shareholders, we'll willing to take a little more volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know there is no way to normalize trading revenues, but if we back out the big markdowns of 3.6 billion in the quarter, trading revenues looked really, really good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that kind of, wow, that was fantastic; we'll never see that again. I'm just surprised given how much volatility there was in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, it was an exceptional performance. Some areas I think the rising tide lifted all boats, so I think you'll see a lot of trading debts in certain currencies and certain rates and other areas where the rising tide lifted all boats. In other areas, our people did an exceptional job. Emerging markets, we were hedged for a downturn on the equity side. We were prepared and positioned for markets going down, so we benefited from that. We're not taking big bets on it, but it was a pretty good performance. Again, we don't expect that to repeat though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally from a deposit standpoint, almost 970 billion on the balance sheet is more than at least I was expecting combining you guys with Washington Mutual and factoring in some growth to that. Can you talk at all about &#x2013; are you gaining more market share there? Are there any pricing pressure changes on the deposit side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think in the market share side and the wholesale side, yes. You see that in TS&amp;S, and we think in Private Bank, the answer would be yes. Retail, the answer is no, and part of the reason, we aren't competing aggressively for funds, nor are we in areas where you have this big flight to quality. So if you were in California or Florida and you were strong, you had a big inflow. If you were in California or Florida and you were strong, you had a big inflow. We weren't in California or Florida, so we weren't the beneficiary of flight to quality in California and Florida. But we think we're probably gaining a little bit of share, and I think the deposits in the last month are up $100 billion in total. That number may be off a little bit, but it's a huge number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have a few questions that are all interrelated. You didn't quantify how many of your businesses are impacted by the prime LIBOR inversion. I just want to be clear in terms of the decline in originations on your mortgage portfolio. Was that more credit based or in terms of tightening underwriting standards or prime LIBOR challenge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Prime LIBOR has a huge negative effect, as we were talking about, on Card. It has a modest beneficial effect across some other businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not a big deal, and it doesn't directly affect the origination business. The origination business, and I think this is true for a lot of people in the industry, Meredith, people have gone back to old-fashioned 80% LTV, real verified income, more disciplined appraisals. And then in some areas they weren't even going to 85% LTV because they expected home decreases. So we are not at 80% in California, Nevada, or Florida. I don't remember exactly where we are at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>65 is the max.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're at 65, so that's why it's down. I think it's true for us and everybody else, almost everything being originated is eligible for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or FHA. So therefore, you have this great reduction for us and for other people in origination. Obviously the quality of that stuff is going to be much higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up is &#x2013; and thank you for that. My follow-up is given the fact that the industry is pulling back credit across the board, is that a chicken and egg question? Are you seeing areas where you have pulled back credit deteriorating much further? Obviously the sand states are experiencing the most credit deterioration, but have you given a test example of pulling back credit in one area and seeing all your competitors and that be a catalyst for a chronic increase in deteriorating credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is probably yes, but we'll never really know. And so if everyone pulls credit out of California, obviously it will accelerate the depreciation of homes in California and make it harder and scarier for people to provide credit.</p>
          <p>Let me just make a general comment about a crisis like this. One of the things that happens which I think the government is focusing on is there are a lot of individual actors. I'm talking about you as investors, banks as providers of credit, individuals, small businesses, large businesses, all start to take actions that are rational for them as an individual or a corporation, but in total can cause exactly what you're talking about. And that's one of the things that the government is trying to reverse.</p>
          <p>It's not just the banks. It's the individuals who invest in banks. It's people who provide capital to other financial institutions, as I pointed out, or moving the money back overseas, so you do see a little bit of that, and they're trying to arrest that. That is the one thing that has got people most scared and they're trying to stop. Like I said before, I think what the government is doing is pretty powerful medicine. I should say the governments around the world are pretty powerful medicine, and I think you will start to see some beneficial effect of that in the next couple weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In theory, though, if you really believed that, you would be gunning credit card lines, right, because you believe that the inversion would abate on LIBOR?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not big speculators, but we are buying slightly more risky assets and we're growing our businesses everywhere, so we're not panicking. Credit cards are up, credit card receivables are up. We're not pulling out of California, we're still going there. We're still marketing, obviously trying to modify what's going on. We're not going to say yahoo, this is over, and extend credit like we did without fear. If you're not fearful, you're crazy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Some of the other investment banks provided some pretty good color in terms of where they have certain assets marked within their investment bank. I just wondered if you guys would be willing to provide that same level of detail across prime, Alt-A, subprime, CMBS. You give the exposure reductions, but we don't really know where those things are marked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Leveraged loans we did, and I'll give you some numbers right now, are you ready? Prime loans is not applicable, securities high 50s, Alt-A performing about mid-70s, nonperforming 40s, that's loans. Alt-A securities high 20s, subprime mid 30s, CMBS loans mid-80s, securities mid-70s. That's all we're going to give you because it's competitive information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's extremely helpful. And then in terms of the Retail Financial Services, just getting a better understanding again, if I look at the charge-off rates for the loans that are &#x2013; the prime loans that are in Retail Financial Services, it looks like it's about 96 basis points this quarter versus the charge-offs for corporate which are about 30, about one-third. So I'm just trying to understand again what's the difference between those prime mortgages held in RFS versus corporate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We may change the reporting of that and combine it so we don't cause this confusion going forward. One other thing I should mention, Mike mentioned it, but when we look at the mortgage business by the way that we looked at the 12 billion ongoing is trading, it's moving, that's what we need to do to service clients. Properly marked, you shouldn't see huge &#x2013; obviously there is risk in trading but it should be back to more normal risk. And there is 6 billion which I would put &#x2013; it's marked but I would put it in as liquidating, very hard to trade. There are certain residuals you can't trade at all, and it's marked down to we're going to get &#x2013; I believe we're going to get very substantial returns, from 10 to 20%, as we liquidate it using fairly bad assumptions. We don't like it, but it's not that big a deal anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally the commentary in terms of your outlook, you talked about basically expecting or having lower expectations for earnings within the Investment Banking result. Is that relative to this quarter or is that just in general what we should be expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just think you should be very cautious on guessing what the environment is going to be. So this crisis isn't over, so we're just guessing like you can guess on your own. We don't know anything that you don't know. We're just guessing that it still could be pretty tough out there for a while. We might have some more markdowns. Mike had mentioned that we have really healthy loan loss reserves. We have $77 billion of loans I think the number is. We have almost 4% up against that. That's historically high, but it's very idiosyncratic. If one big company fails, that could be a huge loss for us. So we're prepared for it to be a little bit tougher in the Investment Bank. We hope to make some money, but we're not going to count on it for now.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anticipation might cause some of that. Surprisingly, we haven't really seen anything in agencies, agency MBS, where the spreads are still damn near the highs, and we think those are probably very good buys.</p>

          <p>I think the second you see a levelization of charge-offs with some certainty going forward, that you don't need any additions to reserves. Keep going until all the questions are asked.</p>

          <p>Hi; thanks. On the Treasury program, if you think a little longer term, there are some incentives to buy back the preferred stock that the Treasury is taking, the number of warrants, the higher coupon. I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on how you think about you may want to issue stock to buy back the preferred, and also just maybe how many warrants you think are going to be issued under the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so once we decide to go in the program, I was thinking can we've 50 billion. So think of it this way. Obviously by the time you get to 9%, you'll probably want to have paid it off, and the warrants are equal to the value you're getting. So in our case, they're going to get warrants if the way it's currently written, ten-year warrants on $3.75 billion of stock. Those warrants are worth you can estimate at 1.2 billion, whatever you come up with, which is an additional cost on the 25 billion. So it's 5% &#x2013; that's the way I look at it, a year, plus another 5% for the full term. You just monetize the cost of the warrants, so it's not bad money that way.</p>
          <p>There is a way if you refinance it sooner, you're going to refinance it with real Tier 1 capital, that you can eliminate half the warrants and we'll deal with that in due course. That to me becomes truly a financial decision there if you do that or not do that, but the government made this part of it not an unattractive thing so that people can get the capital, use the capital, and hopefully do some good with the capital.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't follow the part about the warrants. How many warrants or warrants for how many shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not shares. It's warrants for $3.75 billion worth of stock. You can do your own share calculation. The market value of those warrants would be something like 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion. You can use your own model.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can use your own model. I'm simply saying think of that, of the whole 25 billion, it's 5%, maybe 6%. So if you spread it over the first five years of the 5% of money, your money is costing you 6.5%. It's still cheaper than most of us can raise money at today. And it's real Tier 1, so it's very cheap Tier 1. So to that extent, it's not a bad economic transaction.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a way to reduce them at one point, but you could argue that for a lot of people, they won't want to because it's cheaper capital than they can otherwise get if they think they can do something with it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And then the other part of the FDIC program besides the debt guarantee was the checking account guarantee. Are you going to opt into that? And if so, what will be the cost be?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what they said is 10 basis points in that. And think of that as an operating account guarantee. I think the real point of that wasn't for JPMorgan. It's really for smaller community banks and stuff who do a lot of business with small business and middle market, and they don't want those people to be afraid that their operating accounts are at risk.</p>

          <p>Jamie, this is a philosophical question that may require more foresight than you've got right now, but this Treasury program that was announced yesterday I think came as a bit of a surprise to everybody. It seems to have been done with a few days thought and mostly as a result of what happened in Europe. But what is your feeling about how this has changed the dynamic for capital raising going forward? Is it going to make it more expensive for the banking industry to raise capital beyond this period of Treasury investment? Can you just give me your philosophical thoughts about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, I don't really think so. I think that one day, everything will have normalized again. That might be three years out or five years out. I think what they really want to do, and I don't know how long they worked on this, so I wouldn't assume it was just three days. I do think they had to do something relative to the rest of the word. So if you were in their shoes, you would look at it and say if the rest of the world is guaranteeing deposits and the United States not, and the rest of the world &#x2013; you might create other consequences. But I agree with you, making policy on the run is a very hard thing to do, and it always has these huge unintended consequences, which is really hard to forecast ahead of time or have any foresight on at all. But I think one day it will normalize, and it will make raising capital more expensive for banks. We will just go back to more normal world and people will probably spend a lot more attention on credit, which they should.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just you have been a huge beneficiary of basically institutional failures in this environment. Is it your sense that this Treasury program will slow that process? Is it intended to slow the process? It is intended to prop up banks that should probably fail? Is that one of the unintended consequences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that one of the consequences is that this program obviously helps the weaker more than it helps the strong. I think I mentioned at the beginning that if you don't want to be parochial or selfish, as long as it's really materially helping the system, we all should be in favor of it. So you can sit around the table and argue all day long that we would have been better off, but you're not better off if the system goes down. I don't think the intent on the Treasury, I think the very conscious of they don't intend to hold up failing banks, and you haven't seen them do that. What you've seen them do is be pretty aggressive to try to get failing banks in the hands of good owners. So they're going to have to out this program. That will be in the details how they manage it, so we'll all be looking at how they really manage it going forward and we'll be second guessing them too at one point.</p>
