          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Petrobras conference call to discuss the third quarter 2011 results. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Today, with us we have Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa, Petrobras CFO and Investor Relations Officer, and his staff. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Theodore Helms, Investor Relations Executive Manager of Petrobras, who has some additional comments. Please go ahead, Mr. Helms.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss third quarter 2011 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site <mark type="ph" /> www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english (sic) [www.petrobras.com.br/ri/] (0:52).</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the slide two. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, and Brazilian legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions that you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss third quarter results. We're having this slide number three &#x2013; the highlights of this quarter and I call your attention to the part that operating income and the EBITDA were stable when compared with the second quarter. And this is important for the company that has a very large investment program. We kind of said also that net income of R$6.3 billion in the quarter were affected heavily by the 19% evaluation of the Real but in terms of cash generation there were no impact. And this is really what matters. Also the Real valuates &#x2013; depreciates again, then we will look over all these results.</p>
          <p>The start-up of P-56 in the quarter was the second important event for helping increasing the production for the remaining of the year and beginning of next year. With Pre-salt we have a very important event that was Lula-Mexilh&#xE3;o Gas Pipeline start-up. The conclusion of this pipeline will allow to produce more oil and ship the gas onshore for supply into the Brazilian market. The conclusion of Extended Well Test of Guar&#xE1; and the start-up of Carioca Northeast Extended Well Test is another event in the Pre-salt. We are here the in the conclusion of the second well in the Franco area that gave us a good information on the potential of the area. That confirms we will have the oil to be produced from that area. That is about 60% of the terms or rights we acquired last year &#x2013; about 3 billion barrels of oil. It's important to state also that Petrobras was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year this year. This shows how Petrobras is evolving.</p>
          <p>Next slide. We have the main indicators and confirming what I said, EBITDA and operating income were &#x2013; stable net income of 0.2% when compared with the second quarter. This is due to the depreciation of the Real, but the average price we are selling the products that generate the net income and the cash flow for the company was only one Real below due to the adjustment of the Brent that was about 3% in the quarter. And the production of the company was stable and on that mark grew, we are going to analyze using more detail in the next slide.</p>
          <p>The production was up with &#x2013; the total production up 1.2% when compared with 2010, and this was due to the installation of many systems that is indicated in the slide. And these systems are not in their full &#x2013; into peak production yet. It's slow to increase production for some time, for the rest of the year and some of them will grow over the year to be completed and reaching the peak production in the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>Following slide, please? Internationally, we have a decline in the production mainly to Nigeria. That's where we have ended that contribution to the production of Petrobras, as we were collecting our cost oil investment we have done. We have already collected all we were allowed for, so now we are going to take part of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:35) of that production. So we started paying tax oil in Nigeria, that reduced the production as well as in Ecuador where we left &#x2013; we had a small production from one year to the other but the most of it was caused by the unprogrammed stoppage that we had in Brazil, we are going to discuss this in more details in the slides to come.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, we can show we are &#x2013; we have this slide to show how production behaves and we have here two lines, one blue and one red. The blue line is there to show how one field is expected to perform when the equipment used in the field for production performs 100% in terms of efficiency; and there is a natural decline due to the reservoir performance. But in the case of what we are seeing in Brazil lately, we had the red line where the reservoir performance, there were no larger declines than what was expected, but the difference between the two lines is exactly due to the performance of the equipment, it's not due to the reservoir, and this has caused the production to reduce over time.</p>
          <p>But as we repair the equipment that were stopped in an unprogrammed way, we will recover that production. We can see this more details, or more precisely in the next slide that shows the production of Marlim. Historically you can see on the left hand upper side that historically the decline of Marlim is about 10% a year. But looking at the last six months to one year &#x2013; one year &#x2013; from one year to now you can see on the right hand side that there were two valleys in the production; one in September/October last year due to the interdiction, the stoppage of one block from them and again in this quarter where three platform has been stopped for repairs, that was P-20, P-35 and P-37.</p>
          <p>You can see in the lower part of the slide that we lost due to this maintenance and operational problems we had in this field; we lost 79,000 barrels per day in average in the quarter but due to the improvement in the other wells in the same area we added another 27,000 barrels were to &#x2013; brought us to a balance of 52,000 barrels per day of loss in the quarter. As this platform that I mentioned returned to production, we are going to see that the average production of the field will not change in time. It will follow the tendency you can see from 2002 up to now.</p>
          <p>In the next slide you can see more details not only to Marlim field but in general for all the fields that are producing in Petrobras, how much are from programmed stoppage and unprogrammed stoppage cost us in terms of oil production. First quarter there were more losses of production due unstop &#x2013; unprogrammed than programmed. The second quarter we had our larger number of programmed stoppage, and the third quarter then the unprogrammed grew again at all together in average, during the year we lost 44,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>And as we add new <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:20) to repair the production facilities because to do the repair that I needed it when they are stopped, if it's not programmed we are not prepared to start immediately, so there is an extra cost and extra time. So as we have everything in the program under control, the costs can reduce and their production loss can be reduced as well. And this is the main goal we are aiming at as we discuss with ANP, the new standards we need to follow to do the repair required by the agency.</p>
          <p>And so the next slide you can see how we expect production will perform here mainly due to new wells that shall be added to the production. You see that for the nine months of this year, we have added 35 wells, being 15 of them all in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter we have an order of 22 wells, four of them  have been already connected during October and there are 16 going on during November and December. So 55 wells will be connected at the end of the year and most of them or a good portion of them will contribute this more production from P-57, P-56 the most recently equipment that has been installed by the company.</p>
          <p>And adding to all that, we had three new flotels that are floating hotels where we can accommodate people to do the repairs on the platforms. So these UMSs are very important because of the limitation of room in the platforms when we need to operate them and at the same time to do some repairs. There is a limited space to work and to live. So as we have this accommodation in another unit you can anticipate and accelerate all the repairs on the platforms and the number of FPSOs in production in Petrobras requires us to develop this alternative and it seems that it's going to add some new capacities for the company.</p>
          <p>In the next slide we can see what we are planning for next year in terms of new and potential production. We are working with more than 400,000 barrels per day of new capacity and this will come mainly in the second half of the year. But we hope all these new units elsewhere are the ones that are still with room to increase production; we'll have them ramping up more rapidly than we have seen in the past. This is due to the fact that we have a larger number of rigs we started this year with 15, today we are operating 23 rigs, able to drill in waters as deep as 3,000 meters and we are expecting to receive another 15 up to the end of next year and this is a very critical equipment for the development of production for the exploration, for production for repairing of the unit that are in production to work overs. So we are really <mark type="ph" /> important (18:22) equipment and we are going to have more of them available in the company.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you can see a little bit of reflects of the availability of this new number of rigs. 34 wells has been drilled in the Pre-salt <mark type="ph" /> ramp (18:46) and the production is really growing in the second quarter, we have said, we were producing by then about 130,000 barrels per day. Now we are near 180,000 barrels per day and we hope in the future, we can present to you more and more of this production as we have &#x2013; we are seeing a very large productivity with second well in the Lula <mark type="ph" /> Spirit (19:24) Pilot, add 25,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>We are going to have a third one up to the end of this month from add to the Lula's Pilot and the first one is still producing what was done previously in the second quarter &#x2013; 20,000 barrels of oil plus that's what leads to <mark type="ph" /> 35,000 barrels of Boe (sic) [53,000 barrels of Boe] (20:02). So here is what we have from the Pre-salt that still how prices are performing in the next slide.</p>
          <p>You can see that prices &#x2013; we are selling the oil produced in Brazil has reduced a little more than the great price and this reflects of the market and we produce a heavier oil in the market that is slowing down the heavy crude, it can lose price, in terms of price it can have a higher reduction of price than the more light oil and looking at the domestic prices in dollars we have a big reduction in price in the last months because of the exchange rate. But when you see in Reais there were only one barrel of reduction in terms of average realization price, so that's great. We have adjusted beginning of November gasoline by 10% and diesel by 2% and this is not in this graph yet; the graph goes to the end of September.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, we can see the cost performance. We have seen along this year an increase in the lifting costs of the company and this is largely due to unprogrammed stoppage that cost us more in terms of material, equipment, services, but this reflects on the total cost of the production is reduced as well. Remember for new platforms that were installed last year is in the ramp up process and some extra costs too up to the moment that they will reach the full production.</p>
          <p>So we hope is the return of the platforms that were stopped plus the reaching of the ramping up of production, the total production. We hope we are going to reduce costs to a level more close to R$18, R$19 per barrel. The government take is a function of the international price as international price is reduced, we have effect in Brazil in the amount we have paid.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, we have the production of oil products in Brazil as well as the market performance although we had a very good performance in terms of production by our refineries in Brazil mainly diesel and gasoline where we have increased substantially when compared with last year.</p>
          <p>The market has grown even more &#x2013; up 4% total production an increase against 9% in the market. And these two oil products &#x2013; diesel and gasoline are &#x2013; were the most, the one that contributed most to the total demand of Brazil. This is good for Petrobras, that is the supplier, but at this moment we are importing most of what we are supplying to the market and this does not add much to our margin. What we have produced here yet, this is one of &#x2013; one way to add more margin to our total sales but the import fraction is very small or no margin to the company.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the natural gas market and production. There were 2% growth in production and supply was mainly from domestic production. We have an increase on the non-thermoelectrical sector, mainly the industrial sector, and here is not included the gas that is consumed by our activities; our refineries have increased the volume of gas used in the production. And the production of fertilizer were higher in this period than previously and this has demanded more gas and this gas was supplied as you can see on the right hand side, for the national production that grew from 30 million to 38 million cubic meters a day when compared with last year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, we can see the operating income and we sold more as we have shown you and this has produced more income to the company, but the cost of goods sold has increased because &#x2013; and almost take all the extra revenue we collected in the period mainly because of the need to import almost all the &#x2013; or a good more amount of what we have sold. There are other items that did not contribute much, but except for other expenses that has helped it to increase a little bit our operating income.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows the net income and there we have figure where can see the financial results, how big it was in the period and most of that was due to the deprecation, the valuation of the Real about US$6.6 billion &#x2013; it's not dollar, it's R$6.6 billion &#x2013; there is a mistake on the first bullet. And this is what the deprecation was to the company due to the recognition in the balance sheet, that the debt we have that is indexed to dollar has increased when we have a new exchange rate. But that is the gross amount.</p>
          <p>If we take out of that R$6.6 billion about R$1.5 billion, R$1.6 billion, that is due to minority interest variation then we come a gross amount to Petrobras of R$5 billion, and after netting it with taxes that R$5 billion, that was increased or reduced taxes. We have a net final effect of exchange rate of about R$3.5 billion; that is the difference we can see in the financial results in taxes. And the minorities there, R$1.53 billion, that is added back to the results, that led us to the R$6.3 billion, that is 42% below last quarter. But <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:10) rate recovers and if Real appreciates again, we are going to see these results coming back to the company; but the cash flow were not affected by this movement. Next please.</p>
          <p>Looking to the E&amp;P results &#x2013; operating income of E&amp;P and comparing with the last quarter you see a very small difference. While price has reduced because international price has fallen <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:56) there were R$1 billion of reduction in the operating income and this &#x2013; the cost of goods sold were increased as we've shown in the total costs of the period and has reduced the operating income as well. We <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:31) the E&amp;P has sold or transferred more oil in the quarter. You can ask why this has happened because production was 1% down; but we have extra volume that were produced and not transferred in the previous quarter &#x2013; that has happened to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:58) during this quarter.</p>
          <p>The volume by selling more oil or transferring more oil has increased the cost of goods sold as well and the operational expenses that are cases that, like exploration expense, that was reduced by more than R$400 million and Indemnification from an arbitration dispute that added almost R$340 million to the results of E&amp;P and this led to R$15.68 billion of result the period.</p>
          <p>The downstream is not so bright, not because of the performance of the area as we've shown, we produced more oil product, but they were affected by the price that has fallen R$1 per barrel and this is due to the adjustment of the items that is adjust currently with international price. The area of downstream has reduced in the quarter the refining costs and so news has improved the results and &#x2013; but they sold more and they collect more revenue from the sales &#x2013; that costs has &#x2013; due to the fact that they have sold more, they have to pay more for these goods sold. And this has reduced the income by R$2 billion, almost a little more than the revenue they collect for the extra sales. Operating expenses was a small reduction due mainly to the adjustment of the worker agreement in September. So it led, finally to more than R$4 billion of loss in the third quarter for the downstream.</p>
          <p>Next slide, we look at gas and power international and the distribution. Gas and power, the main effect was gas sold for the industry that has increased the demand and so now they have the recognition of some fiscal credits in the period. Operating income of international were affected heavily by the price being reduced by the adjustment of inventory to market due to the price adjustment as well, as well as the case of Nigeria &#x2013; that is the main producers, producer of international <mark type="ph" /> area (35:47) that were reduced due to the fact that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:49) has ended there. And in distribution, there were some higher incomes due to the 7% increase in the market, and this led them to have a better result in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, we have the investments, and the total of CapEx in the quarter was almost R$51 billion, about 10% less than last year; but let's look in details. You can see that E&amp;P did exactly the same amount of investment in this quarter &#x2013; in this year than in the last year. The downstream is about R$2.1 billion less this year, mainly because of the acquisition of <mark type="ph" /> Brascan/Braskem (37:06) that has happened the beginning of last year. And gas and energy reduced substantially but this was expected because of the main CapEx investment of gas and energy; has been the main project, has been completed and there were no programmed CapEx for the year. It's according to the programmed total and the other ones are small, very small variation as well.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the next that shows our leverage and liquidity. What's important here is that liquidity is about the same. We reduced from June to September about R$4.5 billion in terms of liquidity. It's according to the planned volume as well; but when you see the net debt, it has increased a lot. The net debt in June 30 is wrong, it's not R$6.8 billion. It might be R$60 billion or something like R$61 billion that has grown to R$91 billion due to some increase &#x2013; mainly due to the depreciation of the Real.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>R$69 &#x2013; from R$69 to R$91. So there is still, very large, more than R$20 billion in terms of debt that has increased in the period net debt but this is the depreciation of the Real against dollar. The leverage net debt-to-EBITDA has increased as a consequence and the other &#x2013; the net debt in dollars is about US$5 billion more than previously.</p>
          <p>So with that, we have ended our presentation and we &#x2013; if you have any questions to answer you -together with our colleagues that are present here. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Emerson Leite of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I have three quick questions. First is related to the block BMS-9, you recently requested to ANP an extension of the evaluation period before declaration of commerciality. I would like to understand what were the reasons for such extension and how these will affect your plans? I know from the release that the company suggested this won't have an impact on the Pre-salt development, but I would like to get a sense how come a change in this part of the production &#x2013; of the commercial production of almost two years has no impact in the overall plans for the Pre-salt? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is related to your comment that the decline in production from Campos has to do with equipment availability and nothing to do with geological reasons. Could you provide to us what are the percentage of water cuts in the Marlim field at the moment and what's the average percentage of water cuts in the Campos Basin overall? That will be the second question.</p>
          <p>And the third one is related to this spill in the Frade field experienced by Chevron as operator, but Petrobras is a partner there. Do you believe this event or this incident could have an impact in terms of future drilling plans in the area or in the basin with ANP changing their procedures or something along those lines? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lots of questions, Emerson, but let's try to answer all of them. Extension of BMS, the commercialization -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I can help that, Emerson. Due to the result made so far  we have in this block, we ask them extension as we said in the declaration of commercial feasibility of the area through the end of 2013 and they said that there will be no impact in the production effort and that is true. If you see our project, until 2013, there is no platform in the Carioca area, so it was planned already after 2013. So there will be no impact in the production <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:41) of Carioca. The other areas are more advanced and that's why we are developing first at Guar&#xE1;, Lula <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:41) and that is the reason why there will be no impact in our development plan.</p>
          <p>Regarding the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:08), I don't have the number right now. You asked in the Marlim field, I think it's more than 50%, but I don't have the exact number right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Molinari, sorry, just a follow-up on what you said about Carioca. So the declaration of commerciality would expire at the end of this year. So the fact that you didn't have any system anticipated for the area until 2013 in the first place means that you were already counting on this extension or means that in case you didn't get the extension it wouldn't make much of a difference because you were not so confident in Carioca anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it's not that we are not so confident in Carioca. It's only that we are doing, we proposed the additional drilling in the area, we drill up to three wells and drilling Extended Well Test in the area. So it's not that we are not confident in Carioca.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:32) we believe -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I can check that information, yes that was of the Marlim field, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding Frade and if I recall the question was regarding what would be the impact on the operation in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you anticipate that this could spark a broader say reaction from ANP becoming more strict toward delaying drilling somehow obviously they're &#x2013; a lot of people looking at it. It's a much smaller scale of an event but the recent Macondo situation in the U.S. brings about memories and then people start to wonder if this would have an impact in the Brazilian activities somehow since you are closer to the development. I'm just asking if you anticipate or if you are seeing any such reaction up until now?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So from the point of view and my point of view and I might know it's too early to draw any conclusion on that. This is a very different case as far as I know. I don't know if Molinari has more to say about; but is the situation due to operational conditions that apply to that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:11)? I don't see a reason to take that and apply to all of that, but Molinari?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well after Macondo accident, I think all the national agencies around the world have increased concerns about deepwater drilling and they have raised the requirements. And we also, we have extensions by the national agency, especially this year in the third quarter we had no stopped platforms, no planned platform stoppages and I believe the requirements will stay. What we are working on right now is to have more visibility in the inspections that they are making so we can reduce the unplanned stoppages.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Paula here. My question is, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on this issue about salaries increase. You mentioned in the previous call that you provisioned R$600 million for &#x2013; was it for the third or for the fourth quarter? And then based on the &#x2013; you mentioned R$15 billion is the year-to-date cost with salaries, total cost with salaries, what would be the estimate number for the year? And then if we assume the 10% salaries increase that has been talked about in the local press, would it make sense to just apply that to the total salary number and assume this will be the recurring expense for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I don't have this figure. So we don't work on them. We don't have &#x2013; but maybe we have spent R$15 billion including the R$600 million up to September. The remaining of the year, we will not have the extra holiday increase normal salaries; there is in this R$600 million bonus that has stayed in this period, that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:58). Yeah, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but if you assume R$15 billion as average, R$20 billion would be the year average right? And then R$600 million is the bonus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you take R$5 billion per quarter -- you are not going to miss too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but then if it's a 10% increase, do we apply the 10% to the year number or this is &#x2013; this is total wage including outsources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Because &#x2013; in spite of this 10% is in the R$600 million that is paid as bonus. It does not happen every month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But aren't they talking about a 10% salary increase in average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The average I think is about 10%, close to 11%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just quickly on &#x2013; back to the <mark type="audio gap" /> (51:22) next year. Can you hear me?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. About the production increase for next year or about the platforms that are expected to come on stream, the four platforms, can we expect them to ramp up like the P-56, so doing well in six months or do you expect a ramp up of those platforms to be slower?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Paula, that's a very good question. The ramp up of those platforms will certainly be faster like the P-56 because where we have now the drilling rigs arriving and we plan to drill the wells before the platform arrives. So when we install the platform, we will have more wells all ready &#x2013; ready to be connected.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had a couple of questions. The first one, can you share with us your outlook specifically in terms of costs, lifting costs and refining costs going into the fourth quarter as well as the beginning of the year? You see any environment where you can &#x2013; you have the capability to reduce them or they will be more flattish, any color on those, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me have Molinari and <mark type="ph" /> Marcio (53:26) helping this answer. Please, Molinari?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the lifting cost <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:34) it will &#x2013; there are some movements like production that will benefit for more for a production growth in the fourth quarter. It will depend also in the exchange rate and the Brent price which is our reference. And we have increase in the Brent price, we have also increased in the cost specialized sales in the oil industry. So, it's &#x2013; say a combination of all those aspects that we will relieve the lifting cost up in the fourth quarter. But I should think that it will be in line with what we have in this third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Talking about the refining cost, we are expecting to have on the fourth quarter about the same that we had on the third quarter. That is US$5.2 per barrel. We are expecting to have a flat -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you look into 2012 from a refining cost point of view, given all that's happening in terms of upgrades and with the new refineries, do you see a trend in 2012, not '13, but 2012 where these costs could come down or they're going to be more flattish and really only begin to come down more in 2013 or '14?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably it's going to come down '13, '14 when we have the new refineries because right now we are just investing in quality. So we are increasing costs, but we are not increasing the amount of production. So basically it's going to be flat or a little bit higher than we are today, I mean I'm saying a little bit high because it's very small, but basically it's going to be flat.</p>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Actually for now to the beginning of next year basically we are investing just in quality, we don't have a coker 'til the beginning of next year. So I don't have all the units right here with me. I can return to you or I can give you the information on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:30).

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had some of them concluded right now in this quarter and probably the last quarter, we're going to have a large amount of them being concluded. So let me see if I can find the information right now, if I can get information right now, I can return to you, if not possible I can give it to you on the line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And a follow-up on that on the topic of refining margins, given the price increase that we &#x2013; that you announced recently, do you estimate that refining margins in the fourth quarter or even in the first quarter, if we assume oil prices remaining flattish, do you see your refining margins turning positive at all in the fourth or first quarter of next year or are we still in a break-even kind of negative territory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can tell you that the margins are going to be a little bit better, but &#x2013; on the third quarter &#x2013; on the fourth quarter, but probably we're going to have to import a little bit more especially gasoline, so I can tell you that's going to be...</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About the same, but do you see it being positive or should we &#x2013; in negative territory, negative refining margins until we can really &#x2013; we can get maybe a bigger increase in diesel prices, for example, into next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not giving you guidance on that piece. We expect to produce better results, but whatever they will be depends on a lot of variables and it is difficult to say at this moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And the last question on production, has your &#x2013; if we rewind to the second quarter conference call with your outlook then and now with respect to this ramp up in the October, November, December production, has it changed at all? Have things improved or gotten worse in terms of your expectations of this last quarter really showing a ramp up in production now versus what you expected three months ago?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the ramp up &#x2013; we had, I think I said we had 10 or 11 wells to start production, and we did so. The problem in the production growth in the third quarter was more on the non-planned platform stoppages, the P-56 and P-57 I said that in the year end we will be producing 80% of the capacity of those platforms, and we are still maintaining this indication. So, on the project everything is going well. The only aspect was more non-planned maintenance the period.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, 2.200 million is a peak &#x2013; daily peak production in the year end. If everything goes well, if we don't have any further non-planned stoppages, and if we connect all the wells we have connected through the end of the year, for the average of December, I said that we will be producing more than 2.100 million barrels per day as average for December.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. I have a couple of questions here. I just wanted to start on just the accounting of the quarter. There were a couple of one-offs that hit you, and I just wanted to check one of them. There is a post-tax adjustment of more than R$600 million that you guys booked on gas and power, and I wanted to know if you guys could actually give us some kind of clarity on where that comes from, as a starter.</p>
          <p>The second thing I wanted to check, on your chart on page eight of your presentation, I just wanted to double check, is the scale correct in that graph? Is that graph really going up to only something like 25,000 barrels or is it different than that, because the text on the slide doesn't really seem to jive with the graph?</p>

We're doing our revision on the procedures we found that we were not crediting for some taxes that were calculated previously, but now recognizing that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:44) as a credit and &#x2013; this is going to happen for the future.

          <p>And if I could ask just one last question, with regards to production, it was absolutely great that your guys put in a little bit more clarity on what's going to happen in 2012. I was just wondering &#x2013; I don't know if this is predictable or not, but is there anything that you already have &#x2013; have with visibility with regards to the <mark type="ph" /> Vajedura (65:33) project, that wouldn't be starting up in 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have in our production because it depends on exploratory effort to connect more of the <mark type="ph" /> Vajedura discovery in the distant (66:00) platforms. But we are doing a very big step on that, which is installation of subsea separation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:14) in the Marlim field. As I mentioned, the Marlim &#x2013; the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:19) for Marlim is high, and if we are able to separate the water subsea, we can release <mark type="ph" /> next phase (66:28) on the platform to put more oil like in the <mark type="ph" /> Vajedura (66:33) project. So that's a technological development. Within the six months we should stop the running &#x2013; stop running the subsea separator. We would have the idea and to apply that in several matured fields of the Campos Basin and that to put more oil from the <mark type="ph" /> Vajedura or the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (67:00), but I don't have a number for you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I'm wondering about your financing plans. You so far stuck to your guidance of not coming back to the dollar market after the US$6 billion multi-tranche jumbo earlier this year. You've met with investors in Europe. Looks like you were thinking about doing something there. What can we expect between now and the end of the year and in 2012 in terms of tapping credit markets? Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have raised so far up to the end of third quarter about R$28 billion of new debt. We did amortization of almost R$18 billion. So we added about R$10 billion of new cash to the company through debt. And this was done through many different ways, the largest of that was the bonds we issued at the beginning of the year of R$6 billion and the other ones are bilateral with banks or ECAs and development bank. We are always working and we are going to raise some extra amount during this quarter.</p>
          <p>We do not have targets for the quarter. It depends on many conditions, the market conditions. If the market is there, we can do more. If not, we can delay and do another that is on the market. In this, the liquidity we have provides us comfort to do and to work and such. And having a high liquidity as we ended the quarter with R$55 billion of liquidity, this is enough to provide us the cushion to keep our CapEx going on and managing the opportunities we have or the market present to us.</p>
          <p>We have a target of five years. We raised between R$60 billion and R$90 billion in five years. The first of these five years we have raised up to the end of the quarter about R$16 billion. So we are in line with what we have project.</p>

          <p>I don't have any preference, depends on the market. If market is there for us for the kind of debt we will be issuing, then we will be approaching that market. But it might be in good shape. We are not for any market, and the only thing I can tell you is that we don't go again to the dollar market this year.</p>
