      <speaker>
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to Procter &amp; Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K ,10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.</p>
          <p>As required by Regulation G, P&amp;G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and the after-tax impact of the global pharmaceuticals divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings excluding the gains on divestitures of our pharmaceuticals business. Core EPS refers to earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items. P&amp;G has posted on its Web site, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Bob McDonald and Teri List join me this morning. I'll begin today's call with a summary of second-quarter results. Teri will cover business highlights by operating segment. I'll then comment briefly on Venezuela and on pricing before providing guidance at the end of the call. Bob, Teri and I will take questions after our prepared remarks. And following the call, Teri, Mark Erceg, John Chevalier and I will be available to provide additional perspective as needed.</p>
          <p>We had a strong quarter, with organic volume growing 5%, a seven-point improvement versus last quarter. While the base period was admittedly a weaker one, this volume progress reflects a strong innovation program supported by higher media weights and sharper consumer value. Organic sales grew 5%, a three-point improvement versus last quarter, and at the top-end of our guidance range.</p>
          <p>Progress was broad based. Five of six reportable segments grew organic sales. Both developed and developing markets grew organic sales and volume, and showed sequential quarter-on-quarter improvement in growth rates. Foreign exchange added to organic sales, resulting in all-in sales being up 6%. All-in GAAP earnings per share were $1.49, $0.05 per share above the high-end of our guidance range. The overdelivery was driven by strong top-line growth and by margin expansion. All-in GAAP earnings per share were down 6% versus year-ago, reflecting a smaller gain on the pharmaceuticals divestiture than the gain on the Folgers divestiture that was in the base period year-ago.</p>
          <p>The current period gain on the sale of global pharmaceuticals business was $1.5 billion, which compares to a $2 billion gain on sale of Folgers.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share, which exclude one-time items, were up 22%. Gross margin was up 330 basis points, primarily due to lower commodity costs and our ongoing productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 160 basis points as higher gross margin was partially offset by higher SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A increased 170 basis points due to higher marketing support, the proactive conversion of bolivars into dollars ahead of the Venezuela currency devaluation, and the establishment of a reserve for potential legal liabilities.</p>
          <p>This reserve relates to ongoing inquiries being conducted by competition authorities in Europe, which we and other companies in our industry have previously disclosed. The matters being investigated are not recent. They date back many years. While no final rulings have been made, we have decided to establish a reserve for potential liabilities in a couple of countries this quarter.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate on the quarter from continuing operations was 29.8%. This is up 450 basis points versus year-ago, primarily due to lower audit settlements and foreign tax credits, as well as certain nondeductible charges in the current year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted free cash flow was strong at $3.1 billion. Fiscal year to date we've generated $7.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which is more than 100% of earnings, excluding gains from the global pharmaceuticals divestiture. In November, Moody's revised its outlook on P&amp;G's AA-minus credit rating to stable, which reflects this strong cash progress.</p>
          <p>During the October-December quarter we resumed our share repurchase program. $1.4 billion of shares were repurchased. We currently expect to repurchase about $5 billion for the full fiscal year.</p>
          <p>In terms of acquisitions and divestitures, we announced the closing of the pharmaceuticals sale to Warner Chilcott. This move's enabled us to focus singularly on winning in consumer healthcare, personal healthcare, oral care and feminine care where we're able to fully leverage our core capabilities as a company.</p>
          <p>Also during the December quarter we announced the acquisition of the Ambi Pur air care business from Sara Lee. Ambi Pur is a strategic home run. Its geographic presence complements ours as do its product technologies. The strategic benefits Ambi Pur brings will enable us to more quickly expand and strengthen our air care business. Closing of the acquisition will put us in the air care business in over 80 countries.</p>
          <p>The purchase price was &#x20AC;320 million, which translates to $470 million on the day the deal was announced. Based on estimated results for the year ended June 2009, this equates to a sales multiple of 1.2 and an EBITDA multiple of 13.3, which we believe represent good value for our shareholders. We expect to close the acquisition pending regulatory approval during the April-June quarter.</p>
          <p>Stepping back, we're very pleased with our October-December results. Strong volume growth enabled us to hit the top-end of our organic sales range. Solid top-line results coupled with our cost and productivity efforts also enabled us to exceed bottom-line expectations. We generated a significant amount of cash and effected important strategic adjustments to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>But we have more work to do, particularly in regards to share growth. On a global basis, value shares for the December quarter were slightly below year-ago levels. Due to time lags associated with the reporting of share data, share growth is inherently a trailing indicator. Share improved sequentially through the quarter and should turn positive during the March quarter. This is an important measure to us, as it is indicative of whether we are accomplishing our objective of serving more consumers in more parts of the world more completely.</p>
          <p>We are accelerating innovation in the second half, increasing marketing support and improving consumer value to profitably grow value -- market share. We'll do this while maintaining our focus on cost and cash discipline.</p>
          <p>We're expanding our portfolio vertically, horizontally and into geographic white space. But we're also working to constantly improve existing offerings to deliver more value to consumers. A look at our innovation programs in a couple of key categories over the last two quarters helps illustrate this.</p>
          <p>In Baby Care, we introduced our tier-three diapers, Pampers Simply Dry, into Spain during the December quarter. This builds upon successful launches in Germany, France, Greece and the UK. In all four of these countries we achieved record diaper value shares during the quarter. In our lead market, Germany, we reached our highest-ever diaper value share 63.4%, up more than five share points versus year-ago.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the expansion of our tier-three diaper called Sleep and Play in the Middle East is off to a strong start. Across the Arabian Peninsula, Sleep and Play shipments already represent about 10% of our total business.</p>
          <p>In addition to offering consumers more lower-tier options to care for their babies, we are expanding our portfolio and improving consumer value at the top-end. UnderJams, a premium pull-up overnight bed-wetter product, just started shipping in the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium this week. Launches in additional countries will follow.</p>
          <p>And we recently announced a launch of Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers with Dry Max technology across North America beginning in March. Pampers Dry Max is the biggest innovation for the Pampers brand in 25 years. It's our driest diaper ever and is 20% thinner than our existing product. Dry Max is a dramatically improved product with clear benefits for baby, mom, retailers and the environment. The revolutionary Dry Max technology helps lock wetness in for up to 12 hours. The new thinner core gives babies more freedom to move and to play. The thinner design allows moms and retailers to carry more diapers in less space. And because Dry Max is being offered at the same price as existing offerings, it provides a great consumer value.</p>
          <p>Finally, Dry Max will positively impact the environment. If current North American Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers users switch to Pampers with Dry Max, it will save the weight of a billion diapers every three years. The smaller package will reduce packing materials and the amount of energy needed to transport the product.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, in Baby Care we're expanding the portfolio down and up, expanding our geographic footprint across tiers, and dramatically improving our current offerings.</p>
          <p>In laundry, we're expanding our portfolio horizontally with Tide Stain Release and Ariel Professional in Laundry Additives, and Bounce Dryer Bar in the fabric enhancer segment. Both innovations continue to exceed expectations. In our lead market of Turkey, Ariel Professional is over a 25 share. In the United States, Tide Stain Release shares exceed 10% and year-one retail sales will approach $100 million, while Bounce Dryer Bar shares are nearly 6%.</p>
          <p>We're also expanding our laundry portfolio vertically and into geographic white space. In Western Europe we're innovating in the premium term with Excel Gel. Excel Gel is a new-to-the-world gel that gives the best cleaning performance possible and saves energy because it cleans well in cold water. It allows for controlled dispensing and is consumer preferred by a margin of two to one. Excel Gel continues to perform well with value shares approaching 10% in the United Kingdom. Shares are growing in Germany, France and Spain as well.</p>
          <p>In Japan, our newest laundry brand, Cerasa, was introduced in September and is off to a strong start. Cerasa, is priced at a 15% premium versus the category average and is designed for consumers who want a laundry detergent that cleans well and also provides natural and gentle benefits.</p>
          <p>We also introduced Tide Naturals in India and H in Colombia during the December quarter. Tide Naturals is priced 30% lower than regular Tide at Rs. 20 for 400 grams of products. With 75% of the laundry market priced at Rs. 20 or below, this will allow us to reach a much broader spectrum of Indian households.</p>
          <p> H is a mid-tier laundry brand which complements Ariel's stain removal equity and Bold's softness equity. In the five months since being launched, H grown to almost 2.5% of the Colombian market.</p>
          <p>Finally, we introduced Ariel into Uganda and Senegal during the December quarter. This follows the launch of Ariel into Kenya during the September quarter and is part of our strategy to dramatically increase our business in East Africa.</p>
          <p>In oral care we continue to expand our portfolio as well. Oral-B toothpaste and toothbrush shares in Brazil continue to exceed expectations. Based on our in-market success we have initiated the second wave of our toothpaste expansion plan which will take us beyond the pharmacy channel. The Oral-B dentafrice launch in Belgium and Netherlands is also going well, having achieved an 8% national share since being launched in February 2009.</p>
          <p>Crest Pro-Health is off to a strong growth in China, with initial shipments ahead of expectations. The equity benefit we have created is positively impacting other parts of our oral care business in China. This is one of the reasons oral care shipments in China were up double digits in the most recent quarter. The Crest Pro-Health formula is being expanded to other markets around the world. For example, Blend-a-Med Expert, which uses the Pro-Health formula, was recently launched in Germany and has pushed total Blend-a-Med value shares to nearly 11%.</p>
          <p>In hair care we're significantly improving and expanding our salon offerings with the introduction of Fekkai Advanced. Fekkai Advanced will be sold exclusively at high-end salons and department stores all around the world, while Fekkai Classic will be launched into mass retail as a superpremium offering.</p>
          <p>I could go on, but I think these examples give you a picture of the work we are doing and the investments we are making to expand our portfolio vertically, horizontally and geographically in order to serve more consumers in more parts of the world more completely. Bob will provide more perspective in our second-half innovation plans at CAGNY [Consumer Analyst Group of New York] in February, but we hope to see more of you there.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, a strong innovation program, increased marketing support, better consumer value, tight cost control and cash discipline have resulted in growing momentum in what was all-in a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Teri.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. Starting with the beauty segment, organic sales increased 4%, driven mainly by 3% organic unit volume growth and benefits from pricing. Retail hair care delivered a solid quarter with mid-single-digit organic volume growth led by the Panteen, Head &amp; Shoulders and Rejoice brands. All three brands grew volume 5% or more for the quarter. On a geographic basis, China led the hair care growth with shipments of the Panteen, Head &amp; Shoulders and Rejoice brands all up 15% or more. P&amp;G's all-outlet value share of U.S. retail hair care is approximately 32%, up slightly versus prior-year.</p>
          <p>Skin care volume was up low single digits, with balanced growth in developed and developing markets. Global skin care value share is up versus prior-year to 10%, and Olay all-outlet value share of U.S. facial moisturizers is up more than a point to over 45%. The strong U.S. share progress is due to the success of the Olay Pro-X line which we continue to leverage.</p>
          <p>Personal cleansing volume increased mid-single digits driven by double-digit growth in developing markets. The Safeguard brand was up mid-teens in developing markets.</p>
          <p>Volume in the Prestige beauty business was down slightly, driven by continued market size decline. Organic volume in the salon professional business was down mid-single digits due the ongoing impacts of the global economic downturn.</p>
          <p>In the cosmetics business, Cover Girl shipments were up low singles, and U.S. all-outlet value share was up more than a point to nearly 21%. The strong share performance has been driven by continued leverage of Simply Ageless Foundation and Exact Eyelights Mascara innovations that launched last spring.</p>
          <p>In the grooming segment, organic sales were in line with prior-year. Volume was down 2%. Pricing contributes 4% of sales growth, and product and geographic mix reduced sales by 2%.</p>
          <p>In the nail, blades and razors business, organic volume was in line with prior-year levels, as mid-single-digit growth in developing markets was offset by lower shipments in developed markets. Greater China shipments were up 20% behind distribution expansion of the Vector system. And India blades and razor shipments were up more than 25%, driven by the November launch of the MACH3 razor. In developed markets, Fusion shipments grew mid-singles, but were more than offset by a mid-teens decline of MACH3. Gillette all-outlet value share of the U.S. male blades and razor category was up nearly half a point to over 77%. Fusion share of U.S. male systems is over 45%, up more than four points versus the prior-year. Global Fusion shares have grown versus prior-year every quarter since being introduced four years ago.</p>
          <p>The Braun business continued to be affected by weak category demand, and shipments declined low single digits. However, this was a significant improvement in the trend compared to the mid-teens declines over the last few quarters. Braun's share of hair removal appliances in the U.S. was up 1.5 point to more than 24% behind strength of male shaver accessories. In Western Europe Braun's share of hair removal appliances was up nearly four points to 42% with strong improvement of both male and female products.</p>
          <p>Shipments of male personal care products were up high single digits due to soft results for the Tag brand and increased competitive activity in the shave part category.</p>
          <p>In healthcare, organic sales were up 2%, and organic volume increased 3%. The net impact of pricing and mix lowered sales by 1%.</p>
          <p>In oral care, shipments increased mid-single digits, with developing markets up high singles and developed markets in line with prior-year. In developing markets Oral-B volume was up 30% in Brazil driven by the launch of Oral-B toothpaste and related market share gains on toothbrushes. And the brand was up nearly 40% in India behind manual toothbrush expansion. The Crest brand grew mid-teens in China behind the launch of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, which is off to a very strong start. In developed markets solid growth in Western Europe on the Crest and Oral-B franchises were roughly offset by lower shipments of Oral-B in North America.</p>
          <p>Feminine care share volume grew low single digits as double-digit growth in China and over 30% growth in India was largely offset by volume softness in Latin America following price increases. In the U.S., the Always brand grew all-outlet value share feminine pads by half a point to 59%. Tampax increased its share of the U.S. tampon market by nearly a point to more than 48%, driven by strong advertising and in-store programs for Tampax Pearl.</p>
          <p>Personal healthcare volume increased mid-single digits, driven mainly by a double-digit increase in Vicks shipments due to the early start of the cold and flu season. Pepto-Bismol and Metamucil also delivered strong volume growth, and the Align probiotic brand continues to perform well in its first year in market. Align is now at a 25% value share of the U.S. probiotic supplement market. These increases more than offset a mid-teens decline in Prilosec OTC volume due to increased competitive activity.</p>
          <p>In the snacks and pet care segment, organic sales were up 3%. Organic volume increases of 1% and pricing of five were partially offset by negative product mix. Snack volume declined versus prior-year, but organic sales were higher due to price increases taken last year, with a superstack can restage. Pringles has begun to see a recovery in trade support in key national accounts, which had fallen sharply after the price increase last January. Pringles has now annualized the North America restage in pricing, and the brand expects improved volume trends in calendar year 2010.</p>
          <p>Pet care delivered solid volume solid growth in the mid-single digits behind the continued strength of the Iams ProActive Health, Iams Premium Protection and Eukanuba Naturally Wild initiatives. P&amp;G all-outlet share of the pet nutrition business is up versus prior-year and is approaching 10%.</p>
          <p>In the fabric and home care segment, organic sales increased 7% and volume grew 8%. Home care led to growth with volume up double digits. Fabric care increased high single digits and diary volumes grew low singles. The strong results were aided by weak base period caused by the global economic crisis, as well as the effects from the price increases taken in the fall of 2008.</p>
          <p>In home care, volume growth was broad based across brands and regions. The Dawn, Cascade and Fabreze brands all grew shipments in the teens and Swiffer was up mid-single digits. Geographically, all regions delivered volume growth, and developed and developing markets were both up double digit. In the U.S., Cascade all-outlet value share is up more than three points to 67%, driven by strong marketing and in-store programs designed to increase trial. Fabreze all-outlet share of the U.S. air care markets is also up more than three points to nearly 21% behind the home collections initiative which launched last summer.</p>
          <p>Fabric care shipments were also strong across brands and geographies, with all regions and major brands delivering healthy volume growth. The Gain brand delivered strong volume growth, up low teens due largely to the weak base period. Tide shipments were up high single digits, including strong growth in North America behind the Tide Stain Release laundry additives launch. Tide Stain Release is fast approaching a 10% value share of the stain removers market in the U.S. Tide all-outlet value share of laundry detergents remains above 30% and is down less than a point versus prior-year. The Downy Lenore global franchise grew mid -- grew volume mid-teens driven by nearly 30% growth in both Western Europe and Asia behind strong trade support programs and consumer value interventions.</p>
          <p>Battery volume was up modestly for the quarter, with North America and Western Europe in line with prior-year levels. U.S. market size in unit terms recovered somewhat, approaching all-outlet growth of nearly 6%. With volume essentially flat in a growing market, Duracell market share on both a unit and value basis declined more than three points for the quarter. The brand is acting to stem these share losses with consumer value interventions on larger size packs. The new upcutter packs began showing up in stores this month.</p>
          <p>Baby care and family care delivered organic sales growth of 8% and organic volume growth of 10%. Product mix reduced sales by 2%, due to a shift toward larger pack sizes. Global baby care shipments were up high single digits, with strong growth in both developed and developing markets. Pampers shipments were up mid-singles in North America, high singles in Western Europe and double digits in Asia and the CEEMEA region. The expansion of Pampers Simply Dry value true diaper in Western Europe continues to progress well, as Jon mentioned. Pampers diaper value share in Western Europe is up two points to over 56%. And value share in the UK is up more than four points to over 62%.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., P&amp;G's all-outlet value share of diapers was up a point to over 38%, with both the Pampers and Luvs brands growing market share. The Pampers share progress is especially encouraging since the benefits from the Dry Max innovation won't be fully reflected in market share data until the June quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, family care shipments were up low teens due to a combination of consumer value interventions, initiatives launched earlier in the year, and a soft base period. Charmin's all-outlet value share of the U.S. toilet tissue category was up more than a point to 28%. And Bounty's share of the U.S. paper towel category is up two points to over 46%.</p>
          <p>That concludes the business segment review, and I'll hand the call back to Jon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Teri. Before I get to guidance, I want to briefly address a couple items. First, Venezuela. It's been our practice to maintain a proactive stance towards the conversion and repatriation of Venezuela bolivars in line with current exchange controls, while still holding enough local currency assets to efficiently run our business. In anticipation of a potential devaluation, we accelerated the conversion and repatriation of bolivars. That is one of the reasons that SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales increased during the December quarter. There was a similar impact in the September quarter.</p>
          <p>Because we've managed our exposure proactively, any one-time translation impact with the currency devaluation will be negligible. However, both the top and bottom line will be impacted going forward. We estimate net impacts over the balance of the fiscal year will reduce all-in sales by about 1%. The bottom-line impact is currently estimated at up to 0.05 to $0.10 per share.</p>
          <p>A high degree of uncertainty remains in Venezuela. For example, it's not currently known if enough dollars will be made available at the official rate to preclude the need to enter the parallel market. In addition, the pricing environment and related consumption impacts are not certain at this time. So these current-year numbers and the ongoing impacts may change. We're working to respond quickly, but recovery plans will take time to execute. It's our intention over time to fully restore sales and profit levels seen prior to the devaluation. We've done this historically in Venezuela and in other markets around the world.</p>
          <p>We received several questions recently on price reductions, which I also wanted to address. We remain committed to delivering good value to our consumers. In many instances we're able to deliver consumer value through innovations that perform better or add incremental benefits. This is the case, for example, with Pampers Dry Max. Occasionally, however, we need to make targeted price adjustments to deliver sufficient consumer value. This is typically done for one of three reasons. The first instance is where we took commodity or foreign exchange-based pricing and then underlying market trends reversed, or after a period of time our price gaps versus competition remained outside historical norms. The targeted price interventions we made in North America on laundry large sizes and in tissue-towel, as well as across Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa, have been of this nature.</p>
          <p>The second situation where we may lower prices is when we're making strategic adjustments to our portfolio. A good example of this is a recent intervention we made on Cheer. We lowered Cheer prices 13% in October in order to give consumers a broader range of choices and further differentiate Cheer from Tide. While it's still early, we're confident this decision was the right one. We're now looking to reposition Era, which we believe will optimize our laundry portfolio even further.</p>
          <p>The final situation where we may lower prices is when competition has initiated pricing or promotional strategies that cause share loss over an extended period of time. This is the case, as Teri mentioned, in batteries. To restore consumer value proposition we have upsized some of our AA and AAA pack counts in North America.</p>
          <p>These pricing interventions are very targeted versus being broad based. All of the pricing investments we've made over the past year to improve consumer value represent only about 1% of sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to guidance, we've been indicating for some time that second-half earnings growth will be lower than the first half. The biggest driver of this is incremental marketing investments to support our innovation program which, as we've mentioned, is back-half loaded. Second, we expect less favorable year-on-year commodity comparisons. Third, pricing benefits we've been receiving should continue to diminish as they annualize. Finally, as I indicated earlier, the impact of the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela will impact second-half results.</p>
          <p>So with that background, let me move to specific guidance. We're increasing fiscal-year organic sales growth expectations to three to 5%. This is an increase of one percentage point versus our previous guidance range. The increase is driven by December quarter results, confidence in our innovation and investment program, and our expectation for slightly higher rates of underlying market growth during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange based on current spot rates should be flat up to 1%, resulting in all-in sales of three to 6%. Core earnings per share are now expected to be $3.53 to $3.63 per share, up two to 5% versus year-ago. This is an improvement from our prior guidance range of flat to up to 3% and recognizes the underlying improvement we're seeing on the business. We're maintaining our all-in GAAP earnings-per-share guidance range at $4.02 to $4.12 per share. The legal reserves which are not reflected in core earnings per share are covered within this.</p>
          <p>Given the impact of Venezuela and the legal reserves and the significant investments we're making to accelerate growth, we believe estimates above the high-end of our guidance range may be aggressive.</p>
          <p>Turning to the March quarter, we expect organic sales growth of four to 6%. All-in sales inclusive of a three- to four-point benefit from foreign exchange are expected to be up seven to 10%. At this level of sales growth we expect to grow global value share. Both core and all-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $0.77 to $0.82 per share.</p>
          <p>In closing, we're very pleased with the progress we're making, while acknowledging there is more work ahead of us. We'll continue to invest in innovation and portfolio expansion. We remain focused on dramatic simplification and managing cost and cash with discipline to create a sustainable level of support. We're confident these investments and actions will enable us to serve more consumers in more parts of the world more completely and profitably grow our business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My question -- fine, thanks -- my question had to do with the investment spending you're making in developing markets, because some of the numbers you were reading -- kind of 30% growth in one business in China, 20% growth in another business -- I'm wondering if that's a reflection of just a much more buoyant China market generally, and whether you're seeing those types of growth rates in India and elsewhere, or whether you're just spending a ton of money on advertising and promotion in those markets.</p>

          <p>Wendy, this is Bob. As Jon tried to indicate in his remarks about our innovation program -- and we feel sorry that we had to cut them short; we had to try to summarize -- our innovation program is happening all over the world. And we're spending behind the innovation program to get the awareness and trial objectives we need to grow market share profitably. So there really is not an unevenness in our spending country to country or innovation to innovation. It's spending behind the innovation program. It's spending behind the core business, and the whole idea is to grow market share profitably.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Bob, back in late August you talked about getting aggressive in terms of the portfolio. And so it's another sort of six months past then. Can you give us your latest thinking in terms of time line, your thoughts in terms of where you think you can add -- obviously very general here -- and do you think you still need to do some major pruning or do you feel like most of that work's been done? So sort of just the overall status of the portfolio right now. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. I would say we've just started. As you know we've turned our purpose, touching and improving lives, into a strategy. Touching, improving more lives, more parts of the world, more completely. Jon gave you some examples of how we've been expanding the portfolio vertically, horizontally and into adjacencies in his remarks. But we've really just started.</p>
          <p>Remember, we've been in China since 1988. We're only in about 14 categories. We lead all of them but one. But the spending per capita in China is only $3 year on Procter &amp; Gamble products. That compares to the United States where we're in over 25 categories and the per-capita spending year is $100.</p>
          <p>So we've got a long way to go. But we started the journey. Getting the portfolio right is strategic. And we're working to do that so we can touch and improve more lives.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, there is a direct correlation between the number of categories we're in in each country, the market share we have in each country, the profit margin we have in each country, and how many lives we're touching and improving, and importantly the growth rate in each country. So getting the portfolio right is strategic and that's our focus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I just was sort of struck by how strong organic volume was this quarter, and I know that part of it there's certainly -- the comparisons help. But it'd be great if you could help us understand what in the portfolio still feels negative, right? You went through the list of things that are positive. What's still really not where you want it to be, where you're still hoping for further reacceleration as we move through the next couple of quarters? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think one area, Lauren, is clearly the more discretionary categories. Teri talked in her remarks about the Prestige fragrance business, salon hair care and Braun. We are seeing sequential improvement in the market size reductions for those categories, but clearly those are areas that we're not growing at the rates we expect to longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lauren, I would also add that any business that we have that is not growing market share profitably, we are impatient to get that share growth. And Jon mentioned that we expect on a company average basis we'll see share growth in the March quarter. But as we talked, we have to make some interventions to get that share growth. We talked about the intervention we've made on batteries. That's an example of an intervention we've made to get share growth. So our innovations and the marketing behind those innovations, coupled with some of these interventions, we're hoping to get the majority of the portfolio to share growth by March. And we're on our way there. We're on track.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jon talked about cash, Bill, and a lot of the outstanding cash discipline we have has been around our management of inventories, both our internal inventories as well as external inventories with our retail customers. As a result of that, our shipments and consumption match up pretty doggone closely, and we watch it weekly. Well, daily, but we review it on a company-wide basis with the vice chairmen weekly. And it's running pretty much one to one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question, Bob, Jon -- whoever cares to take the question -- in terms of the top line for this quarter and then as you think about the March quarter, can you just break down how you're thinking about it in context of your algorithm with category growth and white space and share? And if you could just break that down for us, that'll be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our general objective, Nik, as you know, is to grow our business one to two points ahead of market growth, which obviously is consistent with an objective of building market share. We're looking at currently projecting market growth of two to 3% for the fiscal year, which is an improvement versus the last time we've all been together when we were thinking it was about one to two. So if you look at that two to three on the year, compared to sales growth on organic basis of three to five, I think that gives you the breakdown that you're looking for.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. I just wanted to talk about pricing again. Jon, I guess once upon a time we'd been talking about pricing hitting 1% -- or I guess 10% of the portfolio. And you're saying it hit 1% of price overall, I guess 1% of the top line. Are there more interventions coming going forward, and do you still feel comfortable with that view that your pricing interventions would only be across 10% of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can imagine, Chris, this is a very fluid situation. We're constantly managing, as you know, our value metrics versus competitive offerings. And we respond to those on a real-time basis. But -- so I really -- I don't want to get overly granular on a number. But the directionality of our commentary, both on the 10% of the portfolio and 1% of sales, I think still holds. We're not looking -- in no geography are we leading price declines. We're responding to gaps that we see and we'll continue to do that. But I don't think you should expect broad-based pricing activity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question. I just wanted to sort of square the disconnect between the pretty solid organic growth you guys saw in the quarter and your commentary about shares being down modestly year over year. And then as a follow-up you mentioned that shares did improve throughout the quarter. Is that innovation, is that marketing, or are you starting to see consumers trade up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, this is Bob. I'll start. In our prepared remarks, Jon said that shares naturally lag shipments. And so the shares we're talking about are shares that are a few months old. We also obviously look at scanner data as well as off-take from our distributors. And that's what gives us confidence in saying that we are making progress in growing market share around the world profitably.</p>
          <p>That market share growth is generally coming from places where we are innovating, where we have the right consumer value, where we are doing a good job marketing, getting the trial and awareness that we need of our business, both core business as well as new innovations. And as we look out, remember we said that the innovation program is getting stronger in the second half. And that's one of the things that gives us confidence. And also, as Jon said, that we don't see a large amount of pervasive pricing activity in the second half. That's what gives us confidence to see that that trend in share growth will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe, as we've talked before, while there has been some dynamic of trade-down and I mentioned clearly the market size impact on discretionary categories, we've continued to fare well in the premium portions of the market. Teri mentioned in her remarks our progress on Olay Pro-X. The Fusion business, up four share points in the last quarter, clearly is indicative of a consumer who's willing to spend for value driven by performance. And there are other examples. So it's not one size fits all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting. If you go to a country like India, for example, where our baby care growth has been very strong, we have mothers with arguably lower disposable income than those of us in the United States choosing to buy disposable diapers rather than having their babies not have any diaper at all or use cloth because they know that that disposable diaper will help their baby sleep through the night which will aid their development and obviously be better for the mother as well. I think this idea that this economy is causing everyone to trade down is a little bit overly general and too broadly applied. Innovation and improving lives is really what is critical for us on a consumer-by-consumer basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning, guys. I was hoping to just zero in a little bit on the family care portion of business. I think, Jon, you'd talked about the conditions for pricing, targeted pricing reductions in speaking about reversals in foreign exchange and commodities. And clearly this scenario where you've gotten very nice returns on your promotional investment, very strong volume growth. How should we think about the outlook for that going forward with pulp prices having moved back up, polypropylene moving back up a bit, nat gas moving up, and how are you weighing the continued promotional investments and the fixed cost leverage you're showing on that versus the higher commodity cost outlook in that division? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in general, obviously, I don't want to comment on pricing strategy in this kind of a setting. We will continue to watch this. Any move that we make will obviously be weighed with consumer value in mind and be made on a comparative basis relative to how other competition is responding. It's clearly something we're watching given the commodity cost increases that you appropriately mention. But beyond that I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment specifically.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I guess thinking into 2011 and I know you're just warning people not to get too aggressive on expectations, but I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about the scale opportunity versus the spending algorithm. You know, would that prohibit you, as you look kind of forward, getting back towards that long-term 10% earnings growth that you guys have delivered? And -- or do you see how -- you have to see how the innovation and the market growth plays out first before maybe declaring that victory?</p>

We want to continue to make the investments necessary to get that portfolio expanded around the world. But we are cognizant that we have to do that in a responsible way and deliver the profit necessary. That's why we're talking about growing share profitably.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple one-off things. On Venezuela, I didn't fully understand. Had you projected this kind of 0.05 to $0.10 hit in your original expectations, or is this incremental in terms of your new guidance? And then also can you give a little bit more color on the European -- or the charge taken in the quarter? Are there any future charges and just what that pertains to? Thanks so much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me address Venezuela first. I wish we had a crystal ball that allowed us to predict things like 100% devaluations, but we don't. So the 0.05 to $0.10 is incremental to what we were expecting previously.</p>
          <p>And I'll let Bob comment on the European matter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, on the European matter, the legal reserve, we and other companies have previously reported, we've reported for the last three years in our annual report, that there've been a number of ongoing antitrust inquiries in Europe. And the reserve relates to potential liabilities resulting from those inquiries. As Jon said during his prepared remarks, this reserve relates to a couple of countries in Europe, but there are a number of ongoing inquiries being conducted by competition authorities in Europe, and these could result in additional liabilities. It's too early for us to reasonably estimate the total amount of fines to which the company will be subject as a result of these various competition law issues. Again, it's an industry issue; many companies are involved. These are one-time in nature and they won't impact our investment in the business.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Would appreciate, if you would, just a little bit further perspective on your solid organic growth number for this quarter and then going forward, I guess, along two dimensions, volume and price mix broadly. But the first along volume, I guess, given the retailer and consumer destocking that we talked about a year ago this quarter, you described it as about minus 3% of volume. How should we see your actual takeaway volumes this quarter? I mean, is it -- should we think about it about 3% below what you reported at least even assuming no restocking? So it's a volume question.</p>
          <p>And then secondly if you could just give a little bit more granularity. I understand you don't want to go into too much detail but what we should expect going forward for price mix. You know, maybe some idea by segment but at least by U.S. versus rest of world, if you could, along both of those dimensions. That'd be helpful, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ali, let me start and then Jon will follow me. Our Q2 organic sales growth was due to underlining market growth of about 3%, and again I'm rounding these off to integers. Inventory rebuild about 2%. Share growth, as we said, not where we want it to be -- about zero. So about 3% market growth. About 2% inventory rebuild.</p>
          <p>The organic volume growth was strong in every region. And that's what drove organic sales to the high-end of our guidance range. But as I said, even with retail inventories contributing about two points, we're watching those inventories and working with retailers all over the world. As you know, destocking, as retailers do, actually benefits the Procter &amp; Gamble Company because we create and market leading brands. And the leading brands are usually the ones that end up being on the shelf and end up selling more. Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add one point, which is the point of momentum. So volume, we were down two points in JIS. And in this quarter, depending on how you want to look at it, Ali, whether it's five or three, it's significant progress versus the prior-quarter growth rate. And then going forward, we talked about growing the business sequentially. We're guiding to four to 6% organic sales growth with volume ahead of that slightly in the third quarter. So there may be some inventory impacts as you cite, but the general trend is continued very positive.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob, Alice. I'll start with the market share, and then Jon can follow. Basically we gained market share -- now, again, this is through November. Remember, these numbers lag our shipments quite substantially. But we gained share in places like Latin America. Our share was basically flat in places like Western Europe, Asia. We lost a little bit of share in North America. And the biggest change was really in Central, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa where the economies plummeted quite precipitously last year, and as a result we had to take substantial pricing. And as we take that substantial pricing, our competitors typically do not follow us immediately, and that's where we lost the largest amount of share over the last three months, through that November period.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of market growth, we're seeing stronger market growth in developing markets than developed markets; obviously not back to the levels that it was. But China's growing again. The markets that were most severely impacted by the economic crisis, namely Eastern Europe and the Middle East, have bounced back the sharpest, and markets like Latin America and India, which really weren't affected by the crisis, continue to grow. So we're seeing growth in developing markets at healthy rates, albeit below historical levels, and we're seeing modest growth in developed markets from a market standpoint. Our business split really in terms of volume growth is about four points of growth in developed and about six points in developing.</p>

          <p>Hi; thank you. I was just curious. In terms of your decision to take Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Fekkai into the mass market, it seems to be a trend developing in the professional hair care segment. Maybe L'Or&#xE9;al will come out with something. It just seems like the market is moving that way. Is that not a threat long term to the salon channel and the professional hair care in the salon channel, because the consumer will find the convenience of buying the products at mass? And so can you just explain your decision and whether you think it would impact the Wella business long term?</p>

          <p>Linda, we don't expect it to impact the Wella business. In fact, we introduced a new more advanced Fekkai for the professional channel before we took the Classic Fekkai into retail, just like we have Eukanuba in pet specialty stores and we have Iams in grocery stores.</p>
          <p>Our principle as a company is to have our products for sale wherever the consumer wants to shop, whether that's online, whether that's in the specialty store, or whether that's in a professional salon. And so we're going to continue to do that. But we also recognize we have a responsibility to work with retailers and consumers to differentiate those offerings based upon the consumers who shop in those specific channels. So you can still buy, you can still get and still can use a professional Fekkai in department stores and in salons, but you will also be able to buy the Classic Fekkai in your normal retail outlets. They are different.</p>

          <p>Good morning. My question is around how retailers are behaving and whether you see any differences -- and I'm sure you do -- but from the U.S. to Western Europe and then obviously in the developing markets. Are you seeing some changes in behavior, maybe starting with Wal-Mart?</p>

          <p>Caroline, this is Bob. As you can imagine, I've met with most of the major retailers recently. I think it's a very encouraging environment. The industry is moving to something we call New Ways of Working Together. It's supported by people like Mike Duke at Wal-Mart. People like Lars Olofsson at Carrefour, Sir Terry Leahy at Tesco and all our other partners around the world, which for the first time retailers and manufacturers are going to work together focused delighting the consumer.</p>
          <p>Previously there was a lot of antagonistic behavior between retailers and manufacturers, so I'm actually encouraged that the new Consumers Goods Forum, which I'm obviously part of, and I help sponsor the Operational Excellence Group, is focused on new ways of working together where retailers and manufacturers can work together to help reduce cost, provide better value and delight consumers who shop in retail stores.</p>
