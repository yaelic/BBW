          <p>Hello and good afternoon everybody. This is Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining the call for our nine months results today. Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO will be hosting the call and Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board will also be available for your questions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg and we will open the line again for you for the Q&amp;A session at the end of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello and good afternoon. This is Georg Denoke. I start my presentation with the highlights on page three. Linde's positive business performance has continued over the third quarter. We remain well on track for the targeted new record earnings for the full year. The ongoing global recovery momentum has driven nine months group sales up by 13.1% to &#x20AC;9.405 billion. Group operating profit advanced further over-proportionately with an increase of 23.2% to &#x20AC;2.145 billion.</p>
          <p>This ongoing momentum in our operating performance also translates into strong EPS growth. Our reported EPS was up by 67.2% to &#x20AC;4.13. On adjusted basis, taking into account the purchase price allocation, our EPS increased by 44.4% to &#x20AC;4.88. Operating cash flow per end of September was up 7.7% to &#x20AC;1.533 billion as of last year.</p>
          <p>As we will see in more detail later, our double-digit growth is besides positive currency contribution, driven by a widespread recovery. Emerging markets have again shown a very strong momentum, while we have seen further improvements in our more mature markets in Europe and the U.S. On top of that, we have maintained our full commitment to the implementation of our HPO initiatives. These savings have made significant contributions to the group operating margin improvement of 190 basis points to 22.8%.</p>
          <p>As I have already indicated, this positive business development allows us to reinforce our full-year targets driven by growth in group sales and an over-proportionate increase in group operating profit, we should mark a new record year for group operating profit in 2010.</p>
          <p>My detailed business review starts with a breakdown of group sales by division on page four. Gases sales of &#x20AC;7.59 billion increased by 14.5% versus last year. As we will see later in the gases sales bridge, the currency development, especially from the Australian dollar and the South African rand continued to contribute to this strong growth rate. However, with the comparable sales increase of 6% in the third quarter, our underlying growth momentum in the gases business is fully intact. Per end of September sales growth on comparable basis stood at 5.7%.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering division we have proceeded as planned with the execution of order backlog. Sales for the nine months period of &#x20AC;1.674 billion were on last year's level. Our expectation that full year sales will at least be in line with the previous year is hence unchanged.</p>
          <p>Moving to page five and the divisional split of operating profit, you see that our Gases and our Engineering division have both contributed a strong double-digit growth through the 23.2% operating profit increase on the group level. The Gases division has recorded an operating profit of &#x20AC;2.055 billion, up 16.6% from the previous year. Supported by HPO initiatives, the Gases operating margin hence improved by 50 basis points to 27.1%, including the adverse margin impact due to the pass-through of lower natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>The Engineering division again reached a strong operating profit growth with an increase of 26.9% to &#x20AC;184 million. The operating margin per end of September remained with 11% on a high level. This strong profitability has been driven by the successful execution of a number of individual projects. Factoring in the positive margin development so far in 2010, we now expect the operating margin to be at least 10% for the full year, well above our mid-term target of 8%.</p>
          <p>With regards to the corporate line, please have in mind that last year's cost figure included the restructuring charges of &#x20AC;80 million. The gases sales bridge on page six gets us deeper into our Gases performance. As mentioned earlier the underlying price and volume effect, excluding acquisitions for the nine months period reached 5.7%. Hence with a comparable growth rate of 6%, the group growth momentum remained intact in the third quarter, considering that the second quarter benefited from the weakest base effect and the significant contribution from an inventory restocking among our industry customers.</p>
          <p>Currency effects remained very positive and even intensified in the third quarter. The aggregate contribution from currencies per end of September increased to 7.4%. While translational effects of most currencies were positive against the euro in the reporting period, we recorded as in the half year &#x2013; first half year, excuse me, the strongest contribution from exchange rate changes in Australian dollar, South African rand and followed by U.S. dollar. The sales impact from the pass-through of higher natural gas prices slightly increased to 1.2% after nine months, while we had no significant consolidation impact.</p>
          <p>The sales development by operating segments, on page seven, shows that the recovery momentum is still led by unabated strong growth in our emerging market activities. The operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe has posted again the strongest underlying growth rate, with a comparable sales increase of 11.7% after nine months.</p>
          <p>On reported basis, sales advanced by 21.8% to &#x20AC;1.636 billion. We have seen an unchanged growth momentum in the Greater China region over the third quarter. The emerging economies in South and East Asia also delivered again a strong contribution to our gases growth. Moreover, the positive signals recorded in Eastern Europe during the second quarter were also confirmed by further recovery in our business development in this quarter.</p>
          <p>In the more mature regions, Western Europe and North America, our gases activity also further recovered in line with the general gradual improvement of economic conditions. In Western Europe sales went up by 7.2% year-on-year to &#x20AC;3 billion. Sales growth on comparable basis of 3.6% is meanwhile still held back by the contractual pass-through of lower energy prices to our customer base in the UK.</p>
          <p>On an underlying basis we have seen the gradual recovery in manufacturing continuing in the third quarter. Sales in the operating segment, Americas increased by 14.5% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion year-on-year. Comparable sales growth increased to 8.5% for the nine month period versus 7.2% in the first half year. This acceleration was driven by improving momentum in both regions, North and South America.</p>
          <p>Between the more mature market, the U.S. are hence showing currently somewhat stronger momentum than the Western European markets. We are supporting this demand recovery notably with two new CO2 production facilities dedicated to our electronic specialty gases customers as well as the food, beverage and chemical end markets.</p>
          <p>In South America the good GDP momentum in Brazil and also Chile and Argentina is feeding volume increases in our Bulk and tonnage product areas, whilst health growth remains also strong in our local healthcare portfolio in South America.</p>
          <p>Gases sales in South Pacific and Africa have delivered a reported growth of 25.7% to &#x20AC;1.322 billion, driven to a large extent by strong currency gains. On a comparable basis, sales growth per end of September stood at 1.4% marking a further recovery after flat comparable sales in the first half year.</p>
          <p>This positive development is mainly driven by our activities in the South Pacific region where our gases business has seen a good, gradual demand increase over the course of the year. Given the much more stable GDP development during the crisis, the recovery level is of course overall smaller than in those regions that were hit much harder by the global recession.</p>
          <p>In Africa the industrial production rates driving our Bulk and Cylinder markets still remain rather weak. In South Africa, the competitiveness of local manufacturers on the globalizing markets is hampered by the high exchange rate of the rand, which impacts our business. Other major countries outside South Africa like Nigeria or Kenya also have seen only minor improvements in growth trends.</p>
          <p>The profitability of our regions is highlighted on page eight with detailed operating profit by operating segment. The 50 basis points increase of our gases margin to 27.1% is supported by the continuous implementation of HPO initiatives across all regions. Per end of September, we have achieved the strongest margin improvement in our two biggest regions, Western Europe and the Americas. Our activities in Western Europe increased their nine months operating profit by 12.1% to &#x20AC;877 million. The operating profit margin hence further increased by 130 basis points to 29.2%.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, our operating profit went up by 19.3% to &#x20AC;377 million. With an operating margin of 22.2% this operating segment achieved a solid 90 basis points increase despite the pass-through of higher natural gas prices to our hydrogen customers in the region.</p>
          <p>Driven by the strong sales development in the operating profit in Asia and Eastern Europe advanced by 18.3% to &#x20AC;491 million. The operating margin of our emerging market activities remained with 30% on a high overall level.</p>
          <p>In the year-on-year comparison, dilutive effects from the natural gas price pass-through over-compensated the contribution from our HPO initiatives that we are also implementing within systems in our high-growth regions.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit in South Pacific and Africa improved strongly by 24% to &#x20AC;310 million. Just as for the sales development, this increase is most of all due to the translational currency gains in both regions. The operating margin for the first nine months stood at 23.4%.</p>
          <p>I am now moving over to the gases sales by product area on page nine. Per end of September we have gained &#x2013; we have again recorded the highest growth rate in the tonnage product area. Sales in the Tonnage business were up by 11.2% to &#x20AC;1.81 billion. In the Healthcare segment the growth momentum remained steady.</p>
          <p>Our revenues in the first nine months advanced by 3.5% to &#x20AC;834 million. For the mid-term we stick to our annual growth target of 5% to 6%. Revenues in our Bulk product area have increased by 6.7% per end of September to &#x20AC;1.847 billion. Cylinder sales were up by 2.8% to &#x20AC;3.091 billion for the nine month period.</p>
          <p>I think this is again worth moving forward to the next slide, page 10, for the quarterly view of these growth rates. In the Merchant business we can here see two opposite short term dynamics. On the one side our Bulk business had a particularly strong recovery in the second quarter, driven by the base effect and inventory restocking among our industry customers. This business is in line with its sustainable range of mid to high single-digit growth rates, with a comparable sales increase of 5.1% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In our Cylinder activities of our Merchant business we have seen a strengthening of the recovery momentum in line with the typically late cyclical behavior of this kind of business. Our growth rate has here accelerated to 4.8% in the third quarter after flat sales in quarter one and growth of 3.2% in quarter two.</p>
          <p>In the Tonnage segment sales for the third quarter were up 10% from the previous year on a comparable basis. This marks the fourth quarter in a row that we are posting a double-digit increase in this product area. Besides the much improved loadings of existing plants versus the depressed levels of 2009, this growth is also driven by start-ups and ramp-ups out of our project pipeline.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on the update of our pipeline of signed projects on page 11, we have an unchanged expectation for 24 new startups going onstream this year. And we have moreover increased our pipeline for 2011 by one and for 2012 by three additional projects. The most prominent new signing is the &#x20AC;100 million investment in our joint venture activity for the expansion of our tonnage scheme at TISCO's Taiyuan site in China. Additional projects are coming from our emerging market portfolio in the steel as well as electronics end customer segments.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the year we have decided on 21 large projects for a total amount of more than &#x20AC;550 million. Also on these latest timings, the mega trend in emerging markets remains a strong driving force. Led by investment decisions, our emerging market activities have delivered 64% of the large project CapEx signed so far for this year. Thereof around &#x20AC;300 million are allocated to the regions Greater China and South and East Asia from a year-to-date perspective.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline for 2012 is now up to the investment level of the year 2009. We have moreover already signed first contracts for startup dates in 2013 and '14 as well. So in a nutshell, the recovery in contract signatures continued over the third quarter, further strengthening our confidence in the attractive mid-term growth potential of our Gases and Engineering business model.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the key figures of our Engineering division. This is on page 12. I have already touched upon the P&amp;L development with sales now on last year's level and operating profit, up 27% versus last year to &#x20AC;184 million. The gradual improving market environment for international engineering projects is also visible in our order intake. Despite the mega order of $1 billion signed in the second quarter of last year, our order signings per end of September of &#x20AC;1.538 billion are now slightly ahead of the previous year.</p>
          <p>This very good inflow of small and mid-sized orders really shows that the Engineering business is again gaining strength on a broad basis. While we have, of course, seen an ongoing strong momentum in structural growth markets like Asia Pacific and the Middle East, our order intake so far this year is highly diversified both between our main regions and between our four major plant segments.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we continue to build on a strong order backlog of about &#x20AC;4 billion. Beyond that, the generally improved investment climate is positive for new potential signings in our traditional end markets as well as in our state-of-the-art applications in the environmental and energy field.</p>
          <p>I want to round up my presentation with a look at our cash flow statement and our net debt development. Looking at the key elements of our cash generation and uses on page 13, you see that our operating cash flow was again strong at &#x20AC;1.533 billion. Despite the necessary build up of working capital in the recovery, we hence increased the cash generation of our operations by 7.7% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>This implies that the operating cash flow of the third quarter improved by 24.9% versus the second quarter on basis of roughly the same operating profit. With this good performance, we plan to reach for the full year an operating cash flow in excess of our strong 2009 full-year figure.</p>
          <p>With regards to cash uses, investments in tangible and intangible assets are so far in line with last year at &#x20AC;764 million. We expect a higher CapEx spend in the fourth quarter towards a full figure up to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>On page 14, as you can see, we have used our strong cash generation to fund further de-leveraging. The net debt at the end of September is down to &#x20AC;5.972 billion, the first time below &#x20AC;6 billion. This is around &#x20AC;370 million lower than at the end of June. The last 12 months net debt/EBITDA ratio was per end of September 2.1 times.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you here that the key objective of our cash usage is a healthy balance between capital expenditure for organic growth, sustainable dividend, increase in line with growth in operating profit and de-leverage at the bottom end of our target range of 2 to 3 times net debt/EBITDA.</p>
          <p>With regard to the outlook, you can find the full detail on the last page of the presentation which is page 15. Based on the strong business development in the first nine months, we can reiterate our full-year expectations for sales growth and a new record level for group operating profit. Besides the global economic upturn, this target is supported by numerous efficiency initiatives we are currently implementing under the HPO umbrella. I would therefore like to reiterate our commitment to the gross cost savings of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>Based on the strong performance in the first nine months we expect, of course, now sales and operating profit in the Gases division to be above the record level of 2008. In the Engineering division, 2010 sales will be at least in line with the previous year. On the operating profit side we expect, given our strong performance up to September, to achieve an operating margin of at least 10% for this year, significantly exceeding our mid-term target of 8% margin.</p>
          <p>Overall we are hence pleased with the strong business performance so far this year. We confirm all our targets and look forward with confidence towards the growth opportunities we can serve with our leading gases and engineering set up. In this context, we will come back to you, based on our year-end figures 2010, with a mid-term target when we communicate our full year set of numbers beginning of March 2011.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks on the third quarter results. I would like to ask the operator to open the line for our questions now. Synet, please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Jean de Watteville from Nomura. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi. Thank you for taking my question. Jean de Watteville from Nomura. The first question, and I'm sorry to ask that, but there has been some rumors or some talks in the market following a road show you have done, I think, in Germany about one or two months ago that, I think, probably brought some confusion. And these talks were about you probably considering getting into the discussion between Air Products and Airgas, because Airgas is one of your major customers in the United States. I just would like to use this conference call maybe to offer you the opportunity to clarify this matter. Are you considering, yes or no, to put another competing bid on Airgas. And can you just give us what's the size of the business that Airgas have? How big are the revenues that you generate with Airgas in the United States? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on margins. Yes, on the nine-months basis your margins in Industrial Gases are up. But obviously we know that Q1 '09 was pretty low because of the very low level of operating leverage and low level of volumes. If we look since Q2 '09, actually your margins are pretty flat. So I'm just wondering if you could go through what are the factors that are offsetting your productivity gains, going through the mix effects, cost inflation and probably some pass-through of the productivity gains to customers.</p>
          <p>And the third and last question, just very mechanic. Obviously, we've been surprised by low CapEx on the first nine months. In your presentation, you've been pretty clear that you'll keep the guidance of 1.3 billion CapEx this year. Can you explain why there is that delay? Why do we have such a seasonality of CapEx all in Q4 and not the rest of the year? Is there any delay in the ramp-up of contracts or what explains this? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you Jean for your questions. On Airgas and then this road show feedback which you are referring to, I think this was an over-preferred &#x2013; over-interpretation of what was discussed. So from that perspective, I think it is said what we really can say here in this current environment. But this was the clear over-interpretation of a scenario-based discussion. As you know, we know this company well. We have sold more than 14 air separation units to them. So from that perspective, I think this is very clear.</p>
          <p>On the productivity margin and productivity gain over the year, only to refer to your comments, so we started into the year 2009 in the first quarter with a margin of 25.3%. We were at the end of 2009 and the fourth quarter at 26.7%. We have achieved 26.7% in the first quarter and we are now at 27%. So over this development of eight quarters, it's a clear improvement of the margin from around 25% to 27%. So this is according to our HPO program on the one hand which means, in the end, productivity improvement. And I would not over-interpret now the decline compared to the second quarter, which is from 27.5% to 27%. This is to majority based on the natural gas price impact. So from that perspective, we see further productivity gains coming through. One additional impact is that pricing is slightly positive at that stage and was a little bit better at the half year of 2010. But I would not read too much into that.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx figure, it is as it is, Jean. You sign the project, you sign the contract, and then when it comes to the ramp up of project, from a CapEx perspective sometimes we have the effect that one quarter is more emphasized than the others. So we are holding it back for the fourth quarter. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Evgenia Molotova from UBS London. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Actually, I had one question on the development of your Bulk versus Merchant business and we had results of Air Liquide very recently and they were saying about subdued development in Cylinders. And you show quite positive development in Cylinders, but less so in Bulk. Could you please comment geographically on these two segments, how they are developing in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Evgenia, thank you for your questions. I think, from an overall perspective, I tried to explain in my speaker comments from a global perspective what we have seen, we have seen a base impact on the Bulk side, which was mostly pronounced in the third quarter now. And then we had an volume re-stocking impact, which was most significantly in the second quarter. So from that perspective, when you compare these two lines, you have 9.9% in quarter two, 5.1% in quarter three. I would put it all together and then you see that we are above the 6% in our Bulk business, which is in line with our expectations, which we communicated also from that perspective. So it's more an quarterly specialty based on 2009 development and re-stocking.</p>
          <p>When we look into the regional development, then we see from a year-to-date perspective, that America &#x2013; of course we start with the fastest growth, which is the Asian markets, followed by America and then followed by Europe. When we &#x2013; this is Merchant all together. But when you split this from an perspective of Bulk and Cylinder, you see that our UK business, as our Tonnage business in UK, is impacted by pass-through obligations on electrical energy, which is impacting our top line growth negatively. So you also have, because of the good contracts in Bulk, you have a negative impact on a year-to-date perspective. And this is the only region from a Bulk perspective, which is negative. All other regions are growing in line with the differentiation I made against the different geographies, emerging markets, matured markets.</p>
          <p>From a Cylinder perspective, I think we have seen further recovery in all geographies which is very positive and which is leading us to the 4.8%, with the only exception in South Africa, which we also discussed already at the half-year. Here we see a difficult market environment. Even if we see increase in manufacturing industry, but the market and the country overall, as I was referring to in my speaker notes, it is still an issue for all customers against the strong African rand to deliver products to other markets on the one hand, and then have competition from countries like China from an inland perspective. So that's not easy, but overall this is describing the regional trend on the Merchant side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And one more question if I may. Your cash flow considerably improved. If you could briefly comment on the priorities, deleveraging versus improving the dividends, new projects et cetera, if you could comment on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as I said, I think this is overall a mid-term question from a general perspective. With the growth opportunities, starting with growth, we will see further growth through the mega-trends in emerging markets and in energy. This will help us to grow faster. And if you compare, for example, an investment in an air separation unit for a steel customer, as we did it in Jamshedpur in India for Tata Steel, that was around 100 million. If you compare that with an investment for an enhanced gas recovery scheme in our joint venture in Abu Dhabi, this was around 800 million. So the investment size for the mega-trend of energy-related application can be significantly different. So we want to grab growth opportunities as fast and as good we can, from an overall perspective.</p>
          <p>The second part is then, of course, that from a dividend development perspective, we have always communicated that we have a dividend development in line with our improvement in the operating profit performance. As you know, last year we had been slightly decrease from an operating perspective. We kept the dividend flat. And with the basis of this year, and this is not my decision as you know, this is a decision of -- in the end the shareholders, probably we can assume that there is a positive development on the dividend side.</p>
          <p>From a deleveraging perspective, as last point, of course the deleveraging obligation for us, we are now in line with our 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA range when we look into last 12 months EBITDA. I think this is what we intend. And of course we would come down a little bit if the growth opportunities would be lagging behind. But overall with this famous triangle of serving growth, serving shareholder values through dividend development and through further deleveraging. But at that point in time, I think we see a market which comes back, also from a growth opportunity perspective, in our tonnage business.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth from Westlb Frankfurt. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. If I may, four question please. First is on HPO program, can you give us a little bit  the figure what  you have that impact year-to-date so far for 2010? And I read  this morning &#x2013; I think your CEO gave something statement in the press conference, perhaps saying, they are to fulfill or to even to over-fulfill the project, so meaning perhaps more than the 800 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
          <p>Second question, still on &#x2013; I have to ask this, this is on the Cylinder business in Germany because Air Liquide told a little bit and I think, expressed that sometimes that there is pricing pressure in German market. Can you give your flavor on that?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on engineering, having this quite good earnings figure with more than 10% for this year and taking your midterm target of 8%, do you believe, if you see your order backlog at least for 2011 and 2012, can you imagine that you increase your target perhaps a little bit from this 8% level?</p>
          <p>And the fourth question also belonging a little bit to your overall outlook. As you know, when you withdraw your old midterm target of 3 billion or over 3 billion, and seeing the 2010 efficiency program runs quite well and also expecting, I would say, at least a solid Q4 this year; so I believe you nearly come to this target already in 2010. So what is your expectation a little bit then to give further target as you mentioned in March next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Norbert for your questions, a lot of questions. First of all, related to HPO, I think we are well in line with what we communicated for 2010 as an target range for HPO. This was 150 million to 200 million. This is something, which we can confirm here.</p>
          <p>With a remark to the statement of the CEO at the press conference this morning, I cannot comment on that because I haven't heard that, to be very honest, but overall of course &#x2013; and that was a discussion, when you put 2009 and 2010 together with about 300 million in 2009 and let's say around 150 million to 200 million of 2010, then you are above the average of contribution of HPO for two years.</p>
          <p>But this is also related to the, let's say, lower hanging fruits in 2009, and I think this wasn't a speculation if we can outperform the 800 million target. I think I leave this up to you. I only can tell you it's not all sliced by quarters with a similar impact and we have structural changes where it also needs time that we implement that. So we speak to what we communicated and I think this is what also the CEO meant and we discussed it at the conference.</p>
          <p>The Cylinder business, overall in Germany, I think we have seen an growth of around 3.2%. This is supported also by a positive pricing impact, so I think you were asking specifically about the German market. I think we do have very strong positions in some of the area, so that can be different from a comparison with competitors. Overall, we are satisfied definitely with our continental northern European performance on the Cylinder business at that stage.</p>
          <p>Linde Engineering, your target discussion, of course this is a midterm discussion; overall you know in engineering you could hit a tree and then your margin is gone. Overall, we are executing our projects very carefully as you have seen it by our historical performance. I think it would be too early to be very honest to increase a midterm target. Under the question of executing 4 billion of order backlog, I think I rather keep it with the 8% and outperform the 8% guidance by a strong execution and not using contingencies as planned, let's say it that way; so from that end, I think no target upgrade.</p>
          <p>And with your final point on when do we achieve the 3 billion EBITDA, I think you have seen an year-to-date performance based on the positive currency impact, we also should compare currency impacts between 2006, when we communicated that target, beginning of 2007, and today. So this is also supported a little by currency. So, I think it is a figure which in a way we would achieve when we talk the next time, and when we then look last 12 months backwards. So I cannot tell you a guidance for year-end EBITDA.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein London. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. I have two quick questions. First of all, on HPO, could you perhaps describe, if you're getting the savings where you expected in terms of different types of functions, and perhaps regions? Just if you're &#x2013; any surprises either positive or negative along the way?</p>
          <p>And then second on the onsite projects. I observed that at least two of your peers have reported quite high &#x2013; quite significantly higher Q3 growth rates. And I'm wondering if you could perhaps talk through a little bit about some of the differences that may be driving those, whether it's competitive intensity or differences in winning de-captivations to some of those competitive dynamic in that area? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your question. I think when I start with your first question on HPO, with the question are there any specialties on regions or categories from a performance perspective, I think we are there where we want to be. Also related to the regional split and the Bulk supply chain area, the Cylinder supply chain area. So definitely the stronger contributors are of course our mature countries from an overall perspective. So it's led by Europe, by North America. Nevertheless, we also have implemented HPO in the emerging countries, especially when it comes to rollout, when it comes to standardization; here you always have the opportunity to replicate existing structures. So there's really nothing, which I would highlight now which was against what we expect.</p>
          <p>On the question of growth rate differences, I think we see mixed effects out of structural impacts and one I always refer to is the UK. Here we are market leader in UK as you know and we have an over-proportionately negative impact through the pass-through obligation of lower energy prices. And the other part, which is of course significant, is our base in our electronics business. We have around, on a yearly basis, around 500 million in electronics. If this market segment grows by 30% at that stage, that has some structural different impact compared to our peers. I think these are the main impacts. If I compare that &#x2013; when you look into the details also, with competition you will find out that when we communicate comparable growth, we exclude acquisitions, we exclude de-captivations, all this kind of stuff and that is then driving comparisons in different levels. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Markus Mayer from Unicredit, Munich. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Markus Mayer from Unicredit. Just two questions left. First on the CapEx savings, just give a flavor on your CapEx plan for 2011 and '12? And then on the capacity utilization level of your  onsite plants, could you also give us a flavor on this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I take the first question and then I would hand over to the second question to Dr. Belloni. Overall, we will see a further increase of CapEx in 2011, 2012. From an absolute terms perspective, we assume that also based on the development we have discussed related to energy projects that this could of course increase our CapEx commitment and overall we see still a very strong demand against the development in our emerging markets footprint. So from that perspective, a slight increase is definitely what we see. This could be in 2011 for example easily additional 100 million. And I also assume for 2012 that this could continue, especially when we see one big project from an energy-related perspective.</p>
          <p>At that stage of course the bigger project on the energy side, as the Elixier 2 project in Abu Dhabi is embedded in our joint venture commitment, so you don't see it in the CapEx line. But if you would assume, for example, that this project would be fully consolidated and we are not allowed as foreigner to own a majority, that would hit our CapEx line with 800 million, only to make that explicit from a visibility perspective, and would bring us 400 million of consolidated sales. So this, I think, trend &#x2013; this trend remains against the mega-trend agenda of energy and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On the levels now, I hand over to Dr. Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with regard to capacity utilization, you have to make two differentiations. The first one is pure geographic of course, there is a gap between West and East. Our plants in Asia are much better loaded than in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>And the second differentiation is that they &#x2013; the generation of our onsite project hasn't been the plant which had been onstream already prior to the crisis. They are more or less back to the same utilization, whereas of course the plants which have commissioned in 2009 and 2010 are still in the ramp up phase, which has been of course hurt by the crisis. If I would have to put a number on total, I would say some 90% utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-on on the joint venture CapEx, you said 800 million; how would you be for '11 and '12 and '13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, I only referred to that as an comparison...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...if some projects would be consolidated. I mean you cannot foresee mega projects, you are working on for 2011, 2012, so it would be too early now to refer to such projects. But if you take, let's say, that way an enhanced oil or gas recovery scheme for an oil field or gas field, that is definitely always above a 500 plus million CapEx commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Neil Tyler from JPMorgan London. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hello, good afternoon. Couple of quick questions, please. Firstly, back to the joint ventures again and the margins that you're generating within the JV businesses, there seems to be some fairly significant seasonality or at least the margins have increased quite materially since the beginning of the year. Can you explain whether that is seasonality or whether there's something else impacting those margins, such as currencies or whether &#x2013; and I think you partly answered this in one of your earlier answers, but the HPO program is at all impacting the improvement in margins?</p>
          <p>The second question, with regards back to growth rates, Asia and Eastern Europe you point out that that's the fastest growing region, I wonder if you could split the two parts of that, Asia and Eastern Europe, and talk about the differing trends there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Neil for your questions. I think on the joint venture activities, I said that already in one of the last recent calls, it's mainly driven by net income level and taxation issues. And the biggest volatility from an existing scheme comes out of our PEMEX joint venture for the enhanced oil recovery scheme in Mexico. That is always more volatile.</p>
          <p>When you look into the other activities, this is mainly based on the existing growth of ramp-ups in the emerging markets, which is mainly China joint ventures and a little bit now Eastern Europe and Asia, especially Eastern Europe would be more significant when we see 2011/2012 continuing, because of this enhanced gas recovery scheme in Abu Dhabi. So nothing special.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, structurally the margin you're seeing contributing at the moment is probably the sort of margin we should expect from the joint venture businesses, looking forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course, I mean we have today &#x2013; I told you that we have signed an activity &#x2013; for TISCO again...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we have more contributions, you will see that slightly growing against what we communicate to you related to big activities and joint ventures. I think that is a good assumption and the volatility is a little bit driven by Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your second question, can you repeat your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just within the geographic cluster that you have as Asia and Eastern Europe, are there &#x2013; I've noticed that that &#x2013; the growth rate, the year-on-year growth rate has slowed slightly over the past three quarters to now just below 10%. Is there a difference in the way that the eastern European and the Asian businesses are developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you should have in mind is that we have seen in the Chinese market, because of the energy discussion related to new investments, that we had hold back some activities which we expected originally to come onstream for this full second half year of 2010. These are 100% activities from our side and our customers are not allowed to take onstream direct activities because of the energy-related decisions of the central government. That is impacting a little bit the Chinese quarter-on-quarter comparison here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would not overestimate that because most of this will be solved within this year and we hope that &#x2013; and we have seen one coming onstream right now and we also expect the other come onstream then in the first quarter of 2011. So that is the exception and as I said in the half year call, Eastern Europe of course was hit most severely by the crisis. From a ranking of growth rate league table, it was falling from a number two position to the last position here and this is now coming back, but it is roughly half of what we have seen in the Asian markets up to now so it's rather a 5% than a 10% number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. So do you think there will be a perceptible sort of catch up in growth in the Chinese business in Q4, Q1 or do you think it's not so material we'll notice it in the divisional growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from an operating segment perspective it should happen that way if all comes as it is planned at that stage. It's a further gradual improvement with new activities, definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, very helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks very much. Couple of quick clarifications and then one final question, if I can please? Firstly, Georg, you mentioned in response to Evgenia's question, I think I may have misheard you, but you sort of suggested that there was some energy cost passed throughs in your UK Bulk or Merchant business. I just wonder if you could confirm if I heard that correctly please?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just to follow up on Neil's question there on China, these couple of plants that you have not been able to bring onstream, is it the customers who closed down for &#x2013; under, sort of, Chinese Government energy controls, have those customers now brought their plants back up &#x2013; or are they in the process of bringing them back onstream, or is it an alternative customer base that's evolving and filling your facilities?</p>
          <p>And the final question, on healthcare, you we've been &#x2013; you were, sort of, reasonably confident at the interim stage that you could achieve 5% or so ongoing growth for the full-year 2010. I wonder, now obviously, that's going to be pretty challenging, can you talk us through perhaps what has changed or what hasn't recovered as you'd been anticipating and maybe give us a balance between the tenders that you've been winning on the one hand and perhaps losing on the other? Just to give us some feel for Q4 and then looking into 2011 please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Peter for your questions. The first two one, only confirmations so Bulk UK, you understood it the right way. Bulk is impacted negatively by pastoral obligations for electrical energy, roughly half of our contracts do have these clauses. So that's the negative one.</p>
          <p>The second question, also in confirmation, of course it's the same customer base, these are not different customers, same customers which are now trying to get their investments onstream. Of course they have invested &#x2013; chemical customers, new customers, they have invested more significant amounts so they are eager to get their stuff onstream and then we go with this also onstream as well. So from that perspective it's the same customer base.</p>
          <p>And healthcare, I think we have seen a delay, a slight delay, of our ramp up of our care models, especially in continental Europe, here mainly in Germany we are a little bit delayed. We need here always approval for the reimbursement of insurance companies and we only do start when we do have that approval for the reimbursement, otherwise it is a challenge. So here we have seen a slight delay.</p>
          <p>From the tender issue I would like to refer to the statement that we have &#x2013; we were negatively impacted rather at the beginning of the year and last year by tender issues. We see now rather a positive trend for us but that's not fully coming through, this year it comes through first quarter next year. So overall that is important.</p>
          <p>So nevertheless, the general trend from a pricing perspective is a stressful situation because you have the consolidation of customers, as I said, from more than 200 insurance companies, you were coming down to four in the Netherlands, for example. So that is a little bit impacting the situation, but overall I think I am happy to confirm that we want to be at an 5% to 6% growth rate in healthcare in the mid-term. So we will catch up a little bit but probably you are right, we don't get 5% this year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, just one observation, just wondering on the momentum of trading through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and then on the pricing trends particularly in the European Bulk business, as we look forward or today in the sense of what you might have going forward? And just the observation, I'm just wondering you sort of stand out now, really focusing on the nine months rather than third quarter and I personally find it very difficult to dig out the third quarter numbers so I don't know if that could change or not, but anyway that's just an observation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so when we look into the details of the third quarter related to your questions, I think we have seen in Western Europe a development which is, from a volume perspective, slightly positive as I said, but it's not fully catching up with the great levels we have seen in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>From a pricing perspective, especially from a Bulk performance, it's rather flat than very positive. This is what we have seen here and that is impacting a little bit here the European performance. But overall, I think it is really in line with what we expected. I think as I pointed out earlier, we have seen from a Western European operating segment reporting, we have seen a negative impact through the electrical energy. I think this is very important to understand.</p>
          <p>So when I look into the volume recovery, definitely second quarter was higher, when we talk about the restocking impact in our customer base compared to the third quarter and overall the ramp up is still positive. So from what we have experienced, I think it is as we expected it, Cylinder, further up. And from an average in the Bulk business we are around the 6% plus range, which is in line with expectation.</p>
          <p>So I could not follow fully your last comment on what you have missed on a quarterly basis in the communication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I was meaning was the momentum, trying to seasonally adjust stronger September into October than at the beginning of the quarter. So I meant the momentum through the quarter as we went through Q3 because one of your peers quite clearly said September was very strong, relative to earlier in the quarter, seasonally adjusted as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is against the pattern normally of the previous years. You will normally see a weak August and when you then see for a weaker August, this year the August month was a little bit more pronounced, I would say, because last year you had in the summer break more closures of activities because of short time work in many of the areas. When you now compare that to September, definitely September is normally a strong month, as July is a strong month, and so I don't see a different pattern compared to the previous years at that stage.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Jean de Watteville from Nomura, London. Your line is open again.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes, hi, it's again Jean de Watteville. I was wondering if you could focus on Eastern Europe. You're talking that the signs of recovery seen in Q2 were confirmed in Q3. Where do we stand right now in terms of level of activities compared to the peak levels pre-crisis in the merchant gases? And also, can you talk about in tonnage, what's the outlook for new contracts in Eastern Europe?</p>
          <p>And the second question, just following up on pricing, I think there is obviously different trends on pricing. We know that the UK is down because of the pass-through of electricity. We know from your competitors, Air Liquide and the American gases companies, that overall worldwide liquid price index is about flat. But I think you said that the margins, the return on sale is offset by some positive pricing, so I was wondering if you could provide some kind of clarification.</p>
          <p>What's the price index for the Gases division or for the Merchant division? Or can you provide a little more color of what can reconcile those different points? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay, Jean, I start with last question then I hand over to the first &#x2013; regarding the first question to Dr. Belloni.</p>
          <p>So from an overall perspective in pricing, and we don't split it out in detail, but we see a slightly positive impact for the gas division in the third quarter year-to-date performance. So that is the answer. When you look into the detail, you refer to the point, the most significant impact is UK, slightly negative in &#x2013; or negative in Bulk and then we have seen a, let's say, flat performance in Bulk in Europe. And in the emerging markets we have seen a rather positive development from an overall perspective. So, I think this is what I want to comment at that stage. Now I hand over to Dr. Belloni.</p>

          <p>Hi Jean, this is Aldo. Well with regard to the Merchant situation in Eastern Europe, I think this has to be differentiated between the gas types. We have seen a very good development of nitrogen, for instance, which is associated with industries like the food industry for instance, whereas the gases which are more, as we say, intensive for fabrication manufacturing, like liquid oxygen and liquid argon, they are still quite below their time prior to the crisis.</p>
          <p>Going over to tonnage, I think that the most active activity, so to say, in Eastern Europe is the de-captivation. Of course, there we have to be very careful and a very diligent customer due diligence &#x2013; prior to proceed with these things. But in general terms de-captivation is the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. And can you just say if there's an index of how much down is the argon and the oxygen for the industry?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we 10% below peak or it's more than that, less than that?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around that number and I also want to mention one thing. Eastern Europe for Linde now is including central Asia.</p>
