        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's third quarter 2009 earnings call.</p>
          <p>We hope you've had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the third quarter of 2009. This was a superb quarter for Teva with record-breaking results across the Board including record sales, growth and operating profit, net income, cash flow and EPS.</p>
          <p>Teva's net sales in Q3 reached a record $3.6 billion with gross margin of 58.2%. We approached the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit reaching $997 million, a 42% increase over the third quarter of 2008. And for the first time we crossed the $1 billion mark in quarterly cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>Net income in the quarter reached $806 million and all of this ultimately bought us EPS of $0.89. Teva's growth in both the top and bottom line of Q3 was driven by contributions from across our diverse businesses and geographies, as well as by the continued <mark type="inaudible" /> and efficiencies of the Barr integration. A subject I will say more about after a quick review of the performance of our major businesses during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In North America, we had an excellent quarter with pharma sales of $2.2 billion up 34% over the third quarter of 2008. Sales were led by our U.S. generic business, which benefited from the launches of generic Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo and generic Eloxatin as well as by continued sales of generic version of Lotrel and Adderall XR and a solid performance from our base business.</p>
          <p>Since the start of the year, we have launched 17 new products in the U.S., representing annual brand sales of $11.5 billion. This has increased our product portfolio to a level in excess of 400 molecules. Our pipeline now totals 210 files representing $113 billion of brand sales, 83 of these files are first-to-files, representing brand sales of $54 billion. The unparalleled breadth of our product portfolio and pipeline is a great strategic advantage for Teva, enabling us to offer our customers by far the largest number of products under one group.</p>
          <p>In Europe, pharma sales in local currency were up by 28%, and in U.S. dollar by 15% over Q3 '08, reaching a record $787 million. Sales were especially strong in Germany, Spain, Poland and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The European market remains a turbulent one; something you can see for instance when it comes to market growth. Major markets like France, Spain and Italy were expected to have grown by 15%. In actuality, they grew only around 5%.</p>
          <p>Despite this challenging condition in Europe, Teva managed to improve our market share in key markets. And I'm pleased to report that our portfolio of products in Europe continues to strengthen and grow. As of September 30, we have received 880 generics approval in Europe during 2009. Since we've got another excellent quarter for Teva's international business with sales in local currencies growing by 33% or 17% in U.S. dollars, to reach $463 million. Results were especially good in Russia where we enjoyed very strong sales of products from Teva and Barr's combined portfolios; and in Latin America where sales of seasonal medication were very strong.</p>
          <p>Teva's innovative business continued to grow in Q3, once again achieving record-breaking sales of Copaxone, the world's leading therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Global in-market sales of Copaxone grew by 38% over the third quarter of 2008, reaching $776 million. Over 50% of this growth came from an increase in unit sales.</p>
          <p>Our global market share reached 30% in revenue terms and the gap between Copaxone and the next closest competitor has now widened to eight percentage points. In the U.S. in-market sales increased by 53%; outside the U.S. Copaxone grew by 23% in local currencies over Q3 '08. Copaxone has demonstrated unsurpassed efficacy, safety and tolerability over more than 930,000 patient years of exposure. And we continue to advance our research to ensure Copaxone's position as the first line gold standard MS therapy well into the future.</p>
          <p>I know that many of you have questions about the possibility of a generic version of Copaxone. We remain confident that Copaxone risk from generic competition over the product life cycle is minimal. To begin with, Copaxone is protected by multiple patents that will not expire until 2014 and 2015. As you know, Copaxone is an extremely complex drug that the ingredients of which are difficult to fully characterize. We therefore, believe that just like biology, any potential generic version of Copaxone must be evaluated in placebo controlled clinical trials with clinical endpoints in the multiple sclerosis patients to establish efficacy and safety to measure immunogenicity.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to Azilect, which had an excellent third quarter. Sales in Azilect grew 39% over Q3 '08, led by strong sales in the U.S. and major European markets. Global in-market sales grew by 45% in local currencies. In September, The New England Journal of Medicine published results from their data trials. The article also has concluded, that based on the benefits of early start treatment with Azilect, benefits that were not achieved when the start of treatment was delayed, a one milligram per day dose of Azilect may have a reasonably defined effect.</p>
          <p>We will be working with the FDA to interpret and review these findings and other results from the study. We expect to file a supplemental NDA -- we expect to file, sorry, a supplemental NDA with FDA in 2010. Of course, the scope and timing of any modification to Azilect's label is subject to the FDA review and approval process.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our global respiratory business, sales reached a record $243 million, up 37% over Q3 '08. The increase was driven primarily by strong sales of ProAir and QVAR in the U.S.. As the U.S. Teva market continues to grow, growing by 7% in Q3, ProAir is maintaining its leadership position with a 56% share of this market.</p>
          <p>We also are excited about QVAR's growth during 2009. QVAR achieved the number two market position in its class with a market share in NRx of 17%, up from 13% in 2008. And I'm pleased to report that in October we began Phase III trial of nasal beclomethasone of dipropionate HFA for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, the most common allergic disease in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
          <p>Teva's women's health business reached sales of $103 million, an increase of 10% over Barr comparable sales in the third quarter of 2008, supported by our introduction of Plan B One-Step in July. As I mentioned earlier we are continuing to make great progress in the integration of Barr, a transaction which closed only 10 months ago.</p>
          <p>At the outset of the process, we set very ambitious goals including an ambitious timetable for the integration. Thanks to the outstanding work of the combined Teva and Barr teams, we are exceeding many of these goals, working more quickly, more efficiently, and ultimately realizing even more synergies than we had targeted. As I told you last quarter, we now expect to realize $500 million in annual synergies on the acquisition by 2011.</p>
          <p>We have made great progress in integrating Barr supply chains in many geographies into Teva's global supply chain, something that is also enabling us to eliminate production overlaps and streamline operations. As the Barr integration and our numerous other successful acquisitions over the years demonstrate, business development is one of Teva's core competencies.</p>
          <p>I know that there has been a great deal of speculation about what Teva's next move might be when it comes to merger and acquisitions. So I would like to take a moment to address the question that I think lies at the heart of this speculation, and that is, what is Teva approach to acquisitions today. The short answer is that our approach has not changed. As always we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance Teva's growth and improve our competitive position, whether it's through expanding our existing activities or through entering into new geographies, businesses or market segments or offering new products.</p>
          <p>When we evaluate an acquisition, our criteria remains strict. Any acquisition must be outstanding strategic fit supporting our leadership position. It must contribute to a positive growth, it must offer opportunities for significant synergies; and most importantly any acquisition must have strong financial justification and must become accretive to EPS within a reasonable time, which for Teva means by the end of the first year after closing. Our expertise in targeting, acquiring and integrating companies has been a key driver of our success and will continue to be so in the future.</p>
          <p>Finally, today I would like to review our financial outlook. We are very proud of the results of the first nine months of the year, which have yielded revenues of more than $10 billion and EPS of $2.43. Based on our performance during the first three quarters and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect 2009 EPS in the range of $3.30 to $3.40, compared to the previous range of $3.20 to $3.40. Looking forward to 2010, we expect EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.60. This is on the strength of a number of factors, including our generic launches in the United States, which will kick off on January 1, with the launch of generic Riopix.</p>
          <p>The most visible generic launch opportunity, as you know, is the exclusive launch of Venlafaxine, our generic version of Effexor XR, which is scheduled for July 1. Other important drivers in 2010 will be the completion of the take-back of Copaxone from Sanofi-Aventis in North America beginning April 1 and enabling synergies from the Barr integration.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join us in New York on January 5, where we will be discussing our updated strategic outlook. We are very excited about what both the near and long-term future hold for Teva and are looking forward to sharing our vision with you.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now I will turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial review. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. As you can see, the positive momentum in our business continued into the third quarter of the year, and we are reporting today another record quarter for Teva in terms of sales, GAAP and non-GAAP operating income, net income and non-GAAP EPS; that's a lot of records. Equally important, cash flow and free cash flow reached record highs. These results were driven by a good product mix, tight expense control and continued progress with our integration of Barr.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also worked to strengthen the balance sheet and to improve our financial leverage even further. Before we delve into the numbers, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter: amortization of purchased intangible assets and inventory step-up totaling $147 million of which $138 million are included in COGS and the remaining $9 million are in sales and marketing; $47 million in restructuring costs, these costs partially reflect the integration of our activities in Germany with those of Barr's operations in Germany. Since we moved our operations into Barr and closed down our offices and reduced head count from the Teva employees, these expenses are part of the P&amp;L and not part of the EPA as we do when we close down Barr facilities.</p>
          <p>$37 million in impairment of assets; these amounts result primarily from the write-off of product rights, $13 million in legal settlement in connection with the Paragraph IV litigation, and in addition the related tax benefits of $87 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP result in the third quarter of 2008 are not identical to those in the current quarter. On the one hand in Q3 2008, we did not have legal settlement, impairment and restructuring expenses, and we had a lower level of amortization. But on the other hand, we excluded a payment of $100 million we received as a settlement from an institution, which was offset by acquisitions of in-process R&amp;D and the write-down of auction rate securities.</p>
          <p>As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we, the management team, and our Board look at our financial results. Looking at consolidated results, sales totaled $3.55 billion, an increase of 25% compared to Q3 last year. The Barr acquisition contributed to growth in sales in all of Teva's geographies, particularly in the U.S., Russia, Poland, Germany and Croatia. Similar to the first six months of the year, foreign currency differences adversely affected sales this quarter by $160 million or 6% as the dollar strengthened against certain foreign currency compared to the third quarter of 2008, primarily the Hungarian forint, the Russian ruble, the euro, the British pound, the Polish z&#x142;oty and the Israeli shekel.</p>
          <p>When we eliminate the foreign currency impact for the quarter, consolidated sales actually grew by 31% in local currencies. Pharmaceutical sales in Europe grew 15% in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currencies, while pharmaceutical sales in our international markets grew 17% in U.S. dollars and 33% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income was up 42% compared to Q3 2008, reaching $1 billion, benefiting from strong gross margin and tight expense controls. This quarter foreign currency differences also had an adverse effect on operating profits of approximately $25 million. The negative impact on operating profit resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Russian ruble, the British pound, and the Polish zloty, geographies in which we have higher sales than expenses, partially offset by modest devaluation of the Israeli shekel against the U.S. dollar where we have higher expenses than sales.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income was strong, up 28% compared to Q3 2008, despite higher finance expenses and higher tax rates, which were planned, both resulting from the acquisition of Barr. Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS were $0.89 per share up 16% compared to Q3 2008. Similar to the previous quarter we had approximately 78 million more shares this quarter than in the third quarter of 2008 in our earnings per share calculation, due primarily to shares issued in connection with the Barr acquisition.</p>
          <p>Two housekeeping points related to the EPS calculation. You will find share count details in the press release we issued today and the add back for the non-GAAP EPS calculation is $10 million. Now let's discuss, profit margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which excludes amortization of intangible assets and the inventory step-up of 58.2% in the reported quarter compared to 54% in the comparable quarter of 2008, but similar to non-GAAP gross profit in the first two quarters of this year. The improvement in gross margin is attributable to a higher contribution of sales from our branded and independent franchises as well as improved gross margin in the U.S. generic base business.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margin reached 28.1% up from 24.6% in the comparable quarter last year, driven primarily from strong gross margins and partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses. Net R&amp;D expenses reached $195 million, or 5.5% of sales. Despite lower net R&amp;D expenses as a percent of sales the number of our generic product submissions has substantially grown this year compared to 2008 in the U.S. as well as in Europe and international markets. However this is not just volume, but also value. A year ago we had 58 Paragraph IV with the FDA which we believe to be first-to-file, representing brand value of $42 billion. Today we have 83 submissions of Paragraph IVs, which we believe to be first-to-file, representing brand value of $54 billion.</p>
          <p>Barr's top pipeline has also enabled us to keep R&amp;D expenses lower than we had originally anticipated. We remain committed to our plans to double our generic R&amp;D input and output from its 2007 level by 2012 and we expect Q4 R&amp;D investment to be higher than in the past two quarters.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of intangible assets, totaled $662 million in the quarter, or 18.6% of sales, compared to 17.1% of sales in Q3 2008. These higher sales and marketing expenses are the results of two main factors. The contribution of Barr business, which is characterized by higher sales and marketing expenses and higher contribution to sales of Copaxone, which resulted in higher payments to Sanofi-Aventis</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $212 million, or 6% of sales, compared to 5.5% of sales in Q3 last year due to increases resulting primarily from litigation expenses. We reported $52 million of financial expenses in Q3 compared with $17 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2008. The higher financial expenses resulted from debts incurred in connection with the Barr acquisition, financial expenses were down $9 million from the second quarter of this year as a result of decreasing our debt over the past two quarters.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax expense provided for Q3 is $136 million, compared to $52 million in the third quarter of 2008. We now estimate our annual rate of tax for 2009 on a non-GAAP basis to be 16%, compared with a rate of 10% for 2008. The increase in the tax rate from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from the fact that Barr's effective tax rate is higher than Teva's.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flows. Cash generated from operations exceeded $1 billion for the first time. Our free cash flow, excluding capital expenditures of $195 million and cash dividends of $126 million, amounted to a record of $704 million. The strong cash flow was driven by a reduction in working capital.</p>
          <p>On September 30, our cash remained unchanged from three months ago at about $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $5.8 billion, down $1 billion on the balance as of the end of June. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $800 million of debt including the remaining balance of the bridge loan we took from the Israeli banks to finance the acquisition of Barr.</p>
          <p>This quarter an additional $168 million of our 0.5% and 0.25% convertible debentures due in 2024 were converted, leaving the principal amount of these bonds at approximately $182 million. I would like to remind you again that a conversion did not impact the fully diluted share count and earnings per share calculation and these shares were already included in the diluted share count calculation before.</p>
          <p>The $1 billion debt reduction during the quarter together with our equity growth, improved our financial leverage from 34% as of December 31, 2008 to 23% as of September 30. A level that is lower than our leverage as of September 30 last year, which was prior to the acquisition of Barr.</p>
          <p>DSO, days sales outstanding, amounted to 50 days this quarter compared with 47 days in Q2 2009 and 55 days in Q3 2008. To calculate DSO as we always do, after netting out from the receivables, the sales reserves and allowances provisions. Inventory days were 195 days, similar to the comparable quarter last year, the June 2009 figure of 188 inventory days was distorted by the inventory step-up release.</p>
          <p>Next, net capital expenditures reached $195 million this quarter, compared with $170 million in Q3 2008, and $148 million in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, we executed on a number of plans to expand certain securities, especially in Israel and the Czech Republic. We continuously evaluate our facilities, moving production from one location to another, closing down inefficient and expensive facilities, and expanding others to maximize production efficiency and profitability. For example, during the quarter, we announced closing of facilities in Ireland and a Barr facility in the Czech Republic, while investing in the others I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, dividend. Yesterday Teva's Board approved a quarterly dividend amounting to approximately $140 million. On a per share basis our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, was NIS 0.3 per share. Based on the rate of exchange yesterday the shekel &#x2013; of the shekel to the US dollar this translates into approximately $0.159 per share.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments. Thank you all for your time and attention today. And now we'll be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks guys. Just one question and then a follow-up. Shlomo based on your comments today around M&amp;A, should we read that to see any change in your interest in either a generic versus a brand deal or size of a potential deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No my message was actually nothing has been changed. Our strategy is as I explained many times with our major business is in the generic arena, this is where we see the more potential to growth. We have in addition a very interesting and very profitable branded business, which we nourish and are going to grow as well. And the most important thing is how we're evaluating and how we are targeting and later how we are integrating the acquisition, and Teva as an acquisitive company, will continue to acquire companies in due time. So, I don't want to raise any speculation and any other kind of misunderstanding about Teva future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Then a follow-up maybe for Eyal. On the Lonza and the R&amp;D spending in general, how do we think about the JV investment and then the reimbursement? That line item has bounced around a little bit from last quarter to this quarter. So, as we think about modeling over the next several quarters how should we think about the contribution from those two angles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was about the Lonza or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Lonza reimbursement &#x2013; yeah, reimbursement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this quarter we had a much smaller reimbursement. It was about $8 million, which reduced our R&amp;D expenses accordingly. As far as I know there is nothing much less from these reimbursements and everything in the future we'll be buying jointly by the contribution for the two companies equally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so how much should we expect you to contribute to the JV going forward on a quarterly basis?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Scott Hirsch with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, you noted that in the gross margin expansion, or in the gross margin in general, you saw at least partly &#x2013; part of that was driven by better gross margin in U.S. based generics business, I am kind of curious, how the pricing situation is overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill will you take this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, thanks for the question Scott. Right now, the base business has been very strong. Obviously you do know that some of our competitors have had some issues in the market, and so we have been able to pick up some of those products and we pick those up at our pricing and not at previous pricing. So we are looking for both share growth as well as some positive pricing trends, as well as the things that Teva does every day with driving down its API costs and driving up its efficiency. So all of those have combined to make the base a little bit more profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And what is your flexibility in pricing for Copaxone compared to I guess, the Avonex and Betaserons, Rebif, is there still more room for pricing flexibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think at this point in time that we are priced competitively. We don't want to be the lowest price in the market nor as we necessarily the highest. So, we'll kind of wait and take our time and see what happens with the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then just lastly, does settlement legislation here change the way you think about at risk launches post 30-month stays. Did this model change in the future in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing about the legislation that's currently out there, is it almost favors Teva in the situation that we are able to launch our product at risk and at that point in time, all the settlements that we have entered into, if you go back to budesonide, Solodyn, Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, have all been the same sort of settlement, which is totally appropriate within the current legislation, which is a date of entry settlement. So, I mean in a strange sort of way if the settlement bill goes through, I am pretty well convinced that the only people who will be able to settle will be Teva.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on Copaxone, it seems like it's increasingly difficult to forecast, at least for us. Year-over-year we are looking at 11% growth and you reported 23%, I'm sorry 53% year-over-year growth and there was only about a 10% price increase. Can you help us reconcile, the scrip and the sales growth and what might account for this other than price? And I have one follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Rich. First of all, you should see that this quarter 50% of the Copaxone growth came from renewables and from quantity not from price. I think that this is a very good example to show the quality of the Copaxone in the long-term from a more holistic point of looking. And I think that Copaxone will continue to increase the gap as the safety, which is a very important part, is again and again pulled by this product to the MS patients. Now, I &#x2013; on the other hand I don't think that you should take this quarter, which we are very proud of, as the kind of the quarter that would give you a newer bar of our growth rate for Copaxone. I think Copaxone will continue to grow, but sometimes, and again as you well know a quarter is not the right way to measure the Copaxone in the future. Moshe if you would like to add on to that please jump in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the growth in Copaxone as we see it in the U.S. and outside the U.S. is mainly driven by quantities and share growth, and I think that <mark type="inaudible" /> Copaxone had to deal with the uniqueness. We believe that Copaxone will continue to grow and continue to outpace market growth in all the rest of the year and 2010 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically, the inventory levels have been relatively low. So can we still assume that there again this difference, which doesn't seem to be accounted for by price, has nothing to do with any kind of inventory changes at the trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rich. This is Bill Marth. No we haven't seen any inventory changes at the trade. Right now, we're in the 20 days area, 21, 22 days inventory is out there, it's remained fairly constant. So, we're pretty happy with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one follow-up on R&amp;D, Eyal on the last call, when R&amp;D spending seemed to come in a little lower because of the Lonza reimbursement, you said for the year a 6.8 to 7.2% range for full year R&amp;D spend, net R&amp;D spend as a percentage of revenues, was a good number, is that still the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I don't think so, I think, and I mentioned that in my opening comments, I think what we have done during the year, we've looked at our R&amp;D and the throughput of R&amp;D that we got from the Barr acquisition, the level of assets that we have, how can we deliver more without expanding resources? And I think that the 7% average that we predicted for the year will not happen. You remember in our strategic plan, we were planning to peak at around this time and then to start leveling down. I think we peaked a little earlier, and the number is going to be somewhat lower. So having said that, Q4 is going to be definitely higher than Q3, in absolute numbers and probably also in percentage of sales, because we're planning a lot of activities both on the generic and the beyond generic part for Q2. But it will not make up to be at 7% R&amp;D margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And for next year do you think that it would be still at 7% or below that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not yet on 2010, because we are in a planning process. But let me jump in here by emphasizing one thing that I believe it's important to say when we are talking about Teva's R&amp;D. We remain committed to our plan to double our generic R&amp;D output from the 2007 level, when we initially launched our strategy for the next years. And as for this year, I can assure you that we doubled the number of our submissions; and what counts, or what really counts, is the output and not the expense.</p>
          <p>As Eyal said, part of the Barr pipeline has enabled us to keep the R&amp;D expenses lower. Now to a certain degree, in the R&amp;D, we will double the output of our R&amp;D, so our future looks safe and actually even bright, but when it comes to other parts of our R&amp;D that could ramp up the level of investment or expenses in R&amp;D, because as we have said, we have also innovative R&amp;D part and BioG (40:30 part and some specialty R&amp;D activities as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. First question is just can you elaborate a little bit on the trends you're seeing in your Western European business? And I know you said a bit of turbulence still in the French market. And I guess specifically what are you looking at to turn these markets around for Teva, and I just had a follow-up from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eyal, would you take this question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bill, so, it's a pleasure. First of all let me say if you look at what the overall European dynamics have been, it's exactly as you said, it's been turbulent. But there has actually been some clear spot of good news in there as well. Altogether we could say that we are very happy with the performance as mentioned of our business in Poland, which is by the way, the only European market that hasn't gone into a recession. We are very happy with what's happening in Germany. We're growing our business there and we're seeing our position in around about the number five position in the marketplace being cemented there. Three, we see our Central European business taking up extremely well; the branded part of that business, branded generics markets. We are really performing very well, we are growing our share in places like Hungary, but in many other markets in that area we are doing extremely well. And although there is a slowdown of the economy in some places even in a bad situation of negative growth, we continue to grow our share there.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to build on the success of the acquisition last year in Spain of Bentley and we're growing our business there. And although the total market is slightly behind our expectations, we expect that to pick up because there is a clear growing demand for the sort of medicine that we bring to the market, the generics market is clearly underdeveloped there. But then turn to markets like U.K. and the Netherlands, where there is much more of price competition. We see in these markets that in particular in the trade and in the wholesale, there is a lot of tension, there is a lot of margin being squeezed out. And in those circumstances, we are doing very well, we are growing our share in both of these countries because our offer to the market is exactly the right blend between pure commodity and more specialty products, and our customer share in all of these markets is going up. Our pharmacy share is going up and our overall market share is growing there.</p>
          <p>France is a case where the market has gone down, has not been growing, as fast as we hoped it would be. We expect some changes in the next year from the government, which should give some more focus to growth there again. In that circumstances, we have taken a very firm number three position now where we have been pitching for that for the last year and a half. We took it, we have taken it and we are now stable on the number three position and are looking up for the next one. And then, finally we'll take the market, which is the most difficult one to assess at this stage, which is Italy. In April, there was a change of policy, before April there was a very turbulent, un-measurable and unpredictable situation in the Italian market.</p>
          <p>Since April, there has been a fix of discount regimens in retail. There's also been a low penetration of generics and that status quo as it is today is good. In terms of stability of the market we have captured our market share back to about 17%, we're at the number one position, although it's very fluctuating month-by-month. And we expect from that position onwards that the Italian government should set out clear direction for the future of those markets. And we are in a good position to benefit from that when that market picks up again. All in all, you can say on the European business that we have the good combination of our commercial presence in all of these places I just mentioned to capture the changes, but we also have this R&amp;D machine that is helping us to launch at a high frequency all the needed products. And I think that's one of the main drivers for us to our success and doing it better than our competitors.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Great, thank you. And just a follow-up on, just on the U.S. side, the U.S. generic business. Can you comment specifically, did you see any benefit from Apotex supply interruptions with the 3Q results or is that more of an opportunity we should think about in 4Q and beyond? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Chris. The Apotex share, you don't see it show up in our share right now. Apotex did have product in the market, they were blocked from bringing further product into the market. We overlapped on 60 some different products, and I think we did pretty well there. I think you'll see the share gains in the future. We're now looking to drive our share, in the U.S. generic market to around 25% up from where it currently is. So we think that we've done pretty well with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. First question, just back to M&amp;A. I think in your criteria, Shlomo that you laid out, one of them was to offer new products. Can you be a little bit more specific? You had indicated a preference for branded products relative to generic products, so is that a bit of a change from your last commentary? And then can you provide any insight into the size of the deal? You've in the past collared the size of the type of deal that you've like to do, but can you provide any insight into that? And then I have a follow-up for Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you be so kind to repeat your first part of the question because we hear it here very badly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It has to do with M&amp;A. The criteria that you outlined, as far as your approach to acquisitions, I think you indicated Shlomo to offer new products. Can you be a bit more specific about your preference for branded products relative to generic products? I think in your former statements you've indicated you wanted to drive your branded share as a percent of total sales higher. And then on size of deal, you've collared the size of the type of deal that you're interested in doing. Can you provide any commentary as to whether your previous statements about size of deal are still intact or whether you've changed that? And then I have a follow-up for Bill Marth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the criteria that I mentioned, the same criteria for buying or acquiring the companies or acquiring products, the rationale is the same rationale. As I said we are going to discuss more about our strategy on the January meeting, and we'll cover there of course an update, a strategic vision for the timetable, the time range that Eyal just said, i.e. until 2015.</p>
          <p>But generally speaking I can say that we see even in the long-term future, Teva major business, the generic business, will of course will grow also in a parallel percentage or roughly speaking the same ratio our branded business. In the branded business, we will put some more focus on what we call the specialty segment, where we believe there is a future &#x2013; a good future for Teva. And all in all, because we maintain our growth strategy, I'm sure that we will enhance and do some enhancement in both parts of the business. But this is generally what I can comment on acquisition now.</p>
          <p>Regarding the size, the size is not, I think, real issue. The real issue is the strategic fit and the economics and the accretion element that I mentioned before, these are the three major components that we're looking for. And definitely based on our capabilities and our strategy, we will hit or try to stick to these criteria.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and for Bill on Prevacid. How are you thinking about that opportunity, how is it shaping up in terms of how you're going to capitalize on not only the capsule formulation, but an update on the legal situation around the ODT formulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John as you may know, right now on the ODT, that is still before the judge and we have not heard from her yet. So we are hopeful that we will hear before November 10. And that's probably about all we can say on that. With respect to the capsules of course, we do expect that it will launch on November 10, we have the tentative at this point in time. Of course we have heard that Sandoz is going to be the AG [Authorized Generic], and that's about all we've heard. So it's a very fluid situation. We hope it will be favorable for us and we're cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys thanks. Bill can you comment on the Shire litigation concerning Adderall XR, if you can put some context around that? It seems like you're not satisfied with the amount of product you're getting. And also maybe you could give us a regulatory update on Lovenox for both you, and if you are aware of anything surrounding your competitor?</p>
          <p>And then, Eyal, I believe original revenue guidance was 14.1 to 14.6 billion in 2009, and that clearly seems like you're going to be falling below the range. Can you just give us some sense as to why that is? I think that was even currency adjusted. Did we just miss a launch that you thought you were going to have in your numbers, or maybe put a little bit context around that? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ken, let me first take the one on the top line forecasts. I'm sure that as you know, this has been and continues to be a very volatile year, especially when it comes to foreign exchange rates, as you've just seen in just the first three quarters of this year. We experienced a negative effect of our top line of $670 million, only in this quarter we said $160 million negative impact. So this is very volatile and the volatility makes it very difficult to provide a precise projection regarding the top line this year. But back to your question, I would say that we expect to be in the neighborhood of $14 billion and definitely we will do our best even though the bar some is moving  <mark type="inaudible" /> FX and others that we mentioned that will be in our numbers.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Ken, good morning. On the Adderall, right now obviously we don't like to comment on ongoing litigation. But what I would say is that it's a very simple situation of we think the agreement is quite clear that Shire needs to supply us what we've requested and we don't think they're doing a very good job of that, so I think I'll leave it at that.</p>
          <p>And I think your second question was with respect to Lovenox. And again, I wish I had a crystal ball and could tell you exactly when that approval will come. And I can't really comment too much for the other players in the market. I'm not sure where Momenta is right now and I'm not real sure about Ampisar. What I do know is that we see the application progressing very nicely. We're getting very normal questions back around labeling and all the typical stuff. So we do see activity, and very positive activity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First, I'm looking at my model and looking at your range for 2010, the 4.40 to 4.60. And thank you very much for providing it, but there seems to be still a lot that is still in litigation, and I was wondering if this is essentially your best guess now, if, I guess litigation cases worked their way through the court in 2010, that the possible range of outcome is much wider than 40 &#x2013; than 4.40 to 4.60. And I do have a follow-up?</p>

          <p>Good morning. Hi, it's Shlomo. Again I have to apologize we hear your voice very turbulent, so if you can be so kind and repeat your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mentioned that you've mentioned, you gave us a nice guidance of 4.40 to 4.60 next year, but there seems to be a lot more that is still in some of the courts right now. And I was wondering if this is simply now the number you willing to commit to now and if things work through the courts, obviously your guidance will have to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, now we heard you well. Thank you. It's Eyal. I'll try to take that, and Bill you may jump in and add because you were on the courts in the United States, but there's a very -- the simple standard answer. We try to risk adjust our business plans, we know that we are not going to win every case, but we know that we are going to win some. We're trying to bring everything into consideration and be sure that we know what we are predicting. They're moving parts, I mean there is no doubt -- it could go up a little higher and it could even go a little lower, but there are other parts in our business which are not dependent on litigation, and so that's where we are. And this time of year we are all busy in finalizing our work plan, working out the details, making sure that what we predicted early this year is still valid, and we are in the middle of the evaluation. Bill you want to add something on the litigation parts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Ronny, just a couple of follow-ups. I mean you know of course and we've have talked over and over again about the venlafaxine and people know that. But there is a lot of other cases that are out there, such as we feel very -- pretty good about Angiomax, Gemzar, we've already talked about Merapax comes at the beginning of the year. We're very hopeful on the appeal on Evista, and Temodar I think is just to name a few of some exciting opportunities for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And second and I guess this is more of a global question. You kind of, there was a nice discussion that took place earlier about potentially pushing up R&amp;D a little bit towards the 7% rate a year or two out. But I'm kind of looking at your business model of one/third branded, two/third generic and looking at the branded R&amp;D of around 15% and I know you want to keep your R&amp;D level low, but thinking about investment rate, shouldn't that are R&amp;D line be closer to 10% as opposed to closer to 7% two or three years out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so, I think that the more we look into our future, and you'll remember that re we are willing to maintain the ratio roughly speaking to being the current ratio between the branded business and the generic business. We believe that we will be more than okay in the current numbers. It is important to emphasize that from my perspective, expensive is the means it's not the end. The end is where we are willing to grow, what are the products that we would like to develop and we come to the conclusion that this is the products or this is the what we would like to be in, then we will dedicate the funds or whatever is needed in order to be there. Right now we think that we are achieving our target without the pushing up R&amp;D, and we have different kind of R&amp;D in Teva in the right labels. So you should not expect us to go into the finished kind of numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you believe that your current branded pipeline is wide enough to support your growth in kind of like that three to five years out horizon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally speaking to where we would like to be I believe so and definitely part of our future &#x2013; our long-term future would be not only organic R&amp;D in this respect, but also to a certain degree, some acquisitions that would complement our portfolio &#x2013; our immediate portfolio to support our future projected sales in our branded part of the business.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, as question for Shlomo. If you could just comment on performance trends in the TAPI business in the quarter. I know during your last strategic review you talked about this being roughly a $1 billion business by 2012, but sales have continued to remain relatively soft. I still think we're tracking roughly around 2006 levels. So I'm just sort of puzzled frankly kind of given the strength in the overall generic business worldwide, why we're not seeing stronger performance trends in that segment? And then maybe just a follow-up question for Bill, if you could just give us, can kind of your latest read on where exactly we're with respect to biologics legislation and what we should be looking for there. And then just maybe some color commentary on the notion that 12 years is a significant setback for the generic industry, and the thinking there is that, while obviously for a longer period of time than what you hope, the reality is that at least economically you could be looking at products that are multiples above kind of where they are in the seventh year of their life in the 12th year. So I'm wondering how damaging you really think that is? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first answer the TAPI part of your question. You have to be aware that when we acquire companies, actually we also acquire part of our customers. So from TAPI point of view the Barr acquisition actually took a third party or external customer and make it an internal one. So what you see in the TAPI numbers is actually the third party business or the external business, part of the business. And I'm just giving it as an example because as we grow the business, TAPI is more busy with supplying Teva's internal needs and definitely in the same time we would like to grow our external business, and part of the number that you see is because if we actually move part of our customers into our internal universe. So TAPI will continue to grow the business, TAPI is the largest API producer in global terms, and that's basically what I can say on the TAPI part, Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question Elliott. There is a couple of perspectives here on biogenerics. I mean first as the Chairman of the Association, I have to say that you probably did see the letter we sent to the White House asking that the current biologics legislation is stripped from healthcare reform, because we think with 12 years of exclusivity and really the troubles around the evergreen, that it's just not helpful, it doesn't really create any competitive situation for the generic industry. So that's my Chairman of the GPHA hat.</p>
          <p>That said, from a Teva position, we're going after these products whether we have to do it through an ADLA or a BLA [Biologics License Application] . And we've talked a lot about our filing of G-CSF. And we again we are hopeful that we will get that accomplished yet this year. We are also hopeful about products like Neugranin, which is the albumin infusion, HDA through the albumin infusion G-CSF. So we're going to go after these products one way or another at Teva. So as I've commented many times to the press, don't feel bad for Teva, Teva is going to be in these markets regardless. What I would feel bad for unfortunately is for the American consumer, because I think they are getting a bad deal.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two questions. First, Bill, you talked about Adderall XR a little bit but I guess I'm just a little confused I mean was last quarter a big quarter of Adderall XR and this quarter was a very light quarter because of supply issues? Is that the way we should think about it and we're hoping to get it back together in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Marc, I think you need to think about the supply issues as kind of post-180 day issues. This is going to be a tough market as far as supply. I think the way the situation is worked out right now, the supply is tight there is not a lot of inventory out there. But, right now we are hopeful that our litigation will shake some things loose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other question has to do with the innovative business, some of the products we've seen a lot of press releases just over the past three or four months. Can you talk about just some milestones and things that we should watch for? And on the innovative side when are we going to see some products actually hit the market whether it's Europe or the U.S., maybe just over the next 12 months just give us a flavor for what we should see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Moshe. I think first of all as we discussed, near term opportunities on the Copaxone and the <mark type="inaudible" /> and we talk about the Azilect and LARGO. And the results on the Azilect and goes going forward and in addition if you look at the innovative on the branded pipeline, I think we have a few interesting products definitely Laquinimod that we believe that Laquinimod is a huge potential for us and looking at the MS competitive landscape in the coming years. We have the Pagoclone product on stuttering that we're going to see results in next year and this is a very interesting opportunity for us, and the other indication that we are developing with Laquinimod.</p>
          <p>So all in all, these are the relatively I think mid-term opportunity on the innovative side. We need to remember that on the other segment as well we are developing our other franchises on the respiratory as well we are developing a few products on respiratory and we have a good development plan for our women's health business going forward and definitely the biology is one our growth engines, let's say it beyond 2010, '13 or '14 timeframe. So all in all if you look at the entire spectrum of the branded activities we feel that we have a good pipeline and interesting and robust growth going forward.</p>
