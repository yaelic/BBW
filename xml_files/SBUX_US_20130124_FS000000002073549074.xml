          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today from New York is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and with me from Seattle are Jeff Hansberry, President of our Channel Development and Emerging Brands businesses; and Troy Alstead, CFO. Also available for the Q&amp;A session are Cliff Burrows, President of Americas, here in Seattle with us; and joining us from London is Michelle Gass, President of EMEA; and from Tokyo, John Culver, President of China/Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>This conference call will include conference forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a few housekeeping matters. Today, we filed an 8-K that outlined a few reporting changes including the shift of certain G&amp;A expenses from Other to our four reporting segments. The results we reported today reflect these changes. We have also recapped full-year results for fiscal 2010 and 2012 &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; through 2012, and have posted the recapped financials on our website. They should be there shortly. Additionally, Starbucks' 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in Seattle 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 20th. That meeting will be available via webcast as well.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>JoAnn, thank you, and good afternoon to everyone on today's call. I am very pleased to report the record first quarter fiscal 2013 results Starbucks announced today. Strong global comp store sales growth with comps up 7% in the U.S. and in the Americas, record quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion, an increase in our total company operating margin to 16.6% and a record earnings of $0.57 per share, the highest quarterly EPS in Starbucks' history. Noteworthy, is that Starbucks' record Q1 results was delivered against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence in an overall weak global economy.</p>
          <p>With nearly 70 million customers visiting our more than 18,000 stores on seven continents in 61 countries each week, Starbucks Q1 results demonstrate the strength, unique resilience and increasingly relevant of our global business and brand, and the momentum we have built coming into Q2 ideally positions us to kick our growth plans into high gear and to deliver increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and beyond, as we continue to execute against our blueprint for profitable growth and plans for adding thousands of net new stores over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Not evident from record operating results alone are the facts that in Q1 we also drove significant relevant product and beverage innovation and provided an enhanced in-store experience to customers around the world and implemented strategic operating improvements throughout the organization to streamline the business and deliver increased operating efficiencies into the future, all while delivering the strongest holiday performance in Starbucks' 42-year history. I'll touch on a few these developments and then turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, President of Channel Development and Emerging Brands, and then on to Troy.</p>
          <p>As I've said many times over the years, core to Starbucks' success are our store partners, our ability to attract, develop and retain the very best people in our industry and our ability to create inspired moments for our customers. I'm delighted to report that our U.S. partners achieved record levels of productivity in Q1, an extraordinary accomplishment given the high volume of customer traffic and thousands of Verismo demonstrations in our stores during the holiday season. To my partners around the world, I say thank you for all you do to bring the Starbucks experience to life in our stores, and for our customers every day and particularly for your hard work and effort that enabled us to deliver the results we announced today.</p>
          <p>On a personal note, I also could not be more proud of the fact that last week Starbucks was recognized for the 15th year by FORTUNE magazine as one of the most 100 Best Companies to Work For. Despite what for many retailers was a lackluster holiday season, Starbucks holiday exceeded our own expectations with successful promotions, including the 12 days of gifting, the return of Christmas Blend and a fresh take on gifting with our well-received lines of limited-edition holiday merchandise. This season and for the first time, a Starbucks Card was perhaps the nation's single most frequently given holiday gift, with 1-in-10 U.S. adults receiving a Starbucks Card and $2 million worth of our exclusive first-ever steel Starbucks Card selling out on Internet luxury goods retailer gilt.com in only, believe it or not, six minutes.</p>
          <p>The Americas segment comp store sales increased 7% driven by a 4% increase in traffic. Within the American segment, our U.S. business delivered revenue growth of 9% and an outstanding comp growth of 7% driven largely by increased food and beverage sales and robust holiday activity, driven by significant robust traffic. The U.S. remains a market rife with growth opportunity for Starbucks, and we will profitably capitalize on this opportunity by adding 1,500 new stores in the U.S. market and renovating thousands of existing stores in locally relevant, energy-efficient and environmentally responsible way over the next five years. Roughly 60% of our new U.S. stores will be drive-thru locations.</p>
          <p>Drive-thrus create incremental revenues and profits compared to traditional stores and represent a fast-growing, highly profitable format for Starbucks comprising just over one-third of our U.S. company-operated stores, but contributing nearly 45% of our U.S. retail profit. And we are investing in this high-margin store format with innovations that will further elevate the customer experience, our brand by enhancing drive-thru efficiency and consistency of service.</p>
          <p>Since our acquisition of La Boulange, we've been testing in our San Francisco Bay Area, and we continue to exceed an opportunity to exceed plan and drive incremental food sales and attachment with the 40 Starbucks test stores currently carrying the La Boulange bakery assortment, we're experiencing a lift in both pastry and total food sales. And we are on plan to introduce the La Boulange bakery assortment to the Starbucks stores throughout the Bay Area and in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City in fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>Starbucks China and Asia Pacific segment now spans 12 countries, that by the end of fiscal 2013 will grow to nearly 4,000 stores, including 1,000 stores in Japan and 500 in Korea and China/Asia Pacific continued to deliver in Q1 with a strong 11% increase in comp store sales, marking our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in that region. We started our journey in China with our first store in Beijing in 1999, and in Q1 we celebrated the opening of our 100th store in that extraordinary city. China remains Starbucks most significant market opportunity in the region and is well on its way to becoming our second largest global market in 2014. Today we are proud to operate over 700 stores in Mainland China, and we are on plan to have 1,500 Starbucks stores in over 70 cities across China in 2015. In India, we continue to be awed by the overwhelming customer response to our first four stores in Mumbai, and are eagerly anticipating the opening of our first store in Delhi next month. And in early February, we will open our first Vietnam store in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
          <p>I was in the region last week and saw firsthand the execution against the turnaround of our EMEA segment, and it's well underway. We are driving increased customer and brand relevancy and at the same time we are updating our growth model for this segment, and we're beginning to see tangible benefits of these initiatives. In fact, despite the worst economic retail climate in decades, and one that has been disproportionately impacting high-end retailers, I'm proud to share with you that Starbucks retail transactions in the EMEA region increased in Q1 compared to Q1 of fiscal 2012. Building connections and providing our customers with a meaningful value proposition also continue to be among our top priorities across this region. Towards those ends, in Q1, we successfully launched the Starbucks Card and the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in Germany and introduced promotions including our holiday beverage lineup and 12 days of gifting throughout the region, all of which were well received and contributed to our success in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Licensing will be the centerpiece of our approach to growth and long-term profitability in EMEA, and in Q1 we continued to see the strategy play out successfully. At quarter's end, we had over 1,000 licensed stores in the region, up 12% from a year ago, and we are seeing fantastic customer response and increasing customer demand and acceptance as we extend our retail footprint beyond the high street.</p>
          <p>Starbucks business outside of the U.K. and Continental Europe, where we currently operate nearly 500 stores, continued to thrive in Q1 with strong comp growth in key markets including the Middle East, Turkey and Russia, with our long-term 15-year partner, Alshaya. We opened a stunning new 4,500 square-foot flagship store in the Kuwait Avenues Mall that celebrates local design culture and offers a truly unique premium coffee experience and the region's first Clover and Starbucks Reserve coffee selections.</p>
          <p>In Russia, we entered Saint Petersburg, our first city outside of Moscow, and the stores are performing ahead of plan, demonstrating once again the strength, the relevancy and unique appeal of the Starbucks brand across the region. We remain committed to creating a long-term sustainable and profitable business across EMEA and our solid performance in Q1 gives us confidence that we are very much on track to fulfilling that commitment.</p>
          <p>Our Channel Development and Emerging Brands team is bringing significant innovation to the coffee, tea and health and wellness categories. Jeff will be joining us later in the call to discuss several exciting developments in this segment in detail so I'll just touch on a few highlights. In September, as you well know, we launched the revolutionary Verismo System by Starbucks online, and in October we extended distribution to include nearly 2,000 specialty retailers and over 4,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. We intentionally limited distribution to a select subset of specialty retailers to establish the brand at the high-end in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will drive adoption through a combination of pod and machine innovation and selective retail expansion throughout 2013. To-date, well over 1 million customers have had the opportunity to sample a high-quality Starbucks latte or brewed coffee made with the Verismo machine at one of our many product demonstrations at either a specialty retailer or a Starbucks store. With more than 150,000 Verismo machines sold since launch, Verismo is off to an exceptional start as we build, enhance and expand what we are confident will be a multi-billion dollar premium single-serve platform in the months and years ahead.</p>
          <p>At the same time, single-serve and VIA sales in Q1 were fueled by a number of popular new introductions, including Starbucks Peppermint Mocha VIA, Pumpkin Spice VIA and VIA Refreshers, as well as Anniversary Blend K-Cups and Christmas Blend K-Cups. Jeff will speak more about momentum and opportunities in our single-serve business in a moment.</p>
          <p>On December 31, we closed our highly strategic acquisition of premium tea brand Teavana, making Teavana a wholly-owned subsidiary of Starbucks and the newest addition to our emerging brands portfolio. Together with our new partner at Teavana, Starbucks will apply and leverage our deep knowledge of retail operations, beverage development and preparation and our social and digital media loyalty card and mobile expertise to attract more customers to Teavana stores. And we will expand Teavana's current 300-store footprint from largely mall-based stores to urban street locations where Starbucks obviously has very strong capabilities and ultimately, we will reinvent the tea category just as we did the coffee category 40 years ago.</p>
          <p>Teavana is a perfect complement to Starbucks current $1 billion-plus Tazo brand and will enable us to further extend our leadership position in the $40 billion global tea market. Earlier this quarter, we opened our first Tazo retail store in Seattle to serve as a learning laboratory and help us understand everything from what types of handcrafted tea beverages customers want to see from us to help us to create a meaningful and differentiated retail tea experience for customers. Our plans are to apply all of these learnings to our Teavana rollout in terms of the success and enduring opportunities we have for that company.</p>
          <p>In the health and wellness space, Evolution Fresh is leading innovation and development of the cold-crafted juice category. Since our acquisition of Evolution Fresh, we've redesigned the packaging, strengthened the brand positioning and created four retail conceptual stores. And today we're seeing growth in our Evolution Fresh business across the board.</p>
          <p>Coffee will always be at the very core of Starbucks' business and our commitment to innovating and growing our share of the global coffee market is unwavering. Starbucks Blonde Roast is an example of this commitment. In response to customer demand for a super-premium coffee with a lighter note, we introduced Blonde Roast one year ago and today Blonde is driving growth across all channels and Starbucks has emerged as a leader in the $1 billion light coffee segment. Sales of packaged Blonde Roast were 70% incremental at Starbucks retail stores and 79% incremental in grocery channels in the last year. And we are continuing to find new ways to reach customers who prefer a lighter roast with Vanilla Blonde, our first handcrafted brewed coffee offering in our retail stores as we speak today.</p>
          <p>In response to strong customer demand, we are also continuing to expand availability of our rare and exotic Starbucks Reserve coffees and are on track to increase the number of stores offering Starbucks Reserve by approximately 200 in fiscal 2013. Our customers love our Reserve Starbucks offerings as demonstrated by the fact that a very rare Costa Rica Geisha Reserve coffee offered online in early December at $40 per half pound sold completely out in 24 hours. We look forward to adding more rare and exotic coffees to our unique Starbucks Reserve lineup for our customers to savor in the months ahead as we reaffirm day in and day out our leadership position in all things coffee.</p>
          <p>Another very significant Q1 highlight was the continued growth and success of our digital business and mobile initiatives. Starbucks' digital strategy is and will remain a key driver of our increasingly global business as we leverage all of our proprietary capabilities and connect with more customers all around the world in the future. Our Starbucks Card is more popular than ever today, accounting for 25% of U.S. tender and an increasing portion of Starbucks Card transactions themselves are being paid for using our mobile payment apps, with mobile payment now accounting for nearly 20% of overall card transactions. Over 7 million customers now use one of our mobile payment apps, translating into 2.1 million mobile payment transactions each week, with hundreds of thousands of additional Starbucks mobile app downloads each week.</p>
          <p>In terms of what happened in holiday in Starbucks Card, I must say it was stunning and almost unbelievable. Our Starbucks Card had its best holiday season in history as measured by any metric with more than $1 billion loaded during Q1, the most ever loaded onto any kind of Starbucks Card. Mobile eGifting also delivered record holiday results with the most popular days for eGifting being Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, with performance enhanced by the integration of our mobile strategies and our unique ability to send messages directly to our customers' mobile inboxes.</p>
          <p>And our e-commerce sales also broke holiday records as revenues doubled and we offered online sales in Canada, the U.K., Germany, and France for the first time. We're very excited about the strong customer response and tremendous future opportunities presented by the integration of our mobile, web, card, and loyalty program strategies. The combination of these capabilities enabled us to accelerate growth in our My Starbucks Rewards program, and this is another unique fact in which we added 1.4 million members in Q1 of 2013, an 86% increase over the 778,000 new members we added in Q1 of last year. I'm very pleased that our My Starbucks Rewards program was recently named the Mobile Program of the Year by Mobile Marketer, an award that reflects Starbucks' focus on innovation and driving customer engagement.</p>
          <p>As our Q1 results demonstrate the momentum we've built throughout 2012 carried through holiday and into Q1 in 2013, but we're just getting started and only beginning to see the benefits of the convergence of our retail CPG and social and digital media initiatives. Think about this. We had an 86% more customers signup for My Starbucks Rewards card in the first quarter of 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012, and it's not that these new card customers didn't know where to find us last year, it's that we are more deeply connected and even more relevant to them than any other time in our history. And we can very accurately anticipate the increased traffic and revenue that will flow from the accelerating card acceptance and activity, which we've already seen in calendar Q1.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to attaining leadership in the single-serve category, and I can tell you today that with Verismo we are in the nascent stage of building a multi-billion dollar platform for Starbucks over the long-term. And we are in it for the long-term. We will achieve our goals around single-serve by leveraging the full power of the Starbucks brand and our unique partner, digital and global store footprint assets in continuing to expand our distribution channels. But more importantly, we will continue to innovate and to transform the premium single-serve category while continuing to surprise and delight our customers along the way. Look for some very exciting innovations to come this very year.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, who will take you through the Q1 results of our Channel Development segment and share additional detail around what's to come in this dynamic growth area for our company. Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to join you on the call today to discuss Q1 results for Channel Development and Emerging Brands, as well as give you some additional insight into what is coming in the quarters and years ahead. Channel Development revenue in our first fiscal quarter grew 13% to $380 million. It was the highest revenue quarter we've ever had, led by continued growth of K-Cup, the first stages of launching our Verismo platform, and continued growth in roast and ground coffee. Our top to bottom line translation was also very good in Q1. We grew profit twice as fast as sales in the quarter, even after a significant investment in Verismo. Operating margin expanded by 230 basis points in Q1, up to 25.5%. Favorable coffee-related costs along with continued strength in our North American coffee partnership helped to fuel the growth.</p>
          <p>Our partnership with Pepsi is thriving, and we plan to grow Starbucks' share of the massive ready-to-drink category with the expansion of Starbucks Refreshers beverages, the introduction of our new line of Starbucks Iced Coffee in a new iconic single-serve glass bottle, which is rolling out as we speak in select U.S. markets. We will have national presence by April, just in time for the warmer months, but know that nearly 50% of iced coffee drinkers actually enjoy iced coffee year-round. We will now be very well positioned to serve the rapidly expanding demand for iced coffee in the U.S. In fact, now, one in five beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores is a cold coffee beverage.</p>
          <p>Turning our attention to other coffee formats, I want to discuss the premium single-cup category and the recent milestones achieved across our product lines. VIA Ready Brew continues its solid performance, growing 16% in the food, drug, mass space in the quarter. VIA Refreshers has been available and very popular in our retail stores over the past six months and we're excited to make them available in CPG beginning this quarter. K-Cups were the largest contributor to Channel Development revenue in Q1 as we sold more than 175 million cups across the company in the quarter. And then there is Verismo, which saw strong retail support and customer interest with more than 150,000 machines sold across all channels since launch.</p>
          <p>Q1 marked the beginning of what we expect will be a significant and sustained expansion of Verismo in the quarters and years to come. We will expand distribution, adding both new doors and new countries to the platform. We will add new products, including many Starbucks favorite beverages across coffee, tea and more to the platform. And we will add new machines with additional functionality and style elements that will help us to drive adoption of the platform.</p>
          <p>Rolling all of this up, in the U.S. food, drug and mass channels in the past 13 weeks, we have grown our total premium coffee business by 28% versus prior year. That's 11% faster than total U.S. premium coffee category and nearly four times faster than the entire U.S. coffee category. As a result, we have grown our share of the total U.S. coffee category to 12.6%, 220 basis points higher than a year ago. And encouragingly, as our internal analytics and these numbers suggest, we are seeing little cannibalization of our roast and ground coffee from our success in premium single cup.</p>
          <p>The expansion of Starbucks Blonde Roast now in its second year will be one of the growth drivers of packaged coffee going forward. This growth will be supported by marketing in our retail stores, through our social and digital channels and through our biggest ever multi-channel marketing and demonstration campaign in CPG starting this month. It is truly our blueprint for growth in action and will introduce millions of potential new Starbucks customers to Blonde Roast. Beyond Blonde Roast, we will introduce new varieties of K-Cups later this year, and as mentioned earlier, new varieties of Verismo pods as well.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to talk about the new organization that we have just finished building, Branded Solutions. This organization combines the capabilities of foodservice with our expertise in licensed stores, allowing us for the first time to create a single, one voice solution to reach our customers across a number of channels from hotels to offices to colleges to hospitals. Now each development manager can present an account or prospective account with a full portfolio of offerings, including Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Tazo and Evolution Fresh and provide a complete solution from a foodservice and licensed store perspective, all supported by one relationship management, all supported by a high-quality Starbucks experience for the customer. It is a breakthrough that will come to life in 2013.</p>
          <p>The next significant growth engine in the emerging brand portfolio is tea, which is fueled by both Tazo and Teavana. The Teavana acquisition closed on December 31st and we are embarking on the next chapter of the journey that we believe will reinvent the way the world enjoys tea, just as Starbucks did decades ago for coffee. By the end of the year, we expect to add over 30 new Teavana stores including the opening of our first neighborhood store, which will combine both an expanded handcrafted tea experience with merchandise and loose tea. Down the road, we intend to offer an enhanced range of handcrafted beverages into our mall-based stores as well.</p>
          <p>In the near-term, our priorities are integrating the company and employees, now our partners, sharing and learning about each company's respective culture and importantly, maintaining our focus on delivering our plan for the balance of the year. While it has been less than four weeks since the acquisition closed, our integration work makes us excited as ever about the opportunity and we'll share more details as we move along.</p>
          <p>Tazo continues to perform in the super-premium packaged tea space, growing by over 30% across all forms in the quarter. The brand continues to be the share leader in the super-premium filter bags space, with a 28.6% share in the most recent 13 weeks ended December 30th, up 160 basis points from prior year.</p>
          <p>Now from tea to juice, where Evolution Fresh is leading the development of the $3.4 billion premium cold-crafted juice category. We continue to build the brand through new distribution and are now in nearly 4,000 Starbucks in natural and grocery stores in the Western U.S. We are on track to open our new state-of-the-art juicery in late spring, which will further allow us to grow our plan to be in approximately 8,000 stores by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In closing, 2013 is off to a strong start with much more on the horizon. We plan to continue demonstrating strong revenue growth while expanding margin. We will do it through innovation, both around new platforms and new SKUs, and we'll do it through growth of a best-in-class portfolio of existing products. We will leverage unmatched cross-channel marketing and promotional capabilities and we will rely on the expertise and passionate commitment of the more than 500 channel development partners around the world who continually exceed expectations.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jeff. As Howard indicated in his opening remarks, this holiday season was Starbucks' best ever and the proficiency with which our store partners delivered daily world-class experiences again drove record results in the Americas. First quarter Americas' revenues totaled $2.8 billion, growing 10% over last year. The largest driver of our revenue growth continues to be strong comparable store sales, which reached 7% in Q1 with a 4% lift in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. In the U.S., comps mirrored those of the Americas region. Our U.S. productivity continues to climb as we saw more transactions per labor hour this quarter than in any other quarter in our company's history. That allowed us to <mark type="ph" /> led (30:37) daily transactions per store to over 700 for the first time as we continue to expand capacity and grow transactions across all day parts.</p>
          <p>Also fueling our strong comp growth were our fall promotional beverages, headlined by Pumpkin Spice Latte, combined with our always popular holiday beverage offerings. Combined, these added more than a percentage point of comp growth. A significant increase in food sales and a favorable shift in food mix as breakfast sandwiches and our improved lunch offerings continue to resonate with our customers also added more than 1 percentage point of comp. Verismo contributed approximately a half point of comp in Q1, leveraging the successful demonstration of sampling efforts of our store partners.</p>
          <p>The first quarter in the U.S. started strong and ended strong with comp growth in December mirroring the full quarter result. As we exited the first quarter, the momentum in the business combined with the record volume of Starbucks Cards loaded during the holiday period is fueling early Q2 sales trends. Comp growth in the first few weeks of January is trending consistent with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating income in the Americas segment reached a record $590 million in the first quarter, while operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 20.8%. There were a few anomalies that led to the margin contraction, including our October global leadership conference, which impacted margins by 90 basis points, increased litigation charges, which had a 70 basis point impact, and 30 basis points due to impact of Superstorm Sandy. The phenomenal execution by the partners across the region largely offset these unusual cost pressures in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now in China and Asia Pacific, the combination of solid performance from our existing store base and rapid new store development led to record revenue and profit. Revenue growth was 28%, an increase over last quarter's 23% growth. A portion of this was due to comparable store sales, which grew 11%, with 8% growth in transaction and a 3% increase in average ticket. Two-year comps remained above 30%, an exceptional accomplishment considering the uncertainty that has entered parts of the region over the past year. We saw very successful holiday promotions in many of our CAP markets, with seasonal beverages driving sales growth over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Starbucks Card was an extremely popular item in CAP in Q1, which bodes well for the future. Howard spoke in his comments about the success of the Starbucks Card and our loyalty program globally and in CAP these are meaningful drivers of our strong comps. In fact, 29% of transactions in Thailand and 27% of transactions in Singapore are paid for with the Starbucks Card, levels that exceed those in the U.S. where the Starbucks Card has been available for much longer.</p>
          <p>And as our loyalty program expands globally, it is apparent that its relevancy is universal. In China, for instance, we already have 1.3 million My Starbucks Rewards members. Loyalty to the Starbucks brand continues to grow in this part of the world, directly contributing to our rapid top line growth. The largest contributor to our CAP Q1 revenue growth was the addition of 125 net new stores in the quarter and 452 net new stores over the past year. Half of these new stores are in China where we continue to aggressively pursue high-quality profitable real estate.</p>
          <p>As I discussed last quarter, this growth does have a temporary detrimental impact to operating margin and combined with the mix shift toward a more company-operated store portfolio, accounted for more than the 60 basis point Q1 decline in CAP margin.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting this was lower performance-based compensation. While performance is still very strong in the region, we are lapping the first quarter of 2012 when the CAP region performed significantly better than the operating plan for that period. Profitability remains robust and continues to accelerate quickly in the region as a $72 million of CAP operating come in the first quarter was a record and represented 26% growth over last Q1.</p>
          <p>In the EMEA, revenue, operating income and operating margin all expanded in the first quarter, as the team coupled solid traffic growth with continued focus on cost discipline. Record revenues of $306 million represented growth of 1% over last Q1, driven by 41% growth in licensed store revenue and 27% growth in our foodservice business. As Howard stated, we continue to see strong sales growth in many of our licensed markets as our partnerships continue to thrive and provide a meaningful contribution to our success. The strong growth in licensed and food service was largely offset by a decline in company-operated revenue of 4%. That reduction was due to the loss of revenue resulting from the sale of the Ireland store portfolio and U.K. airport stores to a licensed partner and closures of unprofitable stores as part of our Q4 store portfolio optimization. A decline in comparable store sales of 1% driven by a 3% reduction in average ticket also contributed.</p>
          <p>The lower average ticket was driven by beverage mix shifts and reductions in add-on purchases such as food, suggesting a trade-down impact of consumer spending driven by the economic challenges in the region. Encouragingly, traffic grew by 2% in the quarter, the highest rate of traffic growth EMEA has delivered in a year as we are seeing traction on our efforts to demonstrate that Starbucks serves the best latte on the high street.</p>
          <p>In our largest market, the U.K., we offered Pumpkin Spice Latte for the first time with tremendous success. Holiday beverages had a record year across the region and the launch of the Starbucks Card and in this past year My Starbucks Rewards in the U.K., Germany and other markets in the region, as well as targeted value offers, played a key role in maintaining the loyalty of our core customers. EMEA operating income of $22 million grew by 18% over last Q1. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 7.3%, the second highest quarterly operating margin ever for EMEA as a result of continued deep focus on cost efficiencies, which drove strong leverage on our licensed stores revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The strong first quarter results in each of our operating segments contributed toward a record-setting performance on a consolidated basis. Revenue growth of 11% led to a record total net revenues of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. The growth was driven by a 6% increase in global comparable store sales, including an increase in transactions of 4% and an increase in average ticket of 2%. This was a truly outstanding holiday season around the globe. Consolidated operating income grew 13% to a record $631 million in the first quarter. As I mentioned during the Americas discussion, there were a few unusual items impacting the quarter's results, which had an unfavorable 140 basis point impact on consolidated operating margin.</p>
          <p>However, strong sales leverage and to a lesser extent the expected 50 basis point impact of favorable commodity costs more than offset the unusual cost pressures, driving consolidated operating margin higher by 40 basis points to 16.6%. We also set a record for earnings per share in the first quarter growing 14% to $0.57.</p>
          <p>Earnings include two additional unusual items of note. We reported a lower than usual tax rate in Q1 of 30.4%. As we expected and was factored into our tax rate guidance for fiscal 2013, we recognized an $18 million benefit primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Conversely, this quarter we reported a $26 million reduction over last Q1 in interest income and other, which includes mark-to-market adjustments relating to commodity hedges, unfavorable foreign currency and decreased unrealized gains in the trading securities portfolio of our management deferred compensation plan. The impact of movement in the trading securities portfolio is offset in general and administrative expenses as the compensation plan liability fluctuates with investment performance.</p>
          <p>Also of note, Starbucks repurchased 8 million shares of stock during the first quarter. This leaves approximately 29 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases along with the $0.21 per share dividend resulted in more than $0.5 billion returned to shareholders in the first quarter, which is more than the first three quarters of last year's combined.</p>
          <p>It was a fantastic first quarter by nearly every measure. We exited the quarter with everything squarely on track, which is why we are reaffirming our financial target for fiscal 2013, which I announced on our Q4 FY 2012 earnings call in early November. These include strong EPS growth of 15% to 20%, revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13%, global comparable store sales growth in the mid-single-digits, consolidated operating margin expansion targeted at approximately 100 basis points, 1,300 net new stores globally, capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2 billion and the tax rate of 33%.</p>
          <p>One item not factored into our targets but worthy of mention is the pending Kraft arbitration ruling. While there has been no ruling or resolution yet and no change for expectations, we do anticipate resolution later in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This was the best holiday season and first quarter in the history of Starbucks, setting the stage for another strong year. The record results of the first quarter once again demonstrate our ability to drive growth in revenue and earnings in the current quarter while planting the seeds for growth into the future. Our store partners are delivering great coffee and great experiences to our customers every day and doing it with higher levels of productivity than ever before. We have a deep pipeline of innovative products, diverse channels and geographies for growth and strong execution and financial discipline. We entered the second quarter with great momentum and are well positioned to deliver our growth targets for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Great. Thank you very much. First, if we could review what your remodel strategy is for fiscal 2013, how significant that could be and what you've been seeing in a control sample in terms of what the performance of those stores are versus the stores that you haven't done is the first question. And then secondly, I think its short, when might you have an opportunity to put Evolution products or Teavana products as part of the handcrafted beverage line within Starbucks? I think that, that might be a very big opportunity for innovation around your product line, if you could discuss when that could possibly be? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, John, and thanks for the question. With regards to refurbishments this year and I'll talk specifically to the largest market of the U.S. We'll do the same number of refurbishments plus or minus as we did last year as I shared in December when we met in New York. Where we have done major refurbishments, we have seen significant improvements in the capacity we built in that store, and the additional opportunities to introduce Clover for example, have all seen significant blips. And our strategy around minor refurbishments carries on as it always has been and that's about sort of putting the store back in a good state, so really no changes there. And if I hand it to Jeff around developments of handcrafted beverages...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll be about 1,400 stores that we will cover this year and that will be a mixture, 60/40 of major &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; minor to major, that sort of magnitude. About 500 major refurbishments this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So in terms of Evolution Fresh and Teavana entering Starbucks stores, as we've talked before, this is a critical element to our blueprint for growth strategy. And so, from an Evolution Fresh standpoint, John, we have already started moving the Evolution Fresh brand into Starbucks stores and in fact now we're in over 2,400 Starbucks stores primarily in the western U.S. and as our new juicery comes online, that will give us additional capacity to begin to move east in this year so we'll continue to expand Evolution into Starbucks stores and also into the natural and premium grocery segment as that brand continues to expand. We've had great results so far.</p>
          <p>With regard to Teavana, we're less than four weeks into the integration but we have said all along that Teavana beverages will play a role in Starbucks stores. We'll come back with more details in the coming quarter as we develop that plan but Teavana will play in Starbucks over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question if I'm still on was really not just on ready-to-drink but also the handcrafted beverages potentially that you could do with those sub-brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, John &#x2013; it's Cliff again &#x2013; yes, the potential is there. Our priority is to rollout the Evolution bottled juices across the U.S. and let Jeff do his work on the integration of Teavana, more to follow on that, nothing to share at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the one last thing I'd add, John, is the key theme here is that these acquisitions in both product platforms absolutely offer us opportunity in ready-to-drink across multiple channels and handcrafted, and it's something that in the right sequence of brand development and integration and rollout of these products, you will see us pursue those opportunities and it's part of what gives us confidence in our ability over multiple quarters and multiple years to continue to drive strong same-store sales growth through our system.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Congratulations, guys. First question. Just two quick questions. First question on China, it seems like your same-store sales is remarkably stable. How would you characterize the consumer environment there? And secondly, with regard to the Starbucks Card loads, Howard mentioned a statistic there. I didn't quite catch that. How much have the loads &#x2013; how much did the dollar loads grow year-over-year in that quarter? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. David, thank you for the question. First off, we're extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our business in China both in terms of the performance of the existing stores as well as the new store growth that we're seeing and as I said, more and more of our growth is coming from the new store base, and less so from comp sales. Our comp sales have remained strong, and when you look at it on a two-year basis, comps are in the mid-30s, and on a three year basis comp sales are up into the 60s. So we feel very good about what's happening with the consumer as it relates to the Starbucks brand.</p>
          <p>There's no doubt that you've seen some shift with other businesses and other companies in China, but for us, our traffic in our stores remains very strong, our transaction growth continues to grow. The card, in terms of the adaptation of the Starbucks Card, we're now at 1.4 million customers and that continues to accelerate and that's just over a year old. And we're continue to be very encouraged about the innovation that we're bringing into our stores, the way that the customers are reacting to that and how they're embracing the Starbucks experience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Dave, to your question about the Starbucks Card, there was a 25% increase in Starbucks Card value loaded in the first quarter over the prior year. What's critical of that is that clearly, it's a very strong level by itself, significantly outpaces the growth in the overall business and is exactly a harbinger for that future growth as those values loaded not only introduce new customers on to the platform but create that, deep in the loyalty and create that frequency opportunity as we move through the balance of this year and into the future.</p>

          <p>David, this is Howard. I would just add that I believe that we are in the nascent stage of being able to leverage and integrate social, digital, mobile, our investment with Square and the loyalty program into a very significant and robust opportunity going forward. And the question I was asked about Teavana in terms of products, at some point, there's a natural opportunity as part of the integration to take those assets, drive incremental traffic into Teavana, benefiting from the ubiquity of Starbucks and the trust and loyalty in that program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I had a follow up question on China. It looks like the rate of investment in the stores continues to accelerate beyond the revenue growth in the company-owned units. I was just wondering kind of what are you doing in the stores that's obviously facilitating great same-store sales? But if you can give us some sort of insight into the investment you're putting in those four walls as that store operating expense continues to ramp.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Sharon, I think it's important that the investments that we're making are going to set the foundation for the future in terms of the success of the stores and of the market overall. So when you look at the investments we're making, it's obviously in the stores themselves, but more so from a people standpoint, in terms of ramping up the people capability that we're going to need to staff the new stores. And so with that, we're bringing on people, we're bringing them into existing stores, and we're training them to take over and run the new stores that we're opening.</p>
          <p>In addition, the investments that you're also seeing in the stores have to do with the investments we're making around the design and how they are adapting into the local architecture, and making sure that we're differentiating ourselves in the marketplace in terms of the third-place environment that we're creating for our customers. So when you look at this, we are making the investments that we need to sustain the growth for the long term. I think what we're seeing is that the investments that we're making in our people is paying off in terms of the experience that we're able to provide our customers, the speed that we're able to put them through the stores, and just the connection that we're able to build with them. And then the investment that we're making from a physical store perspective is creating that third-place environment that our customers want to come to, be a part of, and to experience overall.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you comment on coffee costs year-over-year, just what that cost looks like year-over-year this quarter, and what it might look like in coming quarters? And also, could you fill out a little more on the 13% growth in the Channel Development category, foodservice obviously less, CPG more, and just talk about the components of that growth and whether the lower coffee costs play a role in maybe restraining that revenue growth a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Joe. I'll speak to coffee costs, and then I'll hand it to Jeff to talk about Channel Development growth. First, with respect to coffee, as we expected, we had approximately a net $0.02-per-share benefit from commodities this quarter that includes favorability in coffee, and then moderate unfavorability in dairy and a couple other smaller commodities in our portfolio. So that $0.02 a share, again, that's as expected. That is 50 basis points to the total operating margin improvement in this first quarter, and I expect about that same $0.02-per-share benefit from net commodities each quarter over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>And again, that's all consistent with our previous targets. As we have discussed in the last few months, that amounts to about a net $100 million benefit to this fiscal year. And given what we have locked in terms of pricing in fiscal 2014, and also what we see in the coffee markets right now, we expect a similar level of $100 million benefit as we approach fiscal 2014, so at least a couple years of commodity tailwinds ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Jeff, can you speak to Channel Development growth?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Joe. With regard to Channel Development, as you noted, we grew at 13% in the first quarter. We continue to see positive growth ahead of retail average in Channel Development. Our packaged coffee business overall, when you look at premium single cup as well as roast and ground, we're seeing significant growth in the quarter from an IRI standpoint. From a foodservice standpoint, less so. We're still growing faster than the foodservice segment, which is a material piece of our business, but that segment continues to grow more slowly than the balance of the category.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Troy, I have a question on the guidance for 2013 with respect to the margins. Up 100 basis points relative to what you reported in Q1 which was up 40 basis points, but you had quite a bit of unusual cost items in there. So, I guess, why wouldn't the 100 basis points be on the conservative side as you look at not having some of those unusual cost items in the coming quarters? Or are there some potential offsets that maybe I'm not thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, I appreciate your confidence in our ability to drive profits as we go forward. I would say that 40 basis points of improvement in the first quarter and yes that was net of some unusual pressures in this quarter. We believe that the guidance we have, which &#x2013; that 100 basis point improvement for the full-year corresponds to the 15% to 20% earnings growth that we targeted and that I believe we're right on track for.</p>
          <p>So think with the investments we're making to drive the business, continued investments across our new growth platforms of La Boulange, of Verismo, of Evolution Fresh, while we are delivering quarterly earnings just as we did in Q1, we continue to lay that foundation for growth next year and the year after. And it's been that equation that has worked so well for us and that we intend to navigate as we go through the rest of the year. So I think the guidance we have is remarkable in this environment and feel very confident in our ability to deliver against it as we approach Q2 and onward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Troy, could you possibly remind us about the planned marketing spend maybe as a percent of sales for the year? How that compares year-over-year and then maybe the quarterly cadence? Was 1Q with the Verismo launch above the annual spend and 2Q with Blonde? Is that above 1Q and above the full-year? Any details on that would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Keith. The marketing spend in this first quarter was a little higher than 4% of sales, which for Starbucks in our history is extremely high and perhaps among the highest we've ever recorded in any one particular quarter. And as we talked about, I think, dating all the way back to July when we first announced our initial guidance, that's really primarily driven in this quarter by the launch of the Verismo platform and our investment against that knowing that that's a multi-year platform and proposition for us and we wanted to set it off on its right foot.</p>
          <p>As we progress through the balance of the year, I don't expect marketing spend as a percentage in any quarter to be at that same level as higher than 4%. So I expect it'll be in the 3.5% to 4% range as we progress into the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, fairly consistent throughout the year as we approach introducing the customer and providing those messages to the first Blonde and then other product platforms as we go throughout the year.</p>

Is Channel Development the 13% growth we're seeing this quarter, is that representative roughly of the growth we should expect throughout the balance of the year? Or is there something you think materially changes that trajectory? I just wanted to clarify that from a previous question. And is the first &#x2013; in EMEA, you talked about the average check declining. What reverses that? I think you explain it has something to do with trade-down. Maybe &#x2013; is this the first quarter you've actually seen declines in average check there or has that been going on subtly and it's just more exaggerated this quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. I would say first off that we were really, really pleased and proud with our results of the quarter, seeing the kind of both revenue growth especially in our licensed channel, which is our key focus and strategy going forward. Importantly, the margin expansion that Troy spoke to despite the significant headwinds that continue to face the European customer. And then further, actually seeing transaction/customer count growth of 2% for the quarter and seeing that across our markets.</p>
          <p>So, again, given the headwinds, we're very, very pleased with that result. We did see a deeper erosion ticket than we have been experiencing, so your question is relevant. And we saw it especially with everything happening on the retail high street, the downturn there, particular acute pressure with consumers in our European markets. We're not, by the way, seeing that same pressure play out outside of Europe, but really is focused on the U.K. and Europe.</p>
          <p>And we have continued focus both in keeping our customers coming through loyalty programs, through relevant value, and then also working on increasing our food attach through food innovation programs, and of course that beverage trade-down focusing on customers on our great assortment of beverages. We saw a great response, as Troy mentioned, on Pumpkin Spice. Right now we're experiencing great customer demand on our innovation, Vanilla Spice. And those initiatives will help us prop up our ticket. So it a focus, but job number one is to keep our loyal customers and keep that customer count growing. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, John. With regard to Channel Development growth of 13% in Q1, while we don't offer a specific guidance on individual businesses, we expect the Channel Development will continue to grow at a rate faster than our average retail growth. Importantly, we have a number of initiatives that we're working against and building, everything from Evolution Fresh to our continued expansion of K-Cups to new flavors and SKUs in the VIA lineup and importantly we will continue to invest and grow and build over time the business that's in its very nascent stage that is Verismo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. The first one just on the Verismo, I guess as a follow up, and you talk about the launch in the holidays going well, I think you said 150,000. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that tracked versus your expectation? Obviously it was a heavy investment quarter for it, but do you think there's obviously some time for this to build with the replacement cycle around Keurig? I'm just wondering kind of the early feedback on Verismo and your outlook for growth over the next number of quarters?</p>
          <p>And then separately, Troy, if you could just comment, I think the share repurchase, I think you mentioned it was 8 million shares which would be roughly $400 million for the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could frame that in terms of your thoughts on cash usage for fiscal 2013 whether it be between repo and maintaining the dividend versus CapEx? And whether we should assume that first quarter share repurchase was an anomaly? Or that type of run rate would be sustained? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, why don't &#x2013; can I just start with an overall strategy about single-serve and Verismo and, Jeff, you can take it from there if that's okay with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very important that you all understand that we are deeply, deeply committed to becoming the leader in this space domestically and internationally. We have plotted out a multi-year strategy about Verismo and an overall single-serve platform that will include multiple layers of innovation in the years to come. We feel very strongly that what Verismo demonstrated this holiday season was a great success for us. It met our expectations. We learned a great deal. We also saw a fair amount of discounting from our competitors in the market as a result of our entry and the fact that we disrupted the market in the middle of the holiday season. The leverage and the asset that we have in our stores to both demonstrate, inform and ultimately sell single-serve platform machines, is an asset that is proprietary and nobody has and we will continue to utilize that to our advantage.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I think is worth saying is that we already are seeing customers come back with the opportunity to merchandise and sell them pods as a result of Verismo being in 150,000 households. So we're already seeing an opportunity for incrementality there and we'll be adding more SKUs that are proprietary to Starbucks coffee. And so our commitment, our interest, our motivation to build on single-serve and build on Verismo is 100% and we're going to maintain a high level of commitment and investment in this where we are going to be the global leader. Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Howard. Exactly. In that &#x2013; first, our sales during our very first holiday with a brand new to the world platform were well in line with our expectations, and importantly, we started with a very curated small set of stores, so a select set of specialty retailers and a select set of Starbucks retail stores. And for us, we are not only encouraged by the customer response but also the trade traction that has been created by a number of retailers who want to play on the platform which we have not made available to them as yet. So there are really three things that are going to be growth drivers for Verismo as we step forward.</p>
          <p>First and importantly, it's the innovation itself, it's the first and only machine that does brewed coffee, espresso and lattes and that message got through to customers during the holiday. And as we &#x2013; and secondly, as we add innovation to the system, whether it's through additional coffees, additional espressos, additional Starbucks latte and Seasonal Favorite beverages, as well as tea, that will add to increase the interest in the platform. And then finally from a machine standpoint, we have a pipeline, to Howard's point, multiple years of machine innovation that adds new feature, new styles, new functionality, to a whole series of machines that we will be introducing. So again, and importantly, this is just the very first step in what will be a multi-year growth driver, significant growth driver, in the channel business and for Starbucks overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your question, Jeffrey, about the share repurchase, we're fortunate that this very strong cash flow of our business enables us to have the dividends, and we've accelerated that dividend as you know each year since we've initiated it and also share repurchases. We repurchased 8 million shares in the quarter. Our repurchase program is very valuation and conservatively valuation-based. So our repurchases in any particular quarter are very opportunistic based both on, again, what we see in the market and the valuation. And also, from time to time where and when we as a company might be blacked out of the market and that is frequent given various activities going on. So in any particular quarter, our share repurchase activity will be somewhat lumpy again, just based on those factors.</p>
          <p>I would say our priority spend of cash over the balance of the year and really every year continues to be first and foremost investments back into the business, that's in our partners, in capital expenditures, in new stores, in remodels, of course, funding the dividend over time. And then based on those metrics and principles I outlined, share repurchase. So I don't have a prediction for you of whether that Q1 8 million shares is something that would repeat each quarter or not that again will tend to vary quarter-to-quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a two-part question on the Americas. The first is, just in terms of comps, I know you highlighted a couple of things that were drivers, some of which were new, so Verismo, some of which have been around for a while, so food, and some of your holiday beverages, which are always very popular. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about to what extent the loyalty or the Starbucks Card may have added to comps and if you can measure that. And then the other piece of this was there anything about your mix or about any of the promotions you did that might have affected your margins? I ask only because you had some nice margin expansion on the cost of sales line but maybe not quite as much as I would have expected given 50 basis points of commodities, plus such healthy comps on which you would have seen occupancy leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sara, let me hand it over to Cliff to speak about the comp drivers and I think he'll also be able to speak to cost of goods and leverage a bit. In advance of that I would just make the one comment that the large majority of those unusual expenses that I've spoken about in the quarter, the leadership conference, which we are known about and then a couple of events that we did not know about until we got into the quarter, things like Superstorm Sandy and some of the unusual litigation expenses I mentioned were predominantly focused in the Americas P&amp;L. Absent those anomalies and those unusual cost pressures in the quarter, we would have been on more of our common pace of very significant and meaningful margin expansion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll let Cliff speak more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understand. I just was talking about the cost of sales line in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Okay. Understandable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Sara. The quarter, we really saw a very healthy mix of our core beverages as well as our seasonal beverages, very, very encouraged throughout the quarter how they performed. Our food continues to go from strength to strength and I'm really excited about what lies ahead of us with La Boulange. The holiday season and that is both core coffee with our Christmas Blend. And also our gifts this year performed exceptionally well. If I look at day parts, we have seen growth in all day parts, the early morning growing fastest in terms of percentage. But we continue to add more transactions at our peak time, which again is a really healthy situation to be in.</p>
          <p>And this is a mixture. It's coming from a mixture of not only our product, but we continue to work on the operational effectiveness in stores, and work we've shared with you before around leaning. So building that capacity of peak remains a priority for us. And bringing that all together, I have to say, it's been the focus and dedication from our partners in the stores who, across the whole of the U.S. and the Americas, have done an amazing job in this quarter, dealing with our busiest holiday season ever.</p>
          <p>And the card, I wouldn't out what percentage that's contributing to it, but it is certainly with more people joining the My Starbucks Rewards, by an increasing tender, there is definitely a much richer dialogue coming along. There is a much greater recognition between the customer and our barista. And we're adding, as you know, in this quarter, we're adding to the customer experience through introducing names on aprons, which will be in stores by the end of January, and then phasing in names on cups in the coming months. So all of it focused on the relationship between the customer and our barista, and making it a great personal experience, a Starbucks experience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Sara, back to specific to your question about the cost of goods, the largest impact of commodity favorability, as you know, comes in our Channel Development business. So within the Americas segment, that commodity benefit in the quarter was about 30 basis points or so to OI. Perhaps a little bit higher. And so, just roughly 30 basis points of benefit from commodities. Total cost of goods and occupancy leverage improved by about 50 basis points, so I hope that gives you some context. We actually did see exactly the kind of leverage we would expect both from commodity benefit on that cost of goods line, and then also leverage on fixed costs from growing sales.</p>

          <p>Sure. I think there was talk at the Analyst Day about a channel-agnostic loyalty card. So that it doesn't matter if I get a cup of coffee this morning at a retail store, buy a pound of coffee at the grocery store, is the way I originally understood the intent. That idea incentivizes a loyal, frequent Starbucks user.</p>

Over the next few months or so, we'll be coming back to you and sharing with you the plans that we have to take advantage of Starbucks products within CPG and specifically grocery, and leveraging the technology and the advancement of providing value to our customers that are buying Starbucks products in grocery and leveraging the card. I don't want to get into too much specificity today, only to tell you that we strongly believe that this will provide an incentive for our customers to not only buy Starbucks coffee, but integrate them even further in the Starbucks ecosystem with the card, loyalty and mobile. And are very excited about this and you'll be &#x2013; we will be sharing this with you in the months and quarters ahead. This is something we believe in and something that we are deeply committed to.</p>
